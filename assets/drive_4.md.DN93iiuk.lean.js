Some have Latin or Greek roots deriving from something related to the element, for example some use to which it may have been put. Known elements All 118 discovered elements are confirmed and have a formal name and symbol, as decided by IUPAC. The last four names and symbols were added on November 28, 2016. Incidentally, at this moment there are no unconfirmed discoveries and all seven periods (rows) of the periodic table are completed. Etymology Element names can refer to: * a mythological concept or character (including an astronomical object), * a mineral or similar substance, * a place, or geographical region, * a property of the element, or * a scientist. =People= Chemical elements are sometimes named after people, especially the synthetic elements discovered (created) after ca. 1940. However, very few are named after their discoverers, and even fewer are named after living people. The element seaborgium is named after Glenn Seaborg, who was alive at the time;Kean, 129 and oganesson is named after Yuri Oganessian (still living ). Many of the transuranic elements are named after recipients of the Nobel Prize, including: Transuranic elements named in honour of scientists who did not receive the prize include:Gray, 230-231Kean, 273 The transuranic element americium is indirectly named (via the continents The Americashttps://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-04-24-america- turns-500_N.htm) after Amerigo Vespucci The transuranic element flerovium was named for the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions, which in turn was named for Georgy Flyorov; the IUPAC specified that the element was named after the Laboratory, not Flyorov. However, Yuri Oganessian, who led the team at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions that discovered this element, said that the intention of the naming was to honour Flyorov. The element samarium is named after Vasili Samarsky-Bykhovets,Emsley, 464 and gadolinium is indirectly named (via the mineral gadolinite) after Johan Gadolin.Gray, 220-229Emsley, 188 Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who named the element gallium after his native land of France (from Latin Gallia meaning Gaul) denied that the element's naming was for a pun on his own name (\\"le coq\\" means \\"the rooster\\" in French, as does \\"gallus\\" in Latin).Kean, 55 =Places on earth= Some chemical elements are named after places on the planet earth. Five are named after currently existing countries: * Polonium, named after Poland.Emsley, 412 * Francium and gallium, both named after France.Emsley, 185 * Nihonium, named after Japan. * Germanium was named for Germany.Emsley, 197 Of these, only gallium and germanium are stable and occur in more than trace amounts on Earth. Americium is named after the Americas,https://periodic.lanl.gov/95.shtmlhttp://acshist.scs.illinois.edu/bulletin_open_access/v33-2/v33-2%20p89-93.pdfhttp://pubsapp.acs.org/cen/80th/print/americiumprint.html? and europium after Europe.Gray, 85 Other elements are named after modern states or cities, including berkelium, californium and tennessine named respectively after the American city of Berkeley and the states of California and Tennessee where they were discovered;Kean, 119 and dubnium and moscovium, similarly named after Russia's DubnaEmsley, 157 and Moscow. Several places in Scandinavia have elements named after them: * Yttrium, terbium, erbium, and ytterbium are all named for the Swedish village of Ytterby, where their ores were first found.Kean, 62 * Holmium is named after Holmia, Latin for the Swedish capital Stockholm.Emsley, 224 * Scandium comes from the Latin word for Scandinavia. * Thulium is from the Ancient Greek word for the remote Arctic land that the Romans called ultima Thule.Emsley, 468 A number of other elements are named after classical words for various places. * Ruthenium is from the Latin name for the region including Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia.Emsley, 458 * Lutetium is named after Lutetia, the Latin name for Paris. * Hafnium is named for Hafnia, the Latin name for Copenhagen.Emsley, 299Emsley, 210 * Copper's name comes from an Old English word derived from the Latin name for the island of Cyprus.Emsley, 145 *The names of both magnesium and manganese derive from the Greek region of Magnesia.Emsley, 310 =Astronomical objects= The naming of elements from astronomical objects stems from the ancient association of metals with the various planets and their gods, as follows: mercury with Mercury; copper with Venus; iron with Mars (named for the Roman god of war); tin with Jupiter (named for the Roman king of the gods); and lead with Saturn (named for the ancient, slow god who was the father of Jupiter). The Sun and the Moon were associated with gold and silver, respectively. A few other elements are directly named for astronomical bodies, including planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, the Earth, the Sun, and the Moon. Uranium, neptunium, plutonium, cerium, and palladium were named after Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Ceres, and Pallas, respectively.Emsley, 405Emsley, 345Emsley, 594Emsley, 120Emsley, 475 The name selenium comes from the Greek word for the Moon (Σελήνη, Selene). Similarly, the name helium is derived from the Greek word for the Sun (Ἢλιος, Helios), as the first evidence for helium came in the form of distinctive emission lines from the Sun that were not explainable by any of the known elements in the 1870s. =Minerals= Many elements are named after the minerals in which they are found, e.g. calcium after Latin calx (lime), silicon is named after Latin silex (sand), sodium after soda and potassium after potash. =Temporary names= In 1979, IUPAC published recommendations for their systematic element names to be used for yet unnamed or undiscovered elements as a placeholder, until the discovery of the element is confirmed and a permanent name is decided on. The recommendations are mostly ignored among scientists, who simply call these elements by their atomic number, for example \\"element 119\\" (instead of \\"ununennium\\"), with the symbol of (119) or even simply 119. Since 2002, the IUPAC Inorganic Chemistry Division has been the official body responsible with assigning official names to new elements, with the IUPAC Council making the final decision. Chemical symbol Once an element has been named, a one-, or two-letter symbol must be ascribed to it so it can be easily referred to in such contexts as the periodic table. The first letter is always capitalised. While the symbol is often a contraction of the element's name, it may sometimes not match the element's name when the symbol is based on non-English words; examples include \\"Pb\\" for lead (from plumbum in Latin) or \\"W\\" for tungsten (from Wolfram in German). Elements which have only temporary systematic names are given temporary three-letter symbols (e.g. Uue for ununennium, the undiscovered element 119). Naming controversies The naming of the synthetic elements dubnium and seaborgium generated a significant amount of controversy, referred to as the Transfermium Wars. The Americans wished to name element 105 hahnium, while the Russians preferred the name dubnium. The Americans also wished to name element 106 seaborgium. This naming dispute ran from the 1970s (when the elements were discovered) to the 1990s, when the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) created a tentative list of the element names for elements 104 to 109. The Americans, however, refused to agree with these names because seaborgium was not in the list. Thus, IUPAC reconsidered, and in 1996 named element 105 dubnium and element 106 seaborgium.Kean, 127-128 Alternative forms of an element, names indicating molecular structure, and names of compounds When a pure element, comprising only one type of atom, nevertheless exists in multiple forms (allotropes) with different structure and properties, they are generally given different names; for example graphite and diamond are both forms of the element carbon. Even for elements such as nitrogen having only one stable allotrope, a name such as dinitrogen may be used to indicate its molecular structure N2 as well as its elemental composition. The naming of chemical compounds comprising more than one element is a complex subject, discussed at length in the article on chemical nomenclature.

He was known mostly for his roles as a comedian.  Early life  Krishnamurthy was born on 10 March 1930 to B. S. Vishweshwaraiah and Subbamma. His father, Vishweshwaraiah was a zamindar in Bettadapura, Mysore. As a young boy, Krishnamurthy was drawn towards singing and acting. He exhibited his singing talent during a Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations in front of carnatic vocalist Musiri Subramania Iyer and the then Maharaja of Mysore, Krishna Raja Wadiyar IV. Having been impressed by his performance, the Maharaja compared him to Musiri Subramania Iyer, after which Krishnamurthy was known as Musuri Krishnamurthy to all.  Career  Krishnamurthy made his film debut in the 1943 Kannada language film Vani which was also the debut of actress Pandari Bai, who like Krishnamurthy was later considered one of Kannada cinema's finest actors. He then appeared in films after a span of 10 years, in 1953 with Mangala Gowri, Kanyadana and Kokilavani which marked his debut as a lead actor. Krishnamurthy then began to assist well known film directors like Shankar Singh, B. Vittalacharya, B. R. Panthulu and others. He also worked as an assistant to well known lyricist and director Kanagal Prabhakara Shastry and learnt the art of writing poems. As filmmaking was less during the 1950s, Krishnamurthy slowly shifted his base to theatre and worked for some of the very famous stage companies of that time. He worked for K. Hirannaiah, Subbaiah Naidu, Gubbi Company and other prominent stage troupes of that era. In 1962, he started his own stage troupe called Amba Prasada Nataka Mandali. But, finding it difficult to manage the company due to heavy expenses, he shut it down in 1966 and returned to films. In his second innings in films, Krishnamurthy played roles as comedian, villain and supporting artist. He became known for his role as Connection Kalappa in Puttanna Kanagal's 1978 film Paduvaaralli Pandavaru. Following this and with roles in films in the 1970s and '80s like Dharmasere, Ranganayaki, Guru Shishyaru, Antha, Nanna Devaru, Haalu Jenu and Kaviratna Kalidasa, Krishnamurthy became one of Kannada cinema's most wanted actors. In 1981, he started his film production company called Yashaswini Enterprises under which he produced the film Number 5 Ekka. Being a film producer, he continued appearing in films with his last appearance coming in the 1985 film Veeradhi Veera.  Personal life  Musuri Krishnamurthy married Sushilamma and had three children with her; sons Gurudath Musuri and Jayasimha Musuri and daughter Vishalakshi.

Historically and archaeologically significant, it was found in 1903 by Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie during excavation of Kom el-Sultan in Abydos, Egypt. It depicts Khufu, a Pharaoh of the Fourth dynasty (Old Kingdom), and the builder of the Great Pyramid. To this day, the little seated figure is the only three dimensional depiction of Khufu which survives largely intact, though there are also several statue fragments. Most Egyptologists consider the statue contemporary with Khufu – very likely from his reign. However, because of the unusual provenance, its dating has been repeatedly questioned. The Egyptologist Zahi Hawass even doubts that the statuette dates to the Old Kingdom at all. His argument that the statuette belongs to the 26th Dynasty has not received much credence, but has not yet been refuted. The ritual purpose of the statuette is also unclear. If it was contemporary with Khufu, it was either part of the traditional statue cult or mortuary cult. On the other hand, if the figurine is from a later period, it probably served (as claimed by Hawass) as a votive offering. The statuette's artist is unknown.  Description  The ivory figurine is about 7.5 cm high, 2.9 cm long and c. 2.6 cm wide and partially damaged. Its outer surface was originally smooth and polished to a sheen. The statuette depicts Khufu with the Red crown (deshret) of Lower Egypt. The King sits on a largely undecorated throne with a low back. In his right hand, which is placed over his breast, he holds a flail against his right shoulder with the flail lying over his upper arm. His left arm is bent with his lower arm resting on his left thigh. The left hand is open, with the palm resting on his left knee. His feet have broken away, along with the pedestal. The red crown is damaged – both the ridge at the back and the decorative spiral at the front have broken off. His head is slightly over proportioned relative to his body, with large, projecting ears. His chin is angular and he does not wear the Pharaonic ceremonial beard. The king wears a short, pleated loincloth – his upper body is naked. On the right side, at Khufu's knee is the Horus name \\"Medjedu\\" and on the left side of the knee, the very faint traces of the end of his nomen \\"Khnum-Khufu\\" is visible in a cartouche.  Discovery  = Find location = The artefact was found in 1903 by Flinders Petrie in the Kom el-Sultan necropolis at Abydos in one of the rooms of \\"Magazine C\\" of the large, heavily ruined temple complex of Osiris-Khenti-Amentiu (labelled on the excavation plan as \\"Building K\\") in the southern sector. The temple of Kom el-Sultan was dedicated to the jackal god Khenti-Amentiu from the Early Dynastic Period until about the middle of the 3rd Dynasty. In the Middle Kingdom a sanctuary in honour of the mummiform god Osiris was built on the site. Khenti-Amentiu and Osiris merged with each other very early on and the temple complex was seen as the Sanctuary of Osiris- Khenti-Amentiu. Plaster remains of wooden statues from the same period were also found in the aforementioned room of Magazine C. = Find situation = The Khufu statuette was initially headless; Petrie ascribed this damage to an accident during the excavation.W. M. Flinders Petrie, Abydos II. p. 30; Table XIII und Table XIV. When Petrie realised the significance of the discovery, he had all work stopped and announced a reward for the recovery of the head. Three weeks later the head was found among the debris from the room after an intensive sieving. Today, the restored statuette is in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, in Room 32 with the inventory number JE 36143. The circumstances of the Khufu statuette's discovery have been called \\"unusual\\" and \\"contradicting\\". Zahi Hawass in particular sees the find situation as a strong argument for his doubts about the dating of the figure. He argues that no buildings which certainly date from the fourth dynasty have ever been excavated at Abydos or Kom el-Sultan and that Petrie was strictly speaking only convinced that Room C must have been a Fourth Dynasty temple or shrine because of the discovery of the Khufu statuette. But building K (next to the magazines) has since turned out to be part of a 6th Dynasty building complex. A number of objects from the 1st, 2nd, 6th and 30th Dynasties have been found in the Temple of Khenti- Amentiu, but nothing that can be surely dated to the 4th Dynasty. Furthermore, the temple does not seem to have been in use during this period. Petrie could not find any evidence of buildings from Khufu's time in his excavations, but he explained this with a reference to the Greek historians Herodotus and Diodorus, who report that Khufu forbade the erection of temples and shrines to the gods during his reign. However, recently Richard Bussmann pointed to an unpublished limestone fragment at Abydos with Khufu's name, which shows at least some of the building activity at Abydos belongs to Khufu. Bussmann asks, therefore, whether Building K could have been a temple for the cult of Khufu.Richard Bussmann, Die Provinztempel Ägyptens von der 0. bis zur 11. Dynastie (= Probleme der Ägyptologie, Vol. 30). Brill, Leiden 2007, , pp. 90, 147, 467.  Art historical significance  \\"Brooklyn Royal Head\\" The statuette is the only complete three dimensional object which depicts Khufu. It is often claimed that the little ivory figurine is the only surviving statue of Khufu. However, there are also several alabaster fragments of seated statues, which were found by George Reisner during his excavations at Giza. Altogether, Rainer Stadelmann estimates that around fifty statues of Khufu must have stood in the king's mortuary temple originally. He estimated that twenty-one to twenty-five statues were taken over by Khufu's successor Djedefre. On the bases of the statues of Khufu, however, the complete royal titulary of the king was inscribed; today the names only survive in fragments, but they are enough to enable a certain identification. These used the full name (Khnum-Khufu) as often as the shortened form (Khufu). On one of the fragments from a small seated statue the king's feet survive up to the ankles. To the right of his feet is the syllable \\"fu\\" in a cartouche, which can easily be reconstructed as the name of king \\"Khufu\\".Dagmar Stockfisch, Untersuchungen zum Totenkult des ägyptischen Königs im Alten Reich. Die Dekoration der königlichen Totenkultanlagen (= Antiquitates, Band 25.). Kovač, Hamburg 1994, , pp. 19 & 93. The Palermo stone fragment C2 reports the creation of two colossal standing statues of the king - one of copper and the other of pure gold.Thomas Schneider: Lexikon der Pharaonen. Albatros, Düsseldorf 2002, , S. 100–102. Several statue heads also survive, which are sometimes attributed to Khufu on account of their stylistic features. The best known of these are the rose granite \\"Brooklyn Royal Head\\"Richard A. Fazzini, Robert S. Bianchi, James F. Romano, Donald B. Spanel, Ancient Egyptian Art in the Brooklyn Museum. Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn (NY) 1989, , p. 31. and the limestone \\"Munich Royal Head\\".Sylvia Schoske, Dietrich Wildung (edd.), Staatliche Sammlung Ägyptischer Kunst München (= Zaberns Bildbände zur Archäologie.

An unusual example is the front part of a polished basalt ram statue, with the Horus and Cartouche names of Khufu on it.  Dating  Close up of Khufu's portrait The majority of Egyptologists put the statuette in the Old Kingdom at the time of Khufu.Margaret Alice Murray, Egyptian sculpture. New Edition. Greenwood Press, London 1970, pp. 50–52. Petrie was especially sure that the figure had to derive from the 4th dynasty. The main argument for dating it to the 4th dynasty is the name of Khufu on the statuette. The style of the statuette in comparison with the artworks of the same period and earlier dynasties was cited as further evidence. Rainer Stadelmann pointed out that the figurine's throne is modelled on the short-backed, cubic throne of the Predynastic period.Rainer Stadelmann, Formale Kriterien zur Datierung der königlichen Plastik der 4. Dynastie in Nicolas Grimal, Les critères de datation stylistiques à l´Ancien Empire. Institut français d´archéologie orientale, Le Caire 1998, , p. 353. Barry J. Kemp and William S. Smith further pointed out that the Khufu statuette's face most closely resembles those of statues from the time of Khasekhemwy, Djoser, and Sneferu in execution. The faces of Khasekhemwy and Snefru are also beardless and Khufu's facial expression seems to be modelled on that of Djoser's limestone statues. In particular, the broad nose, rounded face and the rather schematic eyebrows are clearly inspired by the artistic style of the 3rd dynasty. The slightly protruding ears recall those on the statues of Khasekhemwy. With this facial composition, the portrait of Khufu is stylistically in transition from the archaic form to the classical Old Kingdom style.Krzysztof Grymski, Royal Statuary in John P. O´Neill (ed), Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids. Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York 1999, , p. 54. This artistic style can no longer be perceived in the artworks of any king after Djedefre; from King Khafre, depictions of the kings include the ceremonial beard. The artistic elaboration of the ivory figure has been universally acclaimed by researchers as \\"masterful\\" and \\"professional\\".Barry J. Kemp, \\"The Osiris Temple at Abydos\\" in Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archäologischen Instituts, Abteilung Kairo. (MDAIK) No. 23, 1968, pp. 138–155.Wiliam S. Smith: A History of Egyptian Sculpture and Painting in the Old Kingdom. pp. 20 & 157. It is to this day the earliest known Egyptian sculpture showing a king wearing the Red crown. This becomes more common under Khafre.Christian Ziegler, Small Head of King Khafre with Red Crown in John P. O´Neill (ed): Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids. Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York 1999, , S. 260. Zahi Hawass on the other hand doubts the statuette is contemporary with Khufu. He considers Petrie's dating suspect on account of the find circumstances and points out that Khufu's face is unusually round and chubby and shows no emotion whatsoever. In contrast to Petrie and Margaret Alice Murray, who described the figurine's face as \\"powerful\\" and \\"intimidating\\" (in accordance with Greek traditions about Khufu), Hawass saw the face of a very young, possibly underage man. Hawass compares the facial appearance of the statuette with the statues of other contemporary kings (such as Snefru, Khafre, and Menkaure). These three kings' faces are of more normal proportions, thin and friendly - they conform to the ideal form which consciously diverges from reality. In particular, an ivory statuette of King Menkaure, now on display in the Boston Museum under the number Boston 11.280a-b, excites Hawass' interest. Although now headless, this figure displays a similar schema to the Khufu statuette, but its body is very slim and athletic and its execution is significantly more careful. The appearance of Khufu in the ivory statuette, however, is claimed not to be particularly well-worked. Khufu himself, in Hawass' view, would never have allowed such a comparatively crude item to be displayed in his palace or elsewhere. Further, Hawass alleges that the shape of the throne has no counterpart in Old Kingdom art: In the Old Kingdom, the back of the royal throne rose to the neck of the ruler. For Hawass, a conclusive proof that the statue must be a reproduction from a later time is the so-called Nehenekh flail in Khufu's left hand. Sculptural depictions of a king with such a flail as a ceremonial insignia do not appear chronologically before the Middle Kingdom. Zahi Hawass, therefore, comes to the conclusion that the figure was probably sold to a pious citizen or pilgrim as an amulet or talisman in the 26th dynasty (or later). The figurine's presence in its find location would then be a result of use as a votive offering.Zahi Hawass, The Khufu Statuette. pp. 379–394.Abeer El-Shahawy, Farid S. Atiya, The Egyptian Museum in Cairo. p. 49ff. Zahi Hawass is, finally, convinced that the Khufu statuette is most likely a replica of a life-size or over life-size statue. In his view the original was probably located in Memphis in Lower Egypt, which would explain why Khufu wears the red crown. This assumption also underpinned his dating to the 26th dynasty: at that time, homages to the Old Kingdom were very popular; old, long-forgotten deities were portrayed in reliefs and statues and miniatures of royal statues made and sold as talismans or votive offerings and old, long-forgotten titles of the Old Kingdom were reprised and awarded to officials. For example, the temple of King Taharqa contains reliefs which are modelled after Old Kingdom murals from entirely different contexts. Finally, Hawass maintains that the face of the Khufu statuette most closely resembles the black granite heads of King Taharqa. Citing the work of William S. Smith, Hawass claims that statues of the Old Kingdom Kings were mass-produced in later time, that this probably also applies to the Khufu statuette and that the rather sloppy form of the statuette corroborates this.Wiliam S.

The law establishes the form and basis of both natural and legal persons.  Income tax  Income tax is levied to natural persons who engage on economic activities outside employment for the government. For those persons, there are two tax regimes: one is based on accounted profits, and the other is a fixed monthly fee adjusted per occupation. The tax regime based on accounted profits is imposed to people with income over 100000 CUP (equivalent to USD 4000) and to people in some particular occupations, for example food retailing. In this regime, deductions are allowed for costs up to a limit arbitrarily set by the Minister of Finances, but also for other taxes and some base deductions. The second form is imposed to the rest of the retailers, and does not require that the entrepreneur do any kind of accounting. This form of tax is possible because the Cuban legislation only allows for rudimentary forms of economic association involving very few people, also, the kinds of activity per occupation and the occupations themselves are limited per law The Finance Minister sets preliminary monthly tax quotas based on occupation. If the amount of the preliminary tax paid during the fiscal year is higher than the final tax according to income and tax rate, no tax refund is made. That is, tax refunds are not made in any case.

It is based on the tragedy with the same name written by John Ford (1586 – c. 1639). The music was composed by Ennio Morricone. Synopsis In the city of Mantua, during the Italian Renaissance, Giovanni, the son of a propertied man, is sent to study abroad and he never meets his sister, Annabella, who is a couple of years younger than him. After ten years of separation, the now beautiful Annabella is reunited with her brother for the first time, as adolescents. The young siblings are immediately attracted and can not help to fall in love with each other. After struggling with their feelings for some time Giovanni and Annabella begin a secret relationship, and she becomes pregnant. Knowing that the world will condemn them, Giovanni leaves his father's villa, and Annabella accepts the marriage proposal of her suitor, the wealthy noble Soranzo. After Soranzo discovers that he has been the object of a deception, he makes plans for a bloody vengeance.  Cast  * Charlotte Rampling as Annabella * Oliver Tobias as Giovanni * Fabio Testi as Soranzo * Antonio Falsi as Bonaventura, the Friar * Rik Battaglia as Mercante, the father * Angela Luce as Mercante's governess * Rino Imperio as Soranzo's servant Release The film was released in France under the title Dommage qu'elle soit une putain. Reception Italian film critic Marco Giusti writes that Rampling undresses as much as she can, but that it is Fabio Testi's physique that is imposing: Always naked and often framed at the height of his buttocks, it is causing the spectators some embarrassment. Giusti perfectly remembers the sight of Testi's big hairy buttocks on the screen of the cinema Verdi in Genoa. However, Teo Mora \\"forced\\" Giusti and Enrico Ghezzi to stage it at the Teatro dell'Archivolto in Genoa. Giusti acted as Soranzo, Testi's character; he has not done any theatre since.

Encyclopédie complète. 1885 à nos jours. Origins George Messier owned a factory for \\"pneumatic equipment\\" at least as early as 1920. He also developed a type of air suspension for automobiles. In 1920 he created the company Messier Automobiles and marketed the air suspension. From 1925 he produced automobiles on his own account, using the Messier name. In 1931 Messier abandoned automobile production in order to concentrate, primarily, on aircraft landing gear. At least one source claims that Messier's air suspension was the basis for the revolutionary Hydropneumatic suspension of later Citroën models including, most notably, the 1955 DS. The inventor of the Hydropneumatic suspension, Paul Magès, was born in 1908,http://paulmages.com so it is technically possible that he saw the glimmer of a good idea in the Messier and spent WW2 focused on intensive experimentation to improving the idea. He eventually used pressurized oil, not air, as the springing mechanism. The cars The notable feature of the cars was their Air suspension. The engines were bought in from specialist engine manufacturers. The first cars used a 4-cylinder engine from CIME. There was a racing model powered by a 1494cc overhead camshaft unit while Touring and Limousine bodied 4-cylinder cars were fitted with a 1598cc overhead camshaft unit. In October 1924 the manufacturer took a stand at the 19th Paris Motor Show, preparing to market his small cars during the 1925 model year. They were advertised as \\"voitures sans ressorts\\" (cars without springs), highlighting the unconventional pneumatic suspension. In place of springs the cars featured above each front wheel pneumatic tubes of compressed air, each of diameter. Similar tubes were fixed in place of the rear suspension, shorter than the tubes at the front, but also slightly thicker, each having a diameter. By October 1928, it was clear from the cars exhibited on the Messier stand at the 22nd Paris Motor Show that the manufacturer had \\"changed class\\". There were 6-cylinder cars with engine capacities of 2770cc and 3310cc and 8-cylinder models of 3692cc (20CV) and 4850cc (30CV). The largest engines came from Lycoming Engines of Pennsylvania, and engines from other American suppliers were also used.

Redford (ed), The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2001, pp. 154-6. and a Herakleopolite pharaoh had joined the mourning for the latter's grandfather (i.e. Khety II's great-great-grandfather). After Tefibi's death, Khety II was installed as a nomarch by king Merykare himself, who sailed up the Nile with his court on a fleet. It is known that Khety II undertook some restoration works in the local temple of Wepwawet. He was loyal to the 10th Dynasty until the end, and probably died shortly before the fall of Asyut by the Theban pharaoh Mentuhotep II of the 11th Dynasty, which preceded the final capitulation of Herakleopolis and thus the end of the civil war. Under the reign of Mentuhotep II, the old line of nomarchs represented by Khety II and his ancestors was replaced by a new, pro-Theban one. His unfinished tomb at Asyut (no. IV) is the best preserved among the tombs of his relatives, which are unfortunately ruined, and it is also the only one mentioning a royal name (Merykare).

History  Smith was born on 7 November 1749 in Stenness on the Orkney Isles. His father was William Smith and his mother, Charlotte Whitefoord, was sister to Caleb Whitefoord, a diplomat and political satirist. He attended the Royal Academy Schools before moving to London to establish himself as an artist under the tutelage of J. H. Mortimer. He exhibited three portraits at the Society of Artists in 1776 but it seems that his strong political convictions, sometimes violently expressed, limited his work. In 1783, influenced by the experiences of Tilly Kettle, Smith left England for India. There he travelled widely: he was introduced to the nawab of Oudh by John Macpherson, the then governor-general, and also spent time in Calcutta, Madras, Lucknow and probably Delhi, where he may have painted the Mughal emperor, Shah Alam II. Lucknow, in particular, was at that time a hub of artistic activity. Smith was not alone in making this journey abroad, since portrait artists had been encouraged by the first governor-general, Warren Hastings. However, by the time that Smith, Johann Zoffany and painters arrived in the country, the market was in a state of collapse and the successors to Hastings, including Macpherson, were less interested in promoting their efforts. Many struggled to recover the payments that had been arranged for their services and their style of painting contrasted significantly with the native styles, depicting their sitters in a less flattering manner. The novelty of portraiture among the nawabs was also in decline generally. William Baillie, a jealous contemporary of Smith who had tried and failed as a painter of the even more out-of-favour Indian landscapes, described the poor pickings sarcastically in a letter to Ozias Humphry, saying \\"What inducement has he to paint for money?\\" That Smith survived there better than some of his colleagues probably reflects his family connections with politicians and members of the East India Company. Having left India in 1787, Smith was living in London and Edinburgh between 1789 and 1797. He exhibited at the Royal Academy and in 1798 had a musical entertainment staged at Covent Garden Theatre. This musical work - A Day at Rome - was not well received and thereafter he published it as an act of protest. The Analytical Review recorded It is probable that Smith also earned money as a copyist of other artists: William Brummell, father of Beau Brummell, owned a copy of a Joshua Reynolds work that Reynolds himself could barely distinguish from the original. Smith returned to India, working there from 1800 to 1811. In 1802, he published A Trip to Bengal, another two-act musical work, dedicating it to Macpherson in appreciation of his past hospitality. Described as an opera, this also was performed at Covent Garden and it included as its centrepiece a traditional melancholy Urdu song, Dil ne danne lea re. He died at Leith on 19 December 1824.

It was released in 1974. Style Tucson Weekly described it as a \\"pop/prog/avant-garde album\\". According to Josh Frank, Terminal Love \\"had clearly been attempting, at least, to be a pop album\\", noting that the songs were shorter and featured \\"standard variations on the verse-chorus-verse structure\\".

Initiated by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia on 13 July 1941, it was suppressed within six weeks, but continued at a much lower intensity until December 1941. The insurgents were led by a combination of communists and former Royal Yugoslav Army officers from Montenegro. Some of the officers had recently been released from prisoner-of-war camps following their capture during the invasion of Yugoslavia. The communists managed the organisation and provided political commissars, while the insurgent military forces were led by former officers. The entire nation rejected the privileged position offered by its occupiers, rejected the capitulation in order to fight for Yugoslavia, together with \\"Russia\\" (the nationalist insurgents perceived the Soviet Union as Russia at the beginning of the uprising). Within three weeks of the start of the uprising, the insurgents managed to capture almost all the territory of Montenegro. The Italian troops were forced to retreat to their strongholds in Pljevlja, Nikšić, Cetinje and Podgorica. The main commanders included the former officers Colonel Bajo Stanišić and Major Đorđije Lašić, with Captain Pavle Đurišić emerging as one of the principal leaders after he distinguished himself during the successful attack he led on Berane alongside communist forces. The counter-offensive by more than 70,000 Italian troops, commanded by General Alessandro Pirzio Biroli, was assisted by Sandžak Muslim militia and Albanian irregular forces from border areas between Montenegro and Albania, and suppressed the uprising within six weeks. The former Royal Yugoslav Army officers and communists were in dispute over the insurgent's strategy. The nationalists wanted to protect the mountain villages if they were attacked. The communists disagreed and organized a frontal struggle against Italian forces in which the rebel forces were defeated. A split occurred between the insurgents because of their defeats, which were inflicted by the Italians, and because some of the insurgents realized that the uprising was led by the communists. Josip Broz Tito dismissed Milovan Đilas from the command of Partisan forces in Montenegro because of his mistakes during the uprising, particularly because Đilas chose a frontal struggle instead of guerrilla tactics against the Italian forces and because his \\"Leftist Errors\\". After the major defeat of 1 December 1941 during the unsuccessful attack of the communist forces on the Italian garrison in Pljevlja, many soldiers deserted Partisan forces and joined the Chetniks. Following this defeat, the communists terrorized the people they perceived as their enemies, which antagonized many in Montenegro. The defeat of the communist forces in Pljevlja, combined with the policy of terror they pursued, were the main reasons for the expansion of the conflict between the communist and nationalist insurgents in Montenegro following the uprising. In the second half of December 1941, nationalist military officers Đurišić and Lašić began a mobilization of armed units separate from the Partisans. In early March 1942, Đurišić arranged one of the first collaboration agreements between the Italians and the Chetniks. This agreement was between Đurišić and Pirzio-Biroli, and related to the area of operations of the 19th Infantry Division Venezia. In May 1942, Đurišić attacked and defeated the last significant Partisan detachment in Montenegro. Based on agreements signed by the Italians with Đurišić and other Chetnik leaders, the Italian occupation in Montenegro was then effectively reduced to towns while Chetniks remained in control of the rest of the territory of Montenegro. In the second quarter of 1942, a joint Italian-Chetnik offensive resulted in the withdrawal of the remaining Partisan forces from Montenegro.  Background  In April 1941, Germany and Italy invaded Montenegro, the Germans from Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Italians from Albania. The Germans later withdrew, leaving the Italians to occupy the area. Due to the collapse of the Yugoslav Army, the general population of Montenegro had easy access to large amounts of military arms and ammunition. By July 1941, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia had over 1,800 members and another 3,000 youth members, located in the area of Montenegro, Kotor and the Sandzak. Most of these were ready to commence an armed uprising against the Axis powers and the occupying Italians in particular. Grievances mainly related to the expulsion of Montenegrin people from the Kosovo region and Vojvodina, as well as the influx of refugees from other parts of Yugoslavia. Other refugees were fleeing the terror of the Ustaše in the regions along the borders with Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Montenegrins also hated the Italians because they had annexed important food-producing territories around Kosovo and a salt-producing facility at Ulcinj to Albania. This was coupled with the economic damage inflicted by the temporary removal from circulation of Yugoslav banknotes of 500 dinars and more. But the event that triggered the uprising was the proclamation of a restored Kingdom of Montenegro headed by an Italian regent and led by Montenegrin separatist Sekula Drljević and his supporters, known as \\"Greens\\" (zelenaši). This proclamation was announced by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It was issued to the Italian-convoked assembly of Montenegrin separatists held on 12 July 1941. The uprising broke out the following day.  Uprising  = Initial success of the insurgents = In early July 1941, a senior Montenegrin member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, Milovan Đilas, arrived in Montenegro from Belgrade to start the communist struggle against the occupying forces. The general uprising in Montenegro broke out on 13 July 1941, initiated by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Large numbers of non- communists joined the uprising, including many former Royal Yugoslav Army officers, some pro-communist but most having strong nationalist sentiments. It was the third uprising in Axis-occupied Yugoslavia in the summer of 1941. The insurgent forces were led by the former officers, some of whom had recently been released from prisoner-of-war camps. The communists dealt with the organisation and provided political commissars. The insurgents also included large numbers of Serb nationalists known as \\"Whites\\" () and armed villagers. The insurgents seized control of small towns and villages in the early phase of the uprising. On 14 July insurgents attacked Italian gendarmes in Mojkovac and soon captured the town. On 15 July in Košćele, near Rijeka Crnojevića, two detachments of 80 insurgents (from Ljubotinj and Upper Ceklin) ambushed a convoy of trucks transporting Italian II Border guard battalion from Podgorica. Italian forces were sent to release Cetinje which was besieged by the insurgents. After eight hours battle the insurgents were victorious and killed 70–80 Italian soldiers and officers, wounded 260 and captured remaining 440. Insurgents captured several small boats in Virpazar. On 16 July they used one of them to transport 46 captured Italian soldiers to Scutari, in exchange for medical supplies and food. On 17 July, amidst the worst of the fighting during the successful attack he led on Berane, then-Captain Pavle Đurišić distinguished himself, and emerged as one of the main commanders of the uprising. During the attack on Berane, Đurišić fought alongside communist insurgent forces. Đilas attempted to get Stanišić to accept overall command of the uprising, but Stanišić refused. On 18 July, Đilas established the Command of People's Liberation Troops of Montenegro, Boka and Sandžak under his own command, with the advice of those former Yugoslav Army officers that were willing to fight under communist control. On 20 July insurgents captured Bijelo Polje with an Italian garrison of 180 soldiers and officers. Within three weeks from the start of the uprising, Italian troops were forced to retreat to their strongholds in Pljevlja, Nikšić, Cetinje, and Podgorica. Milovan Đilas and Arso Jovanović were sent from Serbia to coordinate the actions of the insurgents. According to Cavallero, most of the insurgent forces were led by former officers of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia until the end of October 1941. = Italian counteroffensive = General Alessandro Pirzio Biroli believed that the only thing the Balkan mentality recognized was force. On 16 July 1941, General Cavallero, the Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Army Group in Albania, gave order to General Alessandro Pirzio Biroli to suppress the uprising \\"at whatever cost.\\" On 25 July 1941, Benito Mussolini appointed Biroli, former governor of Asmara, with complete civil and military powers in Montenegro. He believed that force was the only thing the Balkan mentality recognized. That is why he urged for extreme retaliation. On 5 August, Biroli issued an order to the population to surrender all firearms, and on 8 August, he ordered confiscation of insurgents' property. Biroli commanded the Italian counter-offensive which was the first offensive of the occupying Axis forces in Yugoslavia. Italian troops consisted of six divisions (Messina, Puglie, Pusteria, Taro, Venezia and Cacciatori delle Alpi), two Blackshirts Legion (108 and 164), two combat groups (I group of Cavalry Regiment Cavalleggeri Guide and Skanderbeg) and two battalions of border guard. A force of more than 70,000 Italian troops attacked the insurgents, assisted by around 20,000 members of Moslem militia from Sandžak, Plav and Gusinje and Albanian irregular forces from border areas who provided flank security. The Vulnetari from Kosovo, mostly from the region of Đakovica, came to Plav and Gusinje to support the Italian counter-offensive. Transfer of two Italian divisions (Tarro and Cacciatori delle Alpi) to the Eastern Front was cancelled and they were directed against the insurgents in Montenegro. In one of his reports written in August 1941, Biroli explained that the Division Venezia advanced from Podgorica to Kolašin and Andrijevica. He reported that this division was supported with Alpini troops and Albanian forces under command of Captain Prenk Cali from Vermosh and by forces from Đakovica. Despite fierce resistance of the insurgents, Italian forces managed to re-occupy the region of Kolašin, Andrijevica and Berane, and released from captivity 879 Italian soldiers and officers. In the middle of August on the part of the front toward Rožaje commanded by Pavle Đurišić and toward Čakor commanded by Đorđije Lašić the rebel representatives and Italian forces organized negotiations. The delegation of rebels was headed by Milutin Jelić. The peace with Italian forces was agreed.:\\"U jeku neprijateljske ofanzive protiv ustaničkih snaga, sredinom avgusta 1941. godine, na frontu prema Rožajima u srezu beranskom, kojim je komandovao kapetan Pavle Đurišić, i na frontu prema Čakoru u srezu andrijevičkom, kojim je komandovao generalštabni major Đorđe Lašić, dolazi, iza leđa NOPO, do tajnih pregovora između okupatora i predstavnika kapitulantske buržoaske grupe....Našu delegaciju predvodio je Milutin Jelić, bivši narodni poslanak Radikalne stranke, iz Vasojevića.\\" Initially the rebel requests were the following::\\" Naši uslovi bili su ovi: 1) Na svaki pokušaj italijanske Vlade da Crnu Goru proglasi za nezavisnu državu, mi ćemo dizati ustanak. 2) Zabrana Arnautima i arnautskoj vojsci da ulaze na našu teritoriju; hitno obustavljanje paljenja srpskih sela. U naknadu, ponudili smo im vraćanje zarobljenika. 3) Italijanske trupe u Crnoj Gori smatraće se sve do svršetka rata neprijateljskim okupatorskim trupama.\\" # The rebels would organize new uprising in case of an attempt of Italian government to proclaim Montenegro as independent state # The Albanians and Albanian military will be banned from entering the territory under rebel control and urgent stop of torching the Serb villages. In return the rebels would release prisoners they took during the uprising # Italian troops will be considered as enemy troops until the end of war. The Italian side accepted parts of the rebel demands by agreeing to stop torching villages and by retreating Albanian forces, while rebels obliged themselves to allow Italians to re-occupy towns captured by rebels during the uprising. Italian troops regained control over all towns and communication routes within six weeks. Biroli issued the orders to crush the revolt, but directed his forces to avoid \\"acts of revenge and useless cruelty\\". Nevertheless, in crushing the revolt, dozens of villages were burned, hundreds were killed and between 10,000 and 20,000 residents were interned. For a while, the Muslim and Albanian irregulars were permitted to pillage and torch villages. After the counteroffensive Italians did not rebuild their posts in the villages because they were afraid they could again be an easy prey of the insurgents. As a result, most of the rural areas of Montenegro were not reoccupied. This allowed insurgents to obtain easier communication, supply and other activities. = Leftist errors = After the initial success of the uprising, communists took charge of the situation. Their bloody rule antagonized many people in Montenegro. Đilas and Partisans conducted a brief reign of terror and soon realized that such policy made it harder for them to find supplies and safe hideouts and to recruit new forces. The Partisans pursued the policy of mass terror not only against their soldiers who deserted them after the Battle of Pljevlja, but also against their families, against Chetniks and their families, against wealthier traders, peasants and any professionals they perceived as their potential class enemies. This policy is referred to as the \\"leftist deviation\\". On 22 October 1941 Tito dismissed Milovan Đilas from the command of Partisan forces in Montenegro because of his mistakes during the uprising, including his \\"Leftist Errors\\". = Battle of Pljevlja = After the setback caused by the Italian counteroffensive, toward the end of 1941, the insurgents recovered and resumed with their activities. On 1 December, the Partisan forces attacked Pljevlja but failed to capture it and retreated after suffering heavy casualties. Partisan forces counted 203 killed and 269 wounded soldiers. Many partisans deserted their units and joined the Chetniks. Following their defeat in the Battle of Pljevlja, partisans terrorized people, plundered villages and executed captured Italians, party \\"sectarians\\" and \\"perverts\\". The Battle of Pljevlja was the last major conflict of the Uprising in Montenegro. Following this battle the communists were expelled from Montenegro until spring 1943. = A split between the insurgents = A split developed between the insurgents was a result of their defeats inflicted by the Italians and realization by some of them that the uprising was led by the communists. Partisans were determined to carry on with the communist revolution while nationalists recognized that the uprising had been defeated and wanted to stop fighting. In northern Montenegro, there was a particular distinction between communists and nationalists. The communists wanted to continue with the revolution by turning against their class enemies. The focus of the nationalists was to avoid provoking the Italians but to protect the mountain villages if they were attacked. During the autumn, the nationalists contacted the Italians and offered to assist them to fight the Partisans. Subsequently, the nationalists, including Đurišić who was popular in his own Vasojević clan of northern Montenegro, withdrew into the hinterland. Most nationalist commanders took neither side in the sporadic clashes between Italian forces and insurgent forces that became increasingly dominated by Partisans. There were two main reasons for the expansion of the conflict between the two groups of insurgents: a major defeat of Partisan forces during their attack on the Italian garrison in Pljevlja and terror conducted by communists, the so-called \\"Left Deviations\\". \\"A land without Chetniks was suddenly overwhelmed by Chetniks\\" largely due to the policy of Left Deviations which resulted in a temporary defeat of the Partisan movement in Montenegro in 1942. The general uprising of the people of Montenegro became a civil war.  End of uprising  In early November 1941 Tito dismissed Milovan Đilas from the command of Partisan forces in Montenegro because of his mistakes during the uprising, including his \\"Leftist Errors\\". Tito emphasized that Đilas made mistakes because he organized a frontal struggle of armies against a much stronger enemy instead of connecting the Partisan struggle with the people's uprising and adopting the partisan methods of resistance. Đilas was appointed as editor of the paper Borba, the Party's main propaganda organ. The uprising continued to a reduced extent until December 1941.  Aftermath  The population of Serbia also turned against the uprising and communist insurgents because of their repression and intention to carry on a communist revolution. The Partisans moved from Serbia to Bosnia (nominally NDH) and joined their comrades who had already left Montenegro. Together, they made up the First Proletarian Brigade established by Tito on 21 December 1941, in Rudo, southeastern Bosnia. On 20 December 1941, Draža Mihailović, a prominent Chetnik leader later supported by the Yugoslav government-in-exile, appointed Đurišić as the commander of all regular and reserve troops in central and eastern Montenegro and parts of the Sandžak. On 21 December 1941, the Italians declared that they would hold Montenegro responsible if their troops were attacked again. In the second half of December 1941, Đurišić and Lašić began the mobilization and establishment of armed units separated from Partisans. By the middle of January 1942 these units were in armed conflict with Partisans. On 12 January 1942, the Italians specified how they intended to punish the Montenegrins in case of attack on Italian forces: 50 civilians would be executed for every killed or wounded Italian officer. In the case of regular soldiers, 10 civilians would be killed. Biroli was proclaimed a war criminal because of the crimes committed by the Italian forces commanded by him in Montenegro. In February 1942, the Italians estimated that there were about 8,000 Partisans and 5,000 Chetniks operating in Montenegro. In early March 1942, Đurišić arranged one of the first collaboration agreements between the Italians and the Chetniks. This agreement was with Biroli, and related to the area of operations of the 19th Infantry Division Venezia. In May 1942, Đurišić attacked and defeated the last significant Partisan detachment in Montenegro. Partisan forces were pushed out from most of Montenegro. As they retreated, they pillaged and burned villages that did not support them. The towns remained under Italian occupation while Chetniks were allowed to control the rest of Montenegro. The Partisans retreated from Montenegro and joined other Partisans in Bosnia. Except for some individuals and small underground units, Partisans did not re-enter Montenegro for almost a year. Following the withdrawal of the Partisans from Montenegro, the Chetniks repeated the same mistakes the Partisans had made, establishing prison camps, conducting show trials and killing indiscriminately. These actions were not just targeted at the remaining communists, but also against the Sandzak Muslims. Chetnik massacres of Muslims were perpetrated in particular in the towns of Bijelo Polje, Pljevlja and the village of Bukovica. This resulted in the Muslims establishing village militias to defend against both the Partisans and Chetniks.

The battle consisted of a series of operations and is known by several names. In French it is known as Bataille de la cote 1248 (Battle of Hill 1248) and Bataille de Pelister (or Péristéri) after the Pelister mountain. In Bulgarian it is known as the Battle of Chervena Stena, after the Chervena Stena or Crvena Stena ridge, also in the Pelister mountain range. This could be translated as the Battle of the Red Wall, but that name was not used in French or English. Another name for the engagement is the Battle of Lake Prespa.  Background  Monastir (today known as Bitola) seen from Pelister In November 1916 the Entente had managed to capture Monastir but it was impossible for them to use the city because it was within the range of the Bulgarian artillery in the Pelister mountain range to the West and Hill 1248 to the north of the city. The Allied commander-in- chief, Maurice Sarrail, made plans for a large spring offensive in 1917, besides attacking the Crna Bend and Doiran, he also planned an attack north and west of Monastir to give the city, which was always under fire, a wider breathing space. For this attack, Sarrail disposed of five infantry divisions: the French 57th, 11th Colonial, 16th Colonial, 76th and 156th Infantry Divisions.  Battle  Sarrail's plan was to attack the German and Bulgarian line between the Lakes Ohrid and Prespa and to also launch a frontal attack North from Monastir against Hill 1248. On March 11, the operations between the two lakes began with an intense bombardment and an attack by the 76th French Division against the Crvena Stena west of Monastir, where they captured some strong entrenchments around the villages of Dihovo, Tirnova (Tirnovo) and Snegovo. But resistance from Central Powers forces proved more vigorous than expected, and together with the extremely bad weather, this caused the attack to fail. The French attack on Hill 1248, which was to have been delivered at the same time, did not commence until the 14th. On the 18th, after four days of intense engagements, the French captured the whole of Hill 1248 as well as the fortified village of Krklino (also named Krklina, Kir-Klina, Kerklino, Kerklina, etc.), taking 1,200 prisoners. But the Central Powers succeeded, by a counter-attack, in recapturing part of Hill 1248, whose summit remained abandoned by both sides. Monastir was somewhat relieved, but the town continued to remain under fire until the Armistice, when more than half of it had been destroyed by the 20,700 shells dropped on the town proper. Some 500 inhabitants were killed and 650 injured.Villari (1922), pg.126 The Chervena Stena was also retaken by the Bulgarians on 18 May.  Consequences  This French defeat meant that the whole spring offensive of 1917 left the allies with no results at all. For the Bulgarians this victory was a great boost in moral and there were even comparisons made with the historic victory in the Battle of Shipka Pass against the Turks in 1877. It was only 15 months later that the allies succeeded in breaking through the Bulgarian-German defenses in the Battle of Dobro Pole (September 1918). This forced the capitulation of Bulgaria, thus decidedly turning the strategic and operational balance of the war against the Central Powers.

Presently, he is an Honorary Professor at the Molecular Biophysics Unit (MBU), IISc and holds the Bhatnagar fellowship of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India. He is known for his work on lectin structure and interactions, orientation and dynamics of cell surface carbohydrate receptors and protein folding, diabetes, anti-malarials and anti-cancer agents based on curcumin, flavonoids, etc. In addition, neuropathic pain, neurodegenerative disorders and the link between immunity and obsessive compulsive disorder are areas of his current interest Education and career Surolia obtained his bachelor's degree in chemistry and biology from University of Jodhpur, in 1970. He earned his master's degree in biochemistry from Maharaja Sayajirao University, Baroda in 1972. He completed his Ph.D. under the guidance of B. K. Bachhawat from Madras University in 1976. In 1978 he was awarded a D.Sc. degree by Madras University. After his doctoral studies he joined Indian Institute of Chemical Biology (IICB), Calcutta, India as a scientist in 1977 until 1981. He further held the position of assistant professor at IICB until 1986, after which he joined Molecular Biophysics Unit (MBU) at IISc as an associate professor (1986-1991). He was professor at MBU, IISc from 1991 to 2013 and served as its chairman from 2000 to 2006. From 2006 to 2011 he held the directorship of India's prestigious research institute, National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi.

In recognition of his contributions to medicine and science, he was conferred an Honorary D.Sc. degree in 2013 by Queen's University, Belfast, UK. Scientific contributions Surolia has elucidated the role of glycosphingolipids as biological receptors through studies on lectin-glycolipid interactions using liposomes. He discovered novel blood group and tumor antigen specific lectins and made original contribution towards elucidation of the energetics and mechanism of protein-sugar recognition. He genetically re-engineered carbohydrate specificities of lectins imparting exquisite T-antigen tumor recognizing ability to peanut agglutinin. He delineated the molecular basis of carbohydrate recognition by legume lectins and demonstrated the novel C-H...O/N hydrogen bond in protein-sugar interactions. He studied thermal unfolding of lectins that led to the discovery of novel modes of oligomerization in them. He found a molten globule monomeric intermediate during the folding of peanut agglutinin that retained its carbohydrate binding ability - establishing 'wet' molten globule as an \\"on pathway\\" folding intermediate and characterized other early intermediates. His studies showed that the monomers of legume lectins have the necessary structural features for carbohydrate recognition and that oligomerization imparts them with topology necessary for their biologic activities such as agglutination, mitogenesis etc. He elucidated the molecular features of substrate recognition by endoplasmic reticulum chaperones calreticulin and Calnexin. He discovered the unusual quaternary structure of peanut agglutinin and a novel lectin fold in Jacalin as well as the structural basis of inactivation of ribosomes by gelonin. He enunciated that solvent reorganization in protein-ligand interactions modulates their specificities. Showed the existence of co- operativity in lectin- multimeric sugar interactions. Surolia explained the enigmatic endotoxin neutralizing activity of polymyxin B to its specific ability to remove endotoxin from its assembly and attributed it to its unique amphiphilicity. He popularized Protein A as a tool in immunology. He discovered the broad substrate specificity of a key enzyme of biotin biosysnthesis from M. tuberculosis and reported novel inhibitors for it. He has demonstrated the potential of common dietary components- curcumin and green tea catechins as anti-cancer and anti-malarial agents. He has developed a rhodanine, BCFMT, as a potential therapeutic for cancer. Surolia co- discovered the existence of the fatty acid synthesis (FAS) pathway in Plasmodium and demonstrated its remarkable distinction from that of its human host. He co-identified triclosan, a widely used biocide, to compromise the growth of the parasite by inhibiting its enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI). Recently, Surolia and colleagues have identified Pranlukast (an FDA approved drug for asthma) as novel inhibitor of Mtb ArgJ, an enzyme of the arginine biosynthesis pathway, essential for pathogenicity and survival in host cells. Pranlukast demonstrated remarkable efficiency in pre‐clinical models of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis. These apart, Surolia has also ventured into the field of chronic disease biology where he has developed a novel form of insulin Supramolecular Insulin Assembly-II (SIA-II) for long-lasting treatment of type I diabetes mellitus. In addition to protein–sugar interactions his research is also focused on neuropathic pain, neurodegenerative disorders and the link between immunity and obsessive compulsive disorder. Curcumin and its designed analogs are being developed as experimental therapeutics for these diseases and cancer. His findings have been commercially exploited by a number of international companies such as Amersham-Pharmacia, Sigma Chemical Co., Pierce Corporation, Bangalore Genei, Datascope Corp., Shantha Biotechniques Pvt. Ltd. He has about 19 national and international patents. Surolia has published about 360 scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals of high impact factor.

The church is a \\"monument of culture\\" in the Republic of Macedonia and protected by law. It is also a part of the Prespa - Pelagonia diocese of the Macedonian Orthodox Church - Ohrid Archbishopric. Dating Not much is known about the first centuries of the church. Only a painted inscription on the eastern side of the altar mentions the 25th of April 1191 as the beginning of the fresco paintings under the first reign of Isaac II Angelos (1185/95-1203/04). This epigraphic hint was discovered in 1958 during conservation work and confirms the assumption of M. Radivoje Ljubinković in 1940. Previous publications have dated the frescos to the 16th century. The year specification of 1191 could also hint to the edification of the church, which could be dated between the years 1185 and 1190 due to its simple architecture and its small dimensions. The inscription on the altar neither gives any clue about the circumstances, under which the church was erected, nor the names of the donor and the painter. No further written sources are known. However the donor's portrait could give information about the social rank of the founder. Unfortunately, the scene is severely damaged, meaning there are no eponymously inscriptions and the faces of the four participants are unrecognizable. Due to the clothing and the dating of the frescos, one person is identified as Isaac II Angelos, the female as his wife Margaret of Hungary. The third figure could be John X Kamateros, archbishop of Ohrid, while the last participant is assumed to be his protégé. The latter had to be part of the higher circles, belonging to an influential group of nobles. Architecture The building belongs with its dimensions (15x7m) to one of the biggest aisleless churches of Macedonia and is hardly representative regarding its architecture. It consists of a rectangular nave and a semicircular apse in the east, which has a throne integrated at its centre. In front of it is a monolithic, cubic altar. The area of the bema is slightly heightened by two elevations of the floor. The main entrance is situated in the west, while there is one door each in the lateral walls. The northern one is almost at the height of the windows as this side of the church is limited by a slope. All three entrances are completed by a lunette and two archivolts. High up in the northern and southern walls are two windows located, each with round arches. Another pair is situated in the apse, while a seventh one can be found in the western gable zone. Two rectangular screens ensure incidence of light in the south wall. The apse is flanked by one rectangular niche on each side, functioning symbolically as prothesis and diaconicon. Two rectangular deepenings are situated in the side walls of the bema zone. The one in the south is bricked-up and clearly positioned lower than its counterpart, but still taking away part of the painting of a bishop. The walls consist of roughly trimmed stone, combined by mortar. Flatter stones and bricks are used irregularly around the lunettes and windows as well as for the apse. In the upper two-thirds of the eastern wall are two horizontal registers of brick incorporated, which reminds of the cloisonné technique, whereas the lower part is performed coarsely. Since the 11th century the facades of religious buildings in the Byzantine empire are designed more vividly and loosened up by niches, bricks and friezes. Especially the masonry in Kastoria was decorated by pricks forming patterns. Also the lunette with the double archivolt was very common in Byzantine architecture since the 11th century. Frescos =Facade= The church is not only decorated with paintings on the interior, but also on the facade. The cloisonné technique was used for the frescos on the western side imitating brickwork up to the height of the door lintel. Further brick mimicries can be found in the lower zone of the apse and the first archivolt of the southern door. The rest of the paintings are strongly washed out. Better preserved are the rider saints with their halos, shields and lances, who are flanking the western lunette. Above the left saint are the remains of two figures with splendid clothing and imperial footwear, above its counterpart another person can be noticed. A two-lined inscription is written on the first archivolt of the door. The illustration in the northern lunette is lost, but the geometrical and floral patterns around it are exceptionally well preserved. The first arc of the southern lunette shows brick imitations, while the central panel is decorated with the Deesis, enriched by George. To the right of the door are light traces of figures on a smaller scale, divided into four registers. =Interior= Exhibition on the frescos of the monastery at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in 2018 The interior is covered with frescos from top to bottom, divided into three to five registers. Marble imitation is used for the lowest one, whereas the second stripe is filled with saints who are also depicted on the door lintels. The figures are usually arranged in a group of three people, for example Pantaleon, Cosmas and Damian. Constantine the Great and his mother Helena, a typical image in many churches, are portrayed on the southern wall. The most important female martyrs are represented by Thecla, Petka, Theodora, Barbara, Kyriaki and Catherine on the western wall, while Euphrosynus and the nursing Anne, mother of Mary, count as two of the oldest representations at all. A significant figure of the Christian mission is embodied by Saint Clement, whereas Cyril and Methodius stand for patrons of the Byzantine-Slavic culture. The cycle of Christ in the register above starts at the triumphal arch with the Annunciation. Gabriel is constituted on the left side of the conch, Mary on its right. The sequence continues on the southern wall: Visitation, conversation between Mary and Elizabeth, Nativity, Presentation at the Temple, Baptism and Raising of Lazarus. The passion is introduced on the western wall by the Entry into Jerusalem, followed by the Transfiguration, which is normally depicted after the Baptism. Entry and Transfiguration are interrupted by the Dormition above the western entrance. The cycle follows up on the northern wall: Crucifixion, Descent from the Cross, Entombment, Women at the tomb and Harrowing of Hell. The series ends with the Ascension on the eastern gable zone. Its counterpart shows the Pentecost. Below is a depiction of the Theophany, using the full width of the wall. Two monumental icons of Christ and George facing each other are portrayed at the first elevation of the floor. Thirty prophets, who are announcing the coming of Christ, are depicted in the fourth register, but only on the lateral walls. Two figures to the far east of the masonry wear the same imperial footwear as the persons on the western facade. The conch of the apse is framed by ornaments and an inscription, showing in its centre the enthroned Mary with the Christ Child on her lap, flanked by Michael and Gabriel. Below are eight church fathers walking towards the newborn Christ, who is lying on an altar for his ritual sacrifice. This image is shown here for the first time in Byzantine art and therefore contributing to the development of the variety of scenes. The theme came up because of the since the second half of the 11th century existing discussion in Constantinople about the eucharistical sacrifice and is portrayed again and again until the Middle Ages. Some door lintels and window frames have a decoration reminding of marble. A similar presentation could have been used for the altar and the throne. The iconographic program is normally used in churches with a dome. Since the building in Kurbinovo is only covered by a gable roof, the representations had to be adjusted to the room. This can be seen in the prophets, who are usually depicted in the tambour, now portrayed on the upper lateral walls, or the Theophany in the fourth register of the western wall. =Painters and style= The frescoes in the church are considered one of the best known Byzantine paintings of the Macedonian Renaissance. It seems that at least three painters were responsible for the iconographic program, but their identities remain unknown. However a difference in their skills can be noticed. The ablest one portrayed the icons of Christ and George as well as the scenes on the upper eastern wall. The second artist painted the lateral walls, whereas the most ungifted created the illustrations on the western wall, the lower zone of the eastern and a part of the northern wall. It is assumed that local artists have participated in the project and that the masters decorated the church of the saints Cosmas and Damian in the not far away situated settlement Kastoria in 1180. The style of the frescos is that of the last development phase of komnenian art, but small deviations of the regular strict symmetry can be registered in the church of Kurbinovo. More features of the painters become noticeable in the lengthened bodies and the blankness of the faces. Instead the restless drapery of the clothing is used to express the emotional life of the figures with exception of the most ungifted painter who shows the grief about the passing of the Mother of God openly on the faces of the participants. State of preservation and alterations The frescos in the church's interior have lost its colour intensity, except those on the eastern wall. The first zone with marble imitation is gone between the throne and the southern door. Humidity has destroyed almost all holy figures on the southern wall, because this one is not protected by a slope like its counterpart. Not being part of the original decoration is the rider saint Demetrius on the northern door soffit. He is dated to the end of the 16th or the beginning of the 17th century. Dated to the latter century are also the paintings on the southern facade (except the ones in the lunette), but according to M. Milijković-Pepek they belong into the 14th century. Shortly before the middle of the 19th century, a fire has damaged the church, in particular the southern wall. As a result, its porch was also destroyed. The following restoration in the year 1847 brought some unfortunate alterations, for example the damaging of the frescos in the upper parts of the church as the wooden ceiling was replaced, the bricking-up of the lateral doors, the addition of a porch at the western facade as well as the installation of two rectangular windows in the southern wall. The initial iconostasis was replaced by a new one and the frescos on the western facade got painted over with three rider saints. Further conservation work was carried out in the first half of the 20th century. Later additions like the porch at the western wall were removed. In 1958, the following work was performed: removal of the ceiling and raising of the walls by 50 cm, opening of the lateral doors and renewal of the elevations of the floor. Furthermore, the paintings were cleared and restored as well as the original rider saints on the western facade uncovered.

These towers were built to a standard design and made of precast concrete sections and referred to by the abbreviations \\"BT 4x4\\", \\"BT 9\\" or \\"BT 11\\" - the older Type 11 was cylindrical; the later Type 9 had a square floor plan, as did the Type 4x4. These numbers referred either to the height of the tower (e.g. 9 or 11 metres) or its floor plan (e.g. 4 x 4 metres). They varied in height depending on local circumstances and were accessed through a steel door that was usually hidden from the direction of the border. Offset metal ladders led via two or three intermediate corrugated steel floors to the top. The main observation deck was equipped with seating, rifle racks, an air filter system, signaling equipment, log book, mapping material, dedicated communications to the border reporting net, electric heating and emergency and rescue equipment including abseiling kit. It had room for 4-5 soldiers who, usually, formed the \\"Warning Group\\" (Alarmgruppe). The roof terrace was protected by a steel pipe railing and could be accessed through a lockable, airtight steel hatch. On the roof was a movable, remotely operated searchlight (elevation -/+ 90 degrees, azimuth 360 degrees). The BT 4x4 was characterized by its square shape with dimensions of 4 by 4 meters, as opposed to the type (BT-9) with its more slender dimensions of 2 x 2 meters. The other visual key difference between the two types are the windows on the top floor: The windows of the BT 4x4 do not run the full width of the tower whereas the windows in the BT-9 do. Other common abbreviations for the BT 4x4 are BTv 4x4 (\\"Beobachtungsturm viereckig, 4x4\\") or FüSt (\\"Führungsstelle\\"). The tower has the following levels: * Basement * Ground floor with arrest cells * 1st floor with sleeping compartments for a half squad, with two small windows per side, suitable as a loophole * 2nd floor with observation platform, and alarm and signalling equipment.

The idea of sending of a message, through a messenger, from one person to another is not to be found wanting in the Hindu epics but it was taken up as an independent theme for a poem firstly by Ghatakarpara and later on by Kalidasa, Dhoyi, Udaya, Bhavabhuti and many other poets of note. Sandesha Kavya (IAST: sandeśa- kāvya) belongs to the category of Khandakavya. Overview In Sanskrit language, sandeśa (संदेश) means \\"message\\", and kāvya (काव्य) means \\"poem\\" or \\"poetry\\". Sandesha kavya deals with the sending of a message through the agency of a messenger. The idea of sending a message through a messenger is old and familiar in literature. There is practically no story. Arrangement of content Sandeśa kāvyas are always in two parts; in the first part, the hero is presented, there appears the messenger and the route to the destination is described. The second part includes the destination, the house of the heroine, the heroine and her state of grief in separation, the message describing the hero’s own condition and a word of solace, with an identification mark mentioning some incident the hero and the heroine could know, to assure that the messenger is genuine. The messenger can be anyone – a person, a bird, a bee or a cloud or wind, and that messenger provides very interesting descriptions of cities en route with palaces and temples, pubs and parks, theatres, mansions and streets; the country parts and forests, hills and rivers, animals and birds, trees, creepers and flowers, cultivated fields and peasant girls, artisans. Love in separation is the chief emotion depicted in this type of lyrical poetry and there is certain individuality in the treatment of the theme; this type of poetry is not found in any other literature. Mandākrāntā metre The metre used is known as Mandākrāntā which is slow-moving and consists of pada of four lines each, with each line of seventeen syllables as in Kālidāsa's poem Meghadūta Stanza 15: :रत्नच्छायाव्यतिकर इव प्रेक्ष्यमेमत् पुरुस्ताद् वल्मीकाग्रात् प्रभवति धनुष्खण्डमाखण्डलस्य  :येन श्यामं वपुरतितरां कान्तिमापत्स्यते ते बर्हेणेव स्फुरितरुचीना गोपवेशस्य विष्णोः १५ : : : : : – – – –  u u u u u –  – u – – u – x  :\\"Like the blending of tints in the jewels, to the Eastward, at the top of the mountain of Valmīkā, will appear a portion of a bow of Akhandala (Indra), by means of which thy dark blue body will gain excessive beauty, like that of the Shepherd clad Vishnu (Lord Krishna) from peacock’s tail, which possesses glittering beauty.\\" Ghatakarpara’s Sandesha Kavya The fore-runner of Sandesha Kavya is a small poem bearing the title - \\"Poem of the Broken-jug\\" which is a poem by Ghatakarpara on the message sent to the husband by a wife who was in grief on account of separation; it deals with the lamentation of the abandoned wife who does not address her lamentation to one person alone but to the monsoon clouds, her confidante, her distant husband and some trees but none of them entrusted with the task of carrying her message. The poem is of twenty-four stanzas in five different metres. Even though nothing is known about the poet except his name which stands mentioned at the very end of the poem but he is believed to be contemporary of Kalidasa and one of the Nine Gems in the court of Vikramāditya, though he does not reach the lofty, subtle, romantic height of Kalidasa. Abhinavagupta holds the view that this poem was actually written by Kalidasa, and has written a commentary on it, but the construction etc., of the poem indicates that Kalidasa did not write this poem. Eminent Sandesha kavyas In Kalidasa’s Meghadūta, the messenger is the cloud, in Dohyi’s Pavandūta, the messenger is the wind, in Udaya’s Mayurasandeśa, the messenger is the peacock. Bhavabhuti used this metre for Act IX 25-26 of his Mālatīmādhava in which the abandoned Mādhava searching for a cloud to take his message to Mālatī speaks in Mandākrāntā metre. These apart, there is the message sent by a devotee to the Lord described in Hamsasandeśa of Venkatanātha Vedāntadeśika, and the message from the wife to husband in Cakorasandeśa of Vāsudeva of Payyur. The methodology employed by Kalidāsa in the construction of his Meghadūta, a lyric in a little over one hundred verses that personifies objects of Nature and describes Nature with all its beauties and glories, has been imitated by later Sanskrit poets. Sandesha Kavyas are found written in many other Indian languages. Unnuneeli Sandesham, one of the oldest literary works in Malayalam language is composed as a Sandesha Kavya.Dr. K.

These towers were 25 metres high, their roofs were equipped with a host of antennas and were painted green. Several had wooden cladding. In the second half of the 1950s, the Central Committee (ZK) of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) began building its own communications system, the Richtfunknetz der Partei (RFN) which was totally independent of all other communication networks. There were two levels of network: * Network Level 1: a network of microwave links from the ZK in Berlin to all SED provincial headquarters and * Network Level 2: from the provincial HQs to all county HQs. Their construction was prompted by the events of the popular uprising in East Germany on 17 June 1953. In all provinces of the GDR, apart from the urban conurbations, microwave communication centres (BzRFuZ) were established, initially in old barracks and, later, in the towers. All BzRFuZ were given the designation \\"A1\\" prefixed by the respective provincial code number, for example, the Totenstein near Karl-Marx-Stadt was designated as 14A1. In the mid-1960s, the NVA joined the system with their own narrowband radio relay network. Both systems were only communication networks over which telephone and teleprinter circuits were operated. The towers in these networks were not used for surveillance. Due to electronic eavesdropping of these networks by communications intelligence elements of the Bundeswehr and other NATO forces during the 1960s, the use of both networks was technically very restricted. The special radio service of the Stasi may have used the same towers for training purposes. The area around the A towers of the narrowband radio relay network was a military out-of- bounds area and was guarded against unauthorized access. Trespassing and the taking of photographs were punishable. After the Wende the buildings were initially taken over by the Federal Ministry of Post and Telecommunications. Some of them were used by providers of mobile networks. Later they were developed or converted but continued to be used as telecommunications facilities.

Instead of completely controlling a network node as in a man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker only has regular access to the communication channel, which allows him to read the traffic and insert new messages, but not to modify or delete messages sent by other participants. The attacker relies on a timing advantage to make sure that the response he sends to the request of a victim arrives before the legitimate response. In real-world attacks, the response packet sent by the attacker can be used to place malware on the victim's computer. The need for a timing advantage makes the attack difficult to execute, as it requires a privileged position in the network, for example on the internet backbone. Potentially, this class of attack may be performed within a local network (assuming a privileged position), research has shown that it has been successful within critical infrastructure. The 2013 global surveillance revelations revealed that the US National Security Agency (NSA) widely uses a man-on-the-side attack to infect targets with malware through its QUANTUM program.

The small wood frame building was built in 1837, and served as a schoolhouse until 1893, when it was closed due to declining enrollments. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. It is now owned by the Andover Historical Society, and is occasionally open to the public in the summer. Description and history The Tucker Mountain Schoolhouse stands in a remote rural area of eastern Andover, north of the village of East Andover. It is on the east side of Tucker Mountain Road, near its northern end. It is a wooded post-and-beam structure, covered by a gabled roof and set on an unmortared fieldstone foundation. The classroom is wide and long. A small ell was added to the building to provide a weather break, a place to store firewood, and a privy area. The interior of the school has retained its furnishings: the desks are bolted to the floor, which slopes slightly to afford students in the rear a better view of the front of room. The interior walls are finished in pine boards painted black, which served as chalkboards. The building exterior is finished in wooden clapboards. The school was built in 1837 by Benjamin Tucker for $100, on land donated by his brother William. It served the families of the local mountain area until 1893, when it was closed due to declining enrollments. It was acquired by a nearby resident in the 1960s and donated to the local historical society. It is open to the public some Sundays in the summer, or by appointment.

History Originally Geyen was called villa Gegina in 962 AD. Politically Geyen belonged to the office of Bergheim and to the duchy of Jülich. 1794 French troops occupied Geyen, which meant it belonged to the Arrondissement de Cologne in the Département de la Roer. After that Geyen came to belong to the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. In recent times Geyen belonged to Pulheim (1956), then to Brauweiler (1964) and then since 1975 it belongs to Pulheim again. Traffic Today Geyen is avoided by a bypass. The next trainstation is located in Pulheim, where the B59 road runs through as well. The motorways A57 and A1 are very close by. Sights *The castle of Geyen - It is first mentioned in a document of 1337 and 1434 it belonged to the mayor family Judde. Originally it was surrounded completely by water, but now there is only water on one side of it. After it burned in 1664 the castle was rebuilt with bricks in baroque style. This has mainly remained until now. *The catholic church - It was built 1893 by Theodor Roß in Neo-Gothic style and replaced by a medieval church. *Chapel *The stream of Pulheim - Pulheimer Bach - was renatured in 2010 to bring it back into its original style.

Tuttle House is a historic house at 12 Gabby Lane in Concord, New Hampshire. Built in 1933, it is a well-preserved example of a modest Cape- style house with Colonial Revival features. It is historically significant for its association with Donald D. Tuttle, who pioneered the promotion of alpine skiing in the state. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. The house was moved from its original location on Pleasant Street in 2009, in order make way for a road project. Description and history The Donald D. Tuttle House stands in a small residential subdivision in southern Concord, on the south side of Gabby Lane east of South Street. It is a 1½-story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by sidelight windows and pilasters, and topped by a corniced entablature. A small gabled section protrudes on the left side, and the rear roof face is largely extended by a wide shed-roof dormer. A garage stands to the left of the house. This modest house was built in 1933 by Louis and Frank Blake. The house is most significant as the home of Donald D. Tuttle from 1935 to 1945. Tuttle was hired by the state in 1925 as its publicity director, heading a department that over time became the State Planning and Development Commission. He was a leader in promoting tourism in the state, in particular downhill skiing. Due in part to his efforts, the state constructed the Cannon Mountain Tramway (1934–38). The house was moved to Gabby Lane in 2009 to make way for the Langley Parkway.http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/keepers-of-the-tuttle- house?CSAuthResp=1311748254%3A0c77vkoraa8m0g0oqi33vq5kd4%3ACSUserIdCSGroupId%3Aapproved%3A2786F1B794D98D03FCF51EEDD48BBA4E&CSUserId;=94&CSGroupId;=1 See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Merrimack County, New Hampshire References Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire Category:Colonial Revival architecture in New Hampshire Category:Houses completed in 1933 Category:Houses in Concord, New Hampshire Category:National Register of Historic Places in Concord, New Hampshire ","title":"Donald D.

Osten won the award for Best Director at the 22nd Guldbagge Awards. The murder of Olof Palme, the Swedish Prime Minister, took place as Palme was walking home from the cinema after watching The Mozart Brothers in 1986. Plot The film depicts an unconventional opera director, Walter (Etienne Glaser), who is directing a production of Mozart's Don Giovanni at the Stockholm Opera. He attempts to overthrow many of the conventions of opera; he gives certain solo numbers to the opera chorus, he involves the orchestra in the acting, and he wants to fill the stage with damp earth to simulate a graveyard. The singers, the members of the orchestra, and the staff at the opera house are initially very antagonistic to his plans, especially his appeal to their eroticism as individuals. However, they reluctantly agree to do things Walter's way, and gradually come over to his point of view. Throughout the film, Mozart's ghost is glimpsed more and more frequently, at one point seen weeping with joy at the effect his work has had. The film ends with the premiere of the production being a resounding success, and the performers taking the credit for this, with the director largely forgotten.

Among a number of reforming interests, he became best known in the context of the British India Society. Life He was a son of Joseph Pease (1737–1808) and his wife Mary Richardson, and a younger brother of Edward Pease. His father was a woollen manufacturer of Darlington, as was his brother Edward Pease, and he went into the same business. Sometimes referred to as Joseph Pease of Feethams, he is often confused with his nephew Joseph Pease, the first Quaker Member of Parliament. He made his name as an India reformer, and his branch of the family supported abolitionism in the form given to it by William Lloyd Garrison. (\\"Joseph Pease of Darlington\\" may also refer to his father or nephew.) Pease opposed the Corn Laws from 1815. He was one of the founders of the Peace Society in 1817. During the 1830s he became active in involving others in \\"India reform\\", which meant here commercial solutions to driving out the use of slaves in commodity production, as well as the abolition of Indian slavery. He found in George Thompson a speaker who would propagate this line. He drew in William Allen, and by the end of the 1830s the Aborigines' Protection Society was considering the matter. The British India Society (BIS) founded in 1839 was short-lived, not surviving in activity beyond 1843, but Pease was a central figure in it. Its direction, further than support of Garrison, was to promote cotton production in India, seek allies among moderate Chartists, and oppose the divisive evangelical slant represented by the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society (BFASS). At the World Anti-Slavery Convention of 1840, Pease spoke and accused the British government of being complicit in the continuing existence of slavery in India. A supporter of the Anti-Slavery Society, he wrote tracts for it, in 1841 and 1842. He engaged Dwarkanath Tagore on the topic of his Mansion House speech of 1842, finding it too militaristic. In 1843 British legislation made slavery illegal in India. Pease and Thompson put emphasis on the BIS as an ally of the Anti-Cornlaw League, and free trade. Their slighting of the BFASS, however, undermined the international dimension of their efforts. A successful charm offensive by James Cosmo Melvill of the East India Company eventually caused Pease to soften his highly critical views of the Company. Family Pease married Elizabeth Beaumont, who died in 1824. His second wife was Anne Bradshaw, whom he married in 1831. John Beaumont Pease (1803–1873) and Elizabeth Pease Nichol were children of the first marriage.

Osten's father was a social democrat and resistance man who came to Sweden when he fled from the Nazi regime in Germany. Her parents were married in 1941 but divorced when Suzanne Osten was little. In 1963, Osten graduated from Viggbyholmsskolan, a high school with a curriculum focused on language and creative subjects, and, after this, she studied art, literature and history at Lund University where she began directing at the university theater.  Theater  Osten formed one of Sweden’s first fringe theatrical companies, Fickteatern, and began her career as a stage director there in the late 1960s. In 1971, she continued to Stockholm City Theatre, which would be her fixed point for many decades. At that venue, she became a leader in developing the political theater of that time. Together with Margareta Garpe, she wrote the play Tjejsnack [Girl talk] (1971), intended for teenaged girls. Some of the songs from that play, such as the feminist anthem Vi måste höja våra röster [We have to raise our voices] are on the record Sånger för kvinnor och män [Songs for women and men] from 1972. After this, Osten and Garpe wrote the plays Kärleksföreställningen [The love notion] (1973), Jösses flickor! Befrielsen är nära [Gee girls! Liberation is close] (1974) and Fabriksflickorna, makten och härligheten [Factory girls, the power and the glory] (1980). All of these plays have a distinct connection to the Swedish feminist organization Grupp 8. Suzanne Osten is a pioneer in developing theater for children. Throughout her career, she has advocated for art and culture for children and youth. She asserts that the child perspective is a question of power, about describing power relationships, and about seeing power from the perspective of the powerless, i.e., from an underdog perspective. A child is always more dependent on the adult since children are powerless in relation to adults. Osten has remained true to this standpoint in her writing, directing, and even casting of plays and films. In 1975, she formed Unga Klara, a branch of Stockholm City Theater for the purpose of producing theatrical performances for children and youth. Osten worked there as both stage director and artistic director until the summer of 2014 and developed a process for creating a performance. The playscript Babydrama (2006) was written by psychoanalyst and dramatist Ann-Sofie Bárány following a period of improvisation and research. This production was controversial because the intended audience was infants aged from six months. Osten had been cautioned that children this young could not comprehend a drama, but she defied critics, and, during this performance, infants, without previous theater-going knowledge, sat as a theatre audience collectively watching the play for one hour. Baby Drama is a cabaret with six actors. The narrative suggests the lived experience of the audience from conception, the time in the womb, birth, meeting with its family, and then on to a life of its own. Osten documented the reaction of the young audience in Baby Drama: A documentary film with the baby as the lens where the viewer sees infants' faces watching the performance. Osten finds this to be proof of adult significance as performers, as art distributors, and of human love for communication. She interprets the reaction of the audience as an innate need in a child for gestures, facial expressions, emotions, language, and bodies from which to learn communication. Osten’s process involves the entire theatrical company; writers, actors, technicians, mask makers, based on research and extended collaboration with audience groups. This process is influenced by Keith Johnstone’s improvisational theater. Experts outside the theater world, artists, and academic researchers are invited by Osten to contribute with their expertise to the evolutionary and improvisational process of a stage production. Osten put this method of working to the test in Baby Drama when she wanted to investigate how early an audience can be receptive to theatrical performance. = Guest stage director = Osten has been a guest director at theaters other than Unga Klara and in genres other than children's theater. These productions include the operetta Glada Änkan (The Merry Widow) at Folkoperan in 2008, and popular productions at Gothenburg City Theatre, such as Publiken [The Public] by Federico García Lorca and I Annas Garderob [In Anna’s closet] by Ann-Sofie Bárány, inspired by the life and work of Anna Freud. In 2014, Osten directed a major Nordic theatrical collaboration involving artists from Iceland, Finland, and Sweden. Magnus Maria: An opera about the right gender is about Mary Johansdotter / Magnus Johansson, whose destiny begins in the late 17th century in Föglö in Åland and ends a few decades later in Stockholm. The opera premiered in Mariestad, Åland, and toured the Nordic countries.  Film  Osten went from the stage to film with two films made for television; Moa, Östen och Stella [Moa Östen and Stella] (screenplay;1974) and Barn i Afrika [Children in Africa] (director; 1978), before she debuted with the full-length feature film Mamma (1982). Like her stage productions, her films also deal with political issues, for instance Skyddsängeln (The Guardian Angel) (1990) which focuses on political terrorism, although based on riots and demands for democracy in early 20th century Sweden. Tala! Det är så mörkt, (Speak up! It’s so dark) is about the wave of neo-Nazism that swept through Sweden in the 1980s and 90s and its link to unemployment among Swedish young people. For Bröderna Mozart (The Mozart brothers) (1986), Osten was awarded a Guldbagge in 1987 for Best Director. Outside of Sweden, The Guardian Angel, was selected for Un Certain Regard at the Cannes Film Festival in 1990. = Children’s Film Ambassador = In November, 2014, Osten was appointed Sweden’s first Children’s Film Ambassador by the Swedish Film Institute. In this role, Osten is to work for the development of film for children in the country. This position began in 2015.  Controversy The film The Girl, the Mother and the Demons (2016) was written and directed by Osten based on her fictionalized autobiography, Flickan, mamman och soporna [The Girl, the mother and the rubbish] (1998), which was revised for the stage by Erik Uddenberg with the same title. The film, with the release date April 2016, was shot for the age of 11 years and up. However, the Swedish censor rated it from 15 years and up in March 2016. The film had already been screened for selected families in Sweden and marketing was in progress when this decision was made. Osten's colleagues initiated a protest, and the rating decision was appealed successfully. In an article in Svenska Dagbladet, the authors maintained that by denying children the right to see the movie, the Swedish censor demonstrates contempt for children and manifests the conservative winds blowing in Sweden in 2016.

They were typical many British companies who proceeded from bicycle manufacture to motorised bicycles, a change made possible by engine and geared hub suppliers.  Origins  James Hazlewood started making bicycles at Bishopsgate Green, Foleshill in Coventry from 1876 as The Hazlewood Cycle Company. In 1888 John Warman (who was manufacturing 'Rival', 'Albion', and 'Triumph' bicycles and tricycles as Warman & Co at Albion Mills) joined forces to form Warman & Hazlewood. This new company produced bicycles under the 'Albion' and 'Rival' names at Albion Mills. John Warman left the business in 1895, emigrating to America, and other members of the Hazlewood family had joined the business, which was renamed Hazlewoods Ltd. In about 1905 the business started making sidecars for motorcycles.  Motorcycles  1912 Hazlewood motorcycle with a four-stroke single cylinder JAP engine In 1911 they launched their own Hazlewood motorcycle built in Albion Mills, West Orchard, Coventry. There were different engine options, all of them using single cylinder or V-twin engines supplied by J.A. Prestwich (J.A.P.). The most popular model used the J.A.P. 5-6 horsepower V-twin engine (70 mm bore, 85 mm stroke). This type of engine being supplied by J.A. Prestwich to several manufacturers as being well suited to sidecar work (but also providing a powerful solo motorcycle). The smaller capacity motorcycles included one of 300 cc, of which one example survives from 1912. Gearing was provided by a three speed Armstrong rear hub, similar to the three speed hub gear used on their bicycles, which they continued to build. In mid-1914 they updated the motorcycle design by adding a three-speed 'countershaft' gearbox complete with integral kick-start.\\"A New Model Hazlewood\\", Motor Cycle magazine, 30 July 1914, p161 Although Sturmey-Archer were offering a 3-speed countershaft gearbox with integral kick-start from this date, it is not clear that the one used by Hazlewood was a Sturmey-Archer product. The new gearbox required the addition of an extra down-tube at the rear of the frame. The company offered a service to existing owners to retrofit this to their machines, so earlier examples may be found with the three speed gearbox. Later in 1914 they launched a middleweight single cylinder motorcycle again using a J.A.P. engine, this time of 90 mm bore, 93 mm stroke (592 cc) rated at 4 horsepower.\\"A Single-Cylinder Hazlewood\\", Motor Cycle magazine, 20 November 1914, p599 This used similar cycle parts to the V-twin including the three speed gearbox. A smaller engined machine with a 2- horsepower J.A.P. engine continued to be available, this using a Sturmey- Archer 3-speed hub (Sturmey-Archer bought the Armstrong-Triplex Three Speed Company from the New Hudson Cycle Company in 1914). During the 1914-1918 war Hazlewoods had to suspend motorcycle production \\"being engaged in munitions of war\\".Motor Cycle, 6 July 1916 A 1922 V-twin example of the motorcycle complete with sidecar is on display at the Coventry Transport Museum. From an advert of the period the engines sizes available in 1922 for the sidecars were 770 cc or 976 cc. The company continued to make smaller motorcycles, including 292 cc and 346 cc solo machines, all using J.A.P. engines. These later examples could be had with rear chain drive (instead of belt drive). Hazlewoods displayed motorcycles at the Olympia Motorcycle Show at the end of 1922, however production ceased around 1923-1924. A new company was formed in 1926, \\"The New Hazlewood Cycle Co.\\", however this was short-lived and failed in 1928.

The company's first products were wireless communication devices, mica-condensers, and paper-condensers. Five years later the company expanded their product line by adding dynamo bicycle lamps to their products. In the 1950s the company started producing home electric appliances, refrigerated showcases and mini-motors. In 1961 production of juice vending machines is established and one year later, in August 1962, the company is listed on the second section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The 1970s brought the introduction of automotive products to the product line, namely automotive air-conditioners and SD compressors for automotive air- conditioners. In August 1973 the \\"Sanden\\" trade name is established and the company's stocks are listed on the first section of the aforementioned stock exchange. Also in this decade the company established several subsidiaries, namely in the United States, Singapore and Australia and a branch in Great Britain. In October 1982 the company's name is changed, Sankyo Electric Co., Ltd. becoming Sanden Corporation. In 1984 the company expanded their global presence by establishing joint ventures in India, Malaysia, and Mexico (Sanden Mexicana). Four years later Sanden acquired Vendo Company, a US-based vending machine manufacturer. In the 1990s the company started to develop energy- saving, ozone layer friendly products. Also it developed Technical Assistance Agreement with major automakers like Ford Motor Company and General Motors Company and expanded its manufacturing capabilities by opening manufacturing plants in France and Thailand. In 2012 also Sanden Manufacturing Mexico was founded. In November 1999 the founder of the company, Kaihei Ushikubo, died. Focusing on environmentally friendly manufacturing, the company achieved zero- emission at three domestic plants (Kotobuki, Yattajima, and Sakai plants). In 2001 Sanden achieved the production of the accumulated number of 100 million compressor units and in May 2006 received the \\"2005 Supplier of the year\\" from General Motors and the \\"Global Excellence Award\\" from Ford Motors. Also in 2005 Sanden signed a comprehensive agreement with Waseda University's Environmental Research Institute, to promote environmental technology development in business-academia collaboration.

The history of bisexuality is divided into two parts, pre-modern history and contemporary history. The ancient and medieval history of bisexuality consists of anecdotes of sexual behaviors and relationships between people of the same sex and of different sexes. The modern definition of bisexuality started to take form in the 19th century. Today, the term bisexual is defined as a person who is sexually and/or romantically attracted to both males and females, or as a person who is sexually and/or romantically attracted to people of any sex or gender identity, which is sometimes termed pansexuality. The first English-language use of the word \\"bisexual\\", in the sense of being sexually attracted to both women and men, was by the American neurologist Charles Gilbert Chaddock in his 1892 translation of the 7th edition of Krafft-Ebing's seminal work Psychopathia Sexualis. Prior to Krafft- Ebing, \\"bisexual\\" was usually used to mean having both female and male parts as in hermaphroditic or monoicous plants, or to mean inclusive of both males and females as in the sense of mixed-sex education. Beginning from the 1970s, bisexuality as a distinct sexuality gained visibility in Western literature, academia, and activism. Although there is a surge of research and activism in bisexuality, many scholars and activists state that bisexuals have often been marginalized in literature, films, and research works. Societal attitudes towards bisexuality vary across culture and history; however, there is no substantive evidence showing that the rate of same-sex attraction has varied much. Before the contemporary discussion of sexuality as associated with personal identity, the ancient and medieval culture viewed bisexuality as the experience of both same-sex and heterosexual relationships. The cultures of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome believed that it was socially acceptable for adult men to be involved in same-sex relationships, as long as they took the penetrative role.  Ancient history  The question of precisely how cultures through history conceptualized bisexual desire and behavior is a matter of some debate. The author has made adapted and expanded portions of this book available online as A Critique of Social Constructionism and Postmodern Queer Theory. Same sex relations between men are typically more recorded compared to women in literature and historical texts. However, sexual relations between women were also recorded in literatures in Ancient China. =Ancient Greece= Young man and teenager engaging in intercrural sex, fragment of a black-figure Attic cup, 550 BC–525 BC, Louvre. Ancient Greek religious texts, reflecting cultural practices, incorporated bisexual themes. The subtexts varied, from the mystical to the didactic. Same sex relationships between boys and men as a part of rituals in pre-city Greece were researched and confirmed by scholars. The sexual and romantic relationship between males were not recorded explicitly by Iliad or Odyssey. =Ancient Rome= It was socially acceptable for a freeborn Roman man to want sex with both female and male partners, as long as he took the penetrative role.Amy Richlin, The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), p. 225. The morality of the behavior depended on the social standing of the partner, not his sex per se. Both women and young men were considered acceptable objects of desire, but outside marriage a man was supposed to act on his desires only with slaves, prostitutes (who were often slaves), and the infames. Sex did not determine whether a man's sexual partner was acceptable, but it was considered immoral to have sex with another freeborn man's wife, his marriageable daughter, his underage son, or with the man himself; sexual use of another man's slave was subject to the owner's permission. Lack of self-control, including in managing one's sex life, indicated that a man was incapable of governing others; too much indulgence in \\"low sensual pleasure\\" threatened to erode the elite male's identity as a cultured person.Catharine Edwards, \\"Unspeakable Professions: Public Performance and Prostitution in Ancient Rome,\\" in Roman Sexualities, pp. 67–68. = Ancient Japan = Shudo: a young male entertains an older male lover, covering his eyes while surreptitiously kissing a female servant. Records of men who have sex with men in Japan date back to ancient times. There were few laws restricting sexual behavior in Japan before the early modern period. Anal sodomy was restricted by legal prohibition in 1872, but the provision was repealed only seven years later by the Penal Code of 1880 in accordance with the Napoleonic Code. Historical practices identified by scholars as homosexual include shudō (衆道), wakashudō (若衆道) and nanshoku (男色). Several writers have noted a strong historical tradition of open bisexuality and homosexuality among male Buddhist institutions in Japan. When the Tendai priest Genshin harshly criticised homosexuality as immoral, others mistook his criticism as having been because the acolyte wasn't one's own.Leupp, Gary (1995). Male Colors: The Construction of Homosexuality in Tokugawa Japan. p. 31Faure, Bernard (1998). The Red Thread: Buddhist approaches to sexuality p. 209 A wakashū (wearing headscarf) sneaks a kiss from a female prostitute behind his patron's back. Nishikawa Sukenobu, ca. 1716–1735. Hand-colored shunga print. These activities were the subject of countless literary works, most of which remain to be translated. However, English translations are available for Ihara Saikaku who created a bisexual main character in The Life of An Amorous Man (1682), Jippensha Ikku who created an initial gay relationship in the post-publication \\"Preface\\" to Shank's Mare (1802 et seq), and Ueda Akinari who had a homosexual Buddhist monk in Tales of Moonlight and Rain (1776). Likewise, many of the greatest artists of the period, such as Hokusai and Hiroshige, prided themselves in documenting such loves in their prints, known as ukiyo-e, pictures of the floating world, and where they had an erotic tone, shunga, or pictures of spring. Nanshoku was not considered incompatible with heterosexuality; books of erotic prints dedicated to nanshoku often presented erotic images of both young women (concubines, mekake, or prostitutes, jōrō) as well as attractive adolescent boys (wakashū) and cross-dressing youths (onnagata). Likewise, women were considered to be particularly attracted to both wakashū and onnagata, and it was assumed that these young men would reciprocate that interest. Therefore, both the typical practitioners of nanshoku and the young men they desired would be considered bisexual in modern terminology. =Ancient China= In Ancient China, there are many historical records about same sex relationships between upper-class people. The writings on sexuality in literature and historical records in ancient China are often allusive and implied, using phrases and words only recognizable for people who are familiar with the literary culture and background. Words like \\"Long Yang (龙阳 lóngyáng)\\" and \\"male trend (男風; nánfēng)\\" are created to describe men who are engaged in a sexual or romantic relationship with men. Although women's same sex relationships are less recorded compared to men's, some researchers believe that societal attitude towards same sex relationship between women are more stable coompared to that of men's. People who engage in sexual or romantic relationships with the same sex typically also engage in heterosexual relationship. For example, emperors who have male concubines also have female concubines and offsprings. In addition, the concept of sexual identity was not present in ancient China before Western's introduction of the idea. One example that produced the word that describes a homosexual relationship - Duànxiù, or \\"breaking the sleeve\\" - happened between the Han Emperor Ai and his male lover Dong Xian (董賢). Emperor Ai was so devoted to his male lover that he attempted to pass the throne on to him. When Emperor Ai had to leave early in the morning, the Emperor carefully cut off his sleeve, not to wake up Dongxian, who had fallen asleep on top of it. People in China will imitate the cutting of sleeves to express their love to same sex lovers. One of the most well-known historical stories about same sex relationships in ancient China is the story of \\"YuTao (余桃 yútáo)\\", the \\"leftover peach\\" is documented in the Intrigues of the Warring States. The book is a collection of political idioms and historical stories written by Han Fei (280 - 233 BC), a Chinese philosopher. Han Fei recorded this story between Mi Zixia (彌子瑕) and Duke Ling of Wei (衛靈公). His male lover Mi found a very sweet peach in the garden; after tasting it, he shared the remaining half with Emperor Ling. As more Western and Central Asian visitors came to China during the Tang Dynasty, China became increasingly influenced by the sexual moral conduct of foreigners. Female companions of emperors began accumulating political power which only male companions could gain in the past. Same-sex relationships became more allusive and less recorded in the Tang Dynasty. From the beginning of the Tang Dynasty, stories about female same-sex companions between Buddhist and Taoist nuns were first discovered. Modern history According to Dutch anthropologist Gert Hekma, the term bisexual was used in Dutch for the first time in 1877, to refer to a hermaphrodite who had their sexual career as both a heterosexual woman and a heterosexual man. Later, the term bisexuality is used to represent both the double sexual-object choice and androgyny. Since the 19th century, bisexuality became a term with at least three different yet interconnected meanings. In the field of biology and anatomy, it referred to biological organisms that are sexually undifferentiated between male and female. By the early 20th century, in the field of psychology, bisexuality is used to describe a combination of masculinity and femininity in people psychologically instead of biologically. In the late 20th century, particularly since the AIDS epidemic, bisexuality is seen as sexual attraction to both male and female. Therefore, the contemporary history of bisexuality involved many intellectual, conceptual and sociocultural changes. = Freudian theory = In 1905, Sigmund Freud presented his theory of psychosexual development in Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality. In the book, he argued that bisexuality was the baseline sexual orientation for humans. Freud established his theory on a biological development basis that in the pregenital phase, children do not distinguish between sexes, but assume both parents have the same genitalia and reproductive powers. When children reach the phallic stage, at which point gender identity became ascertainable, heterosexuality becomes the result of repression. According to Freud, during this stage, children developed an Oedipus complex where they had sexual fantasies for the parent ascribed the opposite gender and hatred for the parent ascribed the same gender, and this hatred transformed into (unconscious) transference and (conscious) identification with the hated parent who both exemplified a model to appease sexual impulses and threatened to castrate the child's power to appease sexual impulses.Myers, David G. (2008). Psychology. New York: Worth. In 1913, Carl Jung proposed the Electra complex as he both believed that bisexuality did not lie at the origin of psychic life, and that Freud did not give adequate description to the female child (Freud rejected this suggestion). = Kinsey reports = In 1948, American biologist Alfred C. Kinsey, who was himself bisexual, published two books on human sexual behaviors, Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, which are widely known as the \\"Kinsey reports\\". Kinsey and his team conducted 1,600 interviews with people about their sexual histories. Kinsey rejected the notion of a clear-cut line between different sexualities. Instead of assigning people to different categories of sexualities, Kinsey and his colleagues developed a seven-level Kinsey scale. The scale considered people between K=1 and K=5 as \\"ambisexual\\" or \\"bisexual\\". According to the Kinsey Institute, the books Kinsey published sold nearly a million copies around the world and were influential in revolutionizing the public perception of sexuality. Their research found that 11.6% of white males in United States (ages 20–35) had about equal heterosexual and homosexual experience/response throughout their adult lives, and that 7% of single females (ages 20–35) and 4% of previously married females (ages 20–35) had about equal heterosexual and homosexual experience/response for this period of their lives.Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, Table 142, p. 499Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, Table 147, p. 651 As a result of this research, the earlier meanings of the word \\"bisexual\\" were largely displaced by the meaning of being attracted to both sexes. However, Kinsey himself disliked the use of the term bisexual to describe individuals who engage in sexual activity with both sexes, preferring to use \\"bisexual\\" in its original, biological sense as hermaphroditic, and saying, \\"Until it is demonstrated [that] taste in a sexual relation is dependent upon the individual containing within his [sic] anatomy both male and female structures, or male and female physiological capacities, it is unfortunate to call such individuals bisexual\\". = In the United States = 1850 to 1950 Blues singer Bessie Smith had relationships with both men and women (photo by Carl Van Vechten). The first English-language use of the word \\"bisexual\\", in the sense of being sexually attracted to both women and men, was by the American neurologist Charles Gilbert Chaddock in his 1892 translation of the same term used in the same way in the 7th edition of Krafft-Ebing's seminal work Psychopathia Sexualis. Prior to Krafft-Ebing, \\"bisexual\\" was usually used to mean having both female and male parts as in hermaphroditic or monoicous plants, or to mean inclusive of both males and females as in the sense of mixed-sex education. Under any label, openly bisexual people were rare in early American life. One notable exception was the openly bisexual poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, who received the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry for The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver in 1923.Pulitzer site Retrieved December 9, 2010 Furthermore, the poet Walt Whitman is usually described by biographers as either bisexual or homosexual in his feelings and attractions. Early film, being a cutting-edge medium, also provided opportunity for bisexuality to be expressed. In 1914 the first documented appearance of bisexual characters (female and male) in an American motion picture occurred in A Florida Enchantment, by Sidney Drew. However, due to the censorship legally required by the Hays Code, the word bisexual could not be mentioned and almost no bisexual characters appeared in American film from 1934 until 1968. 1960s LGBT political activism became more prominent in this decade. The first public protests for equal rights for gay and lesbian people were staged at governmental offices and historic landmarks in New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. between 1965 and 1969.LGBT Civil Rights, UW Madison . Housing.wisc.edu (1969-06-28). Retrieved on 2010-11-30. In DC, protesters picketed in front of the White House, Pentagon, and the U.S. Civil Service Commission. Two of the protesters at the second White House picket, Judith \\"J.D.\\" Kuch and Kris \\"Gene\\" Kleeberg, identified themselves as bisexual. In 1966 bisexual activist Stephen Donaldson (aka Donny the Punk) founded the Student Homophile League at Columbia University and New York University. In 1967 Columbia University officially recognized this group, thus making them the first college in the United States to officially recognize a gay student group. Activism on behalf of bisexuals in particular also began to grow, especially in San Francisco. One of the earliest organizations for bisexuals, the Sexual Freedom League in San Francisco, was started by Margo Rila and Frank Esposito beginning in 1967. Two years later, during a staff meeting at a San Francisco mental health facility serving LGBT people, nurse Maggi Rubenstein came out as bisexual. Due to this, bisexuals began to be included in the facility's programs for the first time. The Stonewall Rebellion, considered the beginning of the modern LGBT rights movement, occurred at the Stonewall bar in 1969. Bar patrons, including bisexuals, stood up to the police during a raid. In commemoration of this, the next year the first LGBT pride march was held. Bisexual activist Brenda Howard is known as the \\"Mother of Pride\\", for her work in coordinating the first LGBT Pride march, and she also originated the idea for a week-long series of events around Pride Day which became the genesis of the annual LGBT Pride celebrations that are now held around the world every June.Channel 13/WNET Out! 2007: Women In the Movement The Gay Pride Issue: Picking Apart The Origin of Pride Additionally, Howard, along with the bisexual activist Robert A. Martin (aka Donny the Punk) and gay activist L. Craig Schoonmaker are credited with popularizing the word \\"Pride\\" to describe these festivities.Dynes, Wayne R. Pride (trope), Homolexis Donaldson, Stephen (1995). \\"The Bisexual Movement's Beginnings in the 70s: A Personal Retrospective\\". In Tucker, Naomi (ed.). Bisexual Politics: Theories, Queries, & Visions. New York: Harrington Park Press. pp. 31–45. . Bisexual activist Tom Limoncelli later stated, \\"The next time someone asks you why LGBT Pride marches exist or why [LGBT] Pride Month is June tell them 'A bisexual woman named Brenda Howard thought it should be.'\\"In Memoriam – Brenda Howard 1970s Bisexuals became more prominent in the media in the 1970s. In 1972 bisexual activist Don Fass founded the National Bisexual Liberation group in New York City, which issued The Bisexual Expression, most likely the earliest bisexual newsletter. In 1973 bisexual activist Woody Glenn was interviewed by a radio show of the National Organization for Women on WICC in Bridgeport, Connecticut. In 1974, both Newsweek and Time Magazine ran stories on \\"bisexual chic,\\" bringing bisexuality to mainstream attention as never before. In 1976 the landmark book View from Another Closet: Exploring Bisexuality in Women, by Janet Mode, was published. In a September 1976 interview with Playboy, androgynous glam rock musician and pop star David Bowie discussed being bisexual; his wife, Angie Bowie, was also public in her assertions of bisexuality during this time. Bisexuals were also important contributors to the larger LGBT rights movement. In 1972, Bill Beasley, a bisexual activist in the Civil Rights Movement as well as the LGBT movement, was the core organizer of the first Los Angeles Gay Pride March. He was also active with the Gay Liberation Front. In 1975, activist Carol Queen came out as bisexual and organized GAYouth in Eugene, Ore. In 1977 Alan Rockway, a psychologist and bisexual activist, co-authored America's first successful gay rights ordinance put to public vote, in Dade County, Florida. Anita Bryant campaigned against the ordinance, and Rockway began a boycott of Florida orange juice, which she advertised, in response. The San Francisco Bisexual Center also helped sponsor a press conference with lesbian activists Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon, and pediatrician Dr. Benjamin Spock, in opposition to Bryant. Bisexual activist Alexei Guren founded the Gay Teen Task Force in Miami, Fla., in response to Bryant's campaign. The Florida Citrus Commission canceled her contract as a direct response to this pressure. Also in 1979, Dr. Marvin Colter founded ARETE, a support and social group for bisexuals in Whittier, Calif., which marched in the 1983 Los Angeles Gay Pride Parade and had a newsletter. In 1979 A. Billy S. Jones, a bisexual founding member of the National Coalition of Black Lesbians and Gays, helped organize the first black gay delegation to meet with President Jimmy Carter's White House staff. Jones was also a core organizer of the 1979 National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights, and \\"Third world conference: When will the ignorance end?,\\" the first national conference for gay and lesbian people of color. The bisexual movement had its own successes as well. Most notably, in 1972 a Quaker group issued the \\"Ithaca Statement on Bisexuality\\" supporting bisexuals. The Statement, which may have been \\"the first public declaration of the bisexual movement\\" and \\"was certainly the first statement on bisexuality issued by an American religious assembly,\\" appeared in the Quaker Friends Journal and The Advocate in 1972. In 1976 Harriet Levi and Maggi Rubenstein founded the San Francisco Bisexual Center. It was the longest surviving bisexual community center, offering counseling and support services to Bay Area bisexuals, as well as publishing a newsletter, The Bi Monthly, from 1976 to 1984. In 1978, bisexual activist Dr. Fritz Klein introduced the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid in his book The bisexual option: A concept of one- hundred percent intimacy, in which he examined the incidence and nature of bisexuality, the attitudes of bisexual persons, and the rewards of bisexuality. Bisexual activism also began to spread beyond the coasts, as from 1978 until 1979, several Midwestern bisexual groups were created, such as One To Five (founded by Scott Bartell and Gary Lingen for Minneapolis/St.Paul, Minn), BI Women Welcome in Minneapolis, The BI Married Men's Group in the Detroit suburbs, and BI Ways in Chicago. 1980s In the 1980s AIDS began to affect the LGBT community, and bisexual people took an important role in combating it. In 1981 bisexual activists David Lourea and Cynthia Slater presented safer-sex education in bathhouses and BDSM clubs in San Francisco. Also in 1981, bisexual activist Alexei Guren, on the founding board of the Health Crisis Network (now CareResource) in Miami, Fla., began outreach and advocacy for Latino married men who have sex with men. In 1984, bisexual activist David Lourea finally persuaded the San Francisco Department of Public Health to recognize bisexual men in their official AIDS statistics (the weekly \\"New AIDS cases and mortality statistics\\" report), after two years of campaigning. Health departments throughout the United States began to recognize bisexual men because of this, whereas before they had mostly only recognized gay men. Bisexual activists also fought for the recognition of women in the AIDS epidemic. From 1984 until 1986, bisexual activist Veneita Porter, of the Prostitute’s Union of Massachusetts and COYOTE (Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics), advocated for women, transgender people, and injection drug users with AIDS. In 1985, HIV-Positive bisexual activist Cynthia Slater organized the first Women’s HIV/AIDS Information Switchboard. This sort of activism was particularly important for bisexuals as they were often blamed for spreading AIDS to their heterosexual partners. For example, in 1987, Newsweek portrayed bisexual men as \\"the ultimate pariahs\\" of the AIDS epidemic, and bisexual activist and person with AIDS Alan Rockway of BiPOL was quoted speaking against the stereotype. An October 1989 Cosmopolitan magazine article that stereotyped bisexual men as dishonest spreaders of AIDS led to a letter-writing campaign by the New York Area Bisexual Network (NYABN). Cosmopolitan has printed no articles defaming bisexuals since the campaign. The bisexual movement enjoyed some important firsts during the 1980s. The Boston Bisexual Women's Network, the oldest existing bisexual women's group, was founded in 1983 and began publishing their bi-monthly newsletter, BI Women. It is the longest-existing bisexual newsletter in the US. Also in 1983, BiPOL, the first and oldest bisexual political organization, was founded in San Francisco by bisexual activists Autumn Courtney, Lani Ka'ahumanu, Arlene Krantz, David Lourea, Bill Mack, Alan Rockway, and Maggi Rubenstein. In 1984, BiPOL sponsored the first bisexual rights rally, outside the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco. The rally featured nine speakers from civil rights groups allied with the bisexual movement. Also in 1984, the First East Coast Conference on Bisexuality (which was also the first regional bisexual conference in the US) was held at the Storrs School of Social Work at the University of Connecticut, with about 150 people participating. Participants in the conference then founded the East Coast Bisexual Network in 1985, which later was renamed the Bisexual Resource Center (BRC) in 1993. In 1987, the East Coast Bisexual Network established the first Bisexual History Archives with bisexual activist Robyn Ochs’ initial collection; archivist Clare Morton hosted researchers. Also in 1987, the Bay Area Bisexual Network, the oldest and largest bisexual group in the San Francisco Bay Area, was founded by Lani Ka'ahumanu, Ann Justi and Maggi Rubenstein. In 1988, Gary North published the first national bisexual newsletter, called Bisexuality: News, Views, and Networking. In 1989 Cliff Arnesen testified before the U.S. Congress on behalf of bisexual, lesbian, and gay veteran's issues. He was the first veteran to testify about bisexual, lesbian, and gay issues and the first openly non-heterosexual veteran to testify on Capitol Hill about veteran's issues in general. He testified on May 3rd, 1989, during formal hearings held before the U.S. House Committee on Veterans Affairs: Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. He also testified before the same Subcommittee on May 16, 1990, as part of an HIV/AIDS panel. Bisexual people also continued to be active in the larger LGBT movement. The first BiCon UK (a get-together in the United Kingdom for bisexuals, allies and friends) was held in 1984. In 1986 BiPOL's Autumn Courtney was elected co-chair of San Francisco's Lesbian Gay Freedom Day Pride Parade Committee; she was the first openly bisexual person to hold this sort of position in the United States. In 1987 a group of 75 bisexuals marched in the 1987 Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights, which was the first nationwide bisexual gathering. The article \\"The Bisexual Movement: Are We Visible Yet?\\", by Lani Ka'ahumanu, appeared in the official Civil Disobedience Handbook for the March. It was the first article about bisexuals and the emerging bisexual movement to be published in a national lesbian or gay publication.http://www.lanikaahumanu.com/OUT%20OUTRAGED.pdf The North American Bisexual Network, the first national bisexual organization, was first thought of at this gathering, though not founded until three years later (see below.) NABN would later change its name to BiNet USA. Also in 1987, Barney Frank became the first U.S. congressman to come out as gay of his own volition; he was inspired in part by the death of Stewart McKinney, a closeted bisexual Republican representative from Connecticut. Frank told The Washington Post that after McKinney's death there was, \\"An unfortunate debate about 'Was he or wasn't he? Didn't he or did he?' I said to myself, I don't want that to happen to me.\\" 1990s The oldest national bisexuality organization in the United States, BiNet USA, was founded in 1990. It was originally called the North American Multicultural Bisexual Network (NAMBN), and had its first meeting at the first National Bisexual Conference in America. This first conference was held in San Francisco, and sponsored by BiPOL. Bisexual health was one of eight workshop tracks at the conference, and the \\"NAMES Project\\" quilt was displayed with bisexual quilt pieces. Over 450 people attended from 20 states and 5 countries, and the mayor of San Francisco sent a proclamation \\"commending the bisexual rights community for its leadership in the cause of social justice,\\" and declaring June 23, 1990 Bisexual Pride Day. The conference also inspired attendees from Dallas to create the first bisexual group in Texas, called BiNet Dallas. The bisexual movement also became more accepted as part of established institutions. In 1990, Susan Carlton offered the first academic course on bisexuality in America at UC Berkeley, and in 1991, psychologists Sari Dworkin and Ron Fox became the founding co-chairs of the Task Force on Bisexual Issues of Division 44, the gay and lesbian group in the American Psychological Association. In 1997, bisexual activist and psychologist Pat Ashbrook pioneered a national model for LGBT support groups within the Veterans Administration hospital system. Bisexual literature became more prominent in the 1990s. In 1991, the Bay Area Bisexual Network began publishing the USA's first national bisexual quarterly magazine, Anything That Moves: Beyond The Myths Of Bisexuality, founded by Karla Rossi, who was the managing editor of the editorial collective until 1993. 1991 also saw the publication of one of the seminal books in the history of the modern bisexual rights movement, Bi Any Other Name: Bisexual People Speak Out, an anthology edited by Loraine Hutchins and Lani Ka'ahumanu. After this anthology was forced to compete (and lost) in the Lambda Literary Awards under the category Lesbian Anthology, and in 2005, Directed by Desire: Collected Poems a posthumous collection of the bisexual Jamaican American writer June Jordan's work had to compete (and won) in the category \\"Lesbian Poetry\\", BiNet USA led the bisexual community in a multi-year campaign eventually resulting in the addition of a Bisexual category, starting with the 2006 Awards. In 1995, Harvard Shakespeare professor Marjorie Garber made the academic case for bisexuality with her book Vice Versa: Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life, in which she argued that most people would be bisexual if not for \\"repression, religion, repugnance, denial, laziness, shyness, lack of opportunity, premature specialization, a failure of imagination, or a life already full to the brim with erotic experiences, albeit with only one person, or only one gender.\\" Bi Community News began publishing as a monthly print journal in the UK in 1995. In 1997, bisexual activist Dr. Fritz Klein founded the Journal of Bisexuality, the first academic, quarterly journal on bisexuality. However, other media proved more mixed in terms of representing bisexuals. In 1990, a film with a relationship between two bisexual women, called Henry and June, became the first film to receive the NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). But in 1993, bisexual activist Sheela Lambert wrote, produced, and hosted the first television series by and for bisexuals, called Bisexual Network. It aired for 13 weeks on NYC Public Access Cable. Regional organizations in the bisexual movement also began to have more impact. In 1992 the Bisexual Connection (Minnesota) sponsored the First Annual Midwest Regional Bisexual Conference, called \\"BECAUSE (Bisexual Empowerment Conference: A Uniting, Supportive Experience).\\" That year Minnesota changed its State Civil Rights Law to grant the most comprehensive civil rights protections for bisexual, lesbian, gay, and transgender people in the country. Minnesota's bisexual community had united with lesbian, gay, and transgender groups to lobby for this statute. Also in 1992, the South Florida Bisexual Network (founded in 1989) and the Florida International University's Stonewall Students Union co-sponsored the First Annual Southeast Regional Bisexual Conference. Thirty-five people from at least four southeastern states attended. In 1993 the First Annual Northwest Regional Conference was sponsored by BiNet USA, the Seattle Bisexual Women's Network, and the Seattle Bisexual Men's Union. It was held in Seattle, and fifty-five people representing Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Montana, and British Columbia attended. In the UK, BiPhoria was formed in 1994, the oldest bi organisation extant in the UK today. An important event in the LGBT rights movement in this decade was the 1993 March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation. As a result of lobbying by BiPOL (San Francisco), openly bisexual people held key leadership roles in local and regional organizing for the March, and for the first time bisexuals were included in the title of the March. Also, openly bisexual activist and author Lani Ka'ahumanu spoke at the rally, and over 1,000 people marched with the bisexual group. Coinciding with the March, BiNet USA, the Bisexual Resource Center (BRC), and the Washington, DC-based Alliance of Multicultural Bisexuals (AMBi) sponsored the Second National Conference Celebrating Bisexuality in Washington, DC. Over than 600 people attended from the US and Europe, making it at the time the largest Bisexual Conference ever held. Several important surveys concerning bisexuality were conducted around this time. In 1993, Ron Fox authored the first large scale research study on bisexual identity, and established and maintained a comprehensive bibliography on bi research. Also in 1993, The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior showed that 5 percent of men and 3 percent of women considered themselves bisexual. In 1995 BiNet USA Bisexual Youth Initiative, Fayetteville, N.C., developed and mailed a national survey to LGBT youth programs. The survey was published and sent back to agencies, offering assistance to improve services to bisexual youth. In 1992, Colorado voters approved by initiative an amendment to the Colorado state constitution (Amendment 2) that would have prevented any city, town, or county in the state from taking any legislative, executive, or judicial action to recognize bisexuals or gay people as a protected class. The amendment stated: > Neither the State of Colorado, through any of its branches or departments, > nor any of its agencies, political subdivisions, municipalities or school > districts, shall enact, adopt or enforce any statute, regulation, ordinance > or policy whereby homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, > practices or relationships shall constitute or otherwise be the basis of or > entitle any person or class of persons to have or claim any minority status, > quota preferences, protected status or claim of discrimination. This Section > of the Constitution shall be in all respects self-executing. This led to the 1996 Supreme Court Case Romer v. Evans, in which the Court ruled in a 6–3 decision that the state constitutional amendment in Colorado preventing protected status based upon bisexuality or homosexuality did not satisfy the Equal Protection Clause. The majority opinion in Romer stated that the amendment lacked \\"a rational relationship to legitimate state interests\\", and the dissent stated that the majority \\"evidently agrees that 'rational basis'—the normal test for compliance with the Equal Protection Clause—is the governing standard\\". The state constitutional amendment failed rational basis review. The concept of bisexual pride became more widespread in the late 1990s. At an LGBT PrideFest in Connecticut in 1997, Evelyn Mantilla came out as America's first openly bisexual state official. The next year, the Bisexual Pride flag was designed by Michael Page (it was unveiled on Dec 5th, 1998 ), and in 1999, the first Celebrate Bisexuality Day was organized by Michael Page, Gigi Raven Wilbur, and Wendy Curry. It is now observed every September 23. 2000-2010 Bisexual people had notable accomplishments in the LGBT rights movement at this time. In 2001, the American Psychological Association (APA)’s \\"Guidelines on psychotherapy with lesbian, gay and bisexual clients\\" stated \\"homosexuality and bisexuality are not a mental illness\\"; bisexual activist Ron Fox served on the task force that produced the guidelines. In 2002, Pete Chvany, Luigi Ferrer, James Green, Loraine Hutchins and Monica McLemore presented at the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Intersex Health Summit, held in Boulder, Colorado, marking the first time bisexual people, transgender people, and intersex people were recognized as co-equal partners on the national level rather than gay and lesbian \\"allies\\" or tokens. Also in 2002, bisexual activist Robyn Ochs delivered the first bi- focused keynote during the National Association of Lesbian and Gay Addiction Professionals. In 2003, the Union for Reform Judaism retroactively applied its pro-rights policy on gays and lesbians to the bisexual and transgender communities, issuing a resolution titled, \\"Support for the Inclusion and Acceptance of the Transgender and Bisexual Communities.\\" In 2005, bisexual scholars and activists mobilized with The Task Force, GLAAD and BiNet USA to meet with New York Times science section editor and researcher Brian Dodge to respond to misinformation the paper had published on a study about bisexual men. The study, entitled Sexual Arousal Patterns of Bisexual Men, by the researcher J. Michael Bailey, allegedly \\"proved\\" that bisexual men did not exist. With little critical examination, various media celebrities and outlets jumped on the band-wagon and claimed to have \\"solved\\" the \\"problem of bisexuality\\" by declaring it to be non-existent, at least in men. Further studies, including improved follow-up research led by Michael Bailey, proved this to be false. Also in 2005, the Queens Chapter of PFLAG announced the creation of the \\"Brenda Howard Memorial Award\\". This was the first time a major American LGBT organization named an award after an openly bisexual person. On October 11, 2009 in Washington, D.C., the National Equality March was held, calling for equal protection for bisexual, lesbian, gay, and transgender people in all matters governed by civil law in all states and districts. There was a specific bisexual, pansexual and queer-identified contingent that was organized as a part of the March. Several bisexual groups came together and marched, including BiNet USA, New York Area Bisexual Network, DC Bi Women and BiMA DC.Maria, October 15, 2009. \\"My Experience at the National Equality March\\", Bi Social Network There were also four out bisexual speakers at the National Equality March rally: Michael Huffington, Lady Gaga, Chloe Noble, and Penelope Williams. In October 2009, LGBT activist Amy Andre was appointed as executive director of the San Francisco Pride Celebration Committee, making her San Francisco Pride's first openly bisexual woman of color executive director.Adrienne Williams, October 19, 2009. Interview with Amy Andre: New Bisexual Executive Director of SF Pride , BiSocial Network. Significant reports about bisexuals were also released in this decade. In 2002, a survey in the United States by National Center for Health Statistics found that 1.8 percent of men ages 18–44 considered themselves bisexual, 2.3 percent homosexual, and 3.9 percent as \\"something else\\". The same study found that 2.8 percent of women ages 18–44 considered themselves bisexual, 1.3 percent homosexual, and 3.8 percent as \\"something else\\". A 2007 report said that 14.4% of young US women identified themselves as bisexual/lesbian, with 5.6% of the men identifying as gay or bisexual. Also in 2007, an article in the 'Health' section of The New York Times stated that \\"1.5 percent of American women and 1.7 percent of American men identify themselves [as] bisexual.\\" In 2008 Kate Brown was elected as the Oregon Secretary of State, becoming America's first openly bisexual statewide officeholder. 2010 to present In 2011, one of the demands of 2009's National Equality March was met as the \\"Don't Ask Don't Tell\\" policy was ended, allowing bisexuals, lesbians, and gay men in the U.S. military to be open about their sexuality. More important reports on bisexual people were released in the early 2010s. In 2011, San Francisco’s Human Rights Commission released a report on bisexual visibility, titled \\"Bisexual Invisibility: Impacts and Regulations.\\" This was the first time any governmental body released such a report. The report showed, among other things, that self- identified bisexuals made up the largest single population within the LGBT community in the United States. In each study included in the report, more women identified as bisexual than lesbian, though fewer men identified as bisexual than gay. Also in 2011, a longitudinal study of sexual minority women (lesbian, bisexual, and unlabeled) found that over 10 years, \\"more women adopted bisexual/unlabeled identities than relinquished them.\\" Of those who began the study identifying as bisexual, 92% identified as bisexual or unlabeled 10 years later, and 61% of those who began as unlabeled identified as bisexual or unlabeled 10 years later. In 2012, the Bisexuality Report, the first report of its kind in the United Kingdom, was issued. This report, devised by Jen Yockney (editor of Bi Community News) and led by Meg-John Barker (Senior Lecturer in Psychology, OU), Rebecca Jones (Lecturer, Health & Social Care, OU), Christina Richards, and Helen Bowes-Catton and Tracey Plowman (of BiUK) summarizes national and international evidence and brings out recommendations for bisexual inclusion in the future. It was credited with changing attitudes to bisexual inclusion in LGB work for both the UK civil service and LGBT charities. In September 2012 Berkeley, California became the first city in America to officially proclaim a day recognizing bisexuals. Alt URL The Berkeley City Council unanimously and without discussion declared Sept. 23 as Bisexual Pride and Bi Visibility Day. In 2013 on Bisexual Pride and Bi Visibility Day, the White House held a closed-door meeting with about 30 bisexual advocates so they could meet with government officials and discuss issues of specific importance to the bisexual community; this was the first bi-specific event ever hosted by any White House. Another important contribution to bisexual visibility came in 2014, when the Bisexual Research Collaborative on Health (BiRCH) was founded to search for ways to raise public awareness of bisexual health issues, as well as to continue high-level discussions of bisexual health research and plan a national (American) conference. Also in 2014, the book Bisexuality: Making the Invisible Visible in Faith Communities, the first book of its kind, was published. It is by Marie Alford-Harkey and Debra W. Haffner. As for politics, in November 2012 Kyrsten Sinema was elected to the House of Representatives, becoming the first openly bisexual member of Congress in American history. Later, in 2015 Kate Brown became the first openly bisexual governor in the United States, as governor of Oregon when the old governor resigned. Kate Brown was elected as governor of Oregon in 2016, and thus became the first openly bisexual person elected as a United States governor (and indeed the first openly LGBT person elected as such). In 2018, Kyrsten Sinema became the first openly bisexual person to win a major party nomination to run for a U.S. Senate seat, and later that year she became the first openly bisexual person elected to the U.S. Senate. As well, Kate Brown was re-elected that year as governor of Oregon. In 2015, biphobia was added to the name of the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, previously the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia. In 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an amicus brief in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals making the argument that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not prohibit discrimination against employees who are bisexual or gay. In 2018 America's first city-wide Bi Pride event was held, in West Hollywood. = Timeline = * 1892: The word \\"bisexual\\" is first used regarding sexual orientation in Charles Gilbert Chaddock's translation of Kraft-Ebing's Psychopathia Sexualis. * 1905: Sigmund Freud presented his theory of psychosexual development in Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, giving evidence that in the pregenital phase children do not distinguish between sexes, but assume both parents have the same genitalia and reproductive powers. On this basis, he argued that bisexuality was the original sexual orientation and that heterosexuality was resultant of repression during the phallic stage, at which point gender identity became ascertainable. According to Freud, during this stage, children developed an Oedipus complex where they had sexual fantasies for the parent ascribed the opposite gender and hatred for the parent ascribed the same gender, and this hatred transformed into (unconscious) transference and (conscious) identification with the hated parent who both exemplified a model to appease sexual impulses and threatened to castrate the child's power to appease sexual impulses. * 1913: Carl Jung proposed the Electra complex as he both believed that bisexuality did not lie at the origin of psychic life, and that Sigmund Freud did not give adequate description to the female child (Freud rejected this suggestion). * 1914: The first documented appearance of bisexual characters (female and male) in an American motion picture occurred in A Florida Enchantment, by Sidney Drew. * 1966: Bisexual activist Robert A.

First published in 2005, it is the first in a series of crime novels set in Hamburg, Germany, and featuring Kriminalhauptkommissar Jan Fabel. Blood Eagle, as well the follow-up novels in the series, are characterized by their use of history, mythology and legend. In Blood Eagle, Fabel hunts a serial-killer who uses an ancient Viking ritual of human sacrifice, the blood eagle, to kill his victims.  Plot  Two women die horrific deaths, the manner is clearly ritualistic. The murderer writes emails to Hamburg Police's Kriminalhauptkommissar Jan Fabel. But what begins as a hunt for an elusive serial-killer, turns darker and more twisted as Fabel and his team uncover the Blood Eagle ritual, political intrigue, murky Nazi connections, undercover cops and a Ukrainian crime lord who is about to violently take complete control of Hamburg.  Jan Fabel  The detective created by Craig Russell is half-Scottish, half-German (Frisian). Police officers often refer to him as \\"der englische Kommissar\\" (the English Detective) because part of his education took place in the UK and because he carries himself with what Germans perceive as a British elegance and restraint. He is divorced and father of one daughter. No vices, no corruption, Fabel is conceived as a good man with a strong intellect and moral fortitude. He is thoughtful, quiet and highly regarded by his team as both expert and mentor/father figure. He loves the finer things, good living, clothes, food, music and he lives alone in this novel. The beginning of the novel introduces the reader to a dark and melancholy side. Fabel dreams about the victims. They are a constant reminder for him to never give up on a case – the victims deserve justice. Another interesting facet of this cop is the fact that he studied to become a historian. When his girlfriend at the time fell prey to a murderer, young Fabel changed course and joined the police.  Film adaptation  Blood Eagle (aka Blutadler) has been produced for German television by Tivoli Film for public broadcaster ARD. It was directed by Nils Willbrandt, adapted by Daniel Martin Eckhart and premiered 3 November 2012. The lead role was played by German actor Peter Lohmeyer. Although being the first in the series of Jan Fabel novels, Blood Eagle was filmed after Brother Grimm.  Awards  For the creation of the best-selling Jan Fabel thrillers, Craig Russell became the only non-German to be awarded the highly prestigious Polizeistern by the Polizei Hamburg.http://www.craigrussell.com/craigrussell.htm  References   External links  * Craig Russell website * Interview with Craig Russell * Quercus Books Craig Russell author page * Random House author page * Crime Writers Association Category:2005 British novels Category:British thriller novels Category:Novels set in Hamburg Category:British novels adapted into films ","title":"Blood Eagle (novel)"},{"id":"42210622","text":"Coventry City Police was a police force in the city of Coventry, then in Warwickshire, England, from 1836–1969.

She is known as the subject of a portrait by Jacques-Louis David. Early years Henriette Delacroix was born in 1780. Her father was Charles-François Delacroix (or Lacroix), minister of Foreign Affairs under the Directory. She was the second of four children. Her older brother Charles was a general during the First French Empire. Her second brother was Henri. Her youngest brother was the painter Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863), born eighteen years after her. Marriage In 1798 Henriette married Raymond de Verninac-Saint-Maur (1762-1822). He was one of the three commissioners who had been delegated to settle the annexation of Avignon in 1791. Raymond de Verninac was Minister to Sweden from 1792 until 1793, when Louis XVI was executed and relations were broken off. From 1795-97 he was Minister to the Porte of Sultan Selim III. Madame de Verninac as Diana the Huntress, by Joseph Chinard During the Consulate (1799-1804) Verninac was Prefect of the Rhône department. The Verninacs moved to Lyon. Jacques-Louis David painted a portrait of her in 1799. The sensual painting in neo-classical style depicts Henriette in the classical costume popular during the Directory. In 1808 Joseph Chinard sculpted Henriette as Diana the Huntress Preparing Her Arrows. Both of these works are now held by the Musée du Louvre. From 1802-05 Raymond de Verninac was French representative to Switzerland, after which he retired from the diplomatic service. Charles Étienne Raymond Victor de Verninac was born in Paris on 19 November 1803, the couple's only child. Henriette's father died in November 1805. Her second brother Henri died in 1807 in the Battle of Friedland. When her mother, Victoire Oeben, died in 1814 it was found that family estate was fully mortgaged, and his attorney had been stealing from it. Rather than being worth 800,000 francs as thought, the estate was in debt by 175,000 francs. The couple took care of Eugène Delacroix in 1814 after the death of their mother. Delacroix met his first love at Henriette's house. His portrait of the young Englishwoman Elisabeth Salter was painted in 1817. He became attached to his nephew, Charles, who was just five years younger than him. When Charles came to Paris to attend the Lycée Louis- le-Grand, Delacroix acted as his informal guardian. Last years Henriette's husband died on 23 April 1822. With the trial over her father's estate not yet settled, Henriette was ruined and forced to work to survive. She offered her services to the house of education of the Legion of Honour. She died in Paris in 1827. Delacroix became owner of the painting by David. He kept it for the rest of his life.

He was the son and successor of Kharakhuruh.  Biography  Kawus is first mentioned in ca. 802, when the Abbasid prince al-Ma'mun made several campaigns against Osrushana in order to ensure that Kawus stayed loyal to him. However, when al-Ma'mun ascended the Abbasid throne in 813, Kawus declared independence from the Abbasid Caliphate. In ca. 818, a civil war ensued in Osrushana between several princes. Kawus managed to emerge victorious, while his son Khaydar fled to the Abbasid court in Baghdad. In 822, an Abbasid army under Ahmad ibn Abi Khalid al-Ahwal conquered Osrushana and captured Kawus ibn Kharakhuruh; he was sent to Baghdad, where he submitted to the Caliph and converted to Islam.Bosworth, p. 590; Kramers, p. 925; Kennedy, p. 125; al-Baladhuri, pp. 204-05; al-Tabari, v. 32: pp. 107, 135 From this point on, Osrushana was generally considered to be part of the Abbasid state, although the afshīns were allowed to retain their control over the country as subjects of the caliph.Kramers, p. 925.

The church Upon his consecration in December 19, 1995, Bishop Vladimir became the bishop of St. Julius Island within the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Patriarchate of Kiev under the Jurisdiction and the Omophorion of Patriarch Filaret. The Diocese of St. Julius Island was established from the Patriarchate of Kiev in December 1 - 1995 and Vladyka Volodymir was the first Bishop consecrated in Western Europe under the Omophor of Patriarch Filaret. History With the establishment of full communion between the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchate and the Holy Synod of Milan in 1989, the ecclesiology of Archbishop Evloghios became manifestly Moderate. He was in full communion with Metropolitan Mstyslav (after First Patriarch of All Ukraine), manifestly ecumenist that was in full communion with Holy See Constantinople. Then Metropolitan Evloghios was in full communion with the historical Metropolitan Ioan Bornachuk of Lviv, right hand of Patriarch Mstyslav and after with Patriarch Volodymir of [Kiev] (second Patriarch of the Holy See of St. Andrew). For five years the western bishops were full members of the Kievan Patriarchate. In 1989 Archbishop Evloghios was in full communion with Metropolitan Mstyslav, Primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Exile. Metropolitan Mstyslav at that time was in full communion with Patriarch Demetrios I and Bartholomew I of Constantinople. In 1992, Metropolitan Ioan Bornachuk of Lviv, assured Metropolitan Evloghios about the full communion between the two churches that is Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in Ukraine and Autonomous Orthodox Church of Milan, Western Europe and Canada. In October 1993 Metropolitan Evloghios, as Primate of the Autonomous Orthodox Metropolia of Milan and Western Europe, was invited, as First Hierarch in full communion with the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in the U.S.A., to participate at the sobor in Kiev for the election of the second Patriarch after Mstyslav. On November 18, 1993, is confirmed by the Patriarch Volodimir the full right of Metropolitan Evloghios to be part of the Holy Synod of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kievan Patriarchate. On March 20, 1994 Metropolitan Evloghios, receives from the hands of Patriarch Volodimir the Tomos of Autonomy under the jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Kiev. From this date all the episcopal consecrations done in Western Europe became fully part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Patriarchate of Kiev. The status of \\"autonomy\\" of the western episcopate was directly proportional to total fidelity to the Patriarch of Kiev. The title, reconfirmed by Patriarch Volodymir through a new Tomos of Autonomy (1994),[1] is: Metropolitan of Milan and Longobardy, Western Europe and Canada. On December 1995, after one month from the enthronization of His Holiness Patriarch Filaret, Metropolitan Evloghios of Milan, with Metropolitan VIGHILIJ of Paris and Bishop Vassilij od Ostia, consecrated the Archimandrite Volodymir of St. Ambrose Monastery in Milanas (presented to Patriarch Filaret during his election in Kiev) Bishop of St. Julius Island. In 1996, Archbishop Evloghij with Bishop Volodymir and Bishop Vassilij, ordained to the Episcopate Bishop Michell Laroche of Lion (now Metropolitan Michel (Laroche) of Paris). On December 25, 1996 Patriarch Filaret intimate with a letter sent to the Canadian episcopate, Metropolitan Evloghios not accept American bishops under his omoforion (British island). On 23 February 1997, Patriarch Filaret ceased communion with Metropolitan Evloghios. Some bishops remain in the Mother Church of Kiev (Bishop Michell), the others remained in communion with Metropolitan Evloghios (Bishop Volodymir of St. Julius Island and Bishop Vassilj). At that time, Metropolitan Vighilij of Paris (who ordained Bishop Volodymir) died.

There are no truly green stars, because the color of a star is more or less given by a black-body spectrum and this never looks green. However, there are a few stars that appear green to some observers. This is usually because of the optical illusion that a red object can make nearby objects look greenish. There are some multiple star systems, such as Antares, with a bright red star where this illusion makes other stars in the system look green. Why stars do not look green colors of black body radiation and most stars lie on the Planckian locus (the curved black line near the center of the diagram), with the corresponding temperature given in kelvins (in CIE 1931 x,y space). The spectral (rainbow) colors lie on the outer curved part of the diagram, with their wavelength given in nanometers. Black body curves of Planck for various temperatures and comparison with classical theory of Rayleigh-Jeans. A star is usually close to being a black body, give or take a few spectral lines, so its color is usually more or less the color of a black body. The color of a black body lies on the Planckian locus in the middle of the diagram shown here. As can be seen, this locus happens to pass through red, orange, yellow, white, and light blue areas, and one can indeed see many stars of these colors. On the other hand, it does not pass through green, indigo (dark blue) or violet areas, so stars that appear to have these colors are rare and depend on some additional optical effect. The (blackbody) colors of stars are sometimes confused with the colors of the spectrum. The spectral (rainbow) colors are those on the curved part of the boundary of the diagram on the right. As can be seen, the red, orange, yellow and blue rainbow colors happen to be much the same as blackbody colors. However, stars whose peak emission is green light also emit much red and blue light, and the human visual system happens to interpret this mixture of colors as whitish rather than green. So the fact that some spectral colors appear as star colors is more a quirk of human color vision than a property of stars: if one uses an instrument such as a spectroscope that is better at distinguishing wavelengths of light, then all spectral colors look completely different from star colors. All sufficiently hot stars look about the same shade of blue (and not violet as claimed in some popular accounts). The reason for this is that at sufficiently large temperatures (above about 20,000 K) all blackbody spectra look about the same in visible light, though they can differ a lot at shorter wavelengths. Although their maximum output at visible wavelengths is at violet, they put out enough light at other wavelengths to look light blue: the color at the end of the Planckian locus rather than the color at the end of the spectrum. Human color vision is in fact more complicated than suggested by the explanation above, and in particular the perceived color of an object depends not only on the light it emits, but also on the colors of nearby objects. For example, a blue object close to a red object may appear somewhat greenish; this effect accounts for many apparently green stars. Objects that resemble green stars Although there are no truly green stars, there are many astronomical objects that can sometimes appear to be green stars. This section lists some of them. =Multiple stars= Antares (red) and its companion star, Antares B There a few stars in double or multiple star systems that appear greenish, even though they are really blue or white. This can happen if the star system contains a large red or orange star. An optical illusion causes things close to the red star to appear slightly greenish. The classical example is Antares B, the blue companion of the red supergiant Antares. Other examples include the star system Almach, and Sigma Cassiopeiae, a binary star 1500 light-years from Earth. Sigma Cassiopeiae has a green-hued primary of magnitude 5.0 and a blue-hued secondary of magnitude 7.3. =Nebulae= The green planetary nebula NGC 6826 Some planetary nebulae glow green, especially if they contain oxygen. These nebulae, or the stars within them (usually Wolf- Rayet stars) may appear to be green stars. Some examples are the planetary nebulae NGC 6572, NGC 6826 and NGC 7009. =Beta Librae = The star Beta Librae (Zubeneschamali) is usually reported to be white by modern observers. However its color is controversial, and many earlier observers state that it is green. There seems to be no consensus about what its color really is, and no generally accepted explanation for why some observers see it as green. =Uranus= Uranus The planet Uranus, occasionally mistaken for a star and once cataloged as one as 34 Tauri, can appear greenish as it has a lot of methane that absorbs red light. =The Sun= Green flash The Sun can sometimes appear as a green spot for a second or two as it is rising or setting: this is known as green flash. Roughly speaking, the red light from the Sun is blocked by Earth, the blue light is scattered by the atmosphere, and the green light is refracted by the atmosphere to the observer. A similar effect can occasionally be seen with other astronomical objects such as the moon and bright planets. Furthermore, the Sun emits more green photons than any other color; i.e. it peaks in the green part of the visible spectrum. =False color images= The green blobs are false-color images of (non-green) stars. Astronomical images are sometimes printed in false colors, which can make stars look green.

Accessed 15 March 2014. was a Scottish civil servant who was imprisoned for corruption in 1974 following the John Poulson trial. Education and early career George Pottinger was born in 1916, the elder son of the Reverend William Pottinger, MA, of Orkney. He was educated at George Watson's College in Edinburgh and the High School of Glasgow, before proceeding to further study at the University of Edinburgh, Heidelberg University and Queens' College, Cambridge, where he was awarded a major scholarship and graduated with a BA in Anglo-Saxon Studies and English. In 1939 he entered the Scottish Home Department as an Assistant Principal, and upon his return in 1945 following war service he was successively promoted from Principal to Assistant Secretary (1952–9) and Under-Secretary (1959–62). He also spent time as Private Secretary to three Secretaries of State for Scotland – Arthur Woodburn, Hector McNeil and James Stuart – from 1949 to 1952, and as Secretary of the Royal Commission on Scottish Affairs (1952–4). The Aviemore project During the late 1950s, John Maclay, then Secretary of State for Scotland, appointed Lord Fraser of Allander (then Sir Hugh Fraser) to head a survey of tourist resources in the Highlands. Pottinger was put on secondment to Fraser, and in 1962 was asked by ministers to assist the Scottish Tourist Board in preparing a Bill that would allow for a series of investment grants and, potentially, a special tax on overnight accommodation in the area. In a letter to Maclay, he noted that one additional problem inherent in developing the Highlands as a tourist destination was the \\"shortage of top-class hotel accommodation\\", and that an \\"ambitious project which will really strike people's imagination\\" was now needed.Ian Levitt, '\\"Too Deeply Committed\\": Aviemore, the Scottish Office and George Pottinger, 1959-72', Scottish Affairs, 51 (2005), pp. 34-5. This advice was taken on board: following further rounds of negotiation with various agencies and groups, a £5m redevelopment of Aviemore as a winter sports complex was eventually conceived and approved. Prompted by the chairman of the construction firm Bovis, Fraser came to understand that the only architect with the \\"vision\\" and technical ability to develop the scheme was John Poulson. In order to speed up the process and maintain Poulson's interest, Pottinger was delegated to \\"work closely\\" with him.Levitt, '\\"Too Deeply Committed, pp. 41, 49. It was at this time that Poulson started giving Pottinger the 'gifts' that would help assure the downfall of both men.

Translanguaging is an extension of the concept of languaging, the discursive practices of language speakers, but with the additional feature of using multiple languages, often simultaneously. It is a dynamic process in which multilingual speakers navigate complex social and cognitive demands through strategic employment of multiple languages.Ofelia Garcia and Li Wei (2014) Translanguaging: Language, Bilingualism and Education. Palgrave Macmillan It is believed that the term was first coined in Welsh by Cen Williams as trawsieithu in his 1994 unpublished thesis \\"An evaluation of teaching and learning methods in the context of bilingual secondary education.\\" Translanguaging involves issues of language production, effective communication, the function of language, and the thought processes behind language use. The term is a result of bilingualism, and is often employed in a pedagogical setting, but also has applications to any situation experienced by multilingual speakers, who constitute most language communities in the world. This includes complex linguistic family dynamics, and the use of code-switching and how that usage relates to one's understanding of their own multilingualism. In an educational setting, translanguaging can be controlled by both the student and the teacher. It maximizes the student's bilingual ability and is being used across the world. For instance, a teacher can develop a lesson plan using English as the medium of instruction and another language as the medium of discussion. This allows the student to use each language for different domains within the classroom. When talking about bilingualism, some scholars consider translanguaging as opposed to a \\"double monolingualism.\\" This puts an emphasis on how multilingual speakers use varying language skill levels to communicate fully, rather than emphasizing the concept of equal proficiency between two languages. Additionally, translanguaging is dissimilar from diglossia because translanguaging practices do not mandate a language hierarchy, nor do they mandate that different language systems are assigned to different domains or functions for the speaker; rather, translanguaging develops the adaptability and cooperation of language systems.  History  Bilingual education is thought to go back as far as 4000–5000 years. The ideology behind translanguaging emerged from the evolution of multilingual teaching practices, particularly the practices promoted by Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), an international association designed to advance the quality of English language instruction. The beginnings of bilingual education in the United States asserted the primacy of speech and neglected written language learning. The second language instruction of the 1960s and 70s heavily utilized oral–aural drills, and written portions of the courses were mimetic and repetition oriented, and structure, form, syntax, and grammar were given priority status for learners. In this system there was no focus on actual language use, which led to a lack of knowledge about how language and communication work in real practice. In the late 1970s and 80s second language education shifted to focus on the importance of communication and language use for participation in particular discourse communities. However, emphasizing language learning as a means to enter a discourse community was also problematic, as it pressured students to surrender their own language practices in order to become practicing members of the new discourse communities. Translanguaging as a focus of study first emerged in Bangor, Wales, in the 1980s. It is based on François Grosjean's idea that bilinguals are not two monolinguals in one. Cen Williams and his colleagues were researching strategies of using both Welsh and English in a single lesson in a classroom setting. Cen Williams' Welsh term \\"trawsieithu\\" was translated into English as \\"translanguaging\\" by their colleague Colin Baker. Scholars argue that translanguaging functions as an emancipation from the adverse second language acquisition pedagogies of the 20th century. They believe that translanguaging gives multilingual students an advantage within educational systems because it (1) promotes a more thorough understanding of content; (2) helps the development of the weaker language for bilingual or multilingual speakers; (3) fosters home-to-school links within language use; and (4) integrates fluent speakers with early learners, thus expediting the language learning process.  Major debates  A prominent argument against incorporating translanguaging into academic contexts is the notion that speakers of International Englishes would have difficulty communicating with one another because of the immense variety of Englishes spoken. However, advocates for translanguaging pedagogy maintain that misunderstandings between speakers of International Englishes who practice translanguaging are not common, and when misunderstandings do occur between speakers they are quickly resolved through other means of negotiation. Advocates argue that speakers of International Englishes can communicate with relative ease because they have a variety of tools for making sense of the language varieties with which they engage. Some academics call for the development of corpora of \\"nonstandard\\" English varieties to aid with the study of translanguaging. Barbara Seidlhofer argues that language acquisition programs should not be teaching language with the intention of achieving native-speaker competence, but that they should be \\"embracing the emergent realistic goal of intercultural competence achieved through a plurilingualism that integrates rather than ostracizes\\" International Englishes. This pedagogical strategy necessitates translanguaging as a means through which to accomplish such plurilingualism. For Seidlhofer, the incorporation of such International Englishes into educational systems would be more beneficial for second language learners than current dominant language acquisition pedagogies, which emphasize standard American and British varieties of English. Since achieving native-speaker status is nearly impossible without years of study, translanguaging presents students with opportunities to learn language in a more supportive space, fostering their language acquisition in all varieties rather than enforcing the participation in and acquisition of a single dominant variety. Proponents of decolonizing the English language argue that holding on to particular varieties of English as the only legitimate varieties to use in language acquisition programs is a practice that perpetuates destructive colonial attitudes towards non-English languages and the English varieties of their speakers. Incorporating translanguaging is one means through which such a decolonization of the English language could occur. In this way, decentralizing those particular dominant varieties of English would work towards legitimizing the use of \\"nonstandard\\" English varieties at the educational level.  Translanguaging and code-switching  Translanguaging's relationship to the concept of code-switching depends on the model of translanguaging used. Multiple models have been created to describe the cognitive processing of language and how multilingualism functions and manifests within an individual speaker. The unitary model of translanguaging, derived from postmodernism in linguistics, considers code-switching to be a separate phenomenon from translanguaging. This is because the unitary model defines code-switching as a dual competence model, which assumes that the linguistic systems of an individual are separate without overlap. The dual competence model of code-switching directly contrasts with the post- modernist's unitary model, which theorizes that a speaker only possesses a singular linguistic system, thereby making code-switching irreconcilable with translanguaging. On the other hand, the integrated model of translanguaging takes a more centrist position. It considers code-switching to be an aspect of translanguaging alongside other multilingual activities like translation, because an individual's internal linguistic systems are thought to be overlapping but not unitary. Linguistic postmodernists do not recognize code- switching as translanguaging because they call into question the very idea of discrete languages, arguing them to be inventions created through various cultural, political, or social processes. Postmodernists acknowledge that linguistic differences may exist between \\"languages,\\" but the concept of a \\"language\\" as an abstract and independent entity is considered a social construct. When applied to translanguaging theory, postmodernists argue that an individual's linguistic competence is the sum of their individual interactions with other speakers and overall linguistic knowledge. Each person has an individually distinct linguistic repertoire, or idiolect, because of their unique socialization experience. The internal linguistic system is considered unitary and encompasses all grammatical and lexical systems. Hence, the discrete systems of linguistic competence given by code-switching cannot be considered part of translanguaging in the unitary model. The integrated model takes a position closer to the center of the two extremes on linguistic systems. The model was developed from critiques to the unitary model, stating that the conclusions from the postmodernists were the product of theory, rather than linguistic data on multilingualism. The model posits that the internal linguistic system for any given individual is constructed with discrete lexical systems for each \\"language\\" and overlapping grammatical systems that can share phonetic, morphological, phonological, and semantic features. Linguistic systems are thought to rely on each system's linguistic structuring and whether the structuring can be done with or without cognitive differentiation. The integrated model then conceptualizes theories on code- switching to be aspects of translanguaging itself, because both the integrated model on translanguaging and code-switching assume some shared features and some distinction between cognitive linguistic systems.  Translanguaging in Deaf culture  Translanguaging in Deaf culture focuses on sensorial accessibility, as translanguaging still exists in Deaf culture; it is just different than translanguaging in non-Deaf speakers. An example of translanguaging in Deaf culture is when a \\"mixed deaf/hearing family communicates at the dinner table using mouthing, sign-speaking, voice, and signs.\\" Translanguaging can be used prescriptively and descriptively and uses a speaker's entire linguistic range with disregard to the social and political sphere of languages. It also can be seen as the language practices of bilingual speakers. An ongoing issue in the Deaf community is the push for signed languages to be considered minority languages, since deaf speakers have a \\"sensorial inaccessibility to spoken languages.\\" There is also an issue of access to signed languages for deaf children, as for many, this access is compromised. Deaf speakers also face sensorial asymmetries, and theories like translanguaging may threaten the political discourse for sign language rights as signed languages were seen as merely gestures fifty years ago, but not as real languages.Meulder, M. D., Kusters, A., Moriarty, E., & Murray, J. J. (2019). Describe, don’t prescribe. The practice and politics of translanguaging in the context of deaf signers. Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development, 1-15. doi:10.1080/01434632.2019.1592181 Since deaf children use a variation of both signed and spoken languages, they share experiences similar to that of other bilingual children. Translanguaging in the Deaf community is thus unique because they use both visual and gestural, as well as spoken and written language modality.Swanwick, R. (n.d.). Unlocking dialogue through translanguaging in deaf education [Pamphlet]. Leeds, England.  International translanguaging  Non-native speakers of English around the world outnumber native English speakers of English by a ratio of 3:1. With the current influx of technology and communication, English has become a heavily transnational language. As such, English varieties and International Englishes are becoming standard usage in international economic exchanges, thereby increasing their legitimacy and decreasing the dominance of the standard American and British English varieties.  Translanguaging spaces  In the context of translanguaging, when thinking about space, it is not necessarily considered a physical space, but more of a space in the multilingual individual's mind. Through the processes of translanguaging, individuals create their own translanguaging space. Having said that, there can be many different translanguaging spaces that then get incorporated into a larger social space. For example, a university environment may provide a better translanguaging space due to the greater diversity of students in college than in a typical high school – and this is referring to the individuals life outside the classroom. Moreover, multilinguals can generate this social space where they are free to combine whichever tools they have gathered—ranging from personal history, experience and environment, attitude, belief and ideology, cognitive and physical capacity—to form a coordinated and meaningful performance. Within the translanguaging space that has been formed, the isolation of each individual language is not present. Instead, it provides an environment where all languages merge and results in completely new ideas and practices. Multilinguals, in their translanguaging space, are continually coming up with new strategies to take advantage of their language knowledge to attain a specific communication effect in their day-to-day lives and experiences. When they become comfortable with the use of each language, creativity begins to flow and the languages become intertwined in ways that can only be understood in that specific translanguaging space. For example, the mix of Spanish and English in Miami, Florida, leads to different translanguaging spaces. The variety among these spaces depends on the Latin country the speakers come from due to the difference in dialects that exist. It is very common to hear Spanglish being spoken in Miami but if someone speaks both Spanish and English, it does not necessarily mean the usage of certain expressions, words, and sentences will be understood.  Translanguaging pedagogy  The development of translanguaging as a part of second language acquisition pedagogy signifies an ideological shift in bilingual and multilingual education systems, wherein bilingualism and multilingualism are no longer viewed as a disadvantage to learning a second language, such as English, but rather as an asset.Hult, F.M. (2012). Ecology and multilingual education. In C. Chapelle (Gen. Ed.), Encyclopedia of applied linguistics (Vol. 3, pp. 1835-1840). Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell. The incorporation of translanguaging into educational settings signifies the movement of the English language towards a more heterogeneous system of several equally valued English varieties, rather than a system of two enforced varieties (Standard American and British Englishes) contesting with several other depreciated minority varieties. Importantly, translanguaging pedagogy demands that multilingual speakers engaging in translanguaging do not vacillate between language systems arbitrarily, but rather, that they do it with intention and a metacognitive understanding of the way their language practices work. Translanguaging promotes a deeper understanding of subject matter, by discussing in one language and writing in another. Students will always reference what they already know from their first language when working with a second language. This helps students process the information and improve communication in their second language. When introduced in a Welsh bilingual classroom, translanguaging meant that the input and output languages were often switched. In this type of setting, students are typically asked to read a text in one language and discuss it either orally or in written form in their second language. In the case of the Welsh classroom, the languages used were Welsh and English. This led to an increase of Welsh speakers in primary schools in 2007, with 36.5% of the students being able to speak Welsh, compared to 1987 when only 24.6% of students spoke Welsh. The goal of including translanguaging as an aspect of second-language acquisition pedagogy is to move beyond sentence-level and grammatical concerns in second-language teaching strategies, and to focus more heavily on discourse issues and on the rhetoric of communication. Students should be focused on the real applications of language that suit their purposes of communication based on the context in which they are communicating, rather than a one-variety-fits-all mode of learning language. Some scholars writing within translanguaging pedagogy argue for a diversified conception of the English language, where the multiple varieties of English exist with their own norms and systems and all have equal status. Such a system will enable a variety of communities to communicate effectively in English. In this conception of English language, it should be treated as a heterogeneous global language wherein standard varieties of English such as Indian English, Nigerian English, and Trinidadian English would still have the same status as the orthodox varieties of British and American English. Reinforcing only one variety of English in academic situations is disadvantageous for students, since students will ultimately encounter many varied communicative contexts, and as society becomes more digitally advanced, many of those communicative contexts will be transnational. Since translanguaging is not yet a widely sanctioned language practice in educational systems, it is often practiced by students in secret and kept hidden from instructors. The practice of natural translanguaging without the presence of direct pedagogical effort can lead to issues of competence and transfer in academic contexts for students. This issue is why academics call for the inclusion of translanguaging in language acquisition programs, since students need to practice their translanguaging in a semi- structured environment in order to acquire competence and proficiency in communicating across academic contexts. If they are given the appropriate context in which to practice, students can integrate dominant writing conventions into their language practices and negotiate critically between language systems as they engage in translanguaging. For students to be successful at translanguaging in academic and other varied contexts, they must exercise critical metacognitive awareness about their language practices. = Teachers = Making use of translanguaging in the classroom does not require the teacher to be bilingual; however, it does require the teacher to be a co- learner. Monolingual teachers working with bilingual or multilingual students can successfully use this teaching practice; however, they must rely on the students, their parents, the community, texts, and technology more than the bilingual teacher, in order to support the learning and leverage the students' existing resources. As translanguaging allows the legitimization of all varieties, teachers can participate by being open to learning the varieties of their students, and by incorporating words from unfamiliar languages into their own use, serving as a model for their students to begin working with their non-native languages. The traditionally prohibition of translanguaging in high-stakes writing assignments can prevent multilingual students from practicing their translanguaging abilities, and so it is the responsibility of the instructor to provide safe spaces for students to practice and develop their translanguaging skills. Teachers must plan out the translanguaging practices to be used with their students just as each lesson must be planned out, as translanguaging is not random. By reading bilingual authors and texts, teachers give the students the chance to experience two or more languages together and help compare and contrast the languages for the children. Importantly, the use of translanguaging in the classroom enables language acquisition for the students without the direct insertion or influence of the teacher. While teachers do not need to become a compendium of the languages or language varieties practiced in their classrooms, they do need to be open to working with these new languages and language varieties to encourage student participation in translanguaging. = Higher education = Many students will use translanguaging in higher education where they are attending a university that does not have their first language as the medium of instruction. The students use their multiple languages as resources in their learning and understanding of subjects and ideas. An environment of multiple languages spoken with various repertoires allows a greater multilingual competence of subjects taught and reviewed in each language available. Bilingual or multilingual students in higher education who study in their native tongue and the medium of instruction used at their institutions are studied to determine how to reform primary and secondary education. This creates room for discussion of primary and secondary school systems and their language(s) of instruction. Translanguaging in higher education has been seen mostly within North America and in the United Kingdom. There are certain countries that are accepting of multilingual policies, such as India. However, places such as the United Arab Emirates are not accepting of adopting languages into their school systems.

Bell, a 15-year-old gay youth, was \\"intensely bullied\\" both in person and on the internet because he was gay. He was a member of the La Grande High School cheerleading team in La Grande, Oregon, where he was a sophomore. On January 19, 2013, Bell went to a local elementary school and hanged himself from the play structure. He did not immediately die from the strangulation and was rushed to the emergency department, where he was kept on life support. The Associated Press reported that a spokesman for the OHSU Hospital in Portland announced that after being taken off life support, Bell died on February 3, 2013. Bell's death was widely reported in the media, starting discussions about bullying, the effect it has on youth, and gay bullying. The Huffington Post, Salon, Oregon Public Broadcasting, The Raw Story, GLAAD, PQ Monthly, Pink News and many other media outlets reported on Bell's death. The media reported his suicide stemmed from being bullied for being gay, which Bell's father fully believed, stating: \\"He was hurting so bad. Just the bullying at school. Yeah there were other issues, but ultimately it was all due to the bullying, for not being accepted for being gay.\\" Of Bell's death, Oregon LGBTQ activist Alex Horsey stated: \\"Sometimes, it can be easy to become disconnected to so many stories like Jadin's in the media... Every story (including those not covered by media outlets) has equal importance... It's heartbreaking that Jadin's story has become a reminder of the horrifying consequences of bullying, rather than a story of a young man overcoming adversity and a community changing its ways.\\" Legacy After Bell's death, his father, Joe Bell, planned a cross-country tribute in honor of his son. He planned to walk across the entire continental United States within two years, spreading awareness about bullying and the effects that it can have. Bell resigned from his position at Boise Cascade and helped launch Faces for Change, a non-profit anti-bullying foundation, to speak in high schools across the U.S. He stated: \\"Not doing anything is not acceptable. [Those who watch and do nothing] are just as guilty. They are saying that it is acceptable.\\" Joe Bell was killed halfway through his journey after he was hit by a semi-truck in Colorado. The driver of the truck, Kenneth Raven, was charged with reckless driving and may have fallen asleep at the wheel. Joe had begun the walk-in April 2013 and was killed on October 6, 2013. He was pronounced dead at the scene on the shoulder of US 40 when authorities arrived. Faces for Change created a scholarship program in memory of Jadin Bell \\"to make awards to scholastic institutions on behalf of individuals who have demonstrated a commitment to diversity and the development of community tolerance in our area of service.\\" The story was adapted for the 2020 film Good Joe Bell.Kevin Slane, \\"Mark Wahlberg got ‘as thin as possible’ for new movie\\".

Life Born in 1846 in Meurthe-et-Moselle in Nancy, he entered into the École Polytechnique in 1865 and took part, in 1870, in the Franco- Prussian War. He was injured at Patay on 2 December 1870 and at Bécon on 26 April 1871. He distinguished himself during the campaign, and was awarded the rank of Captain. In 1879, he entered into the General Staff for Artillery, and become professor of artillery at the Ecole Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr as chef d'escadron in 1882. He was raised to Colonel and inspector for arms manufacturing in 1895. It was in this post that he attracted the attention of Général André in May 1900, when he was named his Chief of Staff and Brigadier General. Appreciated during his service in that position, Percin was described by André in 1904 as: \\"[an officer] generally very intelligent, very vigorous, very active, with a capacity for exceptional work, assiduous and methodical: he wrote well, and with grace.\\" These qualities were not disputed by Lieutenant Colonel Émile Mayer, who had opportunity to judge Percin because of his friendship with the Minister of War. Mayer, who well knew the two men, recalled that they were commanded together to Angoulême and that \\"André had there the opportunity to appreciate his young comrade, of whom he had a high estimation of intelligence, of professional valor, and of moral quality... They were equally inclined to intransigence and were also committed to remain on the path which both had decided to accomplish.\\" Percin was part of the list of six generals, drawn up by an informant, who together were described as being Freemasons. For Émile Mayer, \\"Percin had been, if not the instigator, at least the principal instrument of that thing which is called the 'système des fiches'.\\" Because of his republicanism and his relatives, Percin was considered to be the probable successor to the Minister of War before he quit the cabinet of André in 1904. He was then replaced by Colonel Mardochée Valabrègue. In 1914, he was put in charge of the defense of Lille against the German Army. His defense of the city was controversial because of an accusation that he had abandoned the city; in his book Lille, published in 1919, he argued that he had only been following orders.

Later that night, Sc4rlet sends him her photo and an invitation to meet at the central station of their hometown, Stockholm, but after his phone is stolen by Agnes and destroyed, their meeting is ruined as Elias cannot find her. Spotting her on the train home, he is afraid of talking to her, and steps off of the train with the intention of jumping on the tracks. He is narrowly saved by Sc4rlet, who suspected the boy of being him, and they soon become friends. As things progress, Sc4rlet begins pressuring Elias to stand up for himself, helping him plan his revenge on his tormentors. They decide to go after Agnes, the leader of the gang, hoping that it will cause the others to stop. They soon make a plan to strip her naked and post photos of her on the internet, mirroring what she did to Elias earlier, and later steal drugs from the local hospital for him to use. The following day, Elias attacks her during an outdoors gymnastics class, but she managed to fight him off, and he left alone in the forest after she injects him with the drugs intended for her. Hallucinating from the injection, Elias begins seeing Sc4rlet, who leads him to the roof of the building next door to his apartment, where she tells him that they will \\"die together, like he wants to\\". Meanwhile, Elias' father, Stefan, finds the stolen drugs in his sons bedroom, alongside an unedited video of the earlier incident at school, given to him by Adam. Stefan then spots Elias alone on the next door roof, and comes to his rescue just in time. Elias wakes up in the hospital, where Stefan angrily berates him for not telling him about the bullying and the drugs. Stefan asks Elias what he can do to help, and Elias asks him that there's only one thing he wants to do. After being discharged from the hospital, Elias records a suicide letter on video and says goodbye to his friends and family. That night, Sc4rlet appears in his room, and we realize that she never stepped off the train in the beginning, and that Elias has been envisioning her to help him. She spends the night, comforting him. The next day, he boards the ferry to Åland, where Sc4rlet appears once again, asking if he is sure about what he is doing. He sets up his camera to record, and jumps off the ferry in the middle of the sea. Three days later, Stefan is watching a news report about his sons disappearance and suspected suicide. The next day a memorial is held at his school, where the students mourn Elias. As the principal takes the stage to give a speech, Adam cuts into the projector feed, playing Elias' suicide note to the entire school, who watch in shock as he exposes Agnes and her friends, before cutting to the unedited video of incident, revealing Agnes and her friends as they truly are. As the students struggle to grasp with what they have seen, Elias appears on the gallery behind them, alive and well. A quick flashback reveals that Elias had jumped to a deck below, where his father caught him. They then faked the disappearance and suicide, with the faked suicide video as \\"evidence\\", in order to bring attention to the bullying. Some time later, Stefan, Elias and Jonas, a family once again, is watching an interview with Stefan on television, where he is questioned about the ethics of Elias faking his death like he did. Stefan then responds that bullying is never taken seriously, \\"not until someone dies. We needed someone to die, so that the world could see the truth.\\" A vision of Sc4rlet appears once again, smiling to Elias, who, for the first time, can smile again. He decides to find her; and using the number she texted him from earlier in the film, tracks her down, learning that her real name is Scarlet Friedmann. The film then ends with Elias finally meeting Scarlet, who recognizes him from the train and tells him that she waited for him at the station and was sad when he never showed up, but is glad that he finally had the courage to meet her.

It is legally a subsidiary of Ukraine's state-owned oil and gas company Naftogaz. However, after the 2014 Crimean crisis it was seized by the region's parliament in the run-up to its annexation by Russia. There was also a privately owned oil company Chernomorneftegaz, registered in Moscow in 1998 and purchased by Rosneft in 2011, which is not linked to Chornomornaftogaz. History The company was established with the order of the Ministry of Gas Industry of the USSR on October 20, 1978 №209-org to develop oil and gas resources in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. In February 2014, Ukraine's state-owned oil and gas company Naftogaz sued Chornomornaftogaz for delayed debt payments of 11.614 billion UAH (almost €1 billion) in the Economic Court of the Crimean Autonomous Republic. In March 2014, Crimean authorities announced that they would nationalize the company. Crimean deputy prime minister Rustam Temirgaliev said that Russia's Gazprom would be the new owner. A group of Gazprom representatives, including its head of business development, has been working at the Chornomornaftogaz head office since mid- March 2014. Formally, nationalized assets were transferred to the newly established company Crimean Republican Enterprise Chernomorneftegaz, which was later reorganized into state unitary enterprise Chernomorneftegaz. On 11 April 2014, the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control announced that it had added Chornomornaftagaz to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List as part of the U.S. sanctions against Russia. Reuters quoted an anonymous U.S. official who explained that the United States wanted to make it impossible for Gazprom to \\"have dealings with Chornomornaftogaz\\", and if that were to happen, Gazprom itself could face sanctions. The European Union followed suit on 13 May 2014, the first time its sanctions list has included a company. Naftogaz has considered to file a suit against Russia in international arbitration for a compensation for the seized company. In December 2015, Chornomornaftogaz moved two jack-up rigs—Tavrida and Petro Hodovanets—from Odeske gas field to Russian territorial waters due to disputed status of the field and a risk that rigs will be arrested by the Ukrainian authorities. Operations Chornomornaftogaz is an integrated oil and gas company engaged in natural gas explorations and production, transport, storage, and distribution. It operates the Hlibovske underground gas storage. Its offshore operations are concentrated primarily in the northwestern part of the Black Sea shelf. The company has licenses for 17 fields, including 11 gas fields, four oil fields and two gas condensate fields. It licenses for offshore fields include Odeske, Shtormove, Prykerchenske, Holitsynske, Arkhangelske, Bezimenne, Subbotinske, and Strilkove. In addition it owns licenses for Jankoy and Semenwckoye onshore fields. Its total reserves of all fields are estimated at of natural gas, 1.231 million tons of natural-gas condensate, and 2.53 million tons of crude oil. In 2013, Chornomornaftogaz produced of natural gas. In 2012, it produced of natural gas, 62,800 tonnes of natural-gas condensate, and 8,900 tonnes of crude oil. The research group IHS reported that in 2013 Chornomorneftegaz accounted for 7.9% of Ukraine's gas production and 2.4% of its oil production. The company owns four jack-up rigs (Syvash, Tavrida, Petro Hodovanets, and Nezalezhnist) and eight fixed drilling platforms. Purchase of Petro Hodovanets (ex-West Juno) and Nezalezhnist was criticized due to corruption and money laundering allegations and higher purchase price that the market price. These rigs were nicknamed the \\"Boyko towers\\" after the former energy minister Yuriy Boyko.

Middle Ages and Renaissance Bohdan Khmelnytsky Entering Kyiv by Mykola Ivasyuk. The first mention of Jews in Kyiv is found in the 10th century Kievian Letter, written by Jews from Cairo in ancient Hebrew. It is the oldest written document to mention the name of the city. Jewish travelers such as Benjamin of Tudela and Pethahiah of Regensburg mentioned the city as one with a large Jewish community. During the Mongol occupation the community was devastated, together with the rest of the city, but the community revived with the acquisition of the city by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. During Polish–Lithuanian rule, Jews were allowed to settle in the city, but they were subject to several deportations in 1495 and again in 1619. During the Khmelnytsky Uprising in 1648 most of the Jews in the city were murdered by Zaporozhian Cossacks, along with most of the Jews in Ukraine. After the Russian occupation in 1654, Jews were not allowed to settle in the city. This ban was lifted only in 1793 after the Third Partition of Poland. Modern history Kyiv's districts according to the 1919 municipal population census Brodsky Choral Synagogue around 1970; then used as a puppet theatre and currently used as a synagogueRededicated Kyiv synagogue to serve as community center In the 19th century the Jewish community flourished and became one of the biggest communities in Ukraine. In 1815, the Jewish population was 1,500, and would continue to grow, reaching over 81,000 nearly one hundred years later in 1913. In that period many synagogues were built including the city's main synagogue, the Brodsky Choral Synagogue. Jewish schools and workshops were built all around the city. The community suffered from a number of pogroms in 1882, and again in 1905, when hundreds of Jews were murdered and wounded. The Beilis trial, in which a local Jew, Beilis, was accused of the ritual murder of a child, took place in the city in 1903. Beilis was found innocent. During the Russian revolution and the Ukrainian War of Independence the city switched hands several times with new pogroms against the Jews. After the establishment of the Ukrainian SSR the Jewish population grew rapidly and reached approximately 224,000 people in 1939. At the beginning of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union most Jews escaped from the city. The remaining 33,771 Jews were concentrated in Babi Yar, and were executed by shooting on September 29-30th 1941, in an act that became one of the most notorious episodes of the Holocaust. Another 15,000 Jews were murdered in the same place during 1941–1942. After the war the surviving Jews returned to the city. On September 4–7, 1945 a pogrom took place and around one hundred Jews were beaten, of whom thirty-six were hospitalized and five died of wounds.Amir Weiner. Making Sense of War: The Second World War and the Fate of the Bolshevik Revolution. Princeton University Press. 2008. p. 192. In 1946, there was only one operating synagogue in Kyiv. The last rabbi to officiate in Kyiv was Rabbi Panets, who retired in 1960 and died in 1968; a new rabbi was not appointed. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, most of the Jewish population emigrated from Kyiv. After Ukrainian independence, there was a revival of Jewish community life, with the establishment of two Jewish schools and a memorial in Babi Yar, where an official ceremony is held every year. Today there are approximately 20,000 Jews in Kyiv, with two major religious communities: Chabad (rabbi Jonathan Markovitch); and Karlin (rabbi Yaakov Bleich). Two major synagogues, the Brodsky Choral Synagogue and the Great Choral Synagogue, serve these communities.Jewish People Around the World =Antisemitism= Ukrainian Rabbi Moshe Reuven Azman called on Kyiv's Jews to leave the city and the country if possible, fearing that the city's Jews will be victimized in the chaos during the Ukrainian revolution of 2014: \\"I told my congregation to leave the city center or the city all together and if possible the country too… I don’t want to tempt fate… but there are constant warnings concerning intentions to attack Jewish institutions”. Moreover, the CFCA (the Coordination Forum for Countering Antisemitism) reported more than three antisemitic incidents occurred in Kyiv since the 2014 Crimean crisis. Both the pro-Russian Ukrainians and the Ukraine-government supporters blamed each other in the exacting situation of the Jews of Kyiv. Leaders of Ukraine's own Jewish community alleged that recent anti-Semitic provocations in the Crimea, including graffiti on a synagogue in Crimea's capital that read “Death to the Zhids,” are the handiwork of pro-Russian Ukrainians. Rabbi Yaakov Dov Bleich, who presides over Ukraine's Jewish Federation, signed a letter asking Russia to end its aggression, and compared the current climate in Crimea to that of pre-Anschluss Austria. The memorial Menorah in Babi Yar was desecrated twice with a sprayed swastika, during Rosh Hashana and a couple of months later. During June 2015, there was an explosion in a Jewish-owned shop in Kyiv. An extreme right-wing organization claimed responsibility for the incident. Later that month, the memorial Menorah in Babi Yar was desecrated again.

Its first aim was to develop standardised terminology, and in 2000 IOTA published a consensus statement on terms, definitions and measurements to describe the sonographic features of adnexal masses that is now widely used today. IOTA now comprises one of a portfolio of studies examining many aspects of gynaecological ultrasonography and early pregnancy within a network of contributing centres throughout the world that are co-ordinated from KU Leuven Having agreed on standardised terminology the principal IOTA investigators prospectively studied a large cohort of patients with a persistent adnexal mass in several different clinical centres. This database and the close involvement of the civil engineering department at KU Leuven has enabled both previously developed prediction models to be tested and novel prediction models to be developed and externally validated . In this way IOTA has been able to refine the optimal approach to characterise adnexal pathology preoperatively. IOTA has also described simple ultrasound based rules that can be used to classify ovarian cysts and so diagnose \\"ovarian cancer\\". These can be applied in about 75% of masses. For the remainder, a further scan by a sub-specialist is recommended. Another approach has to use simple descriptors, which are intuitive features of masses that an ultrasound examiner can use to easily classify about 50% of masses. Summaries of the IOTA studies have been published as reviews. Currently IOTA is engaged in several new studies. The group are studying the long-term behaviour of expectantly managed adnexal pathology (IOTA phase 5). This will answer important questions about complications and malignant transformation in masses that are left in situ. A number of studies are being carried out on masses that currently are difficult to classify even for the most experienced examiner. These studies involve the use of vascular imaging, proteomics, novel Biomarkers and MRI to name but a few (IOTA phase 3). Finally a clinical trial is taking place in London (IOTA phase 4) to evaluate the performance of IOTA prediction models and rules in the hands of examiners with different levels of experience and training. Two paper have been published from the IOTA 4 study that suggest that IOTA rules and models to work when they are not applied by experts. Today there are over 50 clinical units contributing to IOTA studies in nearly every continent. The culture of IOTA is to be transparent and open to new collaborators. The group is multidisciplinary and involves gynaecologists, radiologists, oncologists – as well as physicists and biologists. The group believes that good communication between all these disciplines is how ideas can be turned into improvements for patients. 2013 marked new developments for IOTA. Having focused on research, the group had the first IOTA congress and the development of the IOTA website. Having established a platform of clinical research centres IOTA will be planning further studies investigating aspects of ovarian cancer management and outcome prediction. Interested units should contact the group and we are always interested in new ideas!

Dufour currently trains for Ski Club Sainte-Marie-aux- Mines under his personal coach and mentor Christophe Guinamard. Dufour reached international headlines to his sporting career, when he first won two silver medals each behind Canada's Jasey-Jay Anderson in the men's giant slalom and Austria's Benjamin Karl in the men's slalom at the 2009 FIS Snowboarding World Championships, earning him a ticket for the French team to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. In his official Olympic debut, Dufour recorded a second-fastest time of 1:16.79 in the seeding round of the men's giant slalom, but shortened his chances of adding another career medal after finishing behind Slovenia's Rok Flander in a first knockout round by 1.65 seconds. At the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Dufour qualified as a lone French athlete for two alpine snowboarding events (including the first ever men's parallel slalom) by finishing first from the FIS World Cup series in Carezza, Italy and in Sudelfeld, Germany. In the men's giant slalom, Dufour could not endure his surprising setback from Vancouver after delivering a fifteenth-fastest total time of 1:39.76 in the seeding run and eventually, finishing beyond a five- second margin behind US-born Russian snowboarder Vic Wild in the first round. Three days later, in the men's slalom, Dufour grabbed a tenth-seeded time of 59.43 to compete against Switzerland's Nevin Galmarini, who won the silver in giant slalom earlier, in the first round, but he was later disqualified after missing a gate each in both blue and red course races.

While digging near a waterfall, the idol of Jhandewali Mata and a stone lingam with carvings of nāga were found by him. Das built the temple on the spot. Since the hands of the idol were damaged during excavation, hands of silver were made and the original statue was consecrated in the cavern basement which came to be called \\"Maa Gufa Wali\\" (The Mother Goddess of Cave). A new replica of the idol was installed on the ground floor which came to be called \\"Maa Jhande Wali\\" (The Mother Goddess of Flag).

In the game, the protagonist is an orphan who transfers to Gekkoukan High School in Iwatodai City and discovers a phenomenon called the Dark Hour during which supernatural entities called Shadows roam freely. After awakening an ability within himself called Persona, the protagonist finds himself intertwined in the ongoing struggle against the Shadows with his new schoolmates. For PlayStation Portable's remake, a female version of the character was created by Atlus to provide more options to returning players and attract the female demographic. The male character is voiced by Akira Ishida in Japanese and by Yuri Lowenthal in English. The male was designed by Shigenori Soejima, who aimed to create an ordinary youth who the player could relate to while the female one was done to attract returning players and a female demographic. In the manga adaptation, he goes by the name Minato Arisato. His character was reworked for the animated film adaptation where director Noriaki Akitaya explained pressure in giving the silent character his own personality. In the musical adaptation Persona 3: The Weird Masquerade, his name was given as Sakuya Shiomi. In the movie adaptation and other Persona games, he goes by the name Makoto Yuki. He has also appeared in a number of series spin-off games with the female incarnation also appearing in Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth and Puzzle & Dragons, where she was given the name Kotone Shiomi. Critical reception to the protagonist's character has been generally positive. Design and characterization The Persona 3 protagonist was the first character Shigenori Soejima designed for the game. Early designs of the character made him look mature and collected since the artist viewed him as a \\"cliche[d] cool guy.\\" Soejima took longer to design the protagonist than any other character as the game's other characters would be made to complement his design. In Art of Persona 3, Soejima remarked that \\"Initially, he looked more honest, like an ordinary, handsome young man. But, I worked to achieve greater ambiguity in his expression.\\" He further noted that the character managed to have a \\"hidden coolness.\\" In retrospect, he found that the character was not ambiguous enough and thus when creating the Persona 4 protagonist, Soejima made Yu Narukami with the idea that his entire personality be decided and portrayed by the player's in-game actions and decisions. Director Noriaki Akitaya had faced a similar dilemma for his animated film version. He explained that one of his biggest challenges was, \\"...getting the protagonist, who is the player in the game, and making him into a character named Makoto Yuki for the film, then figuring out how to integrate him [the protagonist] into the story.\\" This led Akitaya to be extremely careful about how he went about constructing the character in terms of his speech, gestures and behavior all the while staying true to what was already established in the game. Akitaya admitted that he would not have been able to meet the expectations of the individual fans of the game since they were able to choose their own unique name and personality for the protagonist. Instead Akitaya took the route of incorporating the most general traits of fan reactions to the protagonist to form Yuki's character. The protagonist's maniacal laugh during the character's first Persona summoning was a point of interest for director Noriaki Akitaya. Akitaya stated that his favorite scene in the film occurred when the protagonist summoned his Persona for the first time. He elaborated that the protagonist's maniacal laugh and heavy breathing helped bring depth to the scene and establish animation director Keisuke Watabe's character designs as being one of the main attractions of the film. Akitaya had joked that during initial pre-production the protagonist's name was still not determined and instead proposed the placeholder until the first draft was developed. However even as Jun Kumagai began working on the screenplay, the placeholder went unchanged for the next four to five months and Akitaya found himself growing attached to it despite eventually changing it. Akira Ishida voiced the protagonist in this Japanese adaptation. He noted that since he was presented with the roles of both Pharos and the protagonist, recording the scene of the protagonist's initial meeting with Pharos was something he enjoyed. In the English version of Persona 3 the role of both the protagonist and Ryoji is taken by Yuri Lowenthal. As with his previous role as protagonist of the Digital Devil Saga games, Lowenthal did not have extensive dialogue lines. His main task was shouting out the names of Personas: localization editor Yu Namba was initially worried about his performance, but Lowenthal managed to pronounce the names correctly. He attributed this to his love for Dungeons & Dragons. Persona 3 Portable has the option to play as a female character. This selection alters some aspects of the story: the first Persona gained by the Protagonist, Orpheus, has a different appearance; Igor's assistant in the Velvet Room, Elizabeth, can be replaced with a male equivalent named Theodore.Atlus.com In making of this version of the protagonist, the staff aimed for a character whose new traits in comparison to the male would be new features for returning gamers as well as attract the female demographic. Designing her was challenging due to similarities with Rise Kujikawa and Mitsuru Kirijo. As result, the final design employs a less beautiful appearance. As they aimed for a beautiful design, Atlus asked the development team what kind of weapon a girl should wield. There were responses saying that girls look cute when they are brandishing about a massive weapon, or that so long as it looked cool it was good, so we went with the naginata. Additionally, the naginata was meant to contrast the male protagonist's Japanese sword. Appearances =In Persona 3= The protagonist of Persona 3. He moves into the Iwatodai dorm, learning of his ability to summon the Personas Orpheus and Thanatos of The Death Arcana when the dorm is attacked by Shadows during the Dark Hour. Mitsuru asks him to join SEES and he is later elected the team's leader in combat. The protagonist is unique among his cohorts in that he has the Wild Card ability which enables him to wield multiple Personas and switch between them during battle. Over the course of the game, he also gains Messiah of the Judgement Arcana and Orpheus Telos of the Fool Arcana in Persona 3 FES. With the power of the Wild Card he has access to over 150 different Personas. Over the course of the game, the player is challenged to manage the protagonist's day-to-day schedule as he attends school, takes part in extracurricular activities, and spends time with classmates and other characters. Igor, the proprietor of the Velvet Room, encourages the protagonist to form Social Links with people, as they will determine his potential in combat. As he works with SEES, the protagonist builds up the Social Link for the Fool Arcana, which symbolizes beginning and infinite possibilities of the journey ahead. When the protagonist decides to spare Ryoji Mochizuki, the Social Link of the Fool Arcana changes into the Judgement Arcana, which symbolizes the end of his journey and looking back at what has transpired this far. The protagonist is an orphan; his parents died ten years prior to the events of Persona 3, which sees him returning to the city he grew up in. In December, the player learns that a Shadow known as \\"Death\\" was sealed in the protagonist as a child by Aigis, who was unable to defeat it herself. The Death Shadow was able to lead the protagonist to twelve other greater Shadows; by defeating them, The Appriser was created, a being which summons Nyx to the world to bring about its destruction. SEES battles The Appriser on the roof of Tartarus, but are not able to stop Nyx's descent to Earth. The protagonist enters Nyx and using the power of his accumulated Social Links, seals it away with the \\"Great Seal\\"—at the cost of his own self. =Other appearances= Persona 3 FES extends upon the original game with the introduction of an epilogue called The Answer. These events reveal that the protagonist died after becoming the Great Seal used to seal Nyx away. After being led to the Great Seal, SEES discovers it to be under attack by a creature called Erebus. Although Makoto does not appear in Persona 4 and the sequel Persona 4 Arena, it is revealed in those games Igor's assistant Elizabeth left her position to find a way to rescue the protagonist from his fate as the Great Seal. In the PlayStation Portable port Persona 3 Portable, an option was added to control a female protagonist, voiced by Marina Inoue in Japanese and Laura Bailey in English. He is also featured in several radio dramas that tell new stories related to games. In the manga, the protagonist is named . There, he is portrayed as a quiet teenager who often is tired or drowsy, and likes to eat and cook food. The character also appears in the game Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth, where he joins forces with the Persona 4 cast to defeat the Shadows. In the stage musical adaption, Persona 3: The Weird Masquerade, the male protagonist is named and was portrayed by Shouta Aoi while the female version is named and was portrayed by Kana Asumi. In the anime film series Persona 3 The Movie and Persona 3: Dancing in Moonlight, he takes the name of .

GameSpy Patrick Joynt praised the character's social life in Persona 3 as it allowed the player to interact with several other characters and learn about their interesting stories. GamesRadar commented that while Makoto is a \\"Japanese RPG stereotype\\" it was refreshing to see him dealing with his social life.

He was also listed as the 10th best Persona character by Kimberley Wallace from Game Informer who found his role in Persona 3 admirable. Reaction to the character's portrayal in the animated film Persona 3 The Movie: #1 Spring of Birth was also met with praise. Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku described the protagonist as being an initially \\"ambivalent, broken character...\\" whose growth takes center stage and gave the film \\"a suitable sense of completion.\\" Elliot Gay from Japanator saw Makoto's growth from an \\"empty, aloof, and distant young man\\" who \\"lacks any kind of real determination to do anything\\" to his growth as a person as one of the film's main focus.

The addition of the female protagonist to Persona 3 Portable was praised for how different her interactions with other characters is according to IGN while also bring up potential replay value. Destructoid agreed, commenting especially on how the new alternate version of the protagonist can form romantical relationships with character the original game could not show. RPGFan agreed with IGN due to the time the player can spend with the female lead's relationships. GamesRadar stated that while at first the differences might be only cosmetic, the character's interactions with the cast, most notably Social Links characters are highly different.

The Werthein family, headed by Leon Werthein, his wife Raquel and five of their children emigrated to Argentina from Bessarabia in 1904, and settled in rural Miguel Riglos, La Pampa Province. Agriculture Three of Leon Werthein's sons; Gregorio, Numo and Noel (1911–2002), started a company in 1928 dedicated to manage agribusiness, and have maintained farming interests in Argentina ever since. Gregorio, Numo y Noel Werthein SA was founded in 1959 and includes extensive agricultural and fruit processing holdings. Its agricultural holdings include over 100,000 hectares (250,000 acres) of land and over 45,000 cattle, distributed in the Provinces of Buenos Aires, La Pampa, Santa Fe and San Luis. They produce wheat, corn, sunflowers, soybeans, cotton, popcorn, candy, sunflower oil, black beans, red beans, and beef as well as a Ranch division that specializes in developing high-quality genetics in the following breeds of cattle: Angus and Hereford (south), Brangus and Braford (North). The fruit area produces apples, pears, peaches, apricots, strawberries and plums in dried form and as a fruit juice concentrate. Banking and services Julio Werthein (born April 7, 1918) has been involved in the Argentine banking sector since 1940.InfoBae =Banco Mercantil Argentino= In 1963 Julio Werthein and his brothers established the Banco Mercantil Argentino. This bank was founded on September 18, 1928 as Banco Israelita Argentino SA, and renamed as Banco Mercantil Argentino SA on October 4, 1940. In 1998, the Banco Mercantil Argentino, with Banco Caja de Ahorro (Savings Bank), merged. In 2000, Banco SUDAMERIS Argentina acquired the Banco Caja de Ahorro, and after several subsequent mergers and organizational reforms, the Banco Mercantil is now the new Banco Patagonia,Banco Patagonia though the Werthein family no longer holds shares therein.Banco Patagonia: Relación con inversores In 1995, the Fundacion Banco Mercantil Argentino was established for the support of music, literature and fine arts.BNM =Los W SA= Numerous holdings of the Wertheins are managed under Los W SA aegis.

US$4,2 Bn and 21.500 employees. During the 20th century, the Group has successfully invested in agribusiness, telecommunications, financial services, gas and energy distribution, oil & gas, textile, vineyards and real estate. Los W has become a very prestigious and well-known group within the business community as a consequence of its strong local presence, excellent track- record, experience in several industries, and a persistent low profile. The Group strongly believes in its successful strategy based on the combination of international first tier institutional investors or a strategic player in partnership with a local prestigious and experienced group (i.e. Leucadia and Generali in Caja de Ahorro y Seguro; Telecom Italia in Telecom Argentina and Standard Bank in Standard Bank Argentina). Family Business History Leon Werthein emigrated from Russia in 1904 and came to Argentina, following difficult times in that empire, especially for Jewish people. The family settled in the countryside and started out a living from scratch, and fifty years later moved to the city to provide for the education of the children and the growth of the business. It is important to note that the growth of the family lead to two different processes of family separation. The first one was in 1973 and the second one in 1992.

It begins at the Ahr spring (Ahrquelle) in Blankenheim in the county of Euskirchen (North Rhine-Westphalia) and runs generally eastwards. At its southernmost point it enters the county of Ahrweiler, and hence the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Running through the collective municipality of Adenau the valley bends northeast at its confluence with the Adenauer Bach and reaches the collective municipality of Altenahr, from where it resumes its characteristic west to east course, albeit interrupted by meanders. Here begins the section that is known as the Ahr valley (Ahrtal) in a touristic sense. Here it is characterized by vineyards on the south-facing slopes and a picturesque rocky landscape, carved out by the river creating a 300 metre deep gorge in the Ahr Hills. In the next stage the Ahr reaches the area of the county town of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, before finally discharging into the Rhine south of Remagen in the borough of Sinzig. Historic view of the Ahr valley near Altenahr Vineyards in the valley near Mayschoß The Ahr below the Bunte Kuh (upper right) above Walporzheim The renaturalised mouth of the Ahr south of Kripp  Course  = Upper Ahr valley = From its head, the Ahr valley runs through a rolling uplands with pastures, woods and occasional hamlets or farmsteads. It is followed by the B 258 federal highway. The first noteworthy villages are Ahrhütte and Ahrdorf, in the municipality of Blankenheim. The Ahr valley then becomes gradually narrower and reaches its southernmost point where it leaves the state of Northe Rhine-Westphalia. The first village in Rhineland-Palatinate that it encounters is Dorsel, on the heights above the valley. In Müsch the B 258 leaves the Ahr valley, and the L 73 then accompanies the river, which is still small at this stage. From here the valley runs through Antweiler to Fuchshofen, almost northwards, before swinging almost due east from Schuld, passing Insul and reaching Dümpelfeld where it is joined by the B 257\\\\. Here, at its confluence with the Adenauer Bach, coming from the south, the Ahr heads northeast, leaves the collective municipality (VG) of Adenau and reaches the collective municipality village of Altenahr south of Liers, which belongs to Hönningen gehörenden. This is now the middle course of the Ahr, the Mittelahr. = Middle Ahr valley = The valley runs initially northeastwards from Hönningen via Ahrbrück, Pützfeld, Kreuzberg and Altenburg to Altenahr. From Ahrbrück the B 257 is joined by the Ahr Valley Railway which follows the valley to the Rhine. At Altenahr the valley bends east and initially has an extremely meandering course. Here, the river is accompanied by the B 267, although it does not follow every bend. In Altenahr is the start of the great Ahr loop (Ahrschleife) which is protected dued to its flora and fauna. From here the valley is ravine-like, its rugged rock faces cutting into the Ahr Hills. From Reimerzhoven there are extensive vineyards especially on the northern side of the river (i.e. on the south- facing slopes). Near Laach the Ahr runs round another loop in the valley and then passes the wine villages of Mayschoß, Rech, Dernau and Marienthal before finally reaching the territory of the town of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler. The last narrow portion of the Ahr valley lies below the Bunte Kuh (\\"Coloured Cow\\"), a rock formation that reaches almost to the river and leaves hardly any room for road and railway. In Walporzheim the valley bottom broadens suddenly into the Lower Ahr Valley (untere Ahrtal). = Lower Ahr valley = The lower Ahr valley is also dominated by vineyards. The Ahr flows through the settlements of Ahrweiler, Bad Neuenahr, Heppingen and Heimersheim, where the vineyards end. The valley floor between Bad Bodendorf on the northern edge and Sinzig on a terrace to the south, is characterised by arable farming, fruit and vegetable growing. The confluence of the Ahr with the Golden Mile of the Rhine near Kripp has an almost natural character and is a nature reserve.  Economy  The Ahr Valley is primarily known for its wine. The wine festivals that take place in the various wine villages and towns from the beginning of September to the end of October play an important role in regional tourism, especially in Altenahr, Mayschoß, Rech, Dernau, Walporzheim, Ahrweiler and Heimersheim. The region and the Volcanic Eifel to the south are also known for the production of mineral water; for example, the iron-rich springs (e. g. the Apollinaris Spring) have made Bad Neuenahr into a spa town. Tourism has been a steadily growing part of the economy for many years. The area immediately around the springs in Blankenheim, but mainly the Middle Ahr Valley between Altenahr and Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler benefit from this. The county town has meanwhile become one of the three most popular tourist stays in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Among the villages along the Ahr, Dernau is representative - here its transformation from local wine village to a national tourist destination has been the most striking.  Culture and sights  Among the sights in the Ahr Valley are the Roman villa of Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, an excavation of a Roman settlement in Ahrweiler, next to the Red Wine Trail (Rotweinwanderweg). Near Bad Neuenahr the Ahr Valley is crossed by the prominent Ahr Viaduct that carries the A 61 motorway. The 1.5-kilometre-long, prestressed concrete bridge, completed in 1975, with its 50-metre-high concrete pillars, dominates this part of the valley. During the Cold War the Ahr Valley was envisaged as a safe location for the central organs of the federal government. Below the vineyards near Marienthal, a concealed government bunker was built in 1962 in a wider section of the valley between Dernau and Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler. It has been largely dismantled and, in March 2008, was opened to the public as a documentation site for the Cold War. For hikers the Ahr Valley has the following attractions: * the Ahr Path (AhrSteig) with its two blue and red sections and a total of six stages, which has been nominated as a \\"Quality Path of Hiking Germany\\" (Qualitätsweg Wanderbares Deutschland) by the German Rambling Association (Deutscher Wanderverband). * the Red Wine Trail (Rotweinwanderweg), that winds its way from Altenahr to Bad Neuenahr through the vineyards and continues to Bad Bodendorf.Red Wine Trail at Romantic Germany.

For cyclists: * the Ahr Cycleway (Ahr-Radweg), which runs mainly along the Ahr from its mouth in Sinzig and has only a gentle gradient.  Transport and infrastructure  The Ahr Valley Railway runs from Remagen initially double-tracked, before reducing to a single track from Walporzheim, to Ahrbrück. The line is closed beyond that point.  References   Literature  * Vera Kettenbach: Das Ahrtal von Bad Bodendorf bis Altenahr. Gaasterland-Verlag, 3.

Its role is to gather and champion the views of users of health and social care services, in order to identify improvements and influence providers' plans. The Healthwatch network is made of up of local Healthwatch groups in each of England's local authority areas, and Healthwatch England, the national body. Organisation Healthwatch England is a statutory body whose purpose is to understand the needs, experiences and concerns of people who use health and social care services and to speak out on their behalf. The local groups work together to share information, expertise and learning in order to improve health and social care services. When established, the organisation was hosted by the Care Quality Commission but reported directly to the Department of Health. However, in January 2016, in a move seen as downgrading the organisation after the departure of its first Chief Executive, it was announced that a new national director would be appointed who would report to the Chief Executive of the CQC. David Behan said that although the national director would report to him, they would be able to criticise the work of the CQC if necessary. Sir Robert Francis was appointed chair in September 2018. Predecessor organisations Healthwatch is the latest reorganisation of arrangements to involve patients and the public in the running of the NHS in England. Community Health Councils (CHC) were established in 1974 and abolished in 2003 to be replaced by Public and Patient Involvement Forums\\"Will Healthwatch give patients a better deal?\\", The Guardian. Accessed 8 December 2014. run by the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health. They were replaced in their turn in April 2008 by Local Involvement Networks. Community Health Councils continue in Wales. Scotland has a quite different system run by the Scottish Health Council. Resources The 148 local Healthwatch groups were allocated £43.5m by the Department of Health in 2013 but the groups only received £33.5m of this – leaving £10m unaccounted for. Anna Bradley, chair of Healthwatch England,\\"Anna Bradley, chair of Healthwatch England: standing up for patients\\", The Guardian. Accessed 8 December 2014. said: \\"This discovery is hugely disappointing. Less than 4p out of every £10,000 spent on health and social care was allocated to champion the cause of consumers in the first place and even this tiny amount is failing to reach those charged with speaking out on behalf of their local communities. The tragedies of Audrey Paley, Mid Staffs, Morecambe Bay and Winterbourne View all highlight what happens when the system fails to listen.\\" Almost a third of councils cut their local Healthwatch budgets in 2015–16 by an average of 14%, Blackpool and Hounslow by more than half. For 2018–19 it was planned that the 152 local Healthwatch services should receive £26,064,086 from local authorities to carry out their statutory activities, 35.3% less than was originally planned in 2013. This paid for 408 full-time equivalent staff. Local Healthwatch organisations also engage a considerable number of volunteers. In November 2018 it was announced that NHS England and NHS Improvement were to make \\"significant investment\\" into the organization in order to encourage participation in the development of the NHS's long term plan. Local Healthwatch The announced intention was that each local Healthwatch would be an independent organisation, able to employ its own staff and involve volunteers and accountable in its own right. Plans to make the local Healthwatch in Leicester an independent organisation were thwarted by Voluntary Action Leicester who had been charged with establishing the organisation but would not hand over the contract to the newly established Healthwatch Leicester Ltd. National activity The organisation produced a report entitled Safely Home: what happens when people leave hospital and care settings? in July 2015, which was based on thousands of shocking stories about what happened when people left hospital without the right planning and support. Criticism The 2015 People's Inquiry into London's NHS recommended that Healthwatch England be closed down, with local Healthwatch bodies separated from the Care Quality Commission and modelled on the old Community Health Councils. They should link up with local community organisations, pensioners' groups and other community organisations, and be given statutory powers to inspect hospital and community services, to object to changes which lack public acceptance, and to force a decision on contested changes from the Secretary of State.

The hospital is both owned and operated by the Fraser Health Authority (FHA). Overview FCH is a 10-bed hospital and provides services including: 24/7 emergency care stabilization and triage and hospice beds and services. Emergency care stabilization and triage 24/7 is a critical need for Fraser Canyon Hospital due to its geographic isolation and the number of travellers using the major highways that converge in the area. Hospital Services Directory One such traveller was Grand Chief Stewart Phillip who was triaged at FCH in 2014 after his car flipped over. On April 17, 1999, an 8-year-old girl playing near Kawkawa Lake Camp was treated at FCH after being attacked by young female cougar. History The establishment of a hospital was a political issue in the 1950s, escalated by the 1956 Slesse Mountain airplane crash that killed all 62 people on board. Efforts and assets by the local Medical Clinic Association to set up a privately operated facility were transferred to the Hope Hospital Association to build and operate a government-backed hospital. Area MLA Irvine Finlay Corbett of the British Columbia Social Credit Party was an advocate but died in his own air crash prior to the opening of the hospital. Health Minister Eric Martin officially opened FCH on January 10, 1959. The 20-bed hospital was complete with delivery and operating rooms.Simone Rolph - Hope Standard, Published: 14 January 2009 In 2001, its governance transferred from the Fraser Valley Health Region to the newly created and larger Fraser Health Authority as part of a province-wide restructuring of health authorities.

The title is derived from \\"Georgie Porgie\\", a 19th-century English nursery rhyme. The story is about a neurotic and celibate vicar, George, who is pursued by lustful spinsters in his country parish.  Plot summary  The story is narrated by a sexually repressed vicar, George, who dislikes any kind of physical contact with women, though he appreciates their beauty. This becomes a problem in the village where his parish is, as the local spinsters try to seduce him. His anxieties may stem from a memory of his late mother, who, seeking to educate her young son, showed him a rabbit giving birth in a cage in their garage. The rabbit, however, then swallowed its baby whole, and George fled terrified into the night. His mother pursued, but was struck and killed by a car. Constantly but painfully rebuffed by George, the spinsters increase their efforts to ensnare him over a period of years, and in an effort to understand their psychology he performs an experiment with rats taken from a choirboy. He separates males from females for three weeks, estimating a translation into three years of human abstinence. He then puts all the rats in the same box, dividing the sexes with a small electric fence. The first rat to try to breach the fence is male, but from that point forth only the females try crossing it, killing themselves one by one as they grow more desperate to reach the males. From these results George draws the conclusion that women are naturally predatory and sexually driven, absolving himself from any blame in the spinsters' behaviour. He decides to cultivate a cold and severe manner, thereby deterring further advances. He is invited to a party hosted by Lady Birdwell, at which he is distant and sardonic with every woman he meets. That is until Miss Roach, a handsome and kindly middle-aged spinster, makes him what she says is a soft fruit drink. He loosens up (it is implied Miss Roach spiked his drink with alcohol), agrees to walk alone with her, and they end up in a summer house where George, apparently in a state of intoxication, starts kissing Miss Roach. She then appears to open her mouth into a large, daunting cave and, like the rabbit George saw as a boy, swallow him whole. He tries clinging to bits of her mouth, but slips easily down her throat until he lands in her stomach, where he meets several other men, mostly in white coats. The implication is that, after attacking Miss Roach in the summer house, he was sectioned, and the men are doctors. From \\"inside\\" Miss Roach he hears the spinsters call him a \\"sex maniac\\" and \\"sadist\\", while it's suggested he maimed Miss Roach's mouth. He's happy to be where he is, however, because he worries that if he gets out the spinsters will catch him. The story ends with another man, possibly a psychiatrist, trying to convince George to escape with him, but George insists they are safer where they are.  Adaptations  The story was dramatised in series two, episode nine of Tales of the Unexpected, first broadcast April 26, 1980. It was written by Robin Chapman and directed by Graham Evans. Joan Collins played both George's mother and Miss Roach. George was played by John Alderton.

He made his mark in the twelve-round lightweight slugfest against Omar Figueroa in July 2013, that earned him the nickname after the film Rocky. \\"The Japanese lefty gained a zillion fans with his rumble last year against Figueroa,\\" TheSweetScience.com's Michael Woods said in 2014. He is the former Japanese and OPBF (Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation) lightweight champion.  Early life and amateur career  Arakawa was born in Musashino, Tokyo, Japan, and move to Fussa soon after. Fussa is the city well known by U.S. Air Force Base and Ryū Murakami's novel Almost Transparent Blue. He enjoyed basketball with fellow kids while living there from the age of two to thirteen, then relocated to Minamiizu, Shizuoka. He became involved in middle-distance running and tennis during junior high school, and served as the captain and pitcher for the high school's baseball team. It was also during high school that he watched the Félix Trinidad fights on WOWOW and was inclined into boxing. He later told that his most favorite fight as of May 2013 was Trinidad vs. Fernando Vargas in December 2000. After five years' stay in Minamiizu, he went back to Fussa and lived there until he moved to Hachioji in March 2012. He started boxing at the age of nineteen at Hirotaka Nakaya's Hachioji Nakaya Boxing Gym in Hachioji. His amateur record was only 4-1 (3 KOs) that won him a minor title in the light welterweight class.  Professional career  On February 10, 2004, Arakawa made a start to his professional career with a first round knockout at the Korakuen Hall. He defeated Yoshitaka Katō to be crowned the East Japan Rookie King in November 2005, and won the All-Japan Rookie King Tournament in December of that year. He rematched Katō in September 2006 where he suffered his first loss in a close decision. Issei Nakaya of Hachioji Nakaya Promotions had promoted Arakawa until the end of 2014. after having visited boxing venues around the world over years. = Regional title fights = In September 2008, Arakawa faced Filipino Randy Suico for the OPBF lightweight title, but the fight ended in a majority draw.  Japanese title  Arakawa won the Japanese lightweight title via a majority decision from Akihiro Kondō in April 2010, after being knocked down for the first time in his career in round one. In his second defense in January 2011, he stopped Hiroshi Nakamori in the eighth round after being floored again in round two. In May 2011, he went to Guadalajara, Mexico for a two-week workout at Julian Magdaleno Gym () where Saúl Álvarez has been training. He defended his title three times all by stoppage before vacating it.  OPBF title  Arakawa successively captured the vacant OPBF lightweight title via a split decision over Filipino fighter Jay Solmiano in October 2011. It was a tough-fought close bout with Solmiano scoring a knockdown in round two. After defending his title against fellow Japanese Ryūji Migaki by a unanimous decision, he travelled to Los Angeles to spar with Miguel Vázquez and others for over a month. He stopped compatriot Takehiro Shimada in round eight in his second defense in August 2012 while throwing over a hundred punches each in two rounds, and then vacated his title. = Arakawa vs. Daniel Estrada = In November 2012, Arakawa competed with Mexican Pedro Daniel Estrada in Mexico City on the main event of the Gala Ring Telmex 2012. It was a WBC Silver lightweight title bout and was a title eliminator with a shot at Adrien Broner on the line. After eleven rounds, Estrada was called as the winner with a technical decision. Its refereeing processes and outcome caused controversy in Japan, and more in Mexico. The WBC's official Twitter account tweeted as follows: \\"There was a controversy in that fight where the winner would be fighting for the title, but because there was this problem, the WBC demanded a rematch. That is a fight for all ring officials to look at.\\" A rematch between them never happened. = Arakawa vs. Omar Figueroa = On July 27, 2013, Arakawa made his U.S. debut at the event dubbed Knockout Kings II at the AT&T; Center in San Antonio, Texas. His opponent fighting out of the blue corner was the undefeated Mexican-American fighter Omar Figueroa, Jr. and the WBC interim lightweight title was at stake. The interim title bout was made when reigning champion Adrien Broner decided to challenge the WBA welterweight title. The incredibly tough fight that was aired live on Showtime Championship Boxing, and on WOWOW in Japan, ended in Figueroa's victory by a unanimous decision. RingTV.com's Douglass Fischer told as follows: \\" no fighter raised his stature during the course of one fight as much as Japanese veteran Nihito Arakawa did with the heroic effort he put forth against Omar Figueroa Jr. last July in San Antonio,\\" Fischer later described. At the year's end, MaxBoxing.com's Steve Kim awarded him the Purple Heart. = Arakawa vs. Jorge Linares = On March 8, 2014, Arakawa came back to the ring to face Japan-based Venezuelan Jorge Linares in a ten-round WBC title eliminator, with a mandatory shot against Omar Figueroa on the line. It was featured on the undercard of the fight between Saúl Álvarez and Alfredo Angulo at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. Figueroa was to fight in the same event, but a wrist injury forced him to postpone it. That is why Arakawa- Linares was carried live on Showtime pay-per-view. Arakawa was again fighting out of the red corner, but lost in a unanimous decision. In the second half of 2014, he defeated Kondō in their rematch in July, and lost to Katō in their rubber match in December, both by unanimous decision at Korakuen Hall. Arakawa then transferred to Hitoshi Watanabe's Watanabe Boxing Gym in April 2015. Among his new stable-mates are Takashi Uchiyama, Kōhei Kōno and Ryōichi Taguchi.  Two nicknames  Arakawa's nickname is \\"The Baby-faced Sniper\\" because of his quite accurate shots. He is originally a sleek jabbing southpaw. Another characteristic is volume punching. From time to time, he has waged tough fights. His effort might be unsuccessful in one aspect and successful in another. According to Arakawa, the most tough fight for him was the OPBF title defense against Jay Solmiano in October 2011. Ryūji Migaki said in early 2012 that it would be Arakawa's nature. His style in the Omar Figueroa fight in July 2013 earned him a new nickname \\"Japanese Rocky\\". During and after the fight, Mauro Ranallo summarize his style as \\"Bushido\\".

Early entrepreneurs Land drainage works were expensive, and were usually undertaken in sparsely populated areas. In the seventeenth century a number of such schemes were carried out by Adventurers, who acted under parliamentary sanction, but who financed the works carried out themselves. In return, they gained rights to the land reclaimed as a result of the civil engineering works. One such scheme was the draining of the Bedford Levels. The Bedford Level Corporation was in charge of the works, which when conceived in 1630, would create large tracts of \\"summer lands\\", which would be suitable for grazing during the summer months, but would still be liable to flooding in the winter. Funds for the work were provided by the Earl of Bedford and thirteen other Adventurers. Of the land reclaimed, the fourteen men were to receive , to be shared between them, while were to be given to the king, and another were designated to provide income to maintain the works once they were completed. The Dutch engineer Cornelius Vermuyden was employed to carry out the work, and on 12 October 1637, it was judged to be complete, when the Court of Sewers met at St Ives. However, there was dissatisfaction with the decision, and the Royal Commission of Sewers overturned it in 1639, when they met at Huntingdon. An Act of Parliament passed in 1649 authorised the fifth Earl of Bedford to carry out further work, so that the land could be used throughout the year for agriculture. Another Act followed in 1660, but after initial improvements, the schemes gradually deteriorated, and the Bedford Level Corporation found it increasingly difficult to find anyone prepared to invest their money, when the outcome was so full of risk. As well as the engineering challenges faced by the Adventurers, there was also opposition from those who judged that their livelihood was affected by the works. In 1631, a group of Adventurers led by Sir Anthony Thomas were authorised to drain the East Fen, the West Fen and the Wildmore Fen, to the north and west of Boston, Lincolnshire. They spent some £30,000 on the work, and received of the drained land. They subsequently spent £20,000 on improvements and buildings, and the land generated some £8,000 per year in rent. The land had previously been extra-parochial, on which people from adjacent villages had grazing rights. After seven years, the Commoners rioted in 1642, breaking down the sluices, destroying crops, and demolishing houses. The Adventurers took their case to the House of Lords, who passed a bill for the \\"relief and security of the drainers\\", but the House of Commons were less supportive, refusing to take sides. They ordered that the Sheriff and the local Justices of the Peace should act to prevent and suppress riots. The Commoners then took their grievances to court, and won. The outcome was that when the monarchy was restored in 1661, management of the Fens returned to the Court of Sewers, and remained in a poor state until the mid eighteenth century. To the south of Boston, the Earl of Lindsay and another group of Adventurers faced similar problems. Having reached an agreement with the Court of Sewers, they worked on draining the Lindsay Levels, the main feature of which was the South Forty-Foot Drain, running for from Bourne to Boston. The land reclaimed was suitable for agriculture, and in 1636 they took possession of it, building houses and growing crops. Again, Commoners and Fenmen felt that they had been dispossessed, and attempted to get Parliament to rule in their favour. After three years, they gave up their attempts at a legal solution, and took direct action, destroying the drains, buildings and crops. In the political turmoil of the time, just prior to the start of the civil war, the Adventurers received no compensation for their loss.

Lack of interest from OEMs, particularly IBM (who previously gave Microsoft multitasking code on IBM PC DOS included with TopView), led to it being released only in a scaled-back form. It is sometimes referred to as European MS-DOS 4.0, as it was primarily used there. It should not be confused with PC DOS 4.00 or MS-DOS 4.01 and later, which did not contain the multi- tasking features.  History  Apricot Computers pre-announced \\"MS-DOS 4.0\\" in early 1986, and Microsoft demonstrated it in September of that year at a Paris trade show. However, only a few European OEMs, such as and International Computers Limited (ICL), actually licensed releases of the software. In particular, IBM declined the product, concentrating instead on improvements to MS-DOS 3.x and their new joint development with Microsoft to produce OS/2. As a result, the project was scaled back, and only those features promised to particular OEMs were delivered. In September 1987, a version of multi-tasking MS-DOS 4.1 was reported to be developed for the ICL DRS Professional Workstation (PWS). No further releases were made once the contracts had been fulfilled. In July 1988, IBM announced \\"IBM DOS 4.0\\", an unrelated product continuing from DOS 3.3 and 3.4, leading to initial conjecture that Microsoft might release it under a different version number. However, Microsoft eventually released it as \\"MS-DOS 4.0\\", with a MS-DOS 4.01 following quickly to fix issues many had reported.  Features  As well as minor improvements such as support for the New Executable file format, the key feature of the release was its support for preemptive multitasking. This did not use the protected mode available on 80386 processors, but allowed specially-written programs to continue executing in a \\"background mode\\", where they had no access to user input and output until returned to the foreground. The OS was reported to include a time-sliced scheduler and interprocess communication via pipes and shared memory. This limited form of multitasking was considered to be more useful in a server rather than workstation environment, particularly coupled with MS-Net 2.0, which was released simultaneously. Other limitations of MS-DOS 3.0 remained, including the inability to use memory above 640 KB, and this contributed to the product's lack of adoption, particularly in light of the need to write programs specifically targeted at the new environment. INT 21h/AH=87h can be used to distinguish between the multitasking MS-DOS 4.x and the later MS-DOS/PC DOS 4.x issues. Microsoft president Jon Shirley described it as a \\"specialized version\\" and went as far as saying \\"maybe we shouldn't have called it DOS 4.0\\", although it's not clear whether this was always the intention, or if a more enthusiastic response from OEMs would have resulted in it being the true successor to DOS 3.x. The marketing positioned it as an additional option between DOS 3.x for workstations, and Xenix for higher-end servers and multiuser systems. =External commands= MS-DOS Version 4.10.20 supports the following external commands:MS-DOS Version 4.10 Fujitsu ICL OEM * APPEND * ASSIGN * ATTRIB * BACKUP * CHKDSK * COMMAND * DEBUG * DETACH * DISKCOMP * DISKCOPY * EDLIN * EXE2BIN * FC * FDISK * FIND * FORMAT * GRAFTABL * GRAPHICS * GWBASIC * HEADPARK * INSTALLX * JOIN * LABEL * LINK4 * MODE * MORE * MOUS * PERM0 * PRINT * QUEUER * RECOVER * REPLACE * RESTORE * SETUP * SHARE * SORT * SUBST * SYS * TREE * XCOPY See also * Concurrent DOS, Concurrent DOS 286, Concurrent DOS 386 - Concurrent CP/M-based multiuser multitasking OS with DOS emulator since 1983 *DOS Plus - Concurrent PC DOS- based multitasking OS with DOS emulator since 1985 *Novell DOS, OpenDOS, DR- DOS - successors of DOS Plus with preemptive multitasking in VDMs since 1993 *FlexOS - successor of Concurrent DOS 286 since 1986 *4680 OS, 4690 OS - successors of FlexOS 286 and FlexOS 386 since 1986 *Multiuser DOS - successor of Concurrent DOS 386 since 1991 *REAL/32 - successor of Multiuser DOS since 1995 * PC-MOS/386 - multiuser multitasking DOS clone since 1987 * VM/386 - multiuser multitasking DOS environment since 1987 * TopView - DOS-based multitasking environment since 1985 * DESQview, DESQview/X - DOS-based multitasking environment since 1985 * Virtual DOS machine * Datapac Australasia References Further reading  * Category:1986 software Category:Discontinued Microsoft operating systems Category:Disk operating systems Category:DOS variants Category:Proprietary operating systems Category:Assembly language software ","title":"MS-DOS 4.0 (multitasking)"},{"id":"42212133","text":"Tunstall is a village within the civil parish of Halvergate in the Broadland district of Norfolk, England.

Early years Charles Étienne Raymond Victor de Verninac was born in Paris, France, on 19 November 1803, the only child of the diplomat Raymond de Verninac Saint-Maur and Henriette de Verninac, sister of Eugène Delacroix. The couple took care of Delacroix in 1814 after the death of his mother. He became attached to his nephew, Charles, who was just five years younger than him. When Charles came to Paris to attend the Lycée Louis-le- Grand, Delacroix acted as his informal guardian. Career In 1821 Charles de Verninac graduated and returned to live with his parents in the country. After his father died in 1822 he returned to Paris and began to study law. He graduated in 1824 and worked in Paris until 1829. Around 1826 Delacroix painted his portrait in a work that is both sensitive and sentimental. In 1829 he entered the diplomatic corps.

Neues Museum, Berlin Cypriot Bichrome ware is a type of Late Bronze Age, and Iron Age, pottery that is found widely on Cyprus and in the Eastern Mediterranean. This type of pottery is found in many sites on Cyprus, in the Levant, and also in Egypt. It was typically produced on a pottery wheel. A large variety of decorations and motifs are attested. This pottery is very similar to certain types of the Mycenaean pottery from various locations. It was originally produced on Cyprus during the Late Cypriot I period. Comparison of the fabrics indicates that it was also imitated in the Eastern Levant and in Egypt. Typology Cypriot Bichrome is characterized by its most common decoration: two black lines with a red line in between. Between those lines geometric, floral or zoomorphic decorations would often appear. For a long time, Bichrome Ware was considered to be a key marker for the beginning of the Late Bronze Age. However, recent studies indicate a slightly earlier appearance. Chronology Bichrome Ware, Archaic I, 750–600 BC, from Salamis, Cyprus The following periods are distinguished on Cyprus. *Cypro-Geometric Period (1050–750 BC) This is a wheel-made pottery featuring rich and symmetrical painted decoration of parallel lines, bands, concentric circles, rhombi, checked, meanders, rosettes, lotus flowers, papyruses and various other floral and geometrical motifs. The Cypro-Geometric period is still not fully understood and is much debated. The main point of contention is the continuity between the end of the Bronze Age and the early Geometric period. During the Cypro-Geometric I Period (1050–950 BC), the following types of pottery were produced on Cyprus other than the Bichrome: White Painted, Plain White, and Black Slip potteries.Gjerstad's Iron Age Pottery Typology & Chronology, Harvard Semitic Museum *Archaic Period (750–475 BC) This period is distinguished by the jugs of the free field style. They feature unique schematised bichrome type representations of bulls, birds, fishes and additional decorative forms. *Cypro-Classical Period (475–325 BC) A type of Bichrome pottery (Bichrome VII) was produced as late as the Cypro-Classical Period.Gjerstad's Iron Age Pottery Typology & Chronology, Harvard Semitic Museum By this time, the artists of Cyprus were most heavily influenced by the art of mainland Greece, but Cypriot idiosyncrasies, such as the pitchers with figural spouts still existed. The human figure made more regular appearances in art than in previous ages, and sculpture became popular on large and minuscule scales.The Docent Collections Handbook, 2007: Geometric and Archaic Art in Cyprus (PDF file) Scientific analysis A noted nuclear scientist Isadore Perlman undertook the analysis of numerous Cypriot ceramics sent to him by the Swedish archaeologist, Einar Gherstad, when he pioneered high-precision methods of neutron activation analysis at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in the US. Neutron activation analysis helps to determine the origin of ancient pottery and other artifacts through the analysis of the clay from which they were made. He was helped in the project by another noted scientist Frank Asaro. Second millennium BC pottery from Cyprus was one of the first archaeological projects that Perlman and Asaro undertook. The project of the origin of the then assumed Second Millennium Palestinian Bichrome Ware was undertaken as part of the PhD thesis of Michal Artzy. This project was chosen because the archaeology for that period in that area was rather confused, and Perlman hoped to add some clarity to the matter.ISADORE PERLMAN, 1915-1991: A Biographical Memoir by GLENN T. SEABORG AND FRANK ASARO (PDF file). NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES Aided by the Swedish archaeologist Einar Gjerstad, they obtained 1,200 pottery sherds excavated by the Swedish Cyprus Expedition in 1927-31. Up until that time, the distinctive type pottery called \\"Bichrome Ware,\\" first found in Tel Ajjul in Palestine by the archaeologist Sir Flinders Petrie, was believed to originate in Palestine. This pottery was very common all over the Levant. The Berkeley group showed that, in fact, the chemical composition of the pieces matched the composition of Cyprus-made pottery, which meant that these items were later exported to Palestine and other areas, a result that had extensive ramifications on the archaeology of the Eastern Mediterranean.The Origin of the \\"Palestinian\\" Bichrome Ware\\", (M.

Asaro, “Cypriote Imports at Ras Shamra,” Israel Exploration Journal 31 1981 Thus, it was found that the fast wheel was used in Cyprus in the second millennium BC (which was not known before). Also, many types of pottery previously believed to have originated in Ras Shamra-Ugarit, now in Syria (M. Artzy, I. Perlman and F. Asaro), had actually been made in Cyprus.

Haiti is impacted by structural violence, a form of dysfunction where social structures prevent certain groups of people from having access to basic human rights, like education and healthcare. This has resulted from its colonial history, and from decades of political instability and social unrest. Additionally, Haitians are financially impoverished and within Haiti, there exist social inequalities. In 2012, 58.5% of its population was below its poverty line. Educational standards within the nation are low, where its literacy rate is about 60.7%, below the 84.1% global average. Haiti is also globally ranked lower than most other nations in various measurements of health outcomes. Such health outcomes include life expectancy, mortality rates, and disease levels. While there has been some international assistance, there are insufficient supportive infrastructures in place within the country to provide resources and opportunities for Haitians who are trying to attain a higher quality of life. Causes that have resulted in higher levels of structural violence within Haiti include political instability and corruption, as well as the impact of post-colonialism, which has established a caste-based class system within Haiti. Definition of structural violence As defined by Medical Anthropologist Dr. Paul Farmer, structural violence is the way by which social arrangements are constructed to put specific members of a population in harm's way. According to Dr. Farmer, social inequalities are at the heart of structural violence, where the prevailing societal framework imposes invisible barriers that perpetuate the suffering of certain groups of people. The term structural violence was first coined by Johan Galtung, the founder of peace and conflict studies, in 1969. The term further gained exposure when it was used by Latin American liberation theologians. These social arrangements are termed structural as they are embedded into the cultural, political and economic realms of society. The term violence highlights the fact that these structures cause injury or inequality to certain groups of peoples and constrain individual agency in the society in which they operate. While structural violence exists in other parts of the world, its effects are more readily identified within Haiti. Compounding factors While the negative effects of structural violence affects almost everyone in the nation of Haiti, there are a number of social factors that render certain demographics of the population to experience a more severe form of human suffering. These include gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. =Gender= Haitian girls While structural violence impacts Haiti as a whole, due to the presence of gender inequality, women within Haiti tend to be more heavily impacted by structural violence than men. In the 2004 United Nations Development Fund for Women report, Haitian women were found to remain as the target of oppression, independent of any political change within the nation. Among the 43% of households which are headed by women, more than 80% are reported to be living in poverty. Moreover, according to the 2000 UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, a report on Haiti noted that structural gender disparities have made Haitian women disproportionately susceptible to physical violence, but also excluded from various forms of protection. For example, spousal rape is not regarded as a crime under Haiti's judicial system. Other forms of legal discrimination against women and girls include differentiated wage levels, as well as unequal penalties for both adultery and divorce. =Race / ethnicity= Racial or ethnic differentiation has been well acknowledged as a means of depriving certain racial or ethnic groups of basic human rights, or from receiving the same quality of resources as others. In Haiti's context, such social discrimination exists predominantly from two areas: Antihaitianismo, which is the racial bias against Haitians and descendants of Haitians by Dominicans, and remnants of the Haitian colonial hierarchy via caste discrimination. While Haitian mulattoes make up 5% of the Haitian population, they are regarded as the upper class and control approximately 44% of the national income. =Socioeconomic status= The Human Suffering Index (HSI), which examines measures of human welfare ranging from life expectancy to political freedom, listed Haiti to be one of the 27 of 141 countries characterized by \\"extreme human suffering\\". Coming from a lower socioeconomic background can render individuals and groups to be more vulnerable to \\"extreme human suffering\\". This is because economic and political structural barriers tend to have a greater impact on those who are lower down on the social order, or are affected by poverty. This stems from the fact that those who are of lower classes often have limited access to resources or do not share the quality of resources that those of higher socio- economic classes have access to. UNICEF statistics show that while less than 10% of births among the poorest 20% in Haiti had a skilled attendant present, 78.1% of all births had a skilled attendant present for the richest 20%. Underweight prevalence among the poorest 20% is 4.7 times greater than that of the richest 20%. Economically, the poorest 40% make up 8% of the nation's total household income, while the richest 20% make up 63%. Impacts of structural violence =Poverty= Slums in the area of Bas-Ravine, in the northern part of Cap-Haïtien The impacts of structural violence are far reaching. They affect individuals, and overall social outcomes. Poverty is one of the biggest by-products of structural violence, as structural violence inhibits individuals and communities from achieving basic human rights. These basic rights include access to healthcare and education. As identified by the 2012 World Development Report, health and education are two key human capital endowments that can influence an individual's ability to reach his or her full potential in society. Due to the inability to receive proper education and maintain good health, individuals impacted by structural violence often are less well-positioned to attain better socio-economic opportunities or to be upwardly mobile. In 2012, Haiti was the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, with approximately 58.5% of its population lived below the nation's poverty line. The Gini coefficient for Haiti was 59.2 in 2001, making it the 7th highest nation in terms of its degree of inequality in the distribution of family income. =Education= Structural violence impacts one's ability to receive education. Haiti's literacy rate is about 60.7%, below the 90% average literacy rate for Latin American and other Caribbean countries. Due to the oppressive political and economic structures that are plaguing the nation, the educational sector in Haiti has limited financial support. The quality of education is low due to the lack of organization, expertise, and resources. There is a shortage of school supplies and qualified teachers. This problem is more prevalent in rural areas. Schools may use either outdated curricula or a partially implemented framework from the 1997 National Plan of Education and Training (NPET) curriculum. Due to the state's lack of institutional strength and capacity to provide basic education to the general Haitian population, the education sector is now predominantly privatized. A 2006 World Bank Study on the private education in Haiti found that 92% of all Haitian schools are privately owned, tuition-based institutions. Due to Haiti's widespread economic hardship, the majority of the nation's population is unable to meet the cost of education. 88% of children aged 6 to 12 are enrolled in school, and less than one-third of those enrolled reach fifth grade. Close to 60% of children drop out of school before receiving their primary education certificate. The 2006 World Bank report notes that \\"the high dropout rate is generally not reflective of a Haitian disregard for or disinterest in education; rather, it is an unfortunate consequence of limited family resources\\". In the poorest 20% of households in Haiti, school fees can represent up to 25% of a family's annual household income per child. Of those who were able to progress to secondary education, 75% go to private schools. Students who complete secondary schooling were not automatically eligible to enroll in a university. This is because approximately 90% of the higher education system consists of private universities with high tuition fees, making it unaffordable to the general population. While the average GDP per capita in Haiti is $673, tuition fees can exceed more than $2000 a year for Haitian private universities. There is also a lack of enrollment space among public Haitian universities, which comprise 5% of all institutions of higher learning. =Access to healthcare= Medical personnel prepare a Haitian woman for surgery at the Milot hospital in Haiti Serviced by a mixture of the public sector, the private sector, the non- profit sector, and religious institutions, the health system in Haiti faces the challenge of establishing efficient health coordination. This is further compounded by the presence of more than 250 additional implementing partners within the health sector. Coupled with a continuing series of political upheavals that have led to an unending social instability, Haiti's inefficient healthcare framework has crippled the nation's ability to provide good healthcare access to its people. The government has limited ability to provide services, where about 55% of health care is provided by missionaries or other non-governmental organizations. While there are a small number of physicians who operate for-profit clinics, most are found in the larger cities. Additionally, medical services, whether public or private are disproportionately located in the metropolitan Port-au-Prince area. Obstetric facilities also follow a similar trend. Hospitals outside the Port-au-Prince area provide limited obstetric services. In rural areas, prenatal care services are often delivered either by outreach teams or by small clinics that do not have formal maternity wards or delivery capabilities. This physical separation of adequate medical facilitates from parts of rural Haiti makes access to healthcare by those living away from the city difficult. While most medical infrastructures are concentrated within Port-au-Prince, these hospitals and clinical facilities are often in a dilapidated state as they are compromised by infrastructural deficiencies and electrical blackouts. This lack of medical infrastructure was further exacerbated by the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In 2007, 47% of the population lacked access to basic health care, with a majority of the population turning to traditional healers for various forms of treatment. A study on Haiti's prosthetic situation also revealed that less than 25% of all amputees obtain a prosthetic limb. Access to healthcare also includes issues like perceived quality of care. While well-known national maternity hospitals located in Port-au-Prince are either at full capacity or overcapacity, rural maternity beds outside of Port-au-Prince, are under utilized, with utilization rates of about 30 to 35%. However, evidence suggests that pregnant women want competent care. This under-utilization of existing rural services is directly tied to the perceived and actual quality of the facilities. A widespread tendency to avoid government-run public facilities is frequently credited to those institutions' low quality of care, such as a lack of equipment and services, and unfriendly attitude of the medical staff. =Health outcomes= Structural violence impacts health outcomes at both an individual and communal level. Individually, structural violence creates barriers that prevent one from properly receiving and utilizing health care systems. Some of these barriers include high user fees, which lower health facility utilization levels, as well as social stigma around certain diseases that reduce utilization and thus negatively impact health outcomes for certain individuals. An example of how the pre-existing healthcare system reinforces social stigma is the way that facility-based health care is delivered to women. In most of Haiti's public health facilities, waiting lines for family planning services and HIV/AIDS testing are designed to be separate from those of routine care. This public separation thus makes visible the social stigma of sexually transmitted diseases, which can deter women from utilizing certain sex-related health services. Aside from individual impact, structural violence also impacts the society as a whole as it facilitates inequity in terms of the distribution of a society's resources and hence the overall quality of life of a society. This uneven distribution of resources across Haiti's society has created numerous social and economic disparities, all of which have led the country to perform below other countries in a series of health outcomes. Life expectancy According to the 2011 World Health Organization data on health indicators, the average life expectancy in Haiti at birth is 61 years for males and 64 years for females, lower than the global average of 70 years. In 2014, Haiti was ranked 186 out of the 223 countries studied for life expectancy at birth. In terms of healthy life expectancy, a 2013 study funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, found Haiti's health life expectancy for males and females to be 27.8 and 37.1 years respectively, both of which are ranked as the lowest out of the 187 countries studied. Haiti's overall low ranking for life expectancy stems from a multitude of factors that includes high HIV/AIDS prevalence, lack of access to basic healthcare services, malnutrition, and poor sanitation. Mortality rates Haitian Cemetery Mortality rates in Haiti are higher than world averages across all demographics. Today, Haiti has the highest rates of infant, under-five, and maternal mortality in the Western hemisphere. High infection rates for diseases such as respiratory infections, malaria, tuberculosis, as well as sexually transmitted diseases like HIV/AIDS are the leading causes of death for Haitians. This largely comes from persisting inequalities in access to health services, especially between the rich and the rural poor. It is estimated that some 60% of Haitians, primarily those living in rural areas, lack access to basic health-care services. In terms of infant mortality, the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation and World Health Organization report that 57 infants per every 1,000 live births die each year before reaching one year of age. The probability of infants dying under the age of five is 76 per 1,000 live births. With regards to maternal mortality, a maternal mortality study of 181 countries in 2008 found that Haiti’s maternal mortality rate was approximately 582 deaths per 100,000 live births, which is one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in both the Caribbean and around the world. While the high maternal mortality rate in Haiti can be attributed to the fact that women in developing countries tend to have on average more pregnancies than those in developed countries, factors that play a much larger role include poverty, distance, and inadequate services, all of which are negative impacts of structural violence. As a result, women often experience long delays in seeking medical help for obstetric emergency, difficulty reaching an obstetric facility, or not receiving adequate care at the obstetric facility, all of which can be life- threatening for pregnant women living in resource-poor settings. In terms of the overall population, the mortality rates for Haitians between 15 and 60 years old is 258 and 223 per 1000 individuals for males and females respectively. Burden of disease The lack of development and spending on healthcare resources and services makes Haitians, particularly those living in rural areas, susceptible to diseases that are otherwise manageable. For example, the WHO confirmed that a typhoid fever outbreak that occurred in 2003 was due to a lack of access to doctors and clean water infrastructure. Across the nation, it is estimated that there are about 25 physicians and 11 nurses for every 100,000 Haitians. WHO also estimates that 43% of the population receives all the recommended immunizations. For communicable diseases, this means loss of herd immunity This lack of healthcare resources and a disease- friendly environment puts Haiti’s burden of disease to be much higher than that of most nations. In the 2010 World Malaria Report, confirmed cases of malaria in Haiti tripled from 16,897 to 49,535 between 2000 and 2009. As of 2012, less than 20% of all households in Haiti have Insecticide-treated bed nets to protect themselves against mosquitoes. In 2010, Haiti also experienced a cholera outbreak that spread quickly throughout the nation due to difficulties in healthcare access and the lack of experience of the healthcare system. By the end of 2010, a total of 179,379 cases, including 3,990 deaths were reported in Haiti. This represents 61% of all cases reported and 80% of all deaths globally. In 2006, prevalence of HIV/AIDS among adults was 2.2%.\\"The HIV epidemic in the Caribbean: meeting the challenges of achieving universal access to prevention, treatment and care\\", West Indian Medical Journal, J. P. Figueroa, 57(3), 2008 In 2012, the total estimated number of people of ALL ages living with HIV was approximately 150,000. Causes 40th President of Haiti, François Duvalier =Political issues= One cause that has resulted in significant levels of structural violence within Haiti is political instability and corruption. Over the past 200 years, Haitian politics have gone through periods of social unrest and turmoil. The nation has experienced more than 30 Coup d'états. There has been a long history of oppression by dictators. Political instability and corruption have left the country with a number of social problems, such as a lack of access to basic human rights, including education and healthcare; and an economy with a lower than average domestic product. According to the World Bank, Haiti ranks 162 out of 183 economies in the world and 31 out of 32 economies within Latin America and the Caribbean. This low economic ranking limits the level of job creation and availability. This lack of job creation contributes to Haiti’s unemployment rate of 40.6%, with more than two-thirds of the labor force not holding formal jobs. =Impacts of post-colonialism= Another cause of structural violence is the impact of post-colonialism. During the 19th century, European expansion into the New World created social arrangements such as slavery and institutionalized racism. The remnants of these social structures exist today in the form of caste-based racial discrimination, which contributes to the social inequality and economic disparities present within Haiti. Comprising 5% of the nation's population, Haitian mulattoes and Haitians of European ancestry have retained positions of power. This is evident in the political, economic, social, and cultural hierarchy in present- day Haiti, where they control about 44% of the nation's income and Gross Domestic Product and hold the country's important positions. For instance, prominent Haitians and political leaders throughout Haiti's history have been either mulattoes or of European-descent. Within Haiti, light skin, straight hair, and European surnames continue to be important and defining characteristics that separate the traditional elites and upper class citizens from the rest of the population.

The position was first established by Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos (r. 1042–1055) as part of his legislative reforms, sometime between 1043 and 1047. During the 11th and 12th centuries, the tribunal of the epi ton kriseon was one of the four high courts of the Byzantine Empire, alongside those of the droungarios tes viglas, the quaestor and the Eparch of Constantinople. According to the history of Michael Attaleiates, the thematic (provincial) judges had to write and submit copies of their verdicts to the epi ton kriseon. This was possibly a safeguard due to the provincial judges' low level of legal knowledge, but the epi ton kriseon did not function as a court of appeal. The office survived at least until the dissolution of the Empire by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. One of the last and most famous occupants was the historian Niketas Choniates.

It is able to live completely inside timber structures or articles made of wood such as furniture without any outside source of water. It is frequently introduced into new locations inadvertently, and causes damage to the structural timbers of buildings and to wooden objects such as furniture. Description As eusocial insects, West Indian drywood termites build a colonial nest and live inside timbers, creating chambers for rearing larvae and short galleries. They resemble other drywood species in being larger and deeper-bodied than underground-dwelling termites, having shorter limbs and walking more slowly. Apart from the reproductive class, all other members of the colony are blind. They have strong jaws for chewing wood fibre, claws for gripping wooden surfaces and antennae resembling the beads of a necklace strung together. The colony consists of several different castes; reproductives including a queen, king and alates (unmated winged termites); soldiers; and pseudergates (false workers). The king and queen have dark brown, chitinous cuticles but other members of the colony have soft bodies. The soldiers are about long with colourless bodies and black, wrinkled, squarish heads. Their mandibles are relatively small and they can use their heads to block galleries to prevent marauding ants from gaining access to the nest. The sausage-shaped pseudergates are immature termites that perform the functions of a worker caste and care for the brood, excavate tunnels, consume wood and feed the other members of the colony. The alates have two pairs of transparent membranous wings with dark veins running along near the leading edge. Identification of termites species is difficult and is usually made as a result of the appearance and structure of the soldiers' heads. Distribution Cryptotermes brevis is more frequently introduced into new locations than any other termite species in the world. It was first described by the British entomologist Francis Walker from a location in Jamaica in 1853 but it is not thought to have originated in the West Indies. As a drywood termite, it is able to extract enough moisture from the wood in which it lives for survival and can thus easily be transported unknowingly to new locations. It may have originated in the Neotropics and spread to Jamaica and elsewhere in ships made of wood or in wooden articles such as furniture. Since then it further spread by similar means to other Caribbean islands and reached the maritime fringes of the southeastern United States before 1919. Cryptotermes brevis is now widely distributed worldwide. It is present in the Caribbean region, United States, Central America, tropical South America, Peru, Chile, St Helena, tropical Africa, South Africa and Madagascar. It is also invasive in Australia, where it was first observed in 1966, as well as New Caledonia, New Zealand, French Polynesia and Fiji, and has been reported from Egypt, Italy and Spain. Life cycle The Cryptotermes brevis queen lays kidney- shaped eggs and these and the developing larvae are cared for by the pseudergates. After several moults they become pseudergates and assist in the work of the colony. At a later date, some pseudergates develop wing pads and become nymphs, which after three further moults grow into alates, reproductive termites with wings. Others go on to become presoldiers with white heads and, after another moult, soldiers with black heads. There are about fifty pseudergates for every soldier in the colony, and alates are only present in the nest at certain times of year. Alates emerge from the colony through temporary holes during the swarming season. In Florida, the dispersal flights take place at night from April to June. The alates are poor fliers and on landing, soon shed their wings. A male and female pair then searches for a suitable timber structure in which to found a new colony. They enter through a hole or crack, seal the entrance with an intestinal secretion and excavate a brood chamber. The first batch of eggs is cared for by the couple for several months but after the larvae have developed into pseudergates, the pair can concentrate on egg-laying. The first soldier does not appear until the second or third years and alates may develop around year five. A mature colony may contain over a thousand termites and survive for upward of ten years. Damage Cryptotermes brevis infests sound softwood and hardwood timbers, both structural wood in buildings and moveable objects. Several colonies can co-exist in a single structure and objects as small as picture frames can be attacked. The pseudergates excavate galleries through the timber but leave a thin veneer of surface wood intact. One wooden door was found to house twenty colonies, judging by the number of reproductive pairs of termites found inside. In the later stages of an infestation the surface of the object may bulge or blister. Small holes known as \\"kick-out holes\\" in diameter are sometimes made through which frass (faecal pellets) can be pushed out, accumulating in a conical, dusty pile below. The pellets are hexagonal in cross section and vary in colour, having one rounded and one tapered end, a shape characteristic of Cryptotermes brevis. Other signs of infestation are the swarming of alates or the presence of shed wings. Cryptotermes brevis is more destructive in habitations than other species in the genus Cryptotermes which require a moister environment. In the United States, this termite causes damage in excess of $100 million annually, and a great deal more than this worldwide.

A friend of Sandy Murry, she befriends and mentors Polly O'Keefe. Major traits Max is a wealthy intellectual and a painter whose work hangs in museums and private collections. Although she was once married, Max has lived for more than 30 years in a happy lesbian relationship with neurosurgeon Dr. Ursula Heschel. Engaging and energetic, Max befriends and mentors Polly, and they become close friends despite the significant difference in their ages. Max is lean and elegant, with black hair and silver-grey eyes. She has a keen interest in a wide variety of subjects including anthropology, theology, and literature and is a lively conversationalist. In the course of her many travels throughout the world, Max was bitten on the eyelid during a trip to South America and contracted Netson's Disease, for which there is no cure.  Character  Max and her younger sister Minerva Allaire (\\"M.A.\\") were raised at Beau Allaire, a plantation Max inherits through her mother's family. Their mother dies when Max and M.A. are young girls, and they grow up dominated by a ruthless, physically and emotionally abusive father who Max describes as a \\"lecherous old roué.\\" One night when Max is away, he attempts to rape M.A.. She manages to get away from him, but runs into the rain, catches pneumonia and dies in anguish. Max never forgives him, but keeps his portrait in Beau Allaire's dining room to remind herself never to be like him. As a young woman, Max marries Davin Tomassi, a colleague of Sandy Murry. Max gives birth to a daughter who dies a few days later, breaking Max's heart. Max and Tomassi divorce. After a series of indiscriminate affairs, Max meets neurosurgeon Ursula Heschel, and they enter into a loving relationship. In A House Like a Lotus, they have been lovers and confidantes for more than 30 years. Max is a successful painter, and some of her paintings are displayed in museums and private collections. A collector of art, she displays works by Hogarth, Van Gogh, Pissarro, and Picasso in Beau Allaire. One of her show pieces is a sculpture known as the Laughing Christ of Baki; this becomes Polly's favorite work, and she and Max talk about it often. Max and Ursula, who usually live in New York City, have come home to Beau Allaire because of Max's urgent need for medical treatment. On a trip to South America, Max contracted the fatal Netson's disease which kills by parasites invading the heart. There is no cure. A distant cousin of Max's is the world's leading specialist in this disease, and he is on the staff of M.A. Horne Hospital, founded by her father after M.A.'s death. In short, Max has come home to die. Through Sandy Murry, Max meets Polly and they quickly become good friends. Max, who loves Polly as the daughter she was unable to have, takes a keen interest in her intellectual and social development. They spend many hours together at Beau Allaire, talking and reading. Due to Max's mentoring and love, Polly blossoms both at school and in her social life. But as Max's disease worsens, she has to resort to drinking alcohol to manage the pain. One night when Polly is staying over at Beau Allaire, Max becomes intoxicated because of her pain and makes what some interpret as a sexual advance toward Polly. Polly, traumatized, runs into the rain just as M.A. did many years ago. Max, trying to stop Polly and recalling M.A. fleeing her father years before, sadly screams out to her father's portrait that she is just like him. Despite Max's attempts to reach out to Polly and apologize, Polly refuses to speak to her until, during her stay in Cyprus, she is able to forgive Max, calls her, and they reconcile.  Name  Maximiliana Sebastiane Horne and her younger sister, Minerva Allaire were named by their mother. She gave her daughters romantic names because she and her sisters had been named Submit, Patience, and Hope. In A House Like a Lotus, she is called Max or Maxa, and in An Acceptable Time, she is referred to as Max. Metaxa—a strong Greek liqueur—is a third nickname.  History  In A House Like a Lotus, Max is a major character. She is friend and mentor to Polly O'Keefe. Max and her partner Dr. Ursula Heschel are Polly's first exposure to a lesbian couple, particularly a couple who have been happily together for over 30 years. At the end of the book, Max is still alive, but clearly nearing the end of her life. There is a single mention of Max in An Acceptable Time. Max died before Polly returned from her trip to Cyprus, and Polly is grieving her death.  References  L'Engle, Madeleine. A House Like a Lotus, . Hearne, Betsy. A mind in motion.

He remained the head of Artists Union of Turkmenistan for many years, and his direct active participation in young Turkmen artists' lives formed several generations of creative authors, among those, an outstanding informal community of the 1970s called \\"The Seven\\", widely recognized in Moscow, Russia and abroad. Since 1953, Klychev was a permanent participant of large all-Union, regional and international exhibitions. He also held a number of personal events in Moscow, Russia and Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, as well as in many foreign countries. = Death = The artist continued working up to the very last days of his life despite suffering from a long illness. His last monumental painting «Geoktepin battle» remains unfinished. He died on January 12, 2006.  Creative period  = Periods and styles = The 1960s is the time of Izzat Klycheva's formation and search for new ways in art. In 1967, the \\"Me and My Mother\\" and \\"My Turkmenia\\" painting series \\"Shearmen\\"(1964), \\"Desert\\" (1964), \\"Legend\\" (1964), \\"Beluji\\" (1965) were honored by receiving the USSR State Prize. Within the same period, Izzat Klychev was working on the «Day of Rejoicing» triptych – the first one in the history of Turkmen arts – that becomes a major occurrence in Soviet creativity. The artist demonstrates his new figurative language of open color, which consists of folklore traditions and \\"austere style\\" technique. This initiative becomes a basisin the further development of Turkmen visual art. > Izzat Klychev's art is modern, not only because he chooses his material from > the daily life, but also because it is rich with the spirit of time which is > interweaved with national and international breakings.Y. Khalaminskiy. A way > to resolution. Magazine \\"Art\\" 11, 1973 pg.44. In the late 1960s to early 1970s, Izzat Klychev is especially prolific and this period is marked with the creation of the paintings «Tomorrow is a Holiday» (1972) and «Eastern Tune» (1976).During this period, Izzat Klycheva is rediscovering his beloved Turkmenistan, dedicating his talent to the portraits of ordinary people and cultural figures. The portraits of writer Berdy Kerbabayev (1969), Hydyr Deryayev (1977) and many others are unveiled during that time. Izzat Klychev's creative development features a special vision of Turkmen women, with his national women types gallery: «Mother» (1967), «Craftswomen» (1969), «Mother's Rejoice\\"(1967) «Young Turkmen girl» (1979), «Embroiderer» (1969), «Carpet maker» (1968), as well as widely known magnificent and inimitable images of women of Beluja - «Belujian» (1972), «Belujian Woman» (1971). One of the specialties of Izzat Klychev's style is the concordant apprehension of other cultures. Izzat Klychev travelled a lot and created several comprehensive and sophisticated image series, which visualize the spirit and distinctiveness of the country of his visit and its people: Egypt (1966), Italy (1969, 1981), Cuba (1971), Bulgaria (1976), Ethiopia (1973), Angola (1978) are among some of his destinations which inspired series. In these works, Izzat Klychev demonstrates himself to be an outstanding landscape artist. Starting from tondo «Happiness» (1979), Izzat Klychev's works of the 1980s become cheerful, featured with intense colors, especially in term of contrast of deep red and orange tones. > Such an improvisational ornamental style in these paintings led the American > painter Anton Refregier to express his thoughts in a letter to Izzat Klychev > \\"I think in terms of your images and feelings you reveal the impressionist > style\\"L.

Izzat Klychev also pays a lot of attention to hedonistic still-life paintings: «Flower-piece with Venetian glass», «Autumn Flowers» (1981), «Still-life champagne» (all of 1980). At the same time, the artist is working on a ceramic panel design for the Turkmen National Circus. > A series of exquisite miniatures of the eastern tales and excellence in > making sophisticated possession of ornament once again make us pay tribute > to the traditions of the Turkmen culture that is manifested in a unique > perfection of Tekin carpets, jewelry silver, and in rare aesthetic details > of nomadic mode of life objects.A.Tarasov.

The initially inherent scenic element of his works become stronger; Izzat Klycheva is fascinated with composition of complicated ornamental patterns. Thanks to his potential as a designer, many now enjoy such masterpieces as «Bride» (1996), «Oriental market» (1996), and «Embroiderers» (1998). Klychev's graphic series inspired by Turkmen tales are known for their flawless coloring and shapes. Within the last decade of his life, he passionately threw himself into the work on such pieces as «Girls with Jugs», «My Village», «Melody of Karakum», «Horsemen» and many others. Within the last 3 years, most of his attention was paid to the historical painting, which illustrates a tragic episode of Turkmen history – seizure of the Geoktepin fortress. The artist, who started his professional development from historical subjects, wanted tocomplete this work with a complex philosophic apologue. Even though the paintingremainsincomplete, it obviously proves the development of Izzat Klychev's emotional and creative power, confirming the artistic maturity of one of the most interesting artists of Soviet and post-Soviet times.

Francis Kitaka attended Rubaga Primary School, starting in 1944. 1948 Kitaka was admitted to Bukalasa Minor Seminary, but was expelled in 1950, for wearing bathroom sandals to Church. The following year, 1951, he was admitted to Rubaga Boys' Secondary School, where he sat his middle school examinations in 1952. He entered St. Mary's College Kisubi in 1952 and left in 1954 after sitting his O Level examinations (Cambridge Ordinary School Certificate Examinations). In 1955, he was admitted to the Faculty of Science at Makerere University for the intermediate course for two years. This was equivalent to Advanced Level (A Level) studies. In 1957 Kitaka entered the Department of Veterinary Medicine, to study for the Diploma in Veterinary Medicine, which he obtained in 1958. In 1961 he received a scholarship from the Government of Uganda to study Biochemistry at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.

In 2003, the shareholders in QCL learned through the Indian High Commissioner to Uganda, that Cipla, the Indian pharmaceutical company was looking for a serious pharmaceutical company to partner with in Uganda. They flew to India and signed partnership and marketing agreements. That was the beginning of the importation of Cipla-manufactured pharmaceuticals into Uganda. They convinced Cipla to build a factory to manufacture ARVs in Uganda. QCL bought a piece of land in 2004 and on 3 September 2005, President Yoweri Museveni performed the ground breaking ceremony. The factory was commissioned in 2007. The pharmaceutical plant is owned by a new entity called Quality Chemical Industries Limited, in which Cipla and Quality Chemicals Limited own equal shares. The plant is operated by QCL. Francis Xavier Kitaka has served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of QCIL from 2007 until November 2013.

Following this, he would then move up to the welterweight division to challenge Pernell Whitaker, still considered one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in boxing, for his WBC welterweight title. In a close fight, De La Hoya would ultimately defeat Whitaker by unanimous division to capture the welterweight title, his fourth world title in his fourth different division.De La Hoya Wins Unanimous Decision, Chicago Tribune article, 1997-04–13, Retrieved on 2014-03-10 De La Hoya would continue his winning ways in June by knocking out mandatory challenger David Kamau in the second round of his first welterweight title defense.

Following that loss, Camacho would go undefeated in his next 21 fights (20–0–1). Though most of the fighters he fought were unknown journeymen, Camacho did score two high-profile victories over two future hall-of-famers, first defeating Roberto Durán by unanimous decision on June 22, 1996, and then scoring a technical knockout victory over Sugar Ray Leonard On March 1, 1997 in what would prove to be the final fight of Leonard's career. After his defeat of Leonard, Camacho publicly challenged De La Hoya should he defeat Whitaker.

Two of the judges had De La Hoya winning all 12 rounds with scores of 120–106 and 120–105, while the third actually gave Camacho two rounds and scored the bout 118–108 in favor of De La Hoya. From the opening bell, De La Hoya served as the aggressor and constantly attacked Camacho. Camacho tried to keep up with his younger and faster opponent, but simply could not land any sustained offense and was forced both to constantly retreat and clinch De La Hoya several times throughout the fight. After punishing Camacho for eight+ rounds, De La Hoya would finally score a knockdown in the ninth after a left uppercut followed by two right hands sent Camacho to the mat with around 35 seconds left. Camacho was able to continue and survived the remainder of the round after clinching the aggressive De La Hoya when he closed in. Though De La Hoya would continue to dominate the remainder of the fight, he was unable to score the knockout victory. In the fight's 12th and final round, referee Richard Steele finally punished Camacho for his constant clinching by deducting a point from Camacho's score, making the fight even more lopsided in De La Hoya's favor.No Contest: De La Hoya Breezes, Chicago Tribune article, 1997-09–14, Retrieved on 2014-03-16 Aftermath De La Hoya would continue his success in 1997 by winning his fifth fight in the year after defeating Wilfredo Rivera on December 6.

For instance, people who are switching employers, starting graduate school, or young adults who have become ineligible for coverage under their parents' plans and are searching for their own insurance might use a short-term insurance plan until obtaining a more permanent solution. Short-term, limited- duration health care plans are not available for purchase on HealthCare.gov or health insurance marketplaces in most states. They are not eligible for federal financial aid but the monthly healthcare premiums may be less expensive. Short-term health insurance plans are exempt from most insurance regulations established by the Affordable Care Act, are not required to cover the full list of health benefits required by that legislation, and may offer lower premiums to individuals who enroll prior to developing pre-existing conditions.

It is up to and is located in the state of Rhineland- Palatinate.  Location  The landscape of the Bingen Forest lies on the boundary of the counties of Mainz-Bingen (north to southeast), Bad Kreuznach (south) and Rhein-Hunsrück-Kreis (west). It is located between the northeastern end of the Hunsrück main ridge (northwest), the Rhine valley (north and northeast), behind which the Taunus rises, the Rhine Knee near Bingen (east) and the Soonwald (southwest).  Flora  The flora of the densely wooded Bingen Forest, about 40% of which consists of oak but otherwise is a mixed forest, covers an area of around 7,000 hectares, most of which comprises a contiguous area of woodland.  History  Remains of Roman buildings Barrows such as that southeast of Dichtelbach, castles and the present-day settlements and villages are evidence that the Bingen Forest and its surrounding area have been settled for a long time. From Roman times the remains of the Villa Rustica have survived as well as parts of a building near the forestry lodge of Forsthaus Lauschhütte. The Ausonius Way runs through the Bingen Forest, which was used as a military link between Bingen and Trier. During the Cold War there was a radar station on the Kandrich for a Nike Hercules Rocket unit based near Dichtelbach. In 1982 this weapon system was replaced by Patriot air defence rockets, which were then based at the Kandrich in newly built positions. These positions have largely been returned to nature – only earth ramparts are still visible.http://www.d21dichtelbach.com/ On the forme Patriot rocket station there are now three wind generators. The Kandrich plateau with its wind generator (Typ E-70); view looking northeast to the Rhine  Hills and uplands  The highest mountain in the Bingen Forest is the Kandrich (638.6 m), and its lowest point lies in the Rhine valley near Niederheimbach (80 m).

In addition, Bingen Forest may be accessed via the A 9 which runs in a northwest-southeast direction through the Middle Rhine valley from Koblenz to Bingen. Railway lines run on either side - for example, along the B 9 - through the Rhine valley (north) and the valley of the Guldenbach (south). The latter is currently closed; however it is to be re-opened in the near future because of the Frankfurt-Hahn Airport which is located southwest of the Bingen Forest and roughly west of Kirchberg between Hahn and Lautzenhausen.

Born in Wrocław, Germany, the family emigrated to Argentina to escape the Nazi regime. Though Oelsner was not religiously observant in her youth, she enrolled in Seminario Rabinico Latinoamericano, graduating in 1994. Early years Margit (nickname, \\"Margarita\\") Oelsner was born in Wrocław to Werner Oelsner, an electrical engineer, and Edith Chaskel. She described her father as \\"a German of Jewish descent, of course, who did not speak Hebrew, did not Passover and did not attend the synagogue\\". During the Second World War, her father wrote to several countries seeking a visa in order to escape the Nazi regime, and, as Argentina was the only one to offer it, the family made their way to Buenos Aires. Here, Margit became \\"Margarita\\", lived in Vicente López, and attended public school. She was not religiously observant as a young woman but, at age 14, her father decided she should receive religious education, which was sponsored by Lamroth Hakol, a Jewish community in Florida. A rabbi at Lamroth Hakol encouraged Oelsner to continue her studies. As her father did not want her to have a university education, she then joined B'nai B'rith. Career Oelsner married Fredy Baumatz, an observant Jew, and had three children. She began studying Hebrew to help their daughters who attended a community school. Oelsner considered herself to be rebellious; she loved to study, was fascinated by challenges, and was a feminist at a time when few others were. Deciding she wanted to become a rabbi, she met with the Seminario Rabinico Latinoamericano's administrator and told him that she could not meet two of the requirements: she had no college degree and she could not go to Israel for a year. To fulfill the seminary's requirements, she studied psychology at university, and spent time in Israel. Though she has no pulpit, Oelsner can officiate at ceremonies outside the synagogue. She leads a group at Lamroth Hakol which organizes activities, meetings and conducts visits to the sick.

The 36 room hotel is located in the heart of the city on Victoria Road, opposite Jaffna Hospital. Built in 1970, the hotel had a monopoly on the Jaffna peninsula for two decades. During the civil war the hotel was occupied by the Sri Lankan military for 16 years. The hotel was handed back to the owners in 2011 and re-opened in 2012. History The hotel was built in 1970 by Ayappan Sangaran, an Indian who had moved to Ceylon in 1928. The hotel was named after Subhas Chandra Bose, the Indian nationalist whom Sangaran admired. Sangaran owned several businesses in the Jaffna including Subhas Café and Ice-cream which had a virtual monopoly on ice cream in the 1970s. The 30 room hotel was certified by the Ministry of Tourism and served as the only tourist hotel in the Jaffna peninsula for two decades. 15 more rooms were added to the hotel later. In October 1995, as the Sri Lankan military launched a military offensive to recapture the Jaffna peninsula from the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The hotel, like many public buildings in Jaffna, became a shelter for refugees fleeing the fighting. After recapturing Jaffna the Sri Lankan military declared the centre of the city, which included Subhas Hotel, as a High Security Zone (HSZ). In December 1995 the Sri Lankan military occupied the hotel, like they did to many buildings in the city. The hotel was the headquarters of the Sri Lanka Army's 51-2 Brigade. Sangaran, who moved to India with his family, died three years after the army took over the hotel. During the Norwegian mediated peace process the Sri Lankan military claimed it would hand the hotel back to the owners by mid-2003 but this never happened. In March 2011, two years after the civil war ended, the military handed the hotel back to the family. The refurbished hotel re- opened for business on 14 December 2012 under the management of S.

Despite facing discrimination because of her gender, she became the first woman chair of a local section of the American Chemical Society and won 22 awards and honors for her laboratory's research. Early life and education Hoobler grew up on a farm in Gallatin, Missouri where she became interested in science from watching the maturation of animals and spending time roaming around her family's property. She became especially interested in children's wellness when on a trip during her childhood, where she observed sick children in poor living conditions in the mountains of Arkansas and became aroused with compassion. Before pursuing a career in chemistry, Hoobler spent three years at the Central Female College in Lexington, Missouri at the urging of her parents, against her own wishes. At Central College, she met her first mentor, biology teacher Lily Egbert, who encouraged her to pursue science. With a new passion for science, she decided to attend the University of Chicago to major in chemistry with a minor in physics. Her advisor at University of Chicago sent her to University of Colorado at Boulder to teach inorganic chemistry. Hoobler went on to earn her master's degree from the University of Colorado in 1918. Her first master's project was developing a more sensitive cyanide test for autopsies, which resulted in her first publication. Her second project was improving an extraction method for tungstic acid from tungsten ores. Additionally, Hoobler was a teaching assistant in the physiological chemistry course at the medical school. Immediately after earning her master's degree, she entered a Ph.D. program at Yale University, where she studied physiological chemistry. At the time, Yale admitted a handful of female graduate students, but it was difficult for these female students to find housing near campus, as landlords discriminated against women and saw them as \\"bothersome.\\" Hoobler joined the Graduate Women's Club and worked to improve living arrangements for female graduate students. Eventually, due to persuasion of the Graduate Women's Club, the university provided an on-campus living option to female students. During a lecture on the dairy and milk industry at Yale, the professor encouraged the women in attendance to go into research on human nutrition. Hoobler became inspired and the health of mothers, infants and children became a priority in her future research. Career After receiving her Ph.D. from Yale, she started working at Western Pennsylvania Hospital in Pittsburgh as an assistant chemist, where she faced extreme discrimination for her gender. The hospital only had restrooms for men, and Hoobler had to use a restroom in a public building a half-block down the street. Due to this, she limited her trips to the bathroom and after a few months of working at the hospital she developed acute nephritis (kidney inflammation). Because of her acute nephritis, she was urged to take a year's leave of absence. Hoobler was also not allowed to eat in the dining hall for doctors, as all the other doctors were male, and she was not allowed to eat in the nurses' dining hall for bureaucratic reasons, so she ate with the hospital employees. Upon expressing her dissatisfaction to the chief of the laboratory, she was told that she would soon get used to the conditions. After two weeks, and when the conditions did not improve, Hoobler resigned from Western Pennsylvania Hospital. A day after her resignation, the president of the board of trustees asked her why she decided to resign and why she didn't attend the annual staff banquet, which the chief of the laboratory had not invited her to because he didn't think she would want to be with \\"all those men.\\" After the president chastised the chief of the laboratory, Hoobler's treatment at the hospital improved to her satisfaction. Hoobler faced numerous other instances of discrimination over the course of her career, including when the Chicago Club invited her to speak at its event, not realizing that \\"Icie\\" was a female's name. Upon arriving at the event, Hoobler was not allowed to enter until her husband negotiated with the manager and the board of trustees re-voted on whether or not to let her speak. In 1923, during her year of rest after developing nephritis, Hoobler began teaching at the University of California, Berkeley. She taught a course on food chemistry, amongst others. While teaching, she was offered the position of Director of the Nutrition Research Project of the Merril-Palmer School for Motherhood and Child Development. The project's goal was to improve knowledge and research on the health of mothers. Hoobler spent the next 31 years directing the laboratory and then served as a research consultant from 1954 to 1974. Under her direction, the laboratory published 300 journal articles and several books on subjects ranging from the metabolism of women during the reproductive cycle to the chemistry of the red blood cell. Honors In 1931 Hoobler was selected as the first woman chair of the local section of the American Chemical Society. She received 22 citations, awards and honors over the course of her research, including the Norlin Award from the University of Colorado Boulder, the Garvan–Olin Medal from the American Chemical Society, the Borden Award from the American Home Economics Association, the Osborne Award, and the Mendel Award from the American Institute of Nutrition. Personal life At the age of 46, Hoobler married Dr. Raymond Hoobler, but he died in 1943, after five years of marriage. In 1982, Hoobler returned to her birthplace in Missouri and died two years later in 1984.

Amzalak was born and educated in Lisbon. He combined a successful business career with broad academic activity. A devoted Jew, a central figure in the Portuguese Jewish Community, he headed the Lisbon Jewish community from 1926 until his death in 1978.  Biography  Amzalak established a solid academic career. He became professor of philosophy and later dean of the Lisbon Institute of Higher Economics and Finance (1933-1944), and was president of the Sciences Academy of Lisbon and deputy rector of the Technical University of Lisbon (1944-1956) and rector from 1956 until his retirement in 1962. His main interests were economic history, history of economic thought, and marketing. He published extensively in his areas of expertise but also published several works on Judaism. Amzalak received the Honorary Doctorate from several universities, including the University of Bordeaux in 1935 and the prestigious Sorbonne, Paris, in 1950. Amazalak was a public figure of great influence. He co-owned the newspaper O Século, then one of the major daily newspapers in Portugal. He was a close friend and a supporter of Portuguese dictator António de Oliveira Salazar. Avraham Milgram says that Amzalak \\"holds a place of honor on the consciousness of the Lisbon Jews.\\"  Nazi controversy  In 2007, historian Antonio Louça published a book where he questioned why Amzalak allowed his newspaper to help the Nazi propaganda machine before World War II. In that book Louça also stated that in January 1935, Amzalak hosted the German ambassador, Baron von Hoyningen-Huene, and the latter subsequently recommended to his superiors that Amzalak be awarded the medal of excellence from the German Red Cross, a German civil assistance organization.LOUÇÃ, ANTÓNIO and PACCAUD, ISABELLE \\"O Segredo da Rua d'O Século –Ligações Perigosas de Um Dirigente Judeu com a Alemanha Nazi (1935-1939) Lisboa, Fim de Século, 2007, In response, Esther Mucznik, one of the leaders of the Jewish Community of Lisbon, defended Amzalak's reputation. Mucznik pointed out the notable work done by Amzalak during the war and also observed that Amzalak's actions in 1935-37 cannot properly be judged in light of what we know today about the Holocaust. Yad Vashem Historian Avraham Milgram remarks that, before the war Amzalak, just like Pope Pius XII, regarded Germany as bulwark against communism and that he misread the Nazi regime in respect to the Jews just as Pius XII did. As the war approached, and from 1938 on, Amzalak changed this view and throughout the war, he made a major effort to assist the refugees. Portuguese researcher Jose Freire Antunes in his book Jews in Portugal, Testimony of Fifty Men and Women credited Amzalak for the expansion of the refugee relief in Lisbon and for the transfer of JDC offices to Lisbon. It was due to the intervention of Augusto d'Esaguy and Amzalak that many of the refugees with visas issued by Aristides de Sousa Mendes were allowed to continue on their way to Portugal. The Portuguese ruler António de Oliveira Salazar held Amzalak in high esteem and that allowed Amzalak to play an important role in getting Salazar's permission to transfer from Paris to Lisbon the main HIAS-HICEM (Jewish relief organization) European Office in June 1940. Latter in the war, Amzalak, together with Leite Pinto, General Manager of the Beira Alta Railway, which operated the line from Figueira da Foz to the Spanish frontier, organized several trains that brought refugees from Berlin and other European cities.Pinto p. 122 and Tesimonials from Baltasar Rebelo de Sousa and José Hermano Saraiva Amzalak was also able to persuade Salazar to instruct consuls in territories under Nazi occupation to validate all passports held by Jews even though these documents were known to be far from \\"kosher\\".

Curling career  In her first World Junior Curling Championships in 2012, Svatoňová was part of the first ever Czech Republic curling team to win a World Championship medal. Her team won the silver medal, Svatoňová playing second for Zuzana Hájková. The team had a strong performance, finishing the round robin with a 6-3 record, in a five-way tie for second. The team avoided a tie breaker however, and after losing their first playoff game to first place Scotland, they rallied to win the semi-final against Sweden's Sara McManus before losing once again to Scotland's Hannah Fleming in the final. The team returned to the 2013 World Junior Curling Championships, with fourth-thrower Iveta Janatova now skipping the team. The team finished the round robin with a 5-4 record, in a four-way tie for third place.

She was the first person to discover an Einstein ring. Early life and education Hewitt was born in Washington, D.C. on September 4, 1958 to parents Warren E. Hewitt, a retired international lawyer from the State Department, and Gertrud (Graedel) Hewitt. She attended Bryn Mawr College where she graduated magna cum laude with a degree in economics in 1980. Hewitt took an astronomy class at Haverford College her sophomore year, which sparked her interest in science. She attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for graduate school. During her graduate studies, she began studying gravitational lensing using the Very Large Array radio telescope. Hewitt obtained a Ph.D. in physics in 1986. Some sources erroneously state that she received her Ph.D. in 1988. Career Hewitt was appointed with a postdoctoral fellowship at MIT as part of the Very-long-baseline interferometry unit from 1986-1988. While analyzing the data from her graduate studies, she found a ring on her computer screen. This ring, part of the gravitational lens system MG1131+0456, ended up being the very first Einstein ring discovered. Since Hewitt's groundbreaking discovery, many other Einstein rings have been discovered, and were found to be far more common than astronomers thought. Einstein rings are important because they can help answer questions about the size and the fate of our universe. Hewitt worked as a researcher at Princeton University's Department of Astrophysical Sciences in 1988. After one year of researching at Princeton, she returned to MIT as an assistant physics professor, working as a full-time professor since 1989. Hewitt is also the principal investigator for the Radio Astronomy Group of the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT. Since 2002, Hewitt has been appointed Director of the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. Honors In 1990, Hewitt won the David and Lucile Packard Foundation fellowship. For her work on gravitational lenses, her colleagues at MIT nominated her for the 1995-1996 Harold E. Edgerton Award. In 1995, Hewitt was the recipient of the Maria Goeppert-Mayer Award and in 1989 the Annie J. Cannon Award in Astronomy for her work in radio astronomy.

Duzgın Bava, also Kemerê Duzgıni \\"the rock of Duzgın\\", ) is a religious figure among Alevi Zazas and Kurds, especially in the Tunceli Province. He also symbolizes a mountain in Nazımiye, nearby the village Qil. The people believe that he disappeared at the top of this mountain, which is known as Kemerê Duzgıni (the rock of Duzgın), Bimbarek (holy) or Kemerê Bımbareki (holy rock) in Zazaki.Hüseyin Çakmak, 'Resmi Anlatımlarda ve Halk Anlatımlarında Duzgı', Munzur, 2008, sy. 29. According to local narrations he is the son of sayyid Kures/Kureş who was an ancestor of Kureşan communityKureşan is an important religious community in Tunceli. They are like Zoroastrian Magi and Jewish Levi communities. Because Kureşan is not only a religious community, it is also a tribe. and his real name is not Duzgın, it is Haydar or Shah Haydar (Zaz. Sa Heyder). But some researches suggest the opposite of this view.for example see Çakmak, 2008, p. 32-3. Duzgın/Dizgun is a 'fictitious saint' and fictitious saints have mostly 'names' which have unknown or absurd meaning. Like Buğday Dede (Tire), Kum Baba (Șile), Çitlenbik Dede (Kemalpaşa) and Çınar Dede...(Gürdal Aksoy, Tunceli Alevi Kürt Mitolojisi, Raa Haq'da Dinsel Figürler, Istanbul, 2006, Komal, p. 47-9 ). The Basic Narration on Duzgi Duzgi was known as a wali in Tunceli where he performed a miracle keramat ('miracle'). One winter the weather was very bad, bringing on a drought and the people were struggling to feed themselves let alone their animals. However, Duzgın's flock seemed healthy. His father was curious about how Duzgın kept them healthy. One day he followed him and saw that whenever Duzgın shook his staff over the dry earth plants began to grow and the flock fed on them. His father was about to leave unnoticed when one of the flock sneezed a few times and Duzgi said; \\"What's the matter? Did you see Kurêso Khurr. Khur means here 'with short ears'. Thus Khurêso Khurr refers to Armenian roots of some clans of Kureyşan community (see Gürdal Aksoy, Tunceli: Alevilik, Ermenilik, Kürtlük, Ankara, 2012, Dipnot). and that's what made you sneeze?\\" At the same time, he turns round and catches sight of his father and than he runs to the top of the mountain. He disappeared 'divinely', out of shame of his father. Etymology Although the name Duzgın is like a Turkish word, it doesn't come from originally Turkish düzgün which means smooth and correct.Aksoy, 2006, p. 50-7 The Turkification process of Alevi myths and beliefs in Tunceli has begun especially with some leaders of Bektashi order who have tried to get contact with local leaders of Alevi Kurds in the 19th century.for this contacts, see Erdal Gezik, Etnik, Politik Dinsel Sorunlar Bağlamında Alevi Kürtler, Ankara, 2012, İletişim Yayınevi Thus it is possible that in this time they added some new motifs to local myths to explain them with Turkish terms. Ağuçan, the name of another sayyid community may be an brilliant example. Because the most of people in the region still believe that it means 'someone who drink poison' (Turkish ağu içen) in Turkish, although it is a popular etymological view.Aksoy 2006, p. 206-14 The name Duzgın and Dizgun are transformation of the name of another mythological figure in the region. He is Tujik/Tuzik which means sharp in Zazaki and Kurdish and it symbolizes also a mountain. Like Duzgın, he is a personification of a mountain, originally of an ancient god (Vahagn).Aksoy, 2012, p. 99-115 . According some songs of aşıks (ashik) he is the strongest veli (saint) in Tunceli. He is the head of 366 saints. Some scholars think that the name of Tujik comes from Armenian duzakh which means the hell among Zoroastrian Armenians. It may be a harmonized form to pronounces of new local languages. Tujik was originally a volcanic mountain. Therefore, the people gave this name. The Turks who live nearby the mountain, have same motivation to give name Cehennem dağı (the mountain Hell) to the mountain Tendürek. Because it is also a volcanic mountain and therefore sometimes the people heard roar from the mountain. Moreover, the etymological origin of the name of Tendürek indirectly refers to 'hell' as a metaphor. It is associated with the word of tandoor which means a kind of oven.Aksoy 2006, p. 56; Aksoy, 2012, p. 99 Origins of the cult Some scholars thought that there is a continual association between Armenian Mithra (Mehr or Mihr) and Bava Duzgi/Dizgun Bava.Aksoy 2006, p. 37-122 Because the mountains of Tunceli was a shelter for Zoroastrian Armenian who have resisted the process of Christianisation in ancient times and there were cult places of the Zoroastrian divinities in the borderland of ancient 'Tunceli' . For example, Bagayaric (now Pekeriç, in Erzincan) was the cult place of Armenian Mithra. Kemah (Turkey) was for Ahuramazda (Armenian Ohrmazd). Therefore, it can be traced from some placenames in Tunceli. The most clear example is about the name of Mercan mountains which etymologically is connected with Mehr.Mercan Not only place names, also mythological elements point to this continuity. First of all, Mithra was a god of the contracts and friendship. He protector of truth.Arthur Cotterell-Rachel Storm, The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Mythology, London, 1999: Lorenz Books, p. 298 Duzgi can resolve individual conflicts among Alevi Zazas and Kurds, also alevitized Armenians of Tunceli and he is also a protector of truth.Therefore some writers thought that it explain why does the people call him as Turkish düzgün (smooth, correct). If anyone has a problem (dava) with someone else and if he/she couldn't solve this problem with him/her, than he/she is going to the top of the mountain of Duzgın and he/she wish his help. According to Alevi Zazas and Kurds of Tunceli, if a pious person doesn't have any son and if he/she go to the mountain of Bava Duzgın, Duzgın will give a chance to the person to get a son. Mithra is known as 'sons-giver' (putro-da) in Avesta. The people pray to Duzgi in the time of first lights of the rising sun, like Mithra's followers. Mithra has been turned a sun god in late times, although he was god of the sunlight. Mithra and Duzgi are shepherds. Mithra is symbolized by an eagle. Duzgi has also such a symbol. It is Heliyo Chal. Both of them are cavalry and they are dressed in red. Moreover, Mithra has a sister (Anahita), Duzgi too (Xaskar). Anahita is a goddess of the water and she symbolizes the purity. Xaskar has a holy water source on the mountain of Duzgın. It is called by her name; Xaskare. If someone drink the water who has good heart, than the water source can't be dried. This belief refers to Anahita who means spotless in Avesta (An-ahit). The name of Xaskar probably comes from Armenian oskrhat which means 'made of the gold' in Armenian. Because Anahid is mostly described with the golden dressing. Consequently, Xaskar and Duzgın is a personifications of Armenian Anahita and Mithra in this mountainous region, Tunceli.for more detailles, see Aksoy 2006, p. 37-122 Myth Not only Turkish writers, also some writers from Tunceli who have been influenced by Turks, suggested that Düzgün is a Turkish name and Düzgün Baba is a successor of Haji Bektash Veli. But it couldn't be explain why is Düzgün so popular name only in this Zaza region (Tunceli), although it is accepted as a Turkish name. This view has no any serious evidence and it is completely fictitious and speculative. Because there is no any historical person and Haji Bektash doesn't have any successor who is called Düzgün.

According to the anonymous Historia translationum reliquiarum sancti Mamantis (\\"History of the Translation of the Relics of Saint Mammes\\"), he was a \\"man of honest living and good testimony\\" (vir honeste vite et boni testimonii) but also as a soldier \\"not the least in the army of the Latins\\" (in exercitu Latinorum non minimus).

By virtue of these offices he participated in the election of the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. Walon became bishop in 1207, but three days after his consecration he abandoned his diocese on account of its abject poverty, leaving it in the custody of the powerful secular lord Amé Pofey. This provoked the intervention of Pope Innocent III, and on 14 July 1208 he combined the diocese of Domokos and Kalydon. Later, Walon obtained the relic of the head of Mammes of Caesarea, the patron saint of Langres, from the Papal legate Peter of Capua. He brought it to Dampierre before bestowing it on the cathedral of his native diocese. There survives a letter from Peter to Robert de Châtillon, bishop of Langres, and his chapter advising them of Walon's mission.

Dennis established the Indiana Farmer newspaper in Richmond in 1851. According to their masthead, they devoted the paper to \\"agriculture, horticulture, mechanics, and the useful arts.\\" In October 1852, the editors established a \\"Ladies' Department\\" and Birdsall was hired to edit the section. She lost no time in promoting a feminist agenda. The section also concerned home economics and agricultural items, such as reporting on the State Fair. Birdsall encouraged her female readers to support women-owned newspapers, such as The Genius of Liberty, published by Elizabeth A. Aldrich in Cincinnati. Birdsall editorialized and published stories urging women to improve their minds and find challenging professions, which she believed would contribute to the betterment of their families, rather than detracting from their roles as wives and mothers. Her tenure at the newspaper, while being well-received, was brief, ending in March 1853. The Indiana Farmer's tenure in Richmond was also brief. It was sold and moved to Indianapolis. = The Lily = The February 1859 masthead for The Lily, published in Richmond, Indiana. About 1848, the newly formed women's temperance society in Seneca Falls, New York, decided they wish to promote their cause with a local newspaper of their own device. They formed a committee to name and construct the paper, but soon lost heart in the enterprise. Amelia Bloomer, however, was determined to carry it through and took over the paper, editorially and financially. The paper was probably the first one focused on women and entirely published and edited by women. The temperance committee chair had chosen the name, The Lily, to represent its purity motive. Bloomer never cared for it, but didn't feel right about changing it, so the name remained. At first, the paper's focus was strictly temperance, but Bloomer soon began promoting women's rights. Circulation expanded greatly after her proposals on dress reform. The introduction of Turkish pantaloons and a short skirt that became widely known as \\"bloomers\\" made national news. When Bloomer and her husband moved from Seneca Falls to Ohio, the paper went with them. However, when they decided to move to Council Bluffs, Iowa, far from any means of distribution, Bloomer decided to sell the paper.Bloomer, p. 142, 186 - 188. Bloomer attended the National Women's Rights Convention in 1853, in which Birdsall also participated. Bloomer visited Richmond, Indiana, on an extension of that trip, giving her ample opportunity to meet Birdsall.Bloomer, p. 137 - 141. Bloomer sold the paper to Birdsall in late 1854 and Birdsall first appeared as editor and proprietor in January 1855. Birdsall was assisted by Mary F. Thomas, another Richmond resident and suffragist who later became city physician. Thomas edited the paper in Birdsall's place throughout 1857. The pair continued to publish feminist and suffragist articles until at least 1859. In 1976, a copy of the second February 1859 edition came to light when it was sold to the Richmond Palladium-Item by Arthur Whalen's estate. Birdsall was still listed as the editor in that issue. During the time Birdsall was associated with the Indiana Farmer and The Lily, these two semi-monthly publications had circulations of about 3,000.  Activism  = Indiana women's rights conventions = Like many Quakers, the Birdsalls were active in a number of social reform movements including temperance, suffrage, and abolition. At an anti-slavery meeting held at Greensboro in Henry County, Indiana, Amanda M. Way proposed a resolution to hold the first Indiana women's rights convention, which the assembly adopted and appointed Way to chair the committee.Stanton et al. p. 306 The first convention took place on October 14–15, 1851, at the old United Brethren Church in Dublin, Indiana, with Birdsall serving as secretary for the convention.Stanton et al. pp. 807-8 The second convention was held the following October in Richmond, which Birdsall helped to organize. At that gathering, both she and her husband signed the organizational papers and constitution to form the Woman's Rights Association of Indiana. Birdsall was elected secretary, a position she held for several more years.Stanton et al. pp. 306–13 The attendees at the second convention discussed and passed more than a dozen resolutions pertaining to \\"elevating\\" women to equal status with men. They argued that citizenship was a moral and mental condition and that women were, in that sense, the same as men. They wanted women to receive the same education as men, in the same institutions. They encouraged all women to pursue an occupation to support themselves, rather than relying on men, for which they should receive equal pay for equal work. Birdsall wrote and submitted the convention minutes to several newspapers for publication. Birdsall served as one of a group of vice presidents at the fourth National Women's Rights Convention that was held in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1853. The 1854 Indiana women's rights convention moved from Richmond to the capital city, Indianapolis, Indiana, and was held in Masonic Hall, where the local press regarded it with disdain.Stanton et al. p. 307 In 1855, the convention met at Washington Hall in Indianapolis and attracted national members of the suffrage movement, including James and Lucretia Mott, who spoke at the convention, as did Ernestine L Rose. In 1858, the convention returned to Richmond, largely due to Birdsall's efforts, and it was during this meeting that members of the group composed a petition to the Indiana General Assembly advocating women's rights. At the ninth convention in 1859, Birdsall was elected president of the association.Stanton et al. p. 310 The Civil War pushed suffrage and women's rights out of view, and the next convention was not held in Indiana until 1869, when the organization was renamed the Indiana Woman's Suffrage Association.Stanton et al. v. III, p.534 =Address to the Indiana General Assembly= alt= On January 19, 1859, the House and the Senate convened in a rare joint session of the state legislature. The Speaker of the House initially had difficulty moving through the large crowd, which included many women, to convene the meeting and many legislators had to stand during the presentation. Mary F. Thomas, Birdsall, and Agnes Cook, who had been given seats at the Speaker's table, presented a petition for women's rights, becoming the first women to address the state legislature. More than one thousand individuals signed the petition, including women residents and legal male voters of Wayne County. Following Cook's brief introductions, Thomas, who noted the large, boisterous crowd, urged the assembly to take the forthcoming presentation seriously before reading the petition aloud. The petition was brief and requested simply that women be granted equal property rights and suffrage. Birdsall spoke next, addressing the session for about a half hour.Stanton et al. p. 309 Her speech was described as \\"a clear and logical plea in behalf of the right of suffrage in woman\\".Indiana Daily State Sentinel, Indianapolis, January 20, 1859. Cited in Scholten p. 354 Only Thomas's address and the petition were published, despite the legislative resolution that the addresses of both women would be printed. No known copy of Birdsall's address exists, but detailed information about the presentation was published in the February 1859 issue of The Lily. Birdsall avowed that no permanent improvement in women's condition could ever occur without equal rights, pointing out that \\"if from time to time there appears a woman rising above traditional prejudice and accumulated obstacles, she must be looked upon as an example of what might oftener have been done under justice\\".Birdsall, Mary, publisher (Feb 1859). The Lily V. XI No. 2. Cited in \\"The 'elevation of women\\" by Annette Warfel (28 Mar 1994). Richmond, IN. Palladium-Item p. 7. She also pointed out that any \\"inferior\\" female characteristics were actually caused by lack of opportunity for women in education and employment, not the reason for it, and the only way to ensure self-protection was through the right to vote. Cook concluded their remarks, describing how enfranchised women would be more effective in the cause of temperance. After Cook finished her presentation, the joint session resolved into a committee of the whole to discuss adding the petition to the legislative agenda, after which the meeting was adjourned and members of the Indiana Senate retired to their own chamber. Although there had been some measure of decorum throughout the proceedings, once concluded, the men began loudly ridiculing the entire notion of women's rights. The mockery continued in the press. The following day, the Senate committee assigned to consider the petition decided to take no further action on the matter. The House agreed. Although the legislature did not grant women their request for voting and property rights, the three suffragists' efforts paved the way for other Hoosier women to fight for the vote by addressing the legislature. Amanda Way and Emma Swank, who were instrumental in the 1859 legislative effort, addressed the state legislature in 1871.  Mary Birdsall House  The Mary Birdsall House in Richmond, Indiana. Construction of the Mary Birdsall House, as it came to be known, began in 1859 and was completed in 1860. The Birdsalls called the home \\"Brightbank.\\" The Italianate house is located on a large lot at the northwest corner of West Fifth Street and Richmond Avenue in Richmond, Indiana. The builders used bricks from the Thistlethwaite brick yard on an adjacent property. The two-story, cruciform house is remarkably similar to a plan published in 1872 by Catherine Beecher and Harriett Beecher Stowe in their book, American Woman's Home. The book promoted a scientific approach to home design The Birdsall's son, William W., acquired the home in 1896. The house was sold to Charles and Laura Moore in 1899. Trustees of the Whitewater Monthly Meeting, Religious Society of Friends, acquired the house in 1927 and named it Lauramoore for the previous owner. They used it as a retirement home for the elderly and as a temporary meeting place for worship after selling their meeting place on North A Street. The society extended the building by adding bedrooms, a kitchen, and back stairs. The Lauramoore Home was privately incorporated in 1951 as a non- sectarian retirement home. Earlham College assumed ownership of Lauramoore in December 2010 as a gift from the retirement home company. The house, now known as the Lauramoore Guest House and Retreat Center, also hosts visitors to the college. In 1999 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2012, a plaque honoring Birdsall was placed on the Lauramoore property in a ceremony that included John Thistlethwaite, one of Birdsall's relatives.  Later life  Birdsall continued her community service activities through a committee of women who formed the Union Relief Association. This organization was founded to aid the destitute by finding them employment, and they established a home for orphans and other needy children. Thomas Birdsall was also active in the community. He met with other temperance-minded male citizens of Richmond in August 1867 to form the Richmond Temperance Society and was elected to serve as its president. Though she had a long association with the Society of Friends, Birdsall stopped attending meetings around 1869. When the Whitewater Monthly Meeting inquired about her absence in the summer of 1872, she reported that she no longer felt connected with the religion. When they proposed to disown her, she consented and the break was formalized in August. She had the right to appeal, but never did so.Whitewater Monthly Meeting. 1872.

Milling removes anywhere from just enough thickness to level and smooth the surface to a full depth removal. There are a number of different reasons for milling a paved area instead of simply repaving over the existing surface.  Purpose  Recycling of the road surface is one of the main reasons for milling a road surface. Milling is widely used for pavement recycling today, where the pavement is removed and ground up to be used as the aggregate in new pavement. For asphalt surfaces the product of milling is reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP), which can be recycled in the asphalt hot mix asphalt (pavement) by combining with new aggregate and asphalt cement (binder) or a recycling agent. This reduces the impact that resurfacing has on the environment. Milling can also remove distresses from the surface, providing a better driving experience and/or longer roadway life. Some of the issues that milling can remove include: * Raveling: aggregate becoming separated from the binder and loose on the road * Bleeding: the binder (asphalt) coming up to the surface of the road * Rutting: formation of low spots in pavement along the direction of travel usually in the wheel path * Shoving: a washboard like effect transverse to the direction of travel * Ride quality: uneven road surface such as swells, bumps, sags, or depressions * Damage: resulting from accidents and/or fires It can also be used to control or change the height of part or all of the road. This can be done to control heights and clearances of other road structures such as: curb reveals, manhole and catch basin heights, shoulder and guardrail heights, and overhead clearances. It can also be done to change the slope or camber of the road or for grade adjustments which can help with drainage. = Specialty = Modified roto-mill head for dowel bar retrofit Dowel bar retrofit slots after the milling Specialty milling can be used to form rumble strips which are often used along highways. Using milling instead of other methods, such as rolling them in, means that the rumble strips can be added at any time after the road surface has hardened. Another example is to modify the roto-milling head to create slots in concrete slabs for the dowel bar retrofit process. The typical process is to saw cut and jackhammer out the slots for the dowels. Following dowel placement, the slots are then typically backfilled with a non-shrink concrete mixture, and the pavement is diamond-ground to restore smoothness. This special milling process shortens the time to create slots from the traditional method which is labor- intensive.  Types  The Asphalt Recycling and Reclaiming Association has defined five classes of cold planing that the Federal Highway Administration has recognized. The classes are: *Class I - milling to remove surface irregularities *Class II - milling to uniform depth as shown on plans and specifications *Class III - same as class II with the addition of cross slope *Class IV - milling to the base or subgrade (full depth) *Class V - milling to different depths at different locations  Process and machinery  Asphalt Milling Machine Milling is performed by construction equipment called milling machines or cold planers. These machines use a large rotating drum to remove and grind the road surface. The drum consists of scrolls of tool holders. The scrolls are positioned around the drum such that the ground pavement is moved toward the center and can be loaded onto the machine's conveyor belt. The tool holders can wear out over time and can be broken while milling if highway structures like manholes are encountered while milling. The tool holders on the drum hold carbide cutters. The cutters can be removed and replaced as they wear out. The amount of wear (and therefore the interval between replacement) varies with the type and consistency of the material being milled; intervals can range from a few hours to several days. The drum is enclosed in a housing/scrapper that is used to contain the milled material to be collected and deposited on the conveyor. The spacing of the tool spirals around the drum affect the end surface of the road, with micro-milling having the tightest spacing. The majority of milling machines use an up-cut setup which means that the drum rotates in the direction opposite that of the drive wheel or tracks, (i.e. work surface feeds into the cut). The speed of the rotating drum should be slower than the forward speed of the machine for a suitable finished surface. Modern machines generally use a front-loading conveyor system that have the advantage of picking up any material that falls off the conveyor as milling progresses. Water is generally applied to the drum as it spins, because of the heat generated during the milling process. Additionally, water helps control the dust created. In order to control the depth, slopes, and profile of the final milled surface many millers now have automatic depth control using lasers, string-lines, or other methods to maintain milled surfaces to ± of the target height. Pavement milling drums  Micro milling  Micro milling is also known as carbide grinding. It is a lower cost alternative to diamond grinding of pavement. Micro milling uses a specialty drum with three to four times as many cutting teeth than a standard milling drum. Micro milling can be used either as the final surface or as a treatment before applying a thin overlay. Micro milling can be used to remove many of the same distresses that standard milling can remove, although usually to a shallower depth. A micro milled surface has a uniform finish with reduced road noise compared to standard milling.

The route takes its name from its part of Corridor K of the Appalachian Development Highway System, and is sometimes called Appalachian Highway or simply the Cleveland Bypass. The route is also designated as Veterans Memorial Highway. The US 64 Byp. section of the road is also multiplexed with unsigned State Route 311 (SR 311) and US 74, and is also known as the US 74 Bypass. The road is a four-lane divided highway its entire length and parts are controlled-access. The bypass is an east-west route and the state route is a north-south. While the road is a bypass around downtown Cleveland, it has come to be one of the heaviest traveled roads in the area, with industries and major businesses locating to it. It has been reported as the road where the most roadway accidents and fatalities occur in Bradley County.  Route description  APD-40/US 64 Byp. westbound approaching US 11/64 (South Lee Highway). Aerial view of the cloverleaf interchange with APD-40 (US 64 Byp., SR 60) and US 64 (Inman Street, Waterlevel Highway) APD-40 begins at the exit 20 interchange on Interstate 75 (I-75) as US 64 Byp. This is also the western terminus of Corridor K. Beginning as controlled-access, it rounds a minor curve to the southeast and enters a long straightaway on the edge of the city limits of Cleveland, and comes to an interchange first with the Cherokee Gateway and then US 11/US 64 (South Lee Highway) approximately later. The route then crosses Candies Creek Ridge on a relatively steep grade, and about from the interstate, the freeway ends, and the road enters South Cleveland, passing an industrial park with several major factories and manufacturers, and crosses a Norfolk Southern Railway. It then crosses Lead Mine Ridge, junctions at an interchange with Blue Springs Road, a connector to Red Clay State Park in southern Bradley County, and crosses another Norfolk Southern railroad. The road travels for about a mile through a business and residential area before crossing SR 60 (Dalton Pike) and intersecting with McGrady Drive, which is a connector to SR 60\\\\. The road then curves sharply to the northeast and becomes a limited access highway, coming to an interchange with SR 74 (Spring Place Road) about later. Bypassing Cleveland to the east on the edge of East Cleveland, the route enters a straightaway, and about a mile later, APD-40 again becomes a freeway, interchanging with US 64 in a cloverleaf interchange and becoming SR 60\\\\. Here the ADHS corridor splits from the route and continues east on US 64 into North Carolina. The road curves slightly to the northwest and has an interchange with Benton Pike. It then has an interchange with Overhead Bridge Road, crosses a Norfolk Southern line, and finally has an interchange with 20th Street NE, before curving again to the northwest where the freeway ends and the road becomes 25th Street, entering into the metropolis of Cleveland. The road intersects with US 11 (Ocoee Street) about a half mile (0.8 km) later and I-75 about beyond this point, continuing north eventually to Dayton.  History  =Construction and early history= The route that is now APD-40 was originally proposed and built to relieve congestion and divert commercial through traffic away from downtown Cleveland that increased as a result of industrial and residential growth. The first section, located between I-75 and South Lee Highway, was constructed at the same time as the corresponding section of I-75 between Ooltewah and northern Cleveland, and opened at the same time in October 1966. Extension of the route to US 64, a project that also included widening of US 64 in Bradley County, was authorized in January 1969. The contract for the segment between South Lee Highway and Blythe Avenue, about east of Blue Springs Road, was awarded on January 30, 1970, and construction was completed in November 1971. The contract to construct the segment between Blythe Avenue and US 64 was awarded on November 19, 1971, and the segment was opened to traffic in April 1973 and completed four months later. The final portion, located between US 64 and US 11, was authorized in December 1971. Awarded in two separate contracts, the first construction phase began in April of 1973, and the second phase in February of 1974. The section was opened to traffic in November 1974, and completed the following month. This section was not in the original plan; the original plan called for the road to end at US 64, but it was later decided to extend it to US 11 (Ocoee Street) and 25th Street NE, and form a complete beltway. SR 60 originally turned south about past the interchange with I-75 and went directly to downtown, but was moved to 25th Street NW in the mid 1960s after being widened, and the section of APD-40 to US 64 after opening. The first segment of APD-40 was initially signed as part of State Route 40, which is part of the origin of the name APD-40. It became known as the U.S. Route 64 Bypass and the State Route 40 Bypass after construction began on the extension. In 1982, after TDOT modified the highway numbering system for state highways, the SR 40 Bypass was replaced with SR 311. US 74 was added to the route in 1986. This route, however, remains largely unsigned. =Traffic hazards= Early in its history, APD-40 developed a notoriety for its high rate of traffic accidents, and continues to be the route with the highest rate of accidents in Bradley County. In 1973 a four-way intersection with Varnell Road, located at the bottom of the steep downgrade on the western slope of Candies Creek Ridge was reconstructed with an overpass after many accidents, including one with fatalities, occurred immediately after being opened to traffic. Prior to construction, the then-incumbent superintendent of the Bradley County Road Department had reportedly requested TDOT to make this change to the design, but they had refused. Other portions of the road, including interchanges, have also received criticism as being hazardous and poorly designed. =Recent developments= APD-40 was designated as \\"Veterans Memorial Highway\\" by the Tennessee General Assembly in 2007. In May 2013, the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) began a project to rework the interchange with I-75. The original route narrowed at the interchange, and crossed the interstate on a two-lane bridge. The project was declared complete on December 16, 2015. The old bridge was replaced with a six-lane bridge, and the ramps were rebuilt and widened, with turn lanes added. Construction began on a new interchange with the newly constructed Cherokee Gateway located about midway between I-75 and South Lee Highway in 2015. The interchange had been proposed since at least 2009, and connects to a proposed industrial area. It was completed in May 2017 and was named in honor of Cleveland's mayor Tom Rowland. In 2016, the parallel bridges across 20th Street, the railroad, and Overhead Bridge Road were designated as the Dustin Ledford Memorial Bridge in honor of a man who was killed by an intoxicated driver near the Overhead Bridge Road exit.

It was a gift from Colonel Thomas Walter Harding, Lord Mayor of Leeds between 1898 and 1899. The choice was probably also a tribute to the future Edward VII, then Prince of Wales, who opened Leeds Infirmary in 1867 and the Yorkshire College buildings (now the University of Leeds) in 1885. The statue is the centrepiece of an array of statues in the square, including more local people such as Joseph Priestley. * The Black Prince at Crecy by Julian Russell Story is a large and detailed painting of Edward, in black armour, standing after a battle above vanquished enemy King John of Bohemia.

One of the closest advisors to Emperor Menelik II, he went on to become the first governor of Dire Dawa, and surrounding areas (1902–1905). Prior to that he was governor of the strategic and frontier district of Jaldessa (Gildessa) and its environd where he also held the position of head of customs. His public career lasted over three decades from the era of Menelik II until the reign of Haile Selassie. He was one of the most recognized Ethiopians of his time. He knew the French language and was open to European ideas and way of life earning him admiration abroad. His most enduring legacy was the construction, maintenance and security of the first railway which he oversaw at the request of Menilek. Mersha belongs to a generation who took advantage of the relative stability of the late 19th – early 20th century to implement a series of wide-ranging political, economic and social reforms which put the country on the path to modernization ushering in a new era. Early life =Childhood and Formative Years= Ato (Mr.) Mersha Nahusenay (አቶ መርሻ ናሁሠናይ) was born about 1850 near the town of Ankober, the former capital of Shewa. According to oral history, Mersha came from a family of priests. His parents were strict followers of the Ethiopian Orthodox faith and religion played a central role in their life. Mersha's childhood was hence heavily influenced by events involving the Church where he was also baptized. Family lore further indicates that his father possessed a land given to him in return for the service he rendered to the church. In addition to holding lands, churches at the time received considerable assistance from the royal palace which they then used to provide key services to their members and communities, including the education of children. Thus Mersha was taught reading and writing at an early age and received traditional church education. Whether or not he had any siblings remains unknown although the name Mersha in the Amharic language implies a desire to forget a traumatic experience such as the loss of a previous child. Growing up, Mersha spent a great deal of time on the farm with his parents. He traveled to various places within Shewa and beyond allowing him to interact with a diverse group of people and explore opportunities which existed for a career in a secular field. For example, early on he learned to appreciate the importance local as well as foreign languages. Beyond these sketchy details, little is known about Mersha's early life at this point. It is unclear, for example, if he had royal ancestry. The fact that he was later married to the daughter of one of Menilek's trusted servants suggests, however, that the family had close ties to the palace. Overall there is little doubt that Mersha's formative and early adulthood experiences helped him prepare for his long and illustrious public career. It's worth noting that today Ankober is one of many districts (woredas) of Ethiopia. But back then, it was the capital of one of several powerful kingdoms. The following quote encapsulates the vitality of the Ankober area at the time: > The early nineteenth-century Shawan royal capital of Ankober was a > spectacular sight, ‘perched at 2400 meters atop a volcanic cone above the > steep escarpment of the eastern highlands’. It commanded a prosperous, > cosmopolitan and culturally diverse polity. Founded as a frontier outpost in > the late-eighteenth century, fifty years later Ankober stood amidst a rich > agricultural area and controlled the Red Sea trade through regional markets > such as Aliyu Amba. Visited by Muslim merchants and traders from the > Mediterranean, and a busy ecclesiastical base of Orthodox theology, Ankober > was a lively commercial and intellectual center. By mid-19th century, Ankober had established trade and diplomatic ties with the outside world. As a result, there was strong public interest in international affairs, foreign languages, history, geography and medicine, as well as the design, manufacturing and function of machines and tools as documented by missionaries. Under Menilek, the last ruler of Shewa (1865–1889), Ankober rapidly evolved into a vibrant political and economic center. Trade was expanded to the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea via Harar. Mersha also grew up in one of the most consequential periods in the nation's history. The second half of the nineteenth century was a turning point in the sense that it marked the end a long period of deep divisions within and between the various kingdoms located in the northern part of the country known as the Era of Princes or Zemene Mesafint (1769–1855). Emperor Tewodros (Tewodros II) was the first ruler (1855–1868) in the modern era to try and unify the northern kingdoms. Included in Tewodros' vision also was the introduction of European-style civilization. His efforts were cut short however by internal resistance and external challenges as well as his untimely death. Emperor Yohannes (Yohannes IV) further pursued the unification agenda during his reign (1872–1889), but he was unfortunately killed in a war with Mahdist Sudan. Emperor Menelik II (1889–1913), his successor, the fortunate one to realize the dreams of his predecessors and much more. He succeeded in bringing together, under a cental authority, northern and southern territories. Through a combination of diplomacy and military campaigns, he was able to create a new empire paving the way for the emergence of modern Ethiopia. Menilek's extraordinary achievements, including his leadership in the decisive victory over Italy at Adwa, in 1896, enabled him to put the country on the path to stability and modernization. According to the prominent Ethiopian historian Tekletsadiq Mekuria, Menilek's top priorities included: negotiating Ethiopia's borders with the three European colonial powers (i.e., France, Britain and Italy) who controlled much of Eastern Africa; securing access to the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea as a way of improving trade relations with Europe and beyond; maintaining security and stability across the vast empire; implementing wide-ranging political, economic and social reforms; and building Ethiopia's image abroad. As will be seen below, Mersha was at the forefront of most, if not all, of these undertakings. He answered repeated calls for public service and rose to the occasion by taking on challenging tasks. More importantly, he was a strong advocate for reform and European-style modernization. The renowned Ethiopian historian Tekletsadiq Mekuria wrote in his book Atse Menilek and the Unity of Ethiopia: > ስለዚህ ዐፄ ምኒልክ የነዚህንና የውጭ አገር ተወላጅ አማካሪዎች ምክር በመስማት እውጭ አገር ደርሰው መጠነኛ እውቀት > እየቀሰሙ የተመለሱትን የነግራዝማች ዬሴፍን፤ የነነጋድራስ ዘውገን፤ የእነ አቶ አጥሜን፤ የነ አቶ መርሻ ናሁ ሠናይን፤ የነ > ብላታ ገብረ እግዚአብሔርን፤ የነ ከንቲባ ገብሩን፤ የነአለቃ ታየን፤ የነነጋድራስ ገብረ ሕይወት ባይከዳኝን፤ የነአቶ > ኃይለማርያም ስራብዮንን፤ አስተያየት በማዳመጥ በአገራቸው የአውሮፓን ሥልጣኔ ለማስገባት ታጥቀው ተነሡ። English > translation: Thus, after listening to the advice of these and other personal > foreign advisors and taking into account the views of those who had > travelled abroad and returned with limited knowledge such as Grazmach Yosef, > Negaddras Zewge, Ato Atsme, Ato Mersha Nahusenay, Blata Gebre Egziabher, > Kentiba Gebru, Aleqa Taye, Negadras Gebre Hiwot Baykedagn and Ato > Hailemariam Serabyo, Atse Menilek decided to introduce European civilization > to his country. Statue of Emperor Menilek II in Addis Abeba Later life Whether Mersha Nahusenay held any official government positions before Menilek II became Emperor of Ethiopia in 1889 remains unknown. What is evident from historical records is sometime in the early 1890s, at the age of about 40, he left his birthplace and settled in the Harar province. By then, Ankober had declined in part due to the rise of Addis Abeba (Addis Ababa), the new capital of Ethiopia founded in 1886 by Menilek and his influential wife Empress Taytu Betul (1851–1918). =Governor of Jaldessa and Head of Imperial Customs= Mersha's relocation to Harar marked the beginning of his long and distinguished career. By some accounts as early as 1892, but surely by 1895, he was appointed governor of Jaldessa (Gildessa, Jildessa, Guildessa, Gheldessa), a historic and strategic district near the present city of Harar. According to one source., at the time, Jaldessa had approximately 6,000 inhabitants at the time compared to 8,000 in the port city of Djibouti and 30,000 in Harar. Not only was Jaldessa a frontier town to Menilek's empire, but it was also located along an important caravan route connecting Ethiopia with the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea coast. As a result, all visitors were required to pass through an armed and customs post established there by the Ethiopian authority and administered by Mersha. As chief of customs, Jaldessa Mersha oversaw the import of all goods. Caravans were stopped and inspected. Import duty of 10 per cent was levied on merchandise generating important revenue for the empire. The economic value of Jaldessa grew considerably after the port of Djibouti became operational. However, it sharply declined following the founding of Dire Dawa, in 1902. As governor, Mersha controlled and administered a vast area between Ethiopian borders with the French and British Somalilands and the Awash River. The territory was inhabited by Somalis, Oromos, Afars and other ethnic groups. He served under Ras Mekonnen Woldemichael (Makonnen Wolde Mikael), who was governor of Harar Province until his untimely death in 1906. The Armenian Sarkis Terzian (1868–1915) served as governor of Jaldessa before him. Terzian, a personality well known to scholars of Ethiopian history, served Menilek in various capacities, including the import of arms and ammunition. Apparently, there was confusion at times about who owned what. On one occasion, Mersha confiscated arms claimed by Terzian, according to distinguished historian Richard Pankhurst. Lord Hindlip, a British businessman and adventurer and a member of an Anglo-American expedition, described his visit to Mersha's residence as follows: > He received us in his official residence, a small circular hut with the > usual pointed roof, built on a conical hill. His furniture consisted of a > table, chair, two beds, a photograph of an Abyssinian priest, and a coloured > Crucification, while his rifle, shield, and revolver were hung on the > walls.Lord Hindlip (1906). Sport and Travel in Abyssinia. > https://archive.org/details/sporttravelabyss00hind Furthermore, Jaldessa was at the center of international negotiations between Menilek and the three colonial powers. Article 3 of the 1897 treaty signed between Britain and Ethiopia, for example, stated that the route between Zeyla (Zeila) and Harar via Gildessa should remain open for the commercial interests of the two countries. Mersha was regularly consulted on relevant matters. He was also directly responsible for implementation of agreements. For instance, in 1896, he hosted Cyrille Macaire (Kyrillos Makarios), a coptic Egyptian bishop who came as a special envoy of Pope Leo XIII to plead with Menilek to free the Italian prisoners from the battle of Adwa.Cyrille évêque de Césarée. Le Prêtre: journal des études ecclésiastiques. Vol. 19. Sueur-Charruey, Paris 1896: 67 When the prisoners were freed ultimately, they were brought to an area near Gildessa to meet with an Italian Red Cross team before being transported to Harar for safe return to Italy. Mersha visited Djibouti on several occasions, including at the request of Emperor Menilek. His knowledge of French was invaluable during his foreign trips. =Promoter of the progressive image of Ethiopia= Following the victory at Adwa (1896), there was a heightened global interest in strengthening diplomatic and trade relations with Ethiopia. A large number of foreign nationals, including diplomats, journalists, writers, scientists and explorers visited the empire. The visitors were intrigued by Menilek's wisdom and accomplishments. Realizing the significance of the moment for the future, the emperor was equally determined to build a progressive image of his nation. What better place to create a good first impression than the frontier town of Jaldessa? Lord Edward Gleichen, the British courtier, officer and author who visited Ethiopia in 1897 and who was a member of Sir Rennell Rodd's diplomatic mission wrote the following: > Next day we made a long march of twenty-four miles over stony country to > Garasle, a pretty little river, three inches deep, running between high > banks, and a three hours' march on the following morning brought us to > Gildessa. Here we were received in great state by the governor, one Aito > Merzha (i.e., Ato Mersha), who, to impress on us that we were now on > Abyssinian territory, had turned out a guard of about a dozen men, all armed > with rifles and carrying the Abyssinian flag. The latter, I fear, did not > impress us much, as it only consisted of triangular yellow, red, and green > pennons nailed on a thin and crooked stick; but the guard of honour was very > beautiful. Reception of the British mission led by Rennell Rodd at Gildessa in 1897, after Count Edward Gleichen 1898 Most visitors came to the country through the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea and many camped at Jaldessa for at least a day before traveling further to Addis Abeba, Harar or other parts of the new empire. Thus, Mersha was tasked with providing logistical and other forms of assistance to the guests. He was uniquely positioned to meet and interact with a large number of Europeans and other foreign nationals. In an article published in Le Figaro (April 1901), the French journalist and author Hughes Le Roux noted the following after a long discussion with Mersha.Hughes Le Roux. Marches d'Ethiopie. Le Figaro. No. 95. April 5, 1901. > Je ne sais si ce sage a lu Candide, mais depuis les années déjà longues que > le Roi des rois lui a confié la clef de la première poterne de l'empire, il > a vu défiler beaucoup d'hommes de toutes couleurs, de tous pays, de toutes > langues. English translation: I do not know if this wise man read Candide, > but since for many years the King of Kings has given him the key to the > first gate of the empire, he had seen people of all colors, all countries, > and all languages. The following is a partial list of notables who have either interacted with or hosted by Mersha at Gildessa or Dire Dawa: *Prince Henri of Orleans (1867-1901): French Prince; *Harald George Carlos Swayne (1860–1940): British army officer and author; *Vicomte Edmond de Montaigne de Poncins (1866– 1937): explorer, naturalist and author; *Lord Albert Edward Wilfred Gleichen (1863–1937): British diplomat and author; *Pyotr Mikhailovich Vlasov (1850-1904): head of the Russian Imperial mission to Ethiopia *Jean-Baptiste Marchand (1863–1934): French army officer and explorer; *Robert Peet Skinner (1866–1960): American diplomat; *Lucien Heudebert (1860–1949): French writer; *Jean-François-Albert du Pouget, Marquis de Nadaillac (1818–1904): French anthropologist; *Hughues Le Roux (aka Robert Charles Henri Le Roux) (1860–1925): French journalist, author and senator; *Robert Pierre Marie Robert, vicomte du Bourg de Bozas(1871–1902): French explorer;; *Peter Nikolaevich Krasnov (1869–1947): Russian diplomat and military officer; *Victor Félix Edmond Marie Goedorp (1874–1963): French publicist and author; *Benito Sylvain (1868–1915): Haitian lawyer, anti-slavery activist and Pan Africanist; *Friedrich Rosen (1856–1935): German diplomat, orientalist, author and politician; he is the brother of botanist Felix Rosen. *Kyrillos Makarios or Cyrille Macaire (1867–1921): Egyptian Coptic leader, Patriarch of Alexandria; *Cesare Nerazzini (1849-1912): Italian diplomat, doctor and military officer *William Fitzhugh Whitehouse (1842–1909): American explorer and adventurer; *Felix Rosen (1863–1925): German Botanist, Professor of Botany at Breslau University (then Germany, now Wrocław, Poland); he is the brother of diplomat and orientalist Friedrich Rosen. *François Marie Casimir Mondon- Vidailhet (1847–1910): French journalist, philologist and author; *Sir Charles Allsopp, 3rd Baron Hindlip (1877–1911): British businessman, adventurer and writer; *Rennell Rodd (1858–1941): British diplomat, politician and poet; *Alexander Bulatovich (1870-1919): Russian military officer, diplomat and author. Despite robust diplomatic efforts by Menilek and his domestic as well as foreign advisors, there was a great deal of skepticism initially among many Europeans that Ethiopia was ready to embrace modernization. In an article titled The Menelik Myth, published in 1899, for example, vicomte Edmond de Poncins, the wealthy French naturalist and explorer, concluded: > The history of Ethiopia, then, may be summed up thus: a country in which > communications are difficult, peopled by a multiplicity of races; its > internal life presents ever the same cycle of wars, victories, defeats, its > external life the same blank. A real civilization is impossible in that > black chaos, and the products of civilization, such as agriculture, > invention, commerce, do not exist. In contrast, there were those who offered unwavering support for the expansion of trade and investment in Ethiopia. Menilek's closest European advisors such as the Swiss engineer Alfred Ilg and the French trader Leon Chefneux (“chief commerce advisor”) were incontestably at the top of the list. Mersha worked closely with both of them. But there were others as well. Casimir Mondon- Vidailhet, the French journalist and contributor to the Le Temps, was another important figure who played a major role in advancing Ethio-French relations. Due to his passion for horticulture, Mondon-Vidailhet may have also played a role in popularizing the eucalyptus tree (የባሕር ዛፍ). He also studied local languages (e.g. Amharic, Guraghe, Harari, etc.) and wrote books about them. More relevantly, Mondon-Vidailhet helped advance the progressive image of Menilek and Ethiopia in Europe and the United States. He did this primarily through his speeches and writings. In an interview that he gave to The New York Times, in 1898, Mondon defended Ethiopia's records and potential: > The country lends itself easily to civilization, and its organization, still > encumbered by feudal relations, tends more and more to become modelled on > the lines of European constitutional monarchies. Menelek, powerful and > respected, an enlightened reformer and administrator, who abolished slavery > in his dominions, and dislikes fanatics to whatever sect they belong, has > revealed himself as a really great sovereign, worthy of admiration by his > conduct, as well as by the dignity of his character. Mersha was a strong proponent of opening Ethiopia to the world. He encouraged 'modern' education and supported missionary schools in Harar. He encouraged trade ties with Europe, particularly France, Ethiopia's major strategic ally at the time. The French government awarded Mersha the El-Anouar Nishan in April 1905. The Legion d'Honneur order given to Mersha in April 1905 =Head of the first railway construction= The first and most significant example of European direct investment in Ethiopia was the construction of Ethiopia's first railway. The agreement to create a company for the construction of the railroad was first signed in 1894 between Menilek and Alfred Ilg. The primary European stakeholder was obviously France although British investors also owned shares and bonds at least until 1902 which is when the line reached Addis-Harar, later renamed Dire Dawa. Ethiopia's first train Anbessa Mersha was a key figure in the negotiations, construction and security of the railway during the initial phases of the project (1897–1911). When the Djibouti railroad reached the Ethiopian border town of Dewele (Dawale), in July 1900, he represented the emperor at the inaugural ceremony attended by a delegation of the French government led by Gabriel Louis Angoulvant, acting governor- general of the French Somaliland as well representatives of shareholders and other domestic and foreign diplomats, including Ato Yosef Zagalan, the Ethiopian consul in Djibouti and a dear friend of Mersha. According to one source, emperor Menilek himself was to be present, but he changed his mind later in protest of the growing interference by the French government in the affairs of the Compagnie Imperiale d'Ethiopie to which he granted concession.T. Lennox Gilmour (1906). Abyssinia: The Ethiopian Railway and the Powers. London. A. Rivers, Limited. Things became worse and the construction was interrupted for several years following the completion of the Djibouti- Dire Dawa line. When the work resumed in 1909, Mersha was once again called to serve. The task given to him and other local officials was to oversee the extension of the meter-gauge line up to Awash. The railway reached Addis Abeba only in 1917. By then emperor Menilek had died and his daughter Zewditu was head of the empire. Emperor Menilek's letter to Mersha, written in December 1908 English translation of Menilek's letter to Mersha: > Dear Ato Mersha. How have you been? I, thank God, am well. Since the French > railway companies informed me that they would resume construction, I would > like you to manage the work in consultation with Negadras Yigezu. Written in > the city of Debre Libanos on the 2nd day of Tahsas 1901. (*The above letter has been included in the recent book titled 'Emperor Menilek's Domestic Letters' as letter #1898 (Paulos Gnogno collections); Aster Nega Publishers; 2010 p. 517). The historian Richard Pankhurst called the first railway “the country’s greatest technological achievement of the period.” It led to rapid expansion of domestic and foreign trade. By cutting the amount of travel time to the coast in half, for example, the railroad increased the import and export of commodities drastically. It accelerated the process of urbanization as it paved the way to the rise of new settlements and villages and transformation of towns such as Harar and Addis Abeba. The movement of people from south to north and vice versa grew considerably. In short, the railway made life better for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Ethiopians. More importantly, it connected the country to the sea. Robert P Skinner, the diplomat who led the first US mission, in 1903–04, noted the following about the importance of the railway to the economyMonthly Consular Reports.: Abyssinia. In Congressional Serial Set. Volume LXXV; June 1904; No. 285: 529–570; U.S. Government Printing Office, 1904 - United States > The custom-house figures show a movement of importations and exportations in > 1902 amounting $1,659,800, but, having in mind the methods of appraisement > and the possibility of entering goods in contraband, it may be > conservatively stated that the total trade under present conditions amounts > to $3,000,000 per annum. Henceforth, this trade will grow rapidly, although > the full power of the country will not be appreciated until the railroad is > extended to the capital, 300 miles distant from its present terminus. Spinner further observed: > When the railroad connecting the Empire and the sea was projected, a route > was naturally selected which should give the greatest advantages to > commerce...A town was created at this point, to which was given the name > Dire Douah, and it has already become an important business center.... =Pioneer and the first governor of Dire Dawa= The conclusion of the Djibouti-Dire Dawa railway, in 1902, marked the birth of Dire Dawa, the second largest city in Ethiopia. Shortly after, Mersha was ordered to move the Jaldessa custom house and his residence to the new terminus making him the first governor of the railway city. Not only he was at the right place at the right time, but this was a natural extension of his administrative responsibilities. Getahun Mesfin Haile, an expert on the history of Dire Dawa wrote: > Before the foundation of the town, the whole frontier region up to Dawale > including the great environ of Dire Dawa used to be administered by a > governor whose seat normally was at Jeldessa, a few km to the east of Dire > Dawa. In 1902 the Governor was one Mersha Nahusenay, an educated and also > French speaking personality, who took a considerable part in the foundation > of the station and eventually of the town. He went on to say; > The earliest town quarters of Käzira and Mägala, which sprang up following > the establishment by the railway company of a station and its main workshop, > soon evolved into the two most important nodes of economic, social and > administrative activities of the new town. Käzira was built according to a > regular plan and well provided with modern amenities. In the meantime, Ato > Märsha Nahusänay, the first governor, and his followers, cleared and settled > an area of land across from Käzira on the opposite side of the Dächatu that > was largely covered with dense brush and cacti then. Growing out of this > nucleus the larger quarter of Mägala took shape by degrees. In fact, the > present quarter of Dächatu used to be known as Gändä-Märsha in the past in > honor of its illustrious resident and founder. Thus, it didn't take long before residential communities appeared and roads, offices and workshops as well as other critical facilities were built under the leadership of Leon Chefneux and Mersha. In the first several years of its founding, residents of the new town and the Franco-Ethiopian railway company were able to lay the foundation for what later became a French-style, cosmopolitan city. Sadly, unlike other towns, foreigners and locals did not live in the same area. Kezira or Gezira became a European quarter while Megala was inhabited by natives. Richard Pankhurst called Dire Dawa “Ethiopia’s first modern town\\". Not only Dire Dawa was built differently than other towns of the time, but its administration was also unique. Historian Shiferaw Bekele noted: > The officials shared certain important characteristics which sharply set > them apart from the general run of Ethiopian officialdom at the time… Almost > in every province, one would meet one or two men who belonged to this > category. However, in no other much concentration as in Dire Dawa. Shiferaw, who is an expert on the early history of Dire Dawa, went on to say: > The Dire Dawan officialdom invariably spoke at least one European language. > Even the earliest, Mersha, spoke French. A good number of them were highly > educated. Afework Gebre Yesus and Gebre Hiwot Baykedagn who were the > directors of Customs had had long years of stay in Europe where they had > attained a tertiary level education. Beshah Wured was educated in the United > States. The rest had gone to Mission schools. Mersha served as governor from 1902 until 1906. He was in charge of administrative as well as judicial affairs. He even held courts \\"under a tree\\" in the early years of his tenure. He was succeeded by Ato Negatu Gugsa. The Dire Dawa municipality did not emerge until sometime between 1915 and 1920. =Chief of railway security= The agreements signed by the Ethiopian government and the railway company required Ethiopia to deploy a police force to safeguard the line and safety of employees. The mission was extremely dangerous due to local hostilities. Mersha became head of railway security full-time in 1906. His strategy for success included working with local chiefs and leaders. In fact he also assumed the position of chief of the Issa territory which much of the opposition to the construction came from. Shiferaw Bekele wrote: > As the governor of the province through with the line passed, he (i.e. Ato > Mersha) was responsible for the peace and security of the line. He posted > detachments of troops all along the line. He carried out negotiations with > all the important chiefs of the Afar and Somali tribes in the region. He > received orders from Ras Mekonnen and from Menilek. He was in charge of the recruitment, training of the security personnel; negotiated their wage with the company; and settled disputes. He had always been the middle man between the railway company and Ethiopians. That involved making sure that the company honored its contractual obligations as well. As early as September 1900, for example, Mr. J. Gerolimato, the British consul agent in Harar, sent the following message to his boss, James Hayes Sadler, the Consul-General of the British-Somaliland: > Dear Sir: BEFORE yesterday, Atto Marcha, Governor of Jildessa, who was in > Jibuti arrived here. There were in Daranli (i.e., Dawale) 200 Abyssinians to > protect the line against the Essa (i.e., Issa), the Company paying 12 > dollars per month for each Abyssinian soldier; now the Company paid them 8 > dollars, instead of 12 dollars, and the Abyssinians have withdrawn these 200 > men.Sessional (Parliamentary) Papers, Volume 48.

Djibouti. which he held until the mid-1920s with the exception of his brief dismissal by Lij Iyasu in 1916. =The Dawn of Modernization= The desire to introduce European style modernization was not unique to Emperor Menelik II. However, it was under him that the country took important practical steps in terms of establishing modern institutions and structure of governance. Transport and communication got a huge boost. The first telephone and telegraph were introduced following the first railway. Major roads were built and bicycles and automobiles appeared for the first time. The tax system was restructured. A modern monetary system was created. The first bank (Bank of Abyssinia) was established. A national currency was launched. The governance system underwent significant reorganization. The first cabinet of ministers was formed. Each of the six districts had two judges appointed by Menilek himself. The position of a supreme judge was created. The first public schools; the first newspaper, the first hotels, the first hospitals and post offices emerged. The list goes on. Although Mersha was principally involved in the construction of the railway and establishment of \\"modern\\" customs, he also participated in other important reforms such as the creation of postal and telegraph services. After Menilek died in 1913, following a long illness, his grandson Iyasu V became the de facto ruler. Mersha was about sixty years of age at the time. During his brief reign (1913–1916), Iyasu seems to have continued some of the reforms that he inherited. However, he also made political miscalculations resulting in his removal from power. In 1915, for example, Iyasu appointed Hasib Ydlibi (Idlibi), a Turk of Syrian origin with business experience, governor of Dire Dawa and Neggadras of Harar.Yidlibi, May (2006). With Ethiopian Rulers (A Biography of Hasib Yidlibi). Addis Ababa University Press. The appointment was kept secret from Dejazmach Teferi (Tafari) Mekonnen, his cousin and governor of Harar Province. But then in July 1916, a few months before his ouster, Iyasu took the unprecedented step of deposing Teferi from his governorship creating further tensions between them and leading to anger in a province traditionally governed by that family. Iyasu also seem to have chosen a foreign policy which sought to alienate traditional allies such as France and strengthen relations with Germany and Turkey (then Ottoman Empire). Perhaps because of that, he went on to remove Mersha from his post at the railway and replace him with Abubakar Mahammad, another important historic figure in Ethiopian history. Ironically, just months before their dismissal, both Dejach Teferi and Mersha had accompanied Iyasu during his trip to the region along with a number of other notables, including Mikael Berru (a German educated, British agency interpreter and father of the Sorbonne graduate Lij Seifu Mikael) and Tesemma Eshete. The radical changes were quickly picked up by foreign media. The sudden change was picked up by international media and largely interpreted as a plan to favor Muslims over Christians, a sentiment shared by many in the country. > Suddenly, at the end of last July, Yasu left Adis Abeba for Harrar and came > on to Jibuti on August 8th, where he renewed his protestations of friendship > to M. Simoni, Governor of French Somaliland .... He was found to have > deposed Prince Taffari, son of Ras Makonnen, from the Governorship of Harrar > and substituted a Muhammadan...

The situation, however, was much more complex than what the reports claimed. There is no doubt that Iyasu tried to nurture close relations with the Muslim community and was married Fatima, the daughter of Abubakar, raising questions about his intentions and vision. Abubakar came from a family of rich Muslim Afar traders who made enormous contributions to Menilek commercially, administratively and diplomatically.Aramis Houmed Soul é (2014). Lij Iyasu and the Afar. The Life and Times of Lïj Iyasu of Ethiopia: New Insights. (Éloi Ficquet, Wolbert G. C. Smidt, Eds.). LIT Verlag Münster; p. 168. His father, Mahammad (also Negaddras) was the governor of the historic town of Aliyu Amba (Shoa Province) while he himself served as the governor of Shenno, another commercial center. His grandfather, Abubakar Ibrahim Chehem, was a notable statesman and Sultan or Pasha of Somalia's port city of Zeila (Zeyla) before it became part of the British Somaliland. In contrast, some scholars argue today that the new policies were all part of Iyasu's efforts to consolidate the imperial power such as by integrating marginal territories such as the Afar land. > From the end of the XIXth century, the members of this family lost their > role as obligatory intermediaries in favour of European traders supported by > their respective states.

Furthermore, although Mersha was Christian, he did not adhere to the historically dominant Orthodox faith. Rather he was one of the first to convert to Catholicism and subjected to mistreament like many of his fellow worshippers.Mickaël Bethe-Selassié (2009).

Addis Abeba University Press, p. 28.Bahru Zewde (2005). Pioneers of Change in Ethiopia: The reformist intellectuals of the early twentieth century. Addis Abeba University Press; p. 96 Mersha's absence was a source of great concern to the railway company in part due to his long and dedicated service and reputation. This was obvious from one of the letters that Emperor Menilek wrote to him. The following comment made by Mr. de Mazérieux, the company's administrator, captures that sentiment: > Avec Ato Marcha, qui était au courant des usages et des méthodes de la Cie, > et qui lui était surtout absolumment dévoué, les difficultés etaient > rapidement aplanies. Abou-Baker est trop connu en Abyssinie et à la Cie, > pour qu’on puisse espérer, qu’il en sera de même avec lui. English translation: With Ato Marcha, who was very knowledgeable of the practices and methods of CIE (i.e., Compagnie Imperiale d’Ethiopie), and who was absolutely devoted, difficulties were quickly resolved. Abu-Baker is very well known in Abyssinia and Cie, so we hope that things will be the same with him. Mersha was restored to his position under Empress Zewditu, Menilek's daughter, who ruled Ethiopia from 1916 until 1930. Teferi Mekonnen was regent to the throne during this period and went on to rule Ethiopia as Emperor Haile Selassie I(1930–1974) when the empress died. =A prominent Catholic= Mersha was a well-known Catholic. He played an important role in the spread of the faith in Harar region and beyond. His wife Tedeneqyalesh was the daughter of Ato Mekbeb (also Mekev, Makeb and Makbeb) who was converted to Catholicism in the late 1860s by the Italian missionary Cardinal Guglielmo Massaja or Abba Messias as he was known in Ethiopia. Martial De Salviac, the French missionary who lived in Ethiopia at the end of the 19th century, wrote the following: > The one which Menelik called 'a man of my confidence', that was Ato Makeb, > officer of the royal house. He soon earned the confidence of missionaries by > becoming an edified Catholic. Later he gave his daughter in marriage to one > of the better students of the mission, Ato Marsha, who was a police chief in > Harar, and actually directed the customs at Jaldessa.The Oromo: An Ancient > People in the State of Menelik.Great African Nation. 1901. As Recounted by > Martial De Salviac. Translation from the Original French Edition by Ayalew > Kanno (2005): 74–77. It is not surprising that Mersha's children were brought up Catholics. Benito Sylvain, the Haitian lawyer, author and anti-slavery activist who visited Ethiopia a few times during the late 19th and early 20th century wrote: > En l'absence de Ras Makonnen, retenu par l'Empereur à Addis-Abeba, pour la > conclusion du traité de paix avec l'Italie, était le Ghérazmatch Banti qui > remplissait les délicates fonctions de gouverneur. Il manifesté de cordiale > faҫon sa joie de me voir et après avoir vidé le tedj ou hydromel de > l'amitié, il me fit donner l'hospitalité chez Ato Marcha, chef des douanes > de Guieldessa, dont tous les enfants sont élevés à la Mission catholique > française que dirige actuellement le sympathique Mgr André, récemment promu > Evèque. English translation: In the absence of Ras Mekonnen, kept by the > Emperor in Addis Ababa, for the conclusion of the peace treaty with Italy > was the Gerazmatch Banti who filled the delicate functions of governor.

Mission schools such as those founded by the French missionary Andre Jarosseau (Abba Endryas) trained a generation of young Ethiopians. Recent biographies (e.g. Ras Emru Haile Selassie) shed light on the importance of these schools. In his autobiography, Captain Alemayehu Abebe, one of the pioneers of Ethiopian aviation and the first black African pilot of a commercial jet airliner, wrote: > አቶ መርሻ ከነቤተሰቦቻቸው በሐረር ከተማ የታወቁና የተከበሩ የካቶሊክ ሃይማኖት ተከታይ ስለነበሩ ምንሴኘር አንድሬ ዣሩሶ > በሚያስተዳድሩት የካቶሊክ ሚሲዮን ገብቼ በአዳሪነት እንድማር ተደረገ English translation: Since Ato > Mersha, along with his family, was a well-known and respected follower of > the Catholic faith in the city Harar, I was allowed to attend the mission > school headed by Mgr Andre Jarousseau. Another important biography by Mickael Bethe-Selassié describes in detail the historic contributions of Catholic Ethiopians during the first half of the 20th century. Many, including Mersha Nahusenay and the author's uncle Berhane- Marqos Welde-Tsadiq, played a role in the modernization efforts of Emperors Menilek and Haile Selassié. The biographer argues that these Catholics form a distinct sub-group within the larger community of educated men also known as La Jeune Ethiopie. However, the historic ties between Catholic and Orthodox Christian intellectuals have also been stressed by Mickael as well other scholars. > The Ethiopian Roman Catholic community, the first of whose members were > converted in the late 19th century by Italian or French missionaries, such > as Guglielmo Massaia and André Jarosseau, included Zäwgä Haylu, who attended > the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1900, and Märsha Nahu Sänay, who > represented Menilek at the ceremony marking the completion of the Jibuti > railway as far as the Ethiopian frontier in 1902. The community thus came > into existence at the very same time as the emergence of the Young > Ethiopians as a whole. The Catholic community was moreover influenced by the > same factors - missionary education, travel to France or Italy, employment > by foreigners, service on the railway, etc. -which gave birth, as we have > seen, more generally to Young Ethiopianism. Death and legacy Mersha retired in the mid-1920s, but he maintained contact with friends such as the missionary A. Jarousseau, according to historian Bahru Zewde. His retirement comes after a long public service of important contributions in four key areas: border and railway security, public administration, economic development and diplomacy. Mersha soon fell ill and was confined to bed for almost a decade. He died in his mid-eighties, during the Italian occupation, and was laid to rest in the city of Harar. Mersha Nahusenay during retirement Mersha nurtured a large family. He and his wife Tedeneqyalesh were blessed with eleven children: Beyene, Negest, Zewditu, Alemu, Worqe, Desta, Yosef, Marqos, Negatu, Zegeye, and Medemdemya. He encouraged his children to attend school and appreciate foreign languages. Beyene Mersha, his eldest child, spoke French fluently. Even his daughter (probably Zewditu) knew French. She read a welcome speech to Colonel Jean- Baptiste Marchand (1863–1934), the French officer and explorer who traveled through Harar in 1899, according to the missionary Martial de Salviac. Mersha loved take his family to important public events. Martial describes how Mersha, a proud father, attended the opening ceremony of the Dawale railway station in 1900 surrounded by \\"a beautiful crowd of eight children.\\" The young Beyene Mersha traveled to France and Italy with Andre Jarosseau. In 1903, on behalf of his father, he met in Dire Dawa with R.P. Skinner, the American diplomat sent by Theodore Roosevelt to sign a trade treaty with Menilek. Mersha himself was present, however, when the first ever US diplomatic mission was ready to return home. He was the one who conveyed the farewell message from the Emperor delivered over the phone. Beyene was active in many areas of public service. He was later appointed by Menilek as head of the postal and telephone office established in the frontier town of Dawale.አጤ ምኒልክ በሀገር ውስጥ የተጻጻፏቸው ደብዳቤዎች (2003). ጳውሎስ ኞኞ. አስቴር ነጋ አሳታሚ ድርጅት (ገጽ 506፤ ደብዳቤ ቁጥር 1861).

He went on to become balambaras and even took part in the campaign to remove Iyasu under the leadership of Fitawrari Tekle Hawaryat. In 1931, during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie, he was appointed director of the first Ethiopian School for Girls founded in Addis Abeba by Empress Menen. He also served as head of the Dessie-Asseb road construction project undertaken by a team of Dutch engineers, according to a recently published book by the renowned Blata Merse Hazen Wolde Qirqos.ቀዳማዊ ኃይለ ሥላሴ (1922-1927). በብላታ መርስዔ ኀዘን ወልደ ቂርቆስ. አዲስ አበባ ዩኒቨርሲቲ ፕሬስ. 2009: https://www.mersie-hazen.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Book-Excerpt- compressed.pdf Ato Denqu, husband of Negest, was appointed in 1907 as the first head of Dire Dawa's Post Office.

The most notable descendant today, Ato Abinet Gebremeskel, is a successful businessman and philanthropist in Ethiopia. The author of this short biography (click here for Amharic version of the Bio), is the grandson of Zegeye Mersha and great-grandson of Mersha. Mersha Nahusenay Street (Kezira, Dire Dawa) Mersha's legacy includes a street named after him in Kezira (Gezira), a subsection of Dire Dawa during the reigm of Emperor Haile Selassie. He was remembered and honored when the railway city celebrated its 105th anniversary in December 2007. However, Mersha is still very much a forgotten hero. His biography remains unwritten and his distinguished service is poorly known by many scholars and students of Ethiopian history. In his book titled Pioneers of Change in Ethiopia: The reformist Intellectuals of the early twentieth century, Professor Bahru Zewde describes the contributions of many historic personalities of that dynamic era. The book does not mention Mersha as a pioneer. However, some of the reformist intellectuals discussed had either administered the offices he helped establish or occupied the positions he held before. Neggadras Gebrehiwot Baykedagn (c.1885-1918), arguably the foremost intellectual of the time, for example, was director of the Dire Dawa customs administration. Fitawrari Tekle Hawariat Tekle-Mariam (1884–1977), who later became governor of Jigjiga; credited for founding Asebe Teferi; and is best known for playing a prominent role in the drafting of the 1931 constitution, was chief of the railway station briefly during Lij Iyasu. He was also among the first Ethiopians to travel abroad for education. As a matter of fact, shortly before the young Tekle Hawaryat departed for Russia, in 1896, Mersha gave him his blessings. We find the following interesting account in his autobiography,: > ጄልዴሳ ላይ ስንደርስ አቶ መርሻ ናሁ ሰናይ ከቤታቸው ወስደው ጋበዙኝ። ያስቀሩኛል ብዬ ፈርቼ በቶሎ ወጣሁና ወደ ሰፈሬ > ሮጥኩ። ፀሀይ እንዳይጎዳኝ አስበው አቶ መርሻ ጥላ ገዝተው ሰጡኝ። (ከወንድሜ ከሟቹ ገብረ ጻድቅ ጋር በጣም ይፋቀሩ > ነበር) (p. 78) English translation: When we arrived at Jaldessa, Ato Mersha > invited me for lunch at his residence. Because I was afraid that he might > not let me travel overseas, I ran away as soon as I finished. Ato Mersha, > however, bought me an umbrella so I could protect myself from the scorching > sun. (He and my deceased brother Gebre Tsadiq were dear friends). The last few decades of the 19th century marked the beginning of a long period of modernization in Ethiopian history in the sense that they opened the door to new ways and better conditions of life and work. Significant achievements were recorded during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie in areas such as manufacturing, transportation (e.g. aviation) and education. Trade and foreign direct investment continued to play a key role in the young economy. Despite some serious setbacks in the two decades after the 1974 popular revolution, primarily due to severe droughts and civil war but also bad policies, the country underwent a radical transformation. The revolution has ended the feudal (ባላባት) system paving the way for greater participation of people in political and economic activities. Following the collapse of the military regime, Ethiopia has embarked on a period of unprecedented economic growth, characterized by a strong public sector, expanding private sector and major development of critical infrastructure (e.g. roads, new Djibouti-Addis railway, etc.). Whether this momentum will be maintained or not, time will tell. When all is said and done, however, there is broad consensus that much of the progress made over the last century is deeply rooted in the historic events and reforms of the late 19th - early 20th century.

A biomolecular gradient can exist intracellularly (within a cell) or extracellularly (between groups of cells). The purposes of such gradients in biological systems vary, but include chemotaxis and functions in development. These types of gradients play a role in many different types of signaling as well as recently being implicated in cancer metastasis.  Development  Cells themselves can create biomolecular gradients by releasing signaling molecules that diffuse outwardly. These gradients are critical for cellular identity and cell relocation. Similarly, the gradients produced by cells may influence cellular fate by their temporal and spatial characteristics. In certain organisms, the choice of cell fate can be determined by a gradient, a binary choice, or through a relay of molecules released by a cell. If cell fate is binary, the identity of the cell is influenced by the presence or absence of a signaling molecule; consequently, these signals can also induce cell fate acting in a relay. The relay functions by the source cell releasing a signaling molecule into the environment. Adjacent cells possessing similar cell identities respond to these signals and can release different signaling molecules to cells in their surrounding area, promoting additional new cell fates. This process continues to all cells in the developing organism. In contrast, a signal can act in a gradient, which induces a specific cell fate as a function of the concentration of the molecule in the gradient. These types of molecules are known as morphogens. An example of this phenomenon is observed in the neural tube with varying concentrations of the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) protein. Shh is characterized as a morphogen and possesses spatial and temporal characteristics that make it well suited for study.  Cancer  Depicts migration of cells in response to types of molecules in the gradient. Biomolecular gradients have been shown to facilitate the invasion of cancer cells into different types of tissues in the body. Cancer metastasis is thought to be directly coupled to growth factor gradients that facilitate chemotaxis of cancer promoter factors. These chemoattractants promote tumour angiogenesis, namely increased blood flow to tissues allowing the cancer to thrive in different areas of the body. Therefore, this pathway allows for the movement of tumour-promoting molecules toward healthy tissues in the body. Further study is required to quantify pathways involved in the above response and may provide insight into more effective treatment for cancer patients.  Signaling  In a similar way, biomolecular gradients can function as signal antagonists that have the potential to drastically affect the cell's characteristics and in turn, the organism's response. This includes allowing the cell to distinguish its orientation or shift the barrier of cell differentiation in a group of cells. For instance, such mechanisms can be used to help the body defend against infection. Specifically, the afflicted area of the body acts as an attractant through ligand-receptor binding. This can occur through the polarity that is established by signal antagonists. In addition, this type of ligand-receptor interaction can lead to a signal cascade that trigger mitosis. A type of gradient molecule that accomplishes the aforementioned mechanism is Pom1.

He has found success in Masters athletics competitions. He also holds the currently ratified M95 American records in the long jump and triple jump. Just four days after his 100th birthday, competing in the USATF Masters Indoor Championships, McPhie was the first centenarian athlete to attempt the high jump, though he failed to clear the bar. McPhie's first experience in the sport of track and field dates to his days at Colton Union High School in Colton, California where he taught himself to pole vault with a bamboo pole. In 1935 he set the school record at San Bernardino Valley College that lasted until the inception of fiberglass vaulting poles that radically changed the event in the 1960s. He continued to San Diego State College where he set the school record in the 220 yard dash and long jump in 1936. To this day, the jump is still ranked #9 in school history, a history that includes two Olympic gold medalists in the long jump, Willie Steele and Arnie Robinson. McPhie joined the Army to fight in World War II, returning to San Diego State to complete his degree. From 1940 to 1969 he worked for the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, by 1954 becoming the youngest to attain the rank of captain. During the Vietnam War, he worked for the State Department and picked up the game of tennis. Still decades later he joined a tennis competition at the local Senior Olympics and noticed a track meet going on associated with the event. Since joining in that day, he has won over 200 gold medals and has set numerous American and world records. Widowed in 2000, he survived open heart surgery in 2004 and a couple of forms of cancer.

Biography Amparo, São Paulo — birthplace of Prestes Maia Francisco Prestes Maia was born to Manuel Azevedo Maia and Carolina Prestes on March 19, 1896 in Amparo, São Paulo, a small town 120 km north of the capital city. In 1917, Prestes Maia completed his engineering and architecture degree at the POLI, Polytechnic School of São Paulo (Portuguese: Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo). In 1918, he set up a real estate office and also began working for the São Paulo state government. From 1924 to 1927, Prestes Maia taught architectural drawing courses part-time at his alma mater, POLI. He was promoted to full professor in 1927 and taught for another ten years. In 1937, he left the university in order to be able to continue working for the city. From 1926 to 1930, he served as the city's Secretary of Transportation and Public Works. In 1930, Prestes Maia published his “Study for a Plan of Avenues for the City of São Paulo” (Estudo de um Plano de Avenidas para a Cidade de São Paulo). The Plano de Avenidas was given an award at the Fourth Pan-American Congress of Architects at Rio de Janeiro in July 1930. He met Maria de Lourdes Costa Cabral e Abreu in 1930 in Rio de Janeiro, where she was on tour with an opera troupe from Portugal. The couple where not able to live together until the death of Prestes Maia's mother in 1935, since Maria had been divorced and Carolina Prestes did not approve of their relationship. The two were not able to officially marry until late in his life, given that divorce was still illegal in Brazil and her ex-husband was still alive. They had no children. In 1938 Prestes Maia was named mayor of São Paulo for the first time by Ademar de Barros, the interventor for the state of São Paulo at the time. He would be appointed again by Lucas Nogueira Garcez in 1942, immediately following his first term. After completing his second term, he left office on November 10, 1945 — roughly the same time that the same time that the Estado Novo was ending and democracy was restored to the country. Prestes Maia had two unsuccessful bids for political office following the overthrow of Getúlio Vargas. In 1961, Prestes Maia was finally elected by popular vote and began his third term as mayor of São Paulo in 1961. Francisco Prestes Maia died in São Paulo on 26 April 1965. Map of São Paulo (1924) Prestes Maia and his Plano de Avenidas had a lasting impact on the geography of São Paulo. On August 27, 1997 the city of São Paulo passed a law (Lei nº 12.443) creating the Prestes Maia Urbanism Award (Prêmio Prestes Maia de Urbanismo) to be awarded every four years with the idea of proposing initiatives in urban planning and engineering. The Prestes Maia Award has only been given twice, in 1998 and in 2006. Toponyms =Roadways= Avenida Prestes Maia São Paulo street sign Francisco Prestes Maia has many streets named for him throughout his home state of São Paulo. The largest of these is Avenida Prestes Maia, an arterial expressway in downtown São Paulo that is part of the North-South Corredor (Corredor Norte-Sul). Traffic on Avenida Prestes Maia in central São Paulo Many municipalities in Greater São Paulo — as well as some in the so-called interior of the state — have at least one street named, Avenida Prestes Maia or some derivation thereof, e.g., Avenida Francisco Prestes Maia, Avenida Doutor Francisco Prestes Maia, etc.: Rodovia Prestes Maia (BR-101) Map of BR-101 Brazil's longest highway, BR-101, is also still popularly known as Rodovia Prestes Maia for much of its 4,800 km (3,000 mi), despite having been officially renamed more than a decade ago to honor another politician from São Paulo, Mário Covas. Rodovia Governador Mário Covas, as BR-101 has officially been known since 2001, passes through twelve Brazilian coastal states in three of the country's five geographic regions: ;Northeast :Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, Bahia ;Southeast :Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo ;South :Paraná, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul =Buildings and organizations= In addition to the many public roads named for Francisco Prestes Maia in the state of São Paulo and throughout Brazil, several buildings and cultural institutions also bear his name, either as an honor to him or because they are located on or near a roadway named “Prestes Maia.” Prestes Maia building Demonstration at 911 Prestes Maia Avenue, 2006 One particularly noteworthy building that is commonly referred to as Prestes Maia is a 22-story abandoned factory in downtown São Paulo, located near the Luz train station. The two tower blocks at 911 Avenida Prestes Maia are still registered to the long-defunct former owner, National Cloth Company (Companhia Nacional de Tecidos). In 1994 the building was purchased by a local businessman, Jorge Nacle Hamuche. Since the 2000s there have been successive occupations by poor and/or homeless individuals connected to squatter's rights groups such as the Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Teto (MTST), a local homeless rights group affiliated with the national Landless Workers' Movement, or Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Terra (MST). These occupations have been the subject of international media coverage and documentary filmmakers. Mayor Prestes Maia Library The Mayor Prestes Maia Library (Biblioteca Prefeito Prestes Maia) is a multi-story public library located at 822 João Dias Avenue() in the Santo Amaro district of São Paulo. The building itself was designed by Prestes Maia. Since December 2012, the library's collection of more than 53,000 items has been focused on architecture and urbanism, including fiction and non-fiction books, magazines, atlases, braille and multimedia items. The lower three floors contain reading rooms and the reference and circulation areas. The upper floors are made up of offices, meeting and exhibition space, and the archives of the former mayor. The special collection, Coleção Prestes Maia, of roughly 12,000 items includes rare books about architecture, urbanism, aesthetics, and history, as well as a collection of personal objects, works of art, and Prestes Maia's papers. The majority of the material at the Biblioteca Prefeito Prestes Maia circulates regularly or is otherwise available to the public. The library's collections are indexed in the São Paulo Municipal Library System online catalog. Prestes Maia Gallery Graça by Victor Brecheret at the Galeria Prestes Maia, São Paulo The Prestes Maia Gallery is subterranean cultural space that connects the Praça da Patriarca to the Valé do Anhangabaú in São Paulo's historic center. Completed in 1940, during Prestes Maia's second term as mayor, it was not named for him until some time later. From nearly sixty years the space functioned alternately as an art gallery, municipal offices, and even a homeless shelter. It had badly deteriorated and in late 2000 the administration of the Gallery was taken over by the São Paulo Museum of Art (Museu de Arte de São Paulo — Masp), who planned a major renovation. The renovations of Galeria Prestes Maia continued until 2013. The remodeled space contains various exhibition spaces, as well as two tunnels connecting the Matarazzo Building (São Paulo's city hall) and the old Othon Hotel building (now occupied by the city government).

As there is no facility to work a clutch pedal, hand controls must generally be used in cars with automatic transmissions; One exception is the GuidoSimplex Semi-Automatic Syncro Drive Clutch System along with a over/under ring accelerator and hand controlled brake a car with a manual gearbox can be adapted. With one hand continuously engaged working the hand controls, the steering wheel will generally also be fitted with a steering knob to allow one-handed use. More complex fittings may also connect into the electronic circuitry of the vehicle to place indicator and other switches in easy reach of the driver without requiring them to release the hand controls or steering knob. A guard plate may be fitted to prevent inadvertent contact between the driver's feet and the pedals. Extension levers or adapted grips may also be fitted to the parking brake to allow it to be applied by a driver with limited hand or arm strength. Adaptions may be individually customized and in more extensive adaptions the traditional pedals and steering wheel may be entirely replaced by a joystick control, or by a secondary mini-steering wheel adapted for users with restricted grip and/or arm movement. Steering knobs may also be adapted for users with restricted grip, using a three-pronged tetra-grip, or for users with a prosthetic hook. Ergonomic adaptations, such as repositioned mirrors and adapted seating may also be needed and some larger vehicles may be fitted to allow them to be driven directly from a wheelchair. Wheelchair and mobility device access A wheelchair-adapted taxi with ramp extended in Israel Standard vehicles are not fitted for wheelchair or mobility device access, leaving users of mobility devices with the choice of either transferring out of their mobility device, or purchasing a vehicle adapted for mobility device access via a lift or ramp, commonly referred to as a Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle (WAV). A range of vehicles can be adapted to fit a lift or a ramp, together with appropriate restraints to secure the mobility device, if necessary. Some users of mobility devices will either transfer directly from their mobility device into the vehicle, with use of a lift or they may be able to do a standing transfer. Some may be able to walk the distance between the boot of the vehicle and the doors of the vehicle. Some may actually drive the vehicle from their wheelchair. In any case, their mobility device May still need to placed in or on the vehicle. While some users are able to lift their mobility device into the vehicle manually, stowing it either in the boot, on the front passenger seat, or behind the front seats, others may require the assistance of a hoist to lift it into the vehicle, onto the roof, or onto a trailer behind the vehicle. Financing (United Kingdom) Generally, the more limiting the disability, the more expensive the adaptation needed for the vehicle. Financial assistance is available through some organizations, such as Motability in the United Kingdom, which requires a contribution by the prospective vehicle lessor, Motability also have a grants team who may be able to help with initial deposits and/or adaptation costs. Motability makes vehicles available for lease to disabled users in receipt of the Higher Rate Mobility Component of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) or its successor, Personal Independence Payment (PIP). If a UK-based employee with a disability requires an adapted car for work use, this would potentially be considered grounds for a \\"reasonable adjustment\\" by the employer in accordance with the Equality Act 2010. In this case the responsibility for funding the adaption would either lie with the employer or potentially be covered by the government-operated Access to Work scheme. The Motability scheme is unique to the United Kingdom and is not replicated anywhere else in the world. Disabled people who cannot access assisted purchase schemes must generally pay for their own vehicles to be adapted. This will add considerably to the cost of a vehicle, doubly so as adaptions generally require the purchase of a more expensive automatic model rather than one with a manual transmission, which may restrict choice to more expensive ranges, as may the need for the vehicle to have sufficient space to accommodate a wheelchair in the boot or at the driver's position. In the case of a second hand vehicle the cost of typical adaptions could well exceed the value of the vehicle. Adapting a vehicle may negatively affect the resale value, as adaptions are considered unattractive to non-disabled users, in the case of a low value vehicle sometimes rendering it worthless. Rental A challenge for mobility-impaired drivers is renting a vehicle when they travel. Organizations that specialize in adaptive tourism can assist in finding a vehicle, when possible. In New Zealand, Enable Tourism is an organization that helps drivers with disabilities to locate car rentals offering adapted cars or vans. In France, adapted cars with hand-controls are available from leading car rental businesses, however, it is advisable for drivers with disabilities to reserve a car well in advance of travelling. Several designs of portable push-pull hand-controls are also available which may be quickly connected to a new vehicle by screwing clamps to the pedals, however these may not be suitable for drivers with more extensive requirements.

Breakover angle differs from ground clearance, which is the shortest distance between the ground and lowest point on the vehicle. Relevance MUTCD warning sign for a low- ground-clearance crossing Breakover angle is a relevant performance metric in many common vehicle scenarios, including: * Off-roading. * Loading a vehicle onto a higher surface with a ramp. * Going over raised railroad crossings. * Going over speed bumps * Going over linkspans If a vehicle drives over a breakover angle larger than what it is capable of clearing, the vehicle will contact the apex of the angle, which will quite likely prevent the vehicle from continuing any further in its direction of travel, possibly even completely immobilizing the vehicle. Calculation Assuming no tire deflection, and assuming an ideal breakover angle scenario (two flat surfaces coming to a point, a vehicle with the lowest point of the chassis located at its midsection, etc.), an approximation for the breakover angle of a vehicle can be calculated as follows: \\\\text{breakover angle}_{approximate} = 2 \\\\cdot \\\\arctan\\\\left(\\\\frac{2 \\\\cdot \\\\text{ground clearance}}{\\\\text{wheelbase}}\\\\right) See also * Approach and departure angles * Overhang (automotive) * Vertical railway curves References External links *HowStuffWorks: The Physics of Off-Roading.

Argentine Jewish immigration to Israel has been, and still is, the largest and most significant migratory flow from Latin America. This is because Argentina has one of the largest Jewish communities in the world, the third largest in the Americas after those in the United States and Canada, and seventh worldwide. Because of this, many Jewish Argentines are able to make aliyah and become Israeli citizens through the Law of Return. The Argentine community in Israel is about 50,000 people, although some estimates put the figure at 70,000, making it one of the fastest growing groups in the country. History Since the establishment of the State of Israel there has been an Argentine Jewish migratory flow to Israel although this flow has fluctuated over time. Argentina recognised the State of Israel on February 14, 1949, being one of the first countries to do so.Roth, Cecil (ed.). Encyclopaedia Judaica (1972), Volume 3, p. 426. In addition, Argentina has maintained long and stable relations with Israel. The South American nation was always opened to immigrants, and Jews were no exception to this except for a brief period when Jewish immigration was banned. Despite this, thousand of Jews entered Argentina and made it their home. It was not until the 1976 Argentine coup d'état when a large number of Jews fled the country in search of safety. The number of Argentine Jews emigrating to Israel greatly increased throughout the period of the Dirty War. Many of them settled permanently in Israel while others returned to Argentina after the fall of the junta. Many Jewish Argentines choose Israel as an alternative to settle due to political and economic instability that has rocked Argentina in recent decades. It was during the Argentine crisis of 2001 when Israel saw the largest number of olim from the South American country. The 1992 attack on the Israeli embassy and the 1994 bombing of the Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires also helped create an impetus for Jews to emigrate. There is a significant number of non- Jewish Argentines, having, or being married to somebody who has, at least one Jewish grandparent, who choose Israel as their new home, either permanently or temporarily. In 2012, according to a report by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) entitled \\"Migration Profile of Argentina\\", Israel was ranked among the top destinations chosen by the Argentines to emigrate, ranking 5th place. = Argentine kibbutzim = Several of the early Argentine pioneers in Israel settled in kibbutzim.

Life  Born in Berlin, he was the son of a goldsmith from Zagreb. From 1865 to 1869, he studied at the Prussian Academy of Arts. After graduation, he spent two years as a tutor to the daughters of Count , during which time he travelled to Dresden, Vienna, Venice, Munich, Nuremberg and Merano. In 1877, he had acquired the funds to make a year-long study trip to the Netherlands, Belgium and France, where he came under the influence of impressionism. He became an assistant teacher at the Prussian Academy in 1878 and, in 1881, he taught anatomical drawing at the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin. The following year, he returned to Paris and exhibited at the Salon. From 1885 to 1886, he was in Paris again, with side trips to Northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands. This is considered to be one of his most productive periods. In 1888, he was appointed a Professor at the Prussian Academy and, in 1892, became a full member there. A year later, however, he resigned his teaching position due to disagreements with the Academy's Director, Anton von Werner. The problem stemmed from his participation in the \\"Group of Eleven\\", an association of artists dedicated to promoting their own exhibitions of what was then considered \\"radical\\" art, free of the Academy's influence. This eventually (in 1898) led to the establishment of the Berlin Secession, of which Skarbina was a co-founder. In 1895, he became a Supervisory Board member for the magazine Pan. In 1898, he served as one of the judges in a contest held by Ludwig Stollwerck to select the artists for a new series of trading cards.Hofacker, Prof. Karl. In: Kunstgewerbeblatt. 9. Jahrgang, Leipzig 1898. He died at his home in Berlin, from an acute kidney ailment, and is buried in the Old Cemetery of St. Jacobkirche.

It is banned from sale or cultivation in New Zealand because its pollen is known to cause asthma and eczema in sufferers. Privet can be removed by contacting local government agencies to report its presence. but in Auckland it is only a surveillance pest plant in the 2012 Regional Pest Management Strategy. The NZ Weedbusters site provides guidance on how to get rid of the plant. When privet is invasive species, the cost of controlling and removing privet is economically detrimental, something that is problematic for conservation efforts. The annual cost of removing Chinese privet in the United States is estimated to be $737 per acre when a mulching machine and two-person herbicide application crew are employed.Environmental Assessment: Zebra Project (Timber Scale).

Invasiveness Privet is a successful invasive species because of its ability to outcompete and therefore displace native vegetation. This competitive superiority to native vegetation is connected with the plant's ability to adapt to different light conditions.Lornalkfosko[ris, Jeffrey L. Walck, Hidayati, S.N. (2002). Growth and Reproduction of the Invasive Ligustrum sinense and Native Forestiera ligustrina (Oleaceae): Implications for the Invasion and Persistence of a Nonnative Shrub. International Journal of Plant Sciences. 163: 1001-1010. For example, in low light environments, privet is able to produce fewer and larger ramets than its competitors. These larger ramets make privet more tree-like, making privet better able to compete for light than its more shrub-like native counterparts. Privet is an ideal invasive species because it reproduces both sexually and asexually. Through sexual reproduction, privet produces seeds that are easily dispersed by wind and animals. These seeds can rapidly colonize disturbed soil such as that perturbed by fires, forest clearings, erosion, or abandoned agricultural land. Privet matures quickly, which allows for a short generation cycle and even greater dispersal. The roots of privet can reproduce asexually through root suckers. This vegetative reproduction makes privet difficult and costly to control because root fragments left in the soil can sprout and grow new plants. One reason why privet is so invasive in the United States is because it has few native shrub competitors.Greene, B.T., Blossey, B. (2011). Lost in the weeds: Ligustrum sinense reduces native plant growth and survival. Biological Invasions. 14:139-150 In a sense, privet is invading and exploiting an open niche within the southern U.S. floodplain ecosystem. Prior to privet invasion much of the native land was clear and open; currently, privet forms a dense thicket which chokes out other, usually native, plant life. Thus, privet is believed to be phylogenetically distinct compared to its native cousins. Ecological impact in the U.S. = Introduction = All nine species of privet currently in the southeast U.S. are invasive. The first species of privet was introduced into the United States in the 1700s as an ornamental plant used as a hedge or foliage for gardens. Glossy privet arrived in the U.S. in 1794, Chinese privet in 1825, Japanese privet in 1845, California privet in 1847, and Amur privet in 1860. Privets escaped cultivation in the early 1900s, but became widely naturalized during the 1950s-1970s or later. Currently privet is designated as a foreign invasive plant in Alabama and Georgia and considered a severe threat in North Carolina and Florida. It is estimated that Chinese privet alone occupies over one million hectares of land across 12 states ranging from Virginia to Florida and west to Texas. The full ecological effect of privet is still being studied. However, data suggest that forests containing large amounts of privet tend to have fewer trees, less shrub diversity, and decreased density of herbaceous plants.Zhang, Y., Hanula, J., Horn, S., Braman, S.K., Sun, J. (2011). Biology of ‘'Leptoypha hospita'’ (Hemiptera: Tingidae), a Potential Biological Control Agent of Chinese Privet. Ann. Entomol. Soc. Am. 104: 1327-1333. When introduced to an ecosystem, privet grows quickly and, given time, will produce a thick layer under the forest canopy preventing sunlight from reaching the native plants below. In some cases, this can drive native populations to extinction. If left unchecked, privet may result in large-scale ecosystem modification and an overall loss of native species diversity and richness. The Sierra Chicas of Cordoba have experienced just such a widespread landscape change since 1970. In a study by Greene and Blossey using field observations and a transplant experiment, a significant negative correlation was found between percent Chinese privet cover and herbaceous cover, species richness, and plant height. In a comparison of two experimental gardens, each with four native plant species, the plot with Chinese privet contained almost entirely nonnative plants after 64 weeks. Out of approximately twenty plants per species, only single individuals of Acer negundo, Chamaenerion latifolium and C. tribuloides survived the entire study when in the presence of Chinese privet. Surviving plants had lower leaf counts and stunted height relative to their counterparts in privet-absent plots. None of the Boehmeria cylindrica survived. Insects are greatly affected by the proliferation of invasive species such as privet.Hanula, J. L., Horn, S. (2011). Removing an invasive shrub (Chinese privet) increases native bee diversity and abundance in riparian forests of the southeastern United States. Insect Conservation and Diversity 4: 275-283. For example, one study found the abundance and diversity of butterflies increased following privet removal to almost the same abundance as that of a similar forest community, with no history of privet invasion. In a study conducted in Georgia, privet was found to decreases the diversity of native honeybee colonies. Plots removed of privet resulted in four times as many bee species as control plots in which privet was not removed. Traps placed in undisturbed forest plots with no history of privet caught an average of 210 bees from 34 species, while traps placed in privet-infested plots caught an average of 35 bees from only 9 species. Another example of how privet can have a negative ecological impact in ecological communities is its ability to threaten endangered species.Zhang, Y., Hanula, J., Horn, S., Braman, S.K. and J. Sun. 2011. Biology of Leptoypha hospita (Hemiptera: Tingidae), a Potential Biological Control Agent of Chinese Privet. Ann. Entomol. Soc. Am. 104: 1327-1333. For example, privet threatens the Miccosukee gooseberry, a native plant species that privet is similar to, by encroaching on the gooseberry's habitat and slowly displacing it.Langeland, K. A., Burks, K.C. (1998). Identification and biology of non-native plants in Florida's natural areas. University of Florida, Gainesville. 165 pp. Biological species invasion is considered a main component of global ecosystem change due to changes in biogeochemical cycles and disturbance regimes.Gavier-Pizarro, G.I., T. Kuemmerle, L.E. Hoyos, S.I. Stewart, C.D. Huebner, N.S. Keuler, and Radeloff, V.C. (2012). Monitoring the invasion of an exotic tree (Ligustrum lucidum) from 1983 to 2006 with landsat TM/ETM + satellite data and support vector machines in Córdoba, Argentina. Remote Sensing of Environment 122: 134-145. Invasive species such as privet are known to alter the dominant vegetation type, soil properties, animal behavior, and the natural cycling of resources. For example, Chinese privet increases the decomposition rate of leaf litter by 2.6-fold in riparian forests.Mitchell, J. D., Lockaby, B.G., Brantley, B.F. (2011). Influence of Chinese Privet (Ligustrum sinense) on Decomposition and Nutrient Availability in Riparian Forests. Invasive Plant Science and Management 4:437-447. However, because the usual method employed to study the impact of privet is to compare invaded and non-invaded areas, available data may be inaccurate. This is because these types of comparison studies have trouble controlling for abiotic and biotic habitat conditions that could be negatively affecting native plant growth. =Effect of climate change= Evidence suggests that climate changes, brought about by increased CO2 concentrations, will increase the spread and proliferation of privet.Bradley, B.A., Wilcove, D.S., Oppenheimer, M. (2010). Climate change increases risk of plant invasion in the eastern United States. Biological Invasions 12:1855–187 Climate change is predicted to increase competition between native and invasive plants. Additionally, the increased temperatures that result from climate change are predicted to expand the range of plants typically restricted to the deep south where it is warm and moist. In a projection based on the current and predicted CO2 levels, temperature, and precipitation, it was predicted that by the year 2100 privet will have spread as far north as Maine, sweeping across the mid-western United States into Nebraska. Thus, states that are currently free from privet invasion (Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Virginia, Pennsylvania, etc.) are all predicted to become invaded with privet within the next 100 years unless either privet is contained or conservation efforts decrease the effect of pollution on climate change. Control and removal methods =Methods of control= The same qualities that allow privet to outcompete native species make it extremely difficult to control and eradicate. Privet is manageable with mowing or cutting consistently, as closely to the ground as possible.Chinese Privet. (2013). Center for Aquatic and Invasive Plants. Retrieved 15 March 2013> This will prevent the spread of the privet but will not eradicate it. Even methods such as controlled burning have proven ineffective and actually aid privet growth because privet recovers better than native plants from controlled burns. Mechanical removal of privet, especially for younger plants or smaller areas of growth, can be effective; however, all of the root must be removed to prevent root re-sprouting. Mechanical removal can prove difficult for more large-scale invasions. When such large invasions occur in the natural environment, herbicide use is usually avoided due to the negative impacts on native plants.Ligustrum sinense Lour. Natural Resource Conservation Services. USDA. Retrieved 15 March 2013 Thus, the use of many workers or heavy machinery such as bulldozers is the most effective option. However, the soil disturbance and resulting erosion are important considerations when using such measures. When herbicide use is warranted, several methods have proven effective. In all cases, soil disturbance following herbicide treatment is inadvisable. This is due to privet's preference for disturbed soils and its increased ability to compete in such an environment. The length of time that the soil must be left undisturbed varies with the treatment. Foliar applications of glyphosate, cut-stump applications of glyphosate or triclopyr, and basal bark treatments for stems less than 0.5 inches is effective. The foliar treatments are most effective against dense thickets of privet. The best time for such treatments are in late fall and early spring when many of the native species are dormant. Care must be used with such an application to avoid spraying non-target plants. This treatment is generally considered to be less effective than the cut-stump and basal bark methods. The cut-stump method is most useful when treating single plants. This method consists of thoroughly covering the stump of a recently cut plant with herbicides, such as glyphosate and triclopyr. The effectiveness of this treatment is increased by cutting a hole into the surface of the stump. Use of this treatment when the plant breaks the dormant stage as well as when the ground is frozen is advised against as it greatly reduces effectiveness. The basal bark treatment consists of application of herbicide to all basal parts of the plant below 12-15 inches. The bark must be thoroughly wet with herbicide for this treatment to be most effective. The USDA suggests that 25% triclopyr and 75% horticultural oil is the most effective herbicide composition for basal bark treatments. The first known biological control of privet is the privet lace bug (Leptoypha hospita), which has been deployed in New Zealand. =Agencies working to control privet= The Federal Interagency Committee for the Management of Noxious and Exotic Weeds (FICMNEW) engages with public and private organizations in the effort to combat noxious and exotic weeds, including Chinese and European privet.Federal Interagency Committee for the Management of Noxious and Exotic Weeds Retrieved 15 March 2013 Privet is monitored by the US Forest Service's Invasive Species Program while the National Park Service deploys Exotic Plant Management Teams.National Park Service. Retrieved 15 March 2013 Each team has jurisdiction over ten national parks and works with local volunteers, contractors, and service organizations. These agencies work to eliminate, contain, and/or remove privet because many areas invaded by privet, such as the Piedmont floodplains, are important areas of biodiversity, carbon storage, and resource production.

National Dialogue is a key part of the agreement brokered by the UN and the Gulf Co-operation Council that saw long-time President Ali Abdullah Saleh hand over power to Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi in November 2011 after an uprising. Mr Hadi was subsequently sworn in for a two-year term as president in February 2012 after an election in which he stood unopposed. The UN's special envoy for Yemen, Jamal Benomar, described the conclusion of the National Dialogue Conference as a \\"historic moment\\". \\"After being on the brink of civil war, Yemenis negotiated an agreement for peaceful change, the only such in the region,\\" he said. \\"The National Dialogue established a new social contract and opened a new page in the history of Yemen, breaking from the past and paving the way for democratic governance founded on the rule of law, human rights and equal citizenship,\\" he added. This negotiation resulted in an agreement that did not address the legitimate grievances of Hirak separatists or the Ansar Allah coalition. The unpopularity of the transitional government and the general distrust of Hadi, who had profited from corruption as Saleh’s long time Vice President for nearly three decades, ensured its failure. After winning a show election in which he was the only candidate, Hadi stayed in power following the expiration of his 2 year mandate. This triggered Houthi incursions into Sana’a. Background As part of the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative that saw deposed president Ali Abdullah Saleh step down, a National Dialogue Conference was to be held. As part of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2051, which stipulated the structure of the dialogue, the GCC Agreement was signed on November 23, 2011.  Conference format  The NDC was divided into separate working groups, each with their own members. Groups were: *The Southern Issue Working Group *The Sa'ada Issue Working Group, the National Issues Working Group *The National Reconciliation and Transitional Justice Working Group, the State-Building Working Group *The Good Governance Working Group *The Foundations for Building and the Role of the Armed and Security Forces Working Group *The Independence of Special Entities Working Group *The Rights and Freedoms Working Group *The Development Working Group *The Special Social and Environmental Issues Working Group *The Formation of the Committee to Draft the Constitution Working Group *The Assurance of Successful Implementation and Conference Outcomes Working Group The NDC was headed by a nine-member presidency including President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi (NDC Chairman), Abdul-Kareem Al-Eryani (General People's Congress), Yassen Saeed No'man (Yemeni Socialist Party), Sultan Al-Atwani (Nasserite Unionist Party), Yassin Makkawi (Peaceful Southern Movement), Saleh bin Habra (Houthis), Abdul- Wahab Al-Ansi (Islah Party). Nadia Al-Saqqaf, and Abdullah Lamlas. The conference was overseen by Jamal Benomar, representative to the United Nations.  Outcomes  Map of the proposed Federal Regions of Yemen. The conference concluded on January 24, 2014 with the signing of the NDC Document, outlining the results of the conference. The document agreed to extend Hadi's presidency for another year so that he can carry out certain reforms and continue overseeing the transition process. It also called for the restructuring of parliament and the Shura Council, which will be composed of 50% northerners and 50% southerners. In terms of the Southern Issue, after 30 meetings during the course of the Dialogue, the Southern Issue Working Group was unable come up with a plan for a new political system that would fairly represent the south. In terms of the Sa'ada Issue, the document guaranteed freedom of religion, makes stipulations on the nonsectarian nature of the government, outlaws illegal financial or arms support from foreign powers, calls for a return of stolen government weapons, prohibits the possession of medium to heavy arms, and calls for addressing the feuds that have contributed to the conflict. These outcomes will be enshrined in the forthcoming constitution. The Dialogue members also agreed that Yemen would be transformed into a 6-region federal system. The regions would be Azal, Saba, Janad and Tihama, Aden and Hadramawt. Sana'a will have a special status and not be part of any region. Aden, the former southern capital, would also have a special status. Azal, Saba, Janad and Tahama would be northern provinces where Aden and Hadramawt would be southern. The federal system was rejected by southern leaders including Mohammad Ali Ahmed, a member of the NDC who resigned after expressing frustration with the transitional process.  Reactions  The European Union Foreign Affairs Council released a statement that the NDC \\"has set an example in the region\\" for transitional phases. Abdul Latif al-Zayani, the secretary general of the GCC, stated that the NDC was a positive development and that \\"the GCC States will continue to exert full efforts alongside regional and international parties to ensure the success of the political settlement in Yemen.\\" Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird congratulated Hadi on the completion of the NDC and said in a statement, \\"the people of Yemen have clearly spoken for a more open society that respects freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law.\\" The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that, \\"Turkey believes that the preparation for a new constitution in Yemen that secures the fundamental rights and freedoms and that has accordance with National Dialogue Conference resolutions is essential for a consistent and prosperous Yemen.\\" United States State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf stated that \\"The debates, discussions and compromises throughout the National Dialogue process are evidence of the will of the Yemeni people to work together constructively for the future of their country.\\" Houthi Leader Mohammad al-Bakhti rejected the outcomes document \\"because it divides Yemen into poor and wealthy regions.\\" The final NDC session was also boycotted by Houthi leaders after the assassination of a Houthi representative to the NDC. Mohammad Ali Ahmed, a southern representative to the NDC who resigned in November 2013, stated that, \\"what has been announced about the six regions is a coup against what had been agreed at the (NDC) dialogue.\\" Al-Hirak member Nasser al-Nawba rejected the NDC outcomes and stated that, \\"We will continue our peaceful struggle until we achieve independence.\\" Most southern leaders boycotted the Dialogue from the beginning of the process.

It was brutally suppressed by the joint efforts of the Golden Horde, Muscovy and Suzdal. At the time, Muscovy and Vladimir were involved in a rivalry for dominance, and Vladimir's total defeat effectively ended the quarter-century struggle for power. The Golden Horde later became an enemy of Muscovy, and Russia did not become free of Mongol influence until the Great stand on the Ugra river in 1480, more than a century later. Background In the early 13th century, the Mongol Empire invaded the Kieven Rus' and proceeded to establish a hegemony over the Rus' states. Among the most important of these was the duchy of Vladimir, the most powerful Rus' principality at the time. The extent of Mongol power was so great that the Golden Horde had the power to issue a jarlig, or decree, that allowed the Rus' princes to rule over their lands, only if they swore allegiance to the Mongol Empire. When confidence fell for the rule of the princes of Vladimir, various factions in the principality began to jostle for power, and the region divided itself into several states, including Tver, Moscow, and others. All these states acknowledged the rule of the prince of Vladimir, but the power had become notional at best by the dawn of the fourteenth century. In autumn of 1326, Alexander, the prince of Tver, received a jarlig from the Mongol Öz Beg Khan, authorizing the prince to rule Vladimir. About a year later, Öz Beg's cousin, Chol-khan, arrived in Tver with a large retinue and removed Alexander from the prince's palace in an apparent reversal of the grant.The Tveŕ Uprising of 1327: A Study of the Sources, p. 163 Instead, Chol-khan took residence in Alexander's former home and began a campaign of persecution against the Christians of Tver in which numerous atrocities were committed, including rape, robbery and beatings. A rumor arose among the people of a Mongol plan to kill all the princes of the principality of Vladimir on the day of the feast of the Dormition of the Mother of God, make Chol-khan the new ruler of Tver and force the people to convert to Islam, although the verity of the rumor is disputed.The Tveŕ Uprising of 1327: A Study of the Sources, p. 167 The people of Tver turned to Alexander to address the issue, but he urged them to \\"endure.\\" Events Despite Alexander's advice, a rebellion broke out on August 15, 1327 after Chol-khan's men attempted to confiscate a mare from a local deacon named Dudko; the people gathered to protect Dudko, and subsequently spread out and began to assault Mongol forces throughout the city.The Tveŕ Uprising of 1327: A Study of the Sources, p.163 Chol-khan attempted to entrench himself against the mob inside the palace, but when the building was lit on fire, he perished. Tartars throughout Tver were slaughtered, including the \\"Bessermen,\\" Tartar merchants. Some chronicles and modern historians believe that Alexander instigated the uprising, but this is unlikely considering the consequences that such a violent rebellion would have.The Tveŕ Uprising of 1327: A Study of the Sources, p.167 However, he did not take any measures to suppress the insurrection. The prince of Moscow, Ivan Kalita, a long time rival of the princes of Tver, hastened to take advantage of the uprising in order to assert his supremacy. Ivan allied with the Golden Horde and volunteered to help restore the power of the Mongols over Tver. In return, Öz Beg promised to make Ivan the Grand Duke and reinforced his army with 50,000 Mongol warriors under the command of five Mongol generals.Карамзин Н. М. История государства Российского. Том IV, глава VIII. The prince of Suzdal also joined the Russo- Mongol punitive expedition that came to be known as the \\"Army of Fedorchuk,\\" named after the Tatar commander Fedorchuk. The Poetics of Early Russian Literature, p. 121 In retaliation, the Russo-Mongol army took dozens of captives and burned entire villages to the ground. Alexander fled to Novgorod, who turned him away, and then to Pskov, where he was made the prince, to escape capture by Ivan. Novgorod managed to avoid the wrath of the army for involving themselves with the prince by paying the Mongol horde two thousand silver hryvnias and providing them with many gifts. Meanwhile, Ivan and his allies demanded the extradition of Alexander from Pskov, and Metropolitan Theognostus of Kiev excommunicated the prince and all the people of Pskov from the church. In order to alleviate the threat of invasion from his host city, Alexander fled once again to Lithuania in 1329, where he would remain for over a year. Aftermath The uprising greatly reduced the Tver Principality's power in the northeastern remains of Kievan Rus'. In 1328, Öz Beg granted Ivan Kalita the duchies of Novgorod and Kostroma. Alexander Vasilyevich, the prince of Suzdal, received Vladimir and a region encompassing present day Nizhny Novgorod and Gorodets. By granting the more prestigious Vladimir to the weaker of the two princes, Öz Beg maintained adherence to the principle of \\"divide and rule,\\" reasoning that Moscow's jealousy of Suzdal's lands would prevent them from allying to fight against the Golden Horde. Alexander moved to Sweden after his time in Lithuania, and then back to Pskov after the city's excommunication was lifted, under the patronage of Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania. In 1335, he gained forgiveness from Öz Beg and was allowed to return to his former position in Tver, however by then, the state had lost most of its influence, being replaced by the Grand Duchy of Muscovy. This return did not last long, as both Alexander and his son Fyodor were taken to Sarai and quartered in 1339. Following the execution of Alexander Vasilievich in 1331, Ivan received the duchy of Vladimir and became the sole ruler of northeastern Russia. Favor from the khan of the Golden Horde allowed Moscow to gain power rapidly at the expense of Tver, with Tver eventually losing all influence to Moscow. However, a new rivalry was formed between the princes of Suzdal-Nizhny Novgorod. The relative power of Moscow and their strong alliance with the Horde led to a period of relative peace in Russia that was not interrupted until the reign of Dmitry Donskoy, the first prince of Moscow to openly challenge the Horde. He would later defeat them at the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380.\\"Battle of Kulikovo\\", Encyclopædia Britannica References Category:14th-century conflicts Category:Wars involving the Golden Horde Category:Conflicts in 1327 Category:1327 in Europe Category:1327 in the Mongol Empire ","title":"Tver Uprising of 1327"},{"id":"42213588","text":"The World's First Collaborative Sentence is a work of internet art by Douglas Davis begun in 1994.

It is located to the south of Menston and north of Baildon. Etymology The name of Hawksworth is first attested in a charter of 1030 in the phrase on Hafeces-weorðe, and then in the Domesday Book of 1086 in the form Hauochesuurde and variants thereof. The Old English word hafoces meant 'hawk's', but the word is thought in this place-name to have been a personal name; worð, meanwhile, means 'enclosure'. Thus the name once meant 'enclosure belonging to Hafoc'.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Names Society, 2017), pp. 52-53. History Hawksworth was historically a township in the large ancient parish of Otley in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It became a separate civil parish in 1866. In 1937 the civil parish was abolished and merged into the new Aireborough Urban District.Vision of Britain website In 1974 Aireborough was itself abolished and absorbed into the City of Leeds Metropolitan District in the new county of West Yorkshire. It currently falls within the Guiseley and Rawdon Ward of the Leeds City Council. Hawksworth Hall, a Grade II* listed building, is a large house, probably built in the 16th century. Hawksworth Church of England Primary School has around 100 pupils.Hawksworth C of E School website Hawksworth is the model for the fictional village of \\"Windyridge\\" in the best-selling 1912 novel of that name by Willie Riley.

Career After leaving school, Henley joined the London company of funeral directors James H. Kenyon Ltd in 1941. Established in 1880, J. H. Kenyon Ltd were the undertakers to the Royal Household, and had in that role assisted in arranging the funerals of many members of the Royal Family. After training in all theoretical and practical aspects of embalming, Henley passed his professional examinations in 1948. Four years later he was appointed the company's chief embalmer. In 1961, Henley became an examiner of the British Institute of Embalmers. He also taught embalming techniques, embalming fluid formulas as well as disaster management to funeral directors.E.g. to Graham Cook of Albin International In an interview published in 1998, Henley expressed doubts that the mummification of Lenin's body in Moscow was indeed as permanent as claimed by the Russian authorities. Notable cases In his role as chief embalmer for J. H. Kenyon Ltd, Henley carried out the embalming of King George VI at Sandringham House in 1952, that of Queen Mary at Marlborough House in 1953, and that of Sir Winston Churchill at the latter's London home at 28 Hyde Park Gate in 1965. Churchill's body was embalmed in the same room where he had died. When the process was completed, the remains were dressed in his silk pyjamas and dressing robe and placed back into his bed. Churchill would lie in repose in private at his Hyde Park Gate home until 9:00 pm Tuesday evening when Kenyon's staff transported his remains to Westminster Hall for public viewing.Todd Van Beck, \\"The Death and State Funeral of Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill\\", part II, in Canadian Funeral News (October 2012), Vol. 40 Issue 10, p. 10 (online ) Four years later, Henley embalmed the remains of Mutesa II of Buganda; and when Idi Amin had Mutesa II's body returned from London to Uganda in 1971, Henley was requested to accompany it. In 1973, Aristotle Onassis had Henley flown to Athens in his private jet to embalm the body of his son, Alexander. Henley also oversaw the embalming of Judy Garland in 1969, Jimi Hendrix in 1970, Field Marshal Lord Montgomery in 1976, Admiral of the Fleet Lord Mountbatten of Burma in 1979, Bon Scott in 1980, and Billy Fury in 1983. In the time between 1963 and 1976, Henley also worked extensively in Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Benin and Malawi, and continued to advise royal families worldwide until his retirement from J. H. Kenyon Ltd in 1992, after 51 years of service. In retirement he lived in London and Portsmouth. His funeral was held on 23 November 2005 at St. Wilfrid's Church, Portsmouth, followed by cremation at Portchester Crematorium. Disaster management After training in disaster management, Henley also served as head of J. H. Kenyon Ltd's emergency services mortuary team. In this role he was involved in the recovery and repatriation of bodies after numerous disasters, including the Kano air disaster in Nigeria in 1973, the Zeebrugge ferry disaster in 1987 and the Lockerbie bombing in 1988. It was for this work at major disasters around the world that Henley was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire \\"for services in the aftermath of disasters involving the loss of human life\\" in the 1997 New Year Honours.

Its southern terminus is at US 90, and it travels westward to Interstate 10 (I-10). The route travels through the Stennis Space Center and to I-59 and US 11 south of Picayune. The road was part of US 11 and US 90, before MS 43 was designated in 1948. MS 607 was created in 1967, after MS 43 was rerouted, and Stennis Space Center was built. Route description All of the route is located in Hancock and Pearl River counties. MS 607 starts at a T-intersection with US 90, and travels westward. The route goes through a forest as a divided highway. Nearly later, MS 607 intersects MS 604 as it turns northwest. After passing by two electrical substations, it crosses a road that leads to the Mississippi welcome center and INFINITY Science Center, a NASA visitor center. The route then intersects I-10 at a diamond interchange, and state maintenance ends just north of it. United States government maintenance begins, and the road soon turns north. About later, MS 607 travels through an access gate and enters Stennis Space Center. Past the access gate, the road crosses over a canal and intersects road that leads to an old alignment of MS 43. MS 607 later shifts northwest until it meets H Road. It then travels north through thick forests for more than , until it reaches Gravel Pit Road, where it begins traveling northwest. South of Turtleskin Creek, MS 607 reaches to an access gate. State maintenance begins at the intersection of Texas Flat Road and the old alignment of US 11. The route continues traveling northwest through the forest, entering Pearl River County and intersecting Asa McQueen Road. Small houses soon appear, and the route meets US 11 and I-59 at a diamond interchange. The road continues on into Picayune as US 11. In 2013, Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) calculated as many as 11,000 vehicles traveling west of MS 604, and as few as 3,400 vehicles traveling south of Texas Flat Road. All of the road is maintained by MDOT and the United States Government. MS 607 is not included as a part of the National Highway System (NHS), a network of highways identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. MS 607 is part of two scenic routes and memorial designations. Hospitality Highway, which is designated from I-10 to US 90. NASA Scenic Byway to Space, starting at the intersection of MS 607 and MS 604 to the south gate of the center, then from the north gate to Texas Flat Road. History The road that became part of MS 607 was part of US 90 and US 11 since 1928, and all of it became paved by 1934. In 1936, a new road was built from US 90 to south of Slidell, and US 90 was soon rerouted to it. The road between US 11 and US 90 became MS 11-90. By 1939, US 90 was moved to another new road, bypassing the old one. The MS 11-90 designation was temporarily removed in 1942, and was restored the next year. In 1948, MS 11-90's designation was removed, and the road became part of MS 43. Between 1958 and 1960, I-59 and I-10 were proposed. Meanwhile, the United States Army Corps of Engineers began buying land in Hancock County for the Mississippi Test Operations in 1962, which later became Stennis Space Center. In 1967, MS 43's alignment was moved east of NASA's test site, and the old alignment became MS 607. Only north and south of the test area were state maintained. Also in the same year, MS 607's interchange with I-10 was completed. In 1971, MS 607 south of the Stennis Space Center became a divided highway.

After he became involved in drama and music there, however, he changed his career plans. His first appearance on radio was in 1929 as a singer on WBAP in Fort Worth, Texas. He soon became an announcer and from that point on, he made his career in broadcasting. Sharbutt's obituary in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel noted that he spent \\"four decades as an announcer, newscaster and company spokesman.\\" A 1943 article in Radio Mirror magazine summarized Sharbutt's progress from local station WBAP to his then-current role at CBS: > [At WBAP] Del was a one-man radio station, singing, acting and announcing at > $25 per week.

In 1958, Sharbutt was involved in an effort to revive a semblance of old-time radio on ABC. The Jim Backus Show was described in the Milwaukee Sentinel as \\"what might be called an old-fashioned radio variety show.\\" Sharbutt was the announcer for the program, which featured singers Betty Ann Grove and Jack Haskell and a quintet, The Honey Dreamers. Also in 1958, Sharbutt became a disc jockey on WABC in New York City. He and another old-time radio announcer, Tony Marvin, began \\"hosting afternoon record shows in their distinctively deep voices.\\"Jaker, Bill; Sulek, Frank and Kanze, Peter. (1998). The Airwaves of New York: Illustrated Histories of 156 AM Stations in the Metropolitan Area, 1921-1996. McFarland & Company, Inc. . P. 29. Other on-air activities in radio for Sharbutt included being a newscaster for the Mutual Broadcasting System and being master of ceremonies for a Ringabuk, a local program in New York City. Sharbutt was an announcer for television programs including Who Do You Trust?, The Jerry Colonna Show, Your Hit Parade The Betty White Show (1954 version), All Star Revue and Kukla, Fran and Ollie. He also appeared as himself on the TV shows Of All Things, The Jerry Fielding Show, and The Saturday Night Revue with Jack Carter. Also, in something of a reprise of one of his regular jobs, Sharbutt played an announcer in the movie Hit Parade of 1947. After doing commercials for Campbell's Soup on several shows that he announced, Sharbutt became more closely associated with Campbell's as a company spokesman. His obituary in the Los Angeles Times noted, \\"He voiced the commercials, touting the soups as 'Mmm-mm-good,'\\" a slogan that he created. Music Sharbutt's obituary in the Los Angeles Times noted, \\"A musician as well, Sharbutt played sax, clarinet, piano and organ, and was a songwriter. Among his credits are the theme for the television comedy series The Bob Cummings Show and the early 1950s ditty 'A Romantic Guy, I.'\\". He also wrote \\"The Kitten with the Big Green Eyes,\\" \\"I'd Love To,\\" \\"Silver and Gold,\\", \\"The Nickel Serenade\\" , \\"I Can't Hold a Dream in My Arms\\" and \\"My Love\\" \\"Silver and Gold,\\" which Sharbutt wrote with Bob Crosby and Henry Prichard, was part of the sound track of the 2013 movie \\"20 Feet from Stardom.\\" Alcohol recovery efforts During the last 26 years of his life, after he retired, Sharbutt became \\"known for his untiring work in alcohol recovery programs.\\" An Associated Press story in 1977 mentioned him as one of 24 prominent people who \\"came out of the closet\\" in an attempt to encourage other alcoholics to seek help. In a 1978 interview with his journalist son, Jay, Sharbutt said that his family physician diagnosed him as an alcoholic in 1955. Sharbutt recalled, \\"I said, 'That's an awful thing to say to a friend.' He said, 'That's a diagnosis, not a put-down. It is a killer disease.'\\" In the interview, Sharbutt said that before the diagnosis, \\"My drinking was getting out of control. I nearly drank myself to death trying to have fun. I knew it was not the real me. I was now drinking just to stay even, to function, survive, not to get high or have fun. But I still did it after work. I did hundreds of shows with hangovers.\\" After his doctor intervened, Sharbutt was helped by some of the doctor's patients who were recovered alcoholics. Sharbutt said, \\"It was my association with these recovered alcoholics that enabled me to stop drinking nearly 24 years ago. My greatest joy since has been trying to help other practicing alcoholics do what I've done.\\" Much of Sharbutt's work in that regard was focused around Palm Desert, California, where he and his wife moved after he retired. Rank wrote, \\"Del and Dr. Joe Cruse ... started an educational program on alcoholism at Eisenhower Medical Center called 'The Alcohol Awareness Hour.' It featured locally and nationally known recovering alcoholics who gave talks and answered questions on the disease.\\" Sharbutt produced a program, \\"Jazz Without Booze,\\" that featured recovering jazz musicians, singers and others. The show was produced for 17 years and always sold out the first day tickets were available. Proceeds went to the Volunteer program of the Eisenhower Medical Center. Sharbutt and his wife (known professionally as Meri Bell), played integral roles in encouraging former First Lady Betty Ford to establish the Betty Ford Center. Bell was Ford's sponsor in Alcoholics Anonymous. Ford's obituary in USA Today related developments after she received hospital treatment for recovering alcoholics: > Ford was encouraged to help other drug and alcohol addicts as part of her > therapy, but Bell's husband, the late Del Sharbutt, Eisenhower [Medical > Center] board President John Sinn and Chairwoman Dolores Hope sought to > integrally involve the Fords in their medical center. \\"After she got out of > treatment,\\" Sharbutt told The Desert Sun in the 1990s, \\"Dolores [Hope] > called her and said, 'You're the new kid on the block. Do you see anything > around here that we're not doing that we ought to be doing?' Betty spoke > right up and said, 'Yes, you don't have a program for alcoholism or chemical > dependency.'\\" Family Sharbutt was married to Mary C. Balsley, who sang professionally as Meri Bell. They had two sons, Jay Sharbutt and Bill Sharbutt, and a daughter, M.D. Ridge. References  External links  * Two streaming recordings of newscasts by Del Sharbutt are among the files on this page.

Education  Alfonso Dávila Ortiz was born in Bogotá, Colombia to José Domingo Dávila Pumarejo and Paulina Ortiz on 4 April 1922. On 22 April 1944 he married Gladys Silva Chéreau, daughter of Colombian General Miguel Silva Plazas and Bertha Chéreau. They had eight children, six of whom survive. He died peacefully surrounded by his family on 10 November 2015 in Bogotá. Following the sale in 1926 to the Municipality of Bogotá of the Compañía Nacional de Electricidad that he had founded (which merged with another private firm to create the nationalised Empresas Unidas de Energia), his father took his family to Europe (Brussels, Paris and Eastbourne) for five years. Dávila Ortiz was subsequently educated in the traditional Gimnasio Moderno of Bogotá, and graduated at 16. He completed a degree in Civil Engineering at Bogotá’s Universidad Nacional 5 years later. While running a successful construction businesses he subsequently completed a postgraduate degree in Economics at Bogotá’s Universidad de los Andes (1963), an MSc in Marketing in Spain (1982) and a postgraduate degree in Business Management at INALDE in Bogotá (1986). On 21 April 1961 the Universidad Distrital in Bogotá awarded him an Honorary Doctorate in Forestry.  Business career  Dávila Ortiz started his professional career in housing construction in Bogotá, subsequently moving into construction of public infrastructure in the 1950s and early 1960s, mainly in Colombia’s Atlantic Coast. As CEO of private construction firms he had co-founded, he oversaw the completion of the Ciénaga-Barranquilla and Santa Marta-Riochacha highways, the Ernesto Cortissoz Airport in Barranquilla, the Simón Bolívar Airport in Santa Marta and the Atlántico Railway (Santa Rosa-El Paso section). Such interventions were seen as important propellers of development of Colombia's Caribbean region, as the physical isolation of the region from the centre of the country had historically been a major source of concern to national and local decision-makers and business entrepreneurs. In the 1940s he was one of a number of young Colombian professionals who were gradually taking over the design and construction of major buildings and infrastructure by local firms following the departure of mainly US companies, and given further impulse following the recommendations of a number of reports, such as the World Bank's 'Currie Mission' of 1950.

He has been called America's first \\"Public enemy Number One.\\" Early life Samuel Green was born in Meredith, New Hampshire in 1796. At an early age, his parents believed him to be possessed by a demon because of his frequent school skipping and would whip him. As a teenager, he became a blacksmith's apprentice where he was whipped for stealing. He was whipped for destroying the blacksmith's garden but did not admit it. He was then sent home and whipped again. In retaliation, Green threw the family dog down a well, contaminating the water, and caused great expense to the family. He was beaten severely for this. He retaliated by slashing the neck of the family pig and was again whipped. The family gave up and sent Samuel to live with family friend Albert Dunne in New Hampton, New Hampshire. Green attended school for a while but began skipping again. He then stole a Jew's harp from a shop and Dunne beat him as punishment. Green fled home and his parents, having heard of the theft beat him unconscious. Green was sent to Dunne and then whipped until flesh was flayed off his back. For the last beating, Green set up a trap to kill Dunne. He put an axe, that would fall on his head, and a pitchfork, that would strike him, in the barn door. When Dunne entered the barn, the axe sliced his coat and the pitchfork gave him a slight foot injury. Dunne then tied Green against a barn door, severely whipping and bloodying him for the attempted murder. Afterwards, Green destroyed a hogshead of cider, stole bushels of corn, and tried to burn down Dunne's barn. As usual, he was whipped and beat by Dunne. After a few months, Green became too strong for Dunne, who let him be. Later, Green met another youth named William Ash. Criminal career Green and Ash went to New Hampton where they met a traveling salesman named Franklin Loomis. He became their mentor, teaching them how to forge bank notes and burglarize homes of the rich, businesses, and banks. One day they came by a schoolhouse and Green hurled a large piece of timber underneath a sleigh full of children, putting them in danger. The schoolmaster caught the two and severely beat them. Later that night, they lay in wait for the schoolmaster to come and knocked him unconsciousness with rocks, stripped him, tied him up and hoped he would freeze. However, he was found and survived. Green and Ash traveled through Guilford and Burlington, Vermont, where Green joined the army. He deserted but was captured and flogged. Later, Green escaped to New Hampshire and reunited with his family. He had become wealthy by this time because of his counterfeiting. Green bought his mother a cow and spent the rest of his money on fancy clothes, a horse, jewelry and meals. Green ran out of money and left for Boston, where he became a servant for wealthy men. During the day, he was a loyal servant but at night Green robbed the homes of valuables and fled. Around this time, Green went back to Loomis, who had taught him how to pick locks more efficiently and make duplicate keys. Green and Ash had robbed hundreds of homes and offices. In Bath, New Hampshire, the two met a jewelry salesman who let them inspect his goods. They ambushed him when he rode past. He was knocked from a mule and clubbed to death to eliminate a witness. Green then went around New England, killing and robbing. He was imprisoned on suspicion several times but released as there was insufficient evidence. Ash also helped him escape jail numerous times. After robbing a store of jewels in Montreal he was pursued by a posse, shooting and killing several of the men. He was later captured and sentenced to hang in a short trial. Ash helped him escape and Green hid in the mountains in New Hampshire. Green then began burglarizing homes and stores in New York City and Albany. Later, he killed a wealthy French traveler in Middlebury, Vermont. Green would go on to rape, steal horses, burglarize, counterfeit and murder from Montpelier, Vermont, to Schenectady, New York; and from Saco, Maine, to Barre, Vermont. He became \\"public enemy number one\\". High bounties were placed on him. Final capture and aftermath Green was arrested for robbing a store in Danvers, Massachusetts while drunk. He was convicted of burglary, sentenced to four years in prison and sent to prison in Boston. Green tried to escape several times and had to wear special shackles and clogs to slow him. He had more years added to his sentence. Green later found out that a black prisoner, Billy Williams, had told officials of and thwarted his previous escape. Once Green was out of solitary confinement, he poisoned Williams' food; however, Williams did not eat it. On November 8, 1821, Green attacked Williams and fractured his skull with an iron rod. While still unconscious, Williams was continuously struck with the iron rod and had his ribs, arms, and legs broken by Green. Williams succumbed to his injuries the next week. Green was convicted of murder and given an execution date of April 25, 1822. At the gallows, Green informed the priest he had nothing to say to the many spectators in attendance. \\"They shall not know my fate,\\" he said. \\"I have written out my confession in full.\\" The priest replied \\"Are you penitent, my son?\\" With the rope placed, Green gave the priest a long stare and a thin smile curled upward as he replied \\"If you wish it.\\"  See also  * List of serial killers in the United States References Further reading A Selection of Leading Cases in Criminal Law: With Notes, Volume 2 United States Criminal History, Being a True Account of the Most Horrid Murders, Piracies, High-way Robberies, &c.;,/ Together with the Lives, Trials, Confessions and Executions of the Criminals.

The village is located on the Arabat Spit and is geographically part of Crimea, however it falls the administration of Kherson Oblast. Moreover, the village also housed a gas transit center strategically important for the peninsula. Russian troops occupied parts of the village, this was the first time Russian troops moved into the Kherson Oblast. In December 2014 the Ukrainian Border Guards Service stated Russian troops began a withdrawal from Kherson ending the 9 month standoff, however although Russian troops left all other positions in Kherson they continued to occupy the gas distribution station located outside the city. Strilkove represents one of the few parts of Crimea that is under direct Ukrainian control. Geography The village lies on the northern portion of Crimean peninsula's Arabat Spit, though neither Strilkove nor the neighboring village of Shchaslyvtseve are claimed as part of the Crimean Autonomous Republic. It is located 8 kilometres to the north of the border of the Crimean Republic, between the Azov Sea to the east, and Lake Sivash in the west; and is 32 km south from the town of Henichesk.

During the Crimean crisis, on 15 March 2014 at about 13:30, some Russian Airborne Troops (40 riflemen) advanced on the village.\\"Russian Military Enter township Strilkove, Kherson Region\\": article on the Ukrainian News Article on the Ukrayinska Pravda Article on Der Spiegel =Crimea crisis and War in Donbass= The village is located on the Arabat Spit and is geographically a part of Crimea, however administratively it is in the Kherson Oblast. Russian paratroopers landed in the village during the 2014 Crimea Crisis, marking the first time Russian forces advanced into mainland Ukraine as prior to this Russian troops operated only in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. The soldiers stated that they missed their landing zone and landed in the village by accident and proceeded to retreat to the gas distribution terminal located near the village. Ukraine for the first time during the conflict placed its air forces on alert and air lifted its own unit of paratroopers to the area. Russian forces retreated from the center of the village but maintained the occupation of the gas distribution center, Russian forces stated that the gas distribution center may be a vulnerable to a terrorist attack and needed to be secured. As of October 2014 Ukrainian border guards and a volunteer territorial defense battalion are stationed in the village. Russian forces maintain a company of 150 troops which are also supported by a gunboat. The area has not experienced any fighting since the Russian takeover of the off shore gas platforms near the village. However, border guards are instructed to not allow people whose Russian passport have been issued in Crimea to pass, as well as inspect vehicles for possible Russian contraband. The small force deployed to the village is also designated to slow a possible advance of Russian troops into Kherson, while the large contingent of Ukrainian forces is stationed at Novooleksiivka and Henichesk, about 20 miles north along the Arabat Spit. On 9 December 2014 Ukraine's border guards reported that Russian troops began withdrawing from southern Kherson Oblast, ending the 9-month-long occupation.

SR 271 (1930–1931) SR 271 was a state route that existed from 1930 until 1931 and was located entirely in Williams County. When it was created, it ran along previously unnumbered roads from the village of Montpelier to Bridgewater Township at US 20. After its two years in existence, the entire route became a part of US 20S. Today, the entire route is a section of SR 576. SR 271 (1932–1962) SR 271 was a state highway through east-central Ohio. When it was first designated in 1932, it ran from Coshocton to North Salem taking over a part of SR 95. In 1935, the route was vastly expanded west to include all of the former SR 309 from Tunnel Hill to Coshocton, unnumbered roads from New Guilford to Tunnel Hill, and part of SR 206 from Martinsburg to New Guilford. The route experienced one more extension, this time at its eastern terminus to act as a spur to the community of Birmingham. No major changes would occur to SR 271 until 1962 when the route was renumbered to SR 541 due to the new Interstate highway, I-271. SR 272 SR 272 was a state highway located north of downtown Canton. The entire route followed Canton's 30th Street and connected SR 8 and US 62/SR 43. The route was in existence from 1930 until 1961, though for its last year as a state route, SR 272 was marked on the official Ohio highway map. After 1961, US 62 was brought onto a new freeway alignment just south of 30th Street. SR 272 was deleted from the system as a result. SR 275 (1930–1962) SR 275 was a state route stretching from Rosewood to just west of Marysville. The first section of SR 275 that was designated was its segment from West Liberty to Marysville at SR 32 (later US 33); it was signed in 1930. In 1937, the route was extended west to SR 29 near Rosewood. After 1962, the SR 275 designation was replaced by SR 245 due to the signing of I-275 near Cincinnati. SR 277 (1930–1962) SR 277 was the predecessor to SR 207 and ran from north of Chillicothe at SR 104 to Mount Sterling. The route when it was created in 1930 originally had its northern terminus at US 22 in Atlanta. The route was extended to its long-time northern terminus in 1935. No major changes would occur to the route until the route was renumbered to SR 207 in 1962 due to the construction of I-277 in Akron. SR 280 (1930–1962) SR 280 was a state highway that existed from 1930 until 1962 and traveled between Amesville and Trimble. The route remained along this alignment for its entire 32-year history. In 1962, due to the building of I-280 in the Toledo area, all of SR 280 became part of an extension of SR 329 which previously ended at US 50 Alt. in nearby Bern Township. SR 283 (1931) SR 283 was a short-lived designation for a state route near Holland. This designation had replaced SR 223 which had to be renumbered due to the addition of US 223 in the state. Within one year, the route number was changed again, this time to SR 326. SR 288 (1931–1940) SR 288 was the predecessor to SR 640 in Lake County. The route was designated in 1931 on the Willowick–Willoughby route it followed for its entire history. In 1940 for unknown reasons, the route number was changed to SR 640. SR 289 (1931–1937) SR 289 was a short state route entirely in New Haven Township. The route existed from 1931 until 1937 and acted as a connector from SR 61 to the former SR 194. After 1937, the entire route became the northernmost of SR 598 following its extension to Huron County. SR 290 (1932–1962) SR 290 was the state route that became SR 296 in 1962. The route throughout most of its history consisted of a routing starting north of Urbana and traveling east to the community of Middletown within Wayne Township, Champaign County. According to the 1932 official Ohio state highway map, SR 290 traveled along the former SR 275 between West Liberty and Middletown even though prior and successive maps show this segment as SR 275. By 1933, SR 290 was routed from US 68 near Kings Creek to SR 275 in Middletown. In 1937, the route was extended slightly west to end at SR 29 (originally SR 54). After 1962 when Ohio routes that shared numbers with proposed Interstate highways were renumbered, SR 290 became SR 296 because of the proposed Interstate 290 in Cleveland (which later was built as I-490). SR 291 (1932–1945) SR 291 was a alternate state route to SR 69 in Liberty Township, Hardin County. While SR 69 shared a concurrency with US 30S east before turning north, SR 291 continued north from the western SR 69/US 30S intersection before making a 90-degree turn to the east. The route was in existence from 1932 until 1945. SR 296 (1932–1936) SR 296 was a state route that connected SR 4 on the Seneca–Huron County line to the village of Bellevue. The route, which was about long, followed the county line for its entire length. The route was created in 1932 and was replaced in 1936 by an extended SR 269. SR 297 (1932–1938) SR 297 was a short spur route that connected the village of Wayne to US 6 near Bradner. The route, which had been asphalt-paved for its entire history, was created in 1932 and existed until 1938 when it was absorbed into a lengthened SR 281, the number the road still carries today. SR 298 SR 298 was a state road that connected SR 4 north of Chatfield to Willard at US 224 and SR 194. The route when it was created in 1932 only consisted of the segment from its western terminus at SR 4 to the village of New Washington. In 1938, the route was extended east and north through Gardner and Celeryville to end at US 224 and SR 194 near Willard. The route would follow this alignment until after 1967 when all of SR 298 and SR 194 was replaced by SR 103 which had been extended from its former end in Chatfield. SR 299 SR 299 was a state route that traveled from Milan to Huron. The route's southern terminus was at US 250 and SR 13 just north of Milan and its northern terminus was at US 6 and SR 2 in downtown Huron. The route maintained this routing throughout its history. Prior to 1966, SR 13 followed US 250 into Sandusky but in 1966, SR 13 was rerouted to follow the entire length of SR 299 thus deleting this number from the system. SR 309 (1932–1934) SR 309 was a state route that ran from the community of Tunnel Hill to the now-defunct village of Roscoe. During its two years of existence from 1932 until 1934, the route was entirely a gravel road. After 1934, SR 309 became one of many state routes and local roads that became a part of a greatly extended SR 271 that stretched from Martinsburg to North Salem. Today, all of the former SR 309 is a part of SR 541. SR 311 SR 311 was a short spur state route from the village of Brookville to the community of Arlington (within Clay Township) at US 40. This alignment of the route would be its route throughout its entire history from 1932 until 1964. As I-70 was built through the area in the early 1960s, the state route was removed from the system though it did feature an interchange with the new Interstate. Today, the portion of the former state route outside of the village limits is a part of Montgomery County Road 6. SR 318 SR 318 was a state route through northeastern Shelby County and eastern Auglaize County. Created in 1932, the route's southern terminus was at SR 274 in Jackson Center. The route traveled north to SR 32 (modern-day US 33). SR 318 formed a concurrency with SR 32 west to Saint Johns before SR 318 turned north and ended in Uniopolis at SR 67. No changes would occur to the routing until 1936 when the entire route was replaced by SR 65 which had been extended south from Lima. SR 326 (1932–1933) SR 326 was the final designation for a state route near Holland. The route had been renumbered from SR 283 in 1932 but after 1934, the route was removed from the state highway system altogether. SR 326 (1935–1967) SR 326 was a short state route in and around Marietta, Washington County. The route became a state road in 1935 but was unlabeled on Ohio state highway maps until 1946. The route began in downtown Marietta as Washington Street before heading into the hills north of the downtown as Cisler Drive and ending at SR 375. The route would be in existence along this routing until after 1967 when it was reverted to local control. SR 333 (1932–1937) SR 333 was a state route running from Dillonvale to Smithfield in Jefferson County. The route existed from 1932 until 1937. After 1937, the road became a part of SR 152, the route that exists on the route today. SR 333 (1946–1962) SR 333 was a state route in the vicinity of Sylvania. The route started in the Central Avenue Park neighborhood of Sylvania Township at US 20 and SR 120 and traveled north on North Holland Sylvania Road. SR 333 curved to the northwest as it entered the city limits of Sylvania. In downtown Sylvania, the route ended at the intersection of Main and Monroe Streets. US 223 traveled east and north of this point. The route was created in 1946 when SR 120 was rerouted from this road onto a more southerly alignment. SR 333 would be deleted by 1964 having been replaced by new freeways, US 23 as the predominantly north-south bypass of the route and I-475 serving as another alternate route. ;Major intersections SR 334 (1932–1937) SR 334 was a state route in Carroll and Jefferson Counties in eastern Ohio. From 1932 until 1934, the route was a spur from SR 43 in Amsterdam to Bergholz. In 1935, the route was extended west to Perrysville at SR 332. For its final year in existence, 1937, SR 334 was extended west further to Leesville at SR 212 through the segment from Amsterdam to Bergholz was replaced by SR 164 at this time. By 1938, all of SR 334 became a part of SR 164. SR 336 SR 336 was a state route in northwestern Ohio and existed from 1932 until 1945. At the time of its creation, the entire length of SR 336 was a former section of US 127. In that year, US 127 was moved onto an alignment closer to the Maumee River (including a concurrency with US 24) leaving SR 336 on the former segment. The route started at US 127 east of Cecil and traveled east before sharply turning to the north at the community of Emmet. SR 336 ended at the intersection which was also the eastern end of the US 127 / US 24 concurrency. After 1945, the entire route was deleted from the state highway system. SR 337 SR 337 was a short state route along the Ohio River in southeastern Meigs County. The spur route ran from the community of Antiquity to Racine at SR 124. SR 337 was created in 1932 but was fully absorbed into SR 338 by 1937. SR 338 SR 338 was a state highway along the banks of the Ohio River in southeastern Meigs County. In 1932, the route was created as a spur from Letart Falls to SR 124 near Rolandus. By 1937, the route extended from Racine to SR 124 south of Portland. The route would follow this alignment for over sixty years until a truncation in 2003 left it at a length of from the Ravenswood Bridge to SR 124 south of Portland. The route was deleted between 2008 and 2012 and today, most of the route was abandoned due to landslides into the river. SR 341 SR 341 was a short state route near Beach City. The highway was a connector from SR 212 east of Beach City to US 21. The route existed from 1933 until 1941 and was not replaced by another state route. SR 346 SR 346 was a state route in eastern Ohio that became a part of the Appalachian Highway in the 1970s. When it was created in 1935, SR 346 ran from SR 160 in Radcliff to SR 143 in Mount Blanco. The route would be on this alignment for 35 years until 1970 when the Appalachian Highway was opened through southern Ohio. The route was extended to a length of running from SR 124 south of Wellston to US 50 southwest of Albany. After 1983, the entire Appalachian Highway was assigned SR 32 therefore the SR 346 was deleted from this section of the divided highway. SR 351 SR 351 was a bypass of Marietta in Washington County. The route existed from 1935 until 1969. The route started in the eastern Marietta suburb of Norwood at US 50 Alternate and SR 7 (Pike Street) and headed north on Acme Street. At its intersection with SR 26 (Greene Street), SR 351 had a two-block concurrency west along SR 26 before turning right onto Colegate Drive. The route curved around the northeastern limits of Marietta intersecting SR 375 along the way. SR 351 ended at an intersection with SR 60 (Muskingum Drive) at the Muskingum River. SR 352 SR 352 was a state route in southern Stark County and northern Tuscarawas County. The route started at US 250 west of Beach City, traveled through Beach City, and ended in Bolivar near Fort Laurens.

Both known species are extremely unusual in that the horns are of unequal sizes: the left horn core is several times smaller than the right horn core. The closest living relative of Tsaidamotherium is probably the Muskox, Ovibos moschatus. Etymology The generic name refers to the Qaidam Basin, the region where the holotype of the type species, T. hedini was found. The specific name \\"hedini\\" honors Dr Sven Hedin. The specific name \\"brevirostrum\\" refers to the short muzzle of T. brevirostrum's holotype skull. Species So far, there are two known species, T. hedini, and the recently described T. brevirostrum. The scrappy remains of the first species, T. hedini, were discovered by Dr Hedin at the Qaidam Basin during the Sino-Swedish Scientific Expedition to Northwest China during the 1930s. Partial remains of two individuals were discovered in the Liushu Formation within the Linxia Basin in Hezheng County, Gansu, in 2004, and were described as T. brevirostrum in 2013. Paleobiology The skulls of both species had large nasal cavities, suggesting the living animals had broad, vaulted muzzles like those of the takin or Saiga antelope. The right horn core of T. hedini is tall and conical, suggesting the right horn would have resembled a Phrygian cap. In T. brevirostrum, the right horn corn is much shorter and flatter, suggesting the right horn would have appeared squashed or flattened in comparison. Paleoecology During the late Miocene, the remains of the fossil horse Hipparion suggests that the Linxia and Qaidam basins were hot and semi-arid savanna environments. However, the anatomy of Tsaidamotherium (the vaulted muzzle, in particular), though, suggests that the living animals lived in comparatively cold environments. It is probable that the living animals had adapted to living in mountainous areas that had formed during a phase of tectonic uplift in Northwestern China at the beginning of the Late Miocene.

His parents, Ramon Bonaplata and Teresa Corriol, were textile manufacturers, principally of chintz, and he had three brothers, Salvador, Ramon and Narcís. Youth and trip to England Josep Bonaplata worked at the family manufactory until his father retired and the business was inherited by his older brother, Salvador.Jordi Nadal: p. 6-8 In 1828 Josep and his friend Joan Vilaregut then started a cotton textile factory in Sallent, with mechanical looms that were hydro-powered by the Llobregat river.Enciclopèdia Catalana In 1829, in an attempt to modernise his business, he was given permission by the Spanish government to import an English steam engine.The news was greeted with strong opposition from the Catalan trade organisation, Junta de Comerç, as it was feared that the project was a cover- up for importing cheaper English textiles. The businessmen would later change their minds after inspecting the new factory site in Barcelona in March 1833. Jordi Nadal: p. 6-8 Bonaplata travelled to Britain with Joan Rull and a man named Camps to learn about the textile industry in Lancashire and to buy the necessary machinery from the Boulton & Watt manufactory in Birmingham. In London, he received authorisation to import a steam engine from the Spanish ambassador Francisco Cea Bermúdez. Bonaplata and Rull returned to Catalonia in July 1830, but Camps stayed in Manchester to continue learning about the machinery, in particular Richard Roberts' self-acting spinning mule, which Bonaplata planned to produce under licence. Industrial entrepreneur On September 30, 1831 Bonaplata formed the firm Bonaplata, Rull, Vilaregut i Cia with his three brothers, his friend Joan Vilaregut, and his new partner Joan Rull. The company was capitalized with 1.600.000 reales. The Bonaplata Factory (also known as El Vapor) was in Carrer Tallers in Barcelona's Raval neighborhood, and it had two activities: in 1832 an iron foundry was installed with a workshop for making mechanical looms, and in November 1833 the mechanical weaving and spinning manufactory opened. This was the first factory in Spain to use a steam engine to power machinery. Its value and social impact was immediately recognised, as it employed roughly 700 people, and it inspired the modernisation of the economy.In 1834 the French geographer Moreau de Jonnès praised the factory in the Spanish part of his \\"Statistique de l'Agriculture de France\\", which compared European economies. This was translated into Spanish by the lawyer and future politician Pascual Madoz in his \\"Estadística de España\\" in 1835, who added the comment that El Vapor brought about a \\"full revolution\\". In 1846 Madoz highlighted again the importance of the Bonaplata Factory as the dawn of the new industrial age. In 1867 Ildefons Cerdà, the Barcelona urban planner who reshaped the city, talking about his youth, remembered \\"El Vapor\\" as the turning point between two ages. Jordi Nadal: p. 7 and 15 However, the factory was assaulted and burned on the night of August 4 and August 5, 1835 by luddite gangs known as BullanguesYears later Valentí Esparó used the same place to build up a workshop that would become the basis of a famous factory, La Maquinista. Enciclopèdia Catalana The losses from the disaster were put at 2.696.625 reales. Bonaplata sued the Spanish government for failing to stop the riot. Initially, the government tried to elude responsibility, but then asked the Cortes Generales (parliament) for permission to pay a compensation. On April 1, 1837, Josep Bonaplata appeared before the Cortes and agreed to rebuild a new and bigger steam-powered factory to begin the modernisation of Spanish industry, but the treasury committee decided that he must give up any compensation claims if he wanted state investment for his new venture.Jordi Nadal: p. 9-11 By this time, Bonaplata was living in a modest room in Madrid where he formed Bonaplata, Sandford y Cía to restart the project. The business was established in the former convent of Santa Barbara, in the Hortaleza neighbourhood. He was now forty-two, and still single. The business included his second iron foundry and an engineer named William Sanford. Bonaplata was probably suffering a breathing disorder, which could explain why his younger brothers Ramon and Narcís joined him here. In 1839 the company name was changed to Bonaplata y Hermanos (Bonaplata and Brothers), and Sanford remained as a technician. Ramon took over the Madrid business, which was capitalised with 200.000 reales, while Narcís opened a new blast furnace in Seville capitalised with 90.000 reales. Major decisions for both businesses were still taken by Josep. Two years later Narcís took full control of the Andalusian factory, leaving Bonaplata y Hermanos in Madrid capitalised with 403.063 reales. Although Josep Bonaplata owned the bigger part of the Santa Barbara concern, the legal documents acknowledged his brother Ramon as its lone administrator, probably because of Josep's poor health, though he retained the right to act on whatever he thought necessary. The rural business A few months after the destruction of El Vapor, in December 1835, Josep Bonaplata had paid 187.000 reales for the Espinar estate in the Valencian village of Llíria. Here he built an olive oil mill, and planted many almond trees. He also invested 1.190.000 reales in a project that would link the Cinca and Segre to irrigate the Llitera area. The plan was promoted by his friend Antoni Gassó, but it came to nothing. Illness and death The severe respiratory disorders that Bonaplata had been suffering affected his work. Fearing a last attack, he made his will in May 1840. Three years later he decided to retire at the Espinar farmhouse in Llíria. On May 30, 1843, Bonaplata handed his will to his executor and started the trip, but his lungs collapsed in a last asthma attack on June 2 while he was passing the nearby village of Bunyol. He was 48. He died without progeny so the brothers were his successors. It is known that he had had an illegitimate daughter named Sofia, but she died at birth in 1840. It is likely that Josep and the mother of his child, Jesusa Romero, became a couple.

First elected in 2012, Goldman successfully sought a third two-year term in the general election held on November 8, 2016. Goldman secured a fourth term in 2018. With 35,083 votes (53.2 percent), he defeated another Democrat, Beth Llewellyn McLaughlin, who collected 29,549 ballots (44.8 percent). Another 1,283 votes (1.9 percent) went to the Libertarian choice, Rod Wingo. Background Goldman's family has lived in Fort Worth for five generations. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Texas at Austin where he was a member of the ZBT fraternity and Silver Spurs. After college, he was for five years a member of the staff of Republican then U.S. Senator Phil Gramm and later was employed by U.S. Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas' 5th congressional district. A lifelong Republican, he has worked to elect members of his party to office in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and nationwide as well through Straight Talk America, a political action committee founded by U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona, of which Goldman was once the executive director. He also worked in the McCain presidential campaign in 2008. Goldman is a partner in two real estate investment companies in Fort Worth. For ten years, Goldman was vice president of a family-owned business, Ronnie's Fine Wines and Specialty Foods on Hulen Street in Fort Worth, named for his father, Ronald J. Goldman. Goldman is a former board member of Cowtown Executives Association, the Tarrant County College Foundation and the Women's Center of Tarrant County. In 2001, he graduated from the civic training school \\"Leadership Fort Worth\\". Goldman is Jewish;. His wife is Auryn B. Goldman. Political life Craig first ran for the state House in a special election held in November 2007 to fill the seat vacated by the resignation on August 15 of that year of Republican Representative Anna Mowery. He received 2,947 votes (16.7 percent), a fourth-place finish, and was hence eliminated from contention in the runoff election on December 18. In that contest, Democrat Dan Barrett defeated Republican Mark M. Shelton, a pediatrician from Fort Worth, 52-48 percent. After less than a year in office, Barrett was unseated as representative by Mark Shelton in the general election on November 4, 2008. After two terms as representative, Shelton did not seek re-nomination in 2012; instead he ran a strong but unsuccessful race for the District 10 seat in the Texas State Senate, held by Wendy R. Davis, the 2014 Democratic gubernatorial nominee against Republican Greg Abbott. Shelton tried again to seek the District 10 Senate seat that Davis vacated in her unsuccessful gubernatorial bid. In the May 27, 2014 runoff election, Shelton was defeated by the conservative activist Konni Burton of Colleyville, a favorite of the Tea Party movement. Goldman entered the 2012 Republican primary; with 6,333 votes (54.7 percent), he defeated two opponents, Susan Todd, with 4,143 votes (35.8 percent), and Chris Hatch, who finished third with 1,105 (9.5 percent). Goldman then defeated Democrat Gary Allen Grassia of Fort Worth, in the general election on November 6, 2012, receiving 38,139 (59.4 percent) to 24,159 (37.6 percent). Another 1,873 votes (2.9 percent) went to the Libertarian Party nominee, Rodney Lynn \\"Rod\\" Wingo of Fort Worth. For the 86th Texas Legislative Session that convened in 2019, Goldman serves on the House committees of Elections and Licensing & Administrative Procedures. In October 2016, Goldman wrote a letter to voters critical of his Democratic opponent, Elizabeth Tarrant's, atheism stating, \\"I am asking for your support this November to send me back to Austin and continue to represent you and your values. My Democrat opponent is a self- proclaimed atheist. This is who the Democrat party is backing as their nominee, and I am certain my opponent does not have does the values you want to represent you in Austin.\\"Hemant Mehta, \\"Texas House Candidate: Don’t Vote for My Opponent Because She’s a Self-Proclaimed Atheist” =Legislative positions= A pro-life legislator, Goldman supported the ban on abortion after twenty weeks of gestation; the measure passed the House, 96-49. He co- sponsored companion legislation to enhance the medical and licensing requirements of abortion providers. These issues brought forth an unsuccessful filibuster in the state Senate by Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wendy R. Davis of Fort Worth. The Texas Right to Life Committee rated Goldman 78 percent favorable. Goldman opposed the bill to establish a taxpayer-funded breakfast program for public schools; the measure passed the House, 73-58.

He co-sponsored legislation to allow college and university officials to carry concealed weapons in the name of campus security. He voted to reduce the time required to obtain a concealed-carry permit. He backed the redistricting bills for the state House and Senate and the United States House of Representatives. Goldman voted against term limits for certain state officials. =Interest group ratings= In 2013, Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum, managed in Texas by Cathie Adams, a former state chairman of the Texas Republican Party, rated Goldman 98 percent favorable, one of the highest rankings from the organization.

He was the younger brother of The Four Tops' lead Levi Stubbs.  Biography  Joe Stubbs was born six years after his brother Levi. The two grew up together in Detroit, Michigan. As a teenager, Stubbs joined the R&B; group The Falcons in 1957 and led them on several of their early hits, among them the million-seller, \\"You're So Fine\\" (1959), and \\"The Teacher\\" (1960). He was then replaced by Wilson Pickett, who took over as lead in 1960.http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Falcons.html Stubbs also recorded a solo single for the Lu Pine label entitled \\"Keep On Loving Me\\", released in 1964.http://www.45cat.com/record/l120 He joined Motown R&B; group The Contours in the mid-1960s. Several original members had left in 1964, along with lead singer Billy Gordon, who had departed the following year. A renewed version of the group, with Joe Stubbs as lead singer, began recording. He provided lead vocals on their hit \\"Just A Little Misunderstanding\\", which was co-written by Stevie Wonder. The song was a Top 20 R&B; Hit in 1966, peaking at #18, and also made the UK Top 40, reaching #31, when it was re-released in 1970. It is the only Contours single to feature Stubbs on lead, as he left the group shortly after recording it.http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Contours.html Singer Dennis Edwards replaced him; Edwards recorded with the group until 1967, when he was drafted as replacement lead singer of The Temptations, taking over from David Ruffin. Stubbs then briefly recorded as a member of fellow Motown group The Originals. The group had come together in 1966, and their first single release, a cover of Lead Belly's \\"Goodnight, Irene\\", features Stubbs on lead. Initial Originals singles did not chart, and much of their early time around Motown was spent providing backing vocals for other artists like Stevie Wonder and David Ruffin. They would eventually find success under the guidance of Marvin Gaye, who co-wrote and produced their first big hit, \\"Baby, I'm For Real\\" in 1969, although Joe Stubbs had departed from the group shortly after their first single back in 1966.http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/Originals.html At Motown, Stubbs also recorded at least one song as a solo artist; his \\"The Girl I've Chosen To Be My Bride\\" was included on volume four of the A Cellarful Of Motown! series.https://www.allmusic.com/album/a-cellarful-of- motown%21-vol-4-mw0002035095 A second recording, \\"It’s Love Baby (24 Hours Of The Day)\\", appeared on the 1967 edition of the Motown Unreleased series. He then went on to record as part of the group 100 Proof (Aged In Soul) under the Hot Wax/Invictus record label. The label was set up by songwriting-production team Holland-Dozier-Holland who had left Motown in 1968 over a dispute with Motown head Berry Gordy about profit-sharing and royalties. The trio put together 100 Proof (Aged In Soul) as a funk/soul act for their new label. The group released several hit singles between their formation in 1969 and break- up in 1973. Joe Stubbs was made co-lead singer along with Steve Mancha. The group found their biggest success with \\"Somebody's Been Sleeping\\", which reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was later certified gold. A notable Stubbs-led 100 Proof song is the acclaimed deep soul classic, a cover of Luther Ingram's \\"Ain't That Loving You (For More Reasons Than One)\\", which also features a spoken word introduction by Stubbs. Following the group's disbandment in 1973, Stubbs remained retired from recording throughout the 1970s and 1980s. He composed one of the tracks on The Four Tops' 1982 album One More Mountain; Joe Stubbs is credited as co-composer of \\"Nobody's Gonna Love You Like I Do\\" (along with brother Levi Stubbs and Four Tops member Lawrence Payton). He did however sign with Ian Levine's Motown revival label, Motorcity Records, in 1989, and there recorded enough material for two album releases, Round And Round (1991) and Pressure Point (1992). Two singles were also released, \\"Destination Unknown\\" in 1989, and \\"You're My Eternity\\" in 1991.https://www.discogs.com/artist/707468-Joe-Stubbs In addition, a rerecorded version of The Four Tops' hit \\"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch)\\" was released as a single in 1989, credited to \\"The Motorcity All-Stars\\", a group put together from as many former Motown singers as producer Ian Levine could assemble. Joe called over his brother Levi, and they both feature on the recording, along with singers Marv Johnson, Sammy Ward, Cal Gill of The Velvelettes and C.P. Spencer of The Originals. At Motorcity, Stubbs rerecorded many songs that originally feature his brother Levi on lead (for The Four Tops), and some of his hit Falcons and Contours songs (\\"You're So Fine\\" and \\"Just A Little Misunderstanding\\"), as well as some original Motorcity-written material. Personal life Joe Stubbs was the cousin of R&B;/soul singer Jackie Wilson. Stubbs had a wife, Louise, and together the two had a daughter, April. Stubbs was married to Louise at the time of his death.https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/alt.obituaries/Hs0QhyjOkKI Death Joe Stubbs died on February 5, 1998.

Life The Verninac family originated in Gourdon, Lot in the former province of Quercy. Jean de Verninac was a counsellor of the king in Villefranche in 1696. Another family member was vicar-general of Rodez in 1786. Raymond de Verninac Saint-Maur was his nephew. Raymond de Verninac was one of the three commissioners who were delegated to settle the annexation of Avignon in 1791. He was Minister to Sweden from 1792 until 1793, when Louis XVI was executed and relations were broken off. Raymond Verninac arrived at Constantinople on 12 April 1795 with the title of Envoy of the French Republic. After a month of negotiations, he was accepted on 18 May 1795. He continued until 1797 as French representative to the Porte of the Ottoman Sultan Selim III. Verninac was not successful in improving relations between the Porte and France, since the Turks were not sympathetic to the recent French Revolution. He did send a commissioner to investigate the state of Egypt, who reported in September 1796 that the Ottoman Empire was in an extreme state of decay and that Egypt could be taken with little effort. On 9 April 1797 Verninac had a long interview with the general Napoleon Bonaparte, who appears to have accepted this view. The idea took hold in Napoleon's mind, and on 16 August 1797 he wrote to the Directory revealing his plan to attack Egypt. In 1798 Raymond de Verninac married Henriette Delacroix, older sister of the future painter Eugène Delacroix. She was the daughter of Charles- François Delacroix (or Lacroix), minister of Foreign Affairs under the Directory. During the Consulate (1799–1804) Verninac was Prefect of the Rhône department. The Verninacs moved to Lyon. From 1802–05 Raymond de Verninac was French representative to Switzerland, after which he retired from the diplomatic service. Charles Étienne Raymond Victor de Verninac was born in Paris on 19 November 1803, the couple's only child. Raymond de Verninac died on 23 April 1822. His wife was left destitute. His nephew and namesake was the future Admiral Raymond-Jean-Baptiste de Verninac Saint-Maur.

She is believed to have written the longest epic poem ever written by a woman. The piece, Messiah's Kingdom, took over nine years to complete. Biography =Early life= Agnes Collinson was born on 31 August 1775 in London, England. Her parents were Edward and Elizabeth Collinson. Bulmer had two other sisters and she was the youngest. The family lived on Lombard Street in London. Bulmer's parents were Methodists, and were friends with John Wesley. Bulmer was baptized by Wesley and she was admitted to his school, in December 1789. She attended the City Road Chapel, and remained a member of the society until her death. She was also a devout patron of the Church of England. The family was defined as middle class, and Bulmer's education provided her access to literature, which she enjoyed very much. By the age of twelve she had read Edward Young's Night-Thoughts. It was a major influence on her own style. By age fourteen she had published her first work, On the Death of Charles Wesley. Wesley sent her a personal note, thanking her for the piece, he also advised her to \\"Beware of pride; beware of flattery; suffer none to commend you to your face; remember, one good temper is of more value, in the sight of God, than a thousand good verses. All you want is to have the mind that was in Christ, and to walk as Christ walked.\\" In school, she befriended Elizabeth Richie Mortimer and Sarah Wesley, the latter being the wife of Charles Wesley. She studied under Hester Ann Rogers in school, and would eventually write an elegy upon Rogers death. =Mid-life= She married Joseph Bulmer in 1793. He was a London-based warehouse worker and merchant, also involved in the Methodist church. He was financially successful and popular within the church, and other non-church related local communities. The couple socialized frequently, spending time with the likes of Adam Clarke, Joseph Benson, Jabez Bunting, and Richard Watson. Clarke was fond of Bulmer, and stated that she \\"astonished\\" him with her intellect and skill. She was described as being a \\"match for men,\\" in Wesleyan Methodist Magazine regarding her intelligence and interests. However, she was often described as being equal yet \\"feminine\\" in her qualities by writers, showing that while men believed her to be equal, she was still \\"domestic\\" and \\"delicate,\\" according to William Bunting, and other writers. =Later life= Bulmer taught at City Road Chapel, until 1822, and wrote. She was involved in social activities, including the Ladies Working Society, and also did visits at hospitals and with the poor. During this period she worked on Bible stories for children, which were published as Scripture Histories. Joseph Bulmer died on 23 July 1822 from an illness. Bulmer's mother died also. She entered into a deep period of mourning, and wrote a lot of poetry related to death. She died on 20 August 1836. She became sick during a trip to the Isle of Wight, and died. William Bunting presided over the funeral. She is buried in City Road Chapel. Work Her earliest published work was On the Death of Charles Wesley, in 1788. Bulmer wrote an elegy for Hester Ann Rogers, after Rogers died in 1793. The piece was published in 1794. She wrote Messiah's Kingdom, an epic poem. The latter was published in a series of twelve books, in 1833. Messiahs' Kingdom is considered the longest poem ever written by a woman. The piece took nine years to complete, with over 14,000 lines. Her children's biblical stories, Scripture Histories, were regularly published in Methodist publications. She wrote her first biography in 1835, about her friend Elizabeth Mortimer, The Memoirs of Elizabeth Mortimer. Further reading *Collinson, Anne Ross. Memoir of Mrs. Agnes Bulmer.

The Assiniboine River Bridge is a railway bridge situated 8 km east of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, Canada. The bridge is located at Mile 50.4 in Canadian National Railway's Rivers Subdivision. The original bridge was a single track, 125 m (412 ft) long and consists of two 35.6 m (177 ft) through truss spans placed between two 25.2 m (83 ft) through plate girder spans. The spans were built in 1906 and were designed to Government of Canada 1901 Specification (equivalent to E-48 Cooper loading). A slow order was required to operate heavy axle load cars over this structure. The railroad determined that to improve operations, the aging spans had to be replaced. It was found to be not much more expensive to replace the entire span than simply replacing the floor system of the bridge. The concrete piers and abutments were found to be in good condition and could be reused. The railway decided to replace all four spans of this older bridge. To this end, a new double-track bridge was proposed. After the required engineering and environmental regulatory permits and approvals were secured, Canam Structural of Quebec City, Quebec was selected for the fabrication of the steel spans. This was carried out from the fall of 2000 to the spring of 2001. The newly built spans were through plate girder spans of the same length as the old spans. These were designed for Cooper E90 loading with diesel impact. The floor system of the bridge consisted of rolled sections installed transverse to the main girders, with a steel deck plate installed on top of the floor beams. The budget for the new bridge project was established at $5.6 Million Canadian. The new bridge was safely completed with no major problems. The work was done within the time available and within budget. The old structure was dismantled and hauled away by truck. The disturbed ground surface was restored to its original profile and was seeded with appropriate vegetation in the spring of 2002. The bridge itself was completed in January 2002.

History In the 1850s officials from the Texas prison system had accidentally buried prisoners on the wrong plot of land. The owners of that plot donated the land to the state so it could be used as a burial ground. The cemetery's current name derives from Joe Byrd, an assistant warden at the Huntsville Unit who, in the 1960s, helped restore and clean the cemetery. Byrd was also the state executioner, overseeing electrocutions at Huntsville and throwing the switch on dozens of inmates personally. As of 2011, each burial has the presence of either the Huntsville Unit warden or a deputy of the Huntsville Unit warden. Prisoners serve as pallbearers, chisel names in headstones, and dig graves using shovels and backhoes. In 2011, 160 prisoners were buried in the cemetery. As of 2012 TDCJ officials confirmed that the cemetery includes remains of 2,100 prisoners.

He photographed all of the graves and concluded that there are over 3,000 graves at the cemetery. As part of his research he found that at least 30 to 40 of the prisoners were veterans of wars. As of 2012 much of the remaining land at the cemetery is prone to flooding. In 2012 James Jones, the warden of the Huntsville Unit, stated that the state needs to find a new burial ground within two years. Geography It is located on of land on a hill, from the Huntsville Unit and in proximity to Sam Houston State University. Robyn Ross of the Texas Observer stated that a person could, in fewer than 10 minutes, cross the cemetery by foot. Ross described the cemetery grounds as having been \\"neatly maintained\\". During the 1980s and 1990s the headstones that were manufactured were concrete crosses. These crosses only have prison ID numbers and dates of death. There are other headstones which also include the names of the prisoners and the dates of birth. Headstones of death row prisoners have prison numbers with the beginning “999”, a state designation for a death row inmate, or they have the letters \\"EX\\" or \\"X\\". Because of soil shifts, some graves have collapsed. As of 2014, over half of the graves in the prison are from after 1979. Wilson stated that this is because of an increase in imprisonment in the 1980s and 1990s.

Retrieved on January 15, 2012. The State of Texas covers the costs of funerals at Joe Byrd. Usually the funerals at the cemetery are held on Thursdays. In order to allow families of executed prisoners to make a single trip to Huntsville instead of two separate trips, the burial of an executed prisoner not claimed by the family is usually done the day after his or her execution. Chaplain David Collier Sr., a chaplain in Huntsville, stated in 2014 that the most common reason why the families do not pick up the bodies is because they are unable to afford doing a burial themselves, so they often schedule a funeral in Huntsville and allow the state to bury the body. On many occasions, the prisoner's relatives do not attend the funeral. The TDCJ refers to a burial with no family members present as a \\"direct\\". Collier stated that some family members in other parts of Texas cannot afford to travel to Huntsville, and sometimes the state cannot locate family members. Prisoners working as the cemetery grounds crew stand witness in burials without family members or friends of the deceased. In the cases of a prisoner who died in the Huntsville Unit, the prisoners at the funeral may know him, but if the prisoner died elsewhere, the prisoners at the funeral will often not know the prisoner. Wilson stated that about 2% of the people buried at the Byrd Cemetery had been executed, but the public believes that all executed prisoners are buried there because the Huntsville Unit, the site of execution in Texas, is in close proximity. Most executed prisoners are claimed by their families.

Lankester (born 1963) is a memoirist whose 2014 book, Dangerous Odds, told the story of her life, from growing up privileged in the suburbs of New York City and post-grad years in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, to working in the heart of the largest illegal sports betting operation in US history, including arrests in Los Angeles and Dominican Republic), to living a comfortable life in Switzerland. The book won three awards. * * In January 2015 discussions began for a movie based on the book starring Margot Robbie as Lankester.  Early Bookmaking Years  Marisa Lankester was born in Rome, and raised in Westchester County, NY by an English father who worked at the United Nations and German mother, and attended the all-girls Catholic independent Ursuline School. She attended Marymount Manhattan College before moving to Vancouver, BC, and later to Los Angeles, CA In June 1987, Lankester was arrested on charges of bookmaking, along with six other employees, after Los Angeles sheriffs, aided by information by two FBI informants, raided the office where she worked as a clerk for Ron (the Cigar) Sacco, operator of a sophisticated horse racing and sports betting operation that processed \\"at least $40 million\\" in bets in 1986 and considered the biggest bookmaker in American history. Lankester married Sacco's right-hand man, Tony Ballestrasse, in 1987 and gave birth to a daughter before locating with Sacco's operation to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic where gambling was legal; although a top model on the Island, she was jailed twice and endured repeated rapes after the FBI and local police raided Sacco’s headquarters in January 1992 (at the time the operation was taking in $100 million/month in bets and considered the \\"nerve center of American sports betting.\\") Dominican police corruption included hiding Lankester from the FBI against her will. As an insider, Lankester was also aware of the role off-shore (shell companies) played in Sacco's operation.  Later years  Retiring permanently from bookmaking in 1994, she moved back to New York in 1996 to attend college in Manhattan. She remarried and moved to Switzerland where she had her second daughter (later divorced). She currently resides in Zürich, Switzerland with her family. Lankester was interviewed by the NY Daily News and active in debates surrounding US gambling laws (refer \\"Works\\" below) including input on the recent ban reversal in pro-sports.

Background  In the 1990s, Cummins was the world's biggest high-speed diesel-engine producer in the category of 200 horsepower and over. Meanwhile, Wärtsilä NSD, then Wärtsilä Diesel, was focussed on medium-speed engines. Cummins wanted to extend its selection in the upper range and Wärtsilä Diesel in its lower range.  Establishment  Cummins and Wärtsilä Diesel agreed about setting up a joint venture to produce engines which would cover the gap in the engine ranges between both companies. The companies signed a letter of intent for the foundation of Cummins-Wärtsilä in December 1994. The ownership was shared 50% / 50% between Cummins and Wärtsilä Diesel. Both the Cummins President Tim Solso as well as the Wärtsilä Diesel Pentti-Juhani Hintikka had high expectations about the co-operation. In March 1995 the President of Cummins- Wärtsilä was appointed Iain M. Barrowman who had served for eight years in Cummins.  Scope  The joint venture designed, developed and produced two product families of diesel and gas engines for power generation and marine propulsion use. Wärtsilä Diesel sold these engines with Wärtsilä brand and Cummins with its own name respectively. Initially the sales and services were carried out by both companies separately; these operations were combined in 1997. *Wärtsilä 200 family was launched shortly before the joint venture establishment. Its power range was 2 200–4 500 kW and it was produced in Wärtsilä SACM Diesel factory in Mulhouse, France. Cummins sold this engine type under name Cummins QSZ. *Cummins QSW was produced in the Cummins Daventry plant and came into market in 1997. It covered range 550–2 700 kW.  End of the joint venture  According to analytics Cummins-Wärtsilä failed badly at introducing new engine types into market. The joint venture created significant losses. In December 1999 Cummins reported about dissolution of the joint venture. Cummins kept the Daventry factory where it continued producing the Cummins QSW (Wärtsilä 170/180) series and the Mulhouse factory was transferred back to Wärtsilä NSD together with production of Wärtsilä 200/220 engines. In January 2000 Ole Johansson, the President of Wärtsilä NSD said that both companies will continue the production and development of their own engine families, providing both parties better synergy benefits and improving profitability from the prevailing deficient level.

Its mandate was later enlarged to include the investigation of the 2002 Gujarat riots. It was appointed on 6 March 2002, with K. G. Shah, a retired Gujarat High Court judge, as its only member. It was later re- constituted to include G. T. Nanavati, a retired judge of the Supreme Court of India, after protests from human rights organizations over Shah's closeness to then-Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi. Akshay H. Mehta, retired judge of the Gujarat High Court, replaced Shah when the latter died before the submission of the Commission's interim report. Mehta was the same judge who had granted bail to Babu Bajrangi, the main accused of the Naroda Patiya massacre. In September 2008 the Commission submitted the part of its report covering the Godhra train burning incident (Part I) in which it had concluded that burning of the S-6 coach of Sabarmati Express near Godhra railway station was a \\"planned conspiracy\\". The part dealing with subsequent violence was submitted on 18 November 2014. Its term ended on 31 October 2014, having received 24 extensions from the state government. Background On the morning of 27 February 2002, the Sabarmati Express, returning from Ayodhya to Ahmedabad, was stopped near the Godhra railway station. Several of the passengers were Hindu kar sevaks, or volunteers, returning from a religious ceremony at the disputed Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri mosque site. Under circumstances that are the subject of a lot of controversy, four coaches of the train caught on fire, trapping many people inside. The resulting blaze killed 59 people, including 25 women and 25 children. The event was generally perceived as the trigger for the anti-Muslim riots that followed, in which some estimate upwards of 2000 people were killed, while 150,000 were displaced. Rape, mutilation, and torture were also widespread. Appointment and membership On 6 March 2002, the government of Gujarat appointed a commission of inquiry under section 3 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 to investigate into the Godhra train burning incident, the subsequent riots and the adequacy or lack thereof of the administrative measures taken to prevent and deal with the disturbances that followed, both in Godhra and subsequently across the state. The Commission was a single member commission consisting of Justice K. G. Shah, a retired Gujarat High Court judge. However, Shah's alleged closeness to Narendra Modi provoked outrage from the families of the victims as well as from Human Rights organisations, and resulted in call for a more independent head for the commission. As a result, on 21 May 2002, the government of Gujarat reconstituted the Commission into a two-member committee, and appointed retired Supreme Court judge G. T. Nanavati as chairman, which thus became known as the \\"Nanavati-Shah Commission.\\" Shah died on 22 March 2008, just a few months before the commission was due to submit its interim report, and on 5 April 2008 the Gujarat High Court then appointed its retired judge Akshay H. Mehta to the committee on 6 April 2008. Commission is hence variously also known as the Shah-Nanavati Commission or the Nanavati-Shah- Mehta Commission. During its six-year probe, the commission examined more than 40,000 documents and the testimonies of more than 1,000 witnesses. The credibility of the Commission's report was called into question when the investigative magazine Tehelka released a video recording showing Arvind Pandya, counsel for the Gujarat government, discussing the Commission. In the video, Pandya states that \\"Hindu leaders\\" need not concern themselves about the findings of the Shah-Nanavati commission; since Shah was \\"their man\\" and Nanavati could be bribed, the findings would definitely be in the BJP's favour. Pandya resigned from the post of counsel for the government, stating that he had been framed. =Terms of reference= Initially, the Terms of Reference of the Commission were to inquire into the facts, circumstances and course of events that led to the burning of the S-6 coach of Sabarmati Express. On 20 July 2004, soon after the UPA government came to power in the centre, the scope of the Commission was widened to include within its scope of inquiry, the role and conduct of the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi and/or any other Ministers in his council of ministers, police officers, other individuals and organizations. This action pre-empted the central government from constituting any other Commission, as section 3(b) the Commissions of Inquiry act of 1952 does not allow two simultaneous commissions into the same matter. =Term= The initial term of the committee was three months; however, its terms were extended for 24 times and its term ended on 31 October 2014. Functioning of the Commission and investigation Inside view of the burnt S-6 coach of Sabarmati Express published in the Commission's report On 7 March 2002, the Commission started its functioning at Ahmedabad. On 20 April 2002, it issued a notification inviting persons acquainted with the subject matter of the inquiry relating to the Godhra incident and post-Godhra incidents to furnish to the Commission statements/affidavits. The inquiry was conducted by the Commission as an open public inquiry and the public and media were also permitted to remain present at the time of hearings fixed by the Commission. . except on one occasion when Mr. Rahul Sharma was asked some questions ‘in camera’ for ascertaining certain facts. That part of his evidence was also made available to the parties later on. It issued summons to railwaymen and higher officers to compel them to produce certain relevant documents. In total 46,494 statements/affidavits were received by the Commission. Out of them 2019 were statements/affidavits filed by the Government officers and 44445 statements/ affidavits were received from the public. The commission initially examined the burnt S-6 coach to see its condition and the damage caused to it and later in the light of the evidence collected by it. Part I of the report and conclusions In September 2008, the Commission submitted its 168-paged Part I of the report, dealing with the Godhra train burning incident, which was tabled before the Gujarat Legislative Assembly. The report concludes that the burning of the S-6 coach of Sabarmati Express was a premeditated crime and not an accident. It further gave a clean chit to Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, saying there was no evidence to show that he or anybody in his Government was involved with incident. =Regarding train burning incident= Commission concluded that \\"there was a conspiracy to burn coach S-6 of the Sabarmati Express train to cause harm to the Karsevaks travelling in that coach.\\" As per the Commission, the \\"conspiracy\\" was hatched by some local Muslims at the Aman guest house in Godhra the previous night and the conspirators immediately made arrangements for collecting about 140 litres of petrol from a nearby pump on the night of 26 February 2002, the next day when the train arrived in Godhra, Hasan Lala, after forcibly opening the vestibule between coaches S-6 and S-7, entered S-6 and threw burning rags setting it on fire. A dismissed Central Reserve Police Force officer named Nanumiyan, and Maulvi Husain Haji Ibrahim Umarji, a cleric in the town of Godhra, were presented as the \\"masterminds\\" behind the operation.The Godhra conspiracy as Justice Nanavati saw it The Times of India, 28 September 2008. Retrieved 19 February 2012. Archived 21 February 2012. The evidence collected by the committee in favour of this conclusion was a statement made by Jabir Binyamin Behra, a criminal who happened to be in custody at the time; however, he later denied giving any such statement. In addition, the alleged acquisition of 140 litres of petrol hours before the arrival of the train and the storage of this petrol at the house of Razzak Kurkur, accused of being a key conspirator, as well as forensic evidence supposedly demonstrating that fuel had been poured on the coach before it was burned, was presented by the committee. The report concluded that the train was attacked by thousands of Muslims from the Signal Falia area. The Commission also concluded that there was no evidence regarding involvement of any definite religious or political organization in the conspiracy. The Commission claimed that there was no evidence to justify the contention that the kar sevaks had been fighting with Muslim vendors at stations before the incident as was alleged earlier, though there were some minor scuffles with three Muslim vendors on the Godhra platform. But it concluded that there was no \\"reliable evidence\\" to show that any attempt was made by the kar sevaks to abduct Sofiabanu, Salim Panwala to spread a \\"false rumour\\" to that effect to collect a mob that started pelting stones on the passengers. According to the report, setting fire to the train was part of a \\"larger conspiracy\\" to \\"instil a sense of fear\\" in the administration and create \\"anarchy\\" in the state. =Regarding role of Narendra Modi and other ministers and officials= The Commission concluded that there was \\"absolutely no evidence to show that either Modi, the then Chief Minister of Gujarat and/or any other minister(s) in his council of ministers or police officers had played any role in the Godhra incident or that there was any lapse on their part in the matter of providing protection, relief and rehabilitation to the victims of communal riots or in the matter of not complying with the recommendations and directions given by National Human Rights Commission.\\" Final Report On 18 November 2014, the final report was submitted by the Commission to the Gujarat government. The report runs in over 2000 pages and is contained in nine volumes. Responses to the findings in Part I Bharatiya Janata Party welcomed the Part I of the report and termed it to be \\"most extensive, exhaustive and scientific\\". It said that the report would put an end to all theories which claim the burning of the train was an accident and that the fire broke out from inside. Vishwa Hindu Parishad also welcomed the report. Its international secretary Pravin Togadia said that the report has established that Godhra train carnage was a \\"pre-planned attack.\\" The Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Indian National Congress both objected to the exoneration of the Gujarat government by the Commission, citing the timing of the report (with the general elections months away) as evidence of unfairness. Congress spokesperson Veerappa Moily commented at the strange absolvement of the Gujarat government for complacency for the carnage before the Commission's second and final report had been brought out. The CPI (M) said that the report reinforced communal prejudices.cong, cpm slam Nanavati report for reinforcing 'communal bias.' Times of India. 28 September 2008. The Commission has come in for heavy criticism from academics such as Christophe Jaffrelot for obstructing the course of justice, supporting the conspiracy theory too quickly, and for allegedly ignoring evidence of governmental complicity in the incident. The Concerned Citizens Tribunal (CCT), headed by Teesta Setalvad, carried out a separate investigation in 2002 and concluded that the fire had been accidental, stating that the attack by a mob was part of a government conspiracy to trigger violence across the state. Several other independent commentators have also concluded that the fire itself was almost certainly an accident, saying that the initial cause of the blaze would not ever be determined. . The Nanavati-Shah Commission findings explicitly contradict these views. Court verdict In February 2011, the trial court convicted 31 people and acquitted 63 others for conspiring to murder, saying the incident was a \\"pre-planned conspiracy.\\" All of those convicted were Muslims. The judgement rested in part on the findings of the Nanavati-Shah Commission; however, Maulvi Umarji, presented by the Commission as the chief conspirator, was cleared of all charges along with 62 others for insufficient evidence.

It lived in the Paleocene epoch, 60.5 to 61.6 million years ago (Ma). The type species name originates from australis, Latin for \\"southern\\", and ornis, the Greek word for \\"bird\\", and lovei commemorates Leigh Love, an amateur paleontologist who discovered it. Australornis is one of the oldest flying seabirds. It is also the first non-sphenisciform (penguins and allies) bird fossil discovered from New Zealand for that age. The fossil originates from an era just after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. The features of the bird indicate that it does not belong to any of the extant bird families, but to a precursor group or clade which is extinct; hence it is a find of global significance with regard to the evolution of birds. Though the fossil evidence is incomplete to substantiate phylogeny, Australornis contributes to the emerging view that the diversification of Neoaves had already begun in the earliest Paleogene. Australornis is also of zoogeographical significance, as New Zealand was much closer to Antarctica during the Late Cretaceous and Early Paleocene and it would have originated over deep waters of a warm sea off the coast of Zealandia, now a nearly submerged continent or microcontinent that sank after breaking away from Australia between 60 and 85 million years ago and on which New Zealand rests.  Discovery  The fossil was discovered in 2009 by Leigh Love in the Paleocene Waipara Greensand of north Canterbury on the South Island of New Zealand. The fossil was deposited in the Canterbury Museum, Christchurch, where it lay in museum shelves for a number of years, as earthquakes severely affected the working of the Museum staff. The fossil was described in 2014 by Dr Gerald Mayr, from the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum in Frankfurt-am-Main, and Dr Paul Scofield of the Canterbury Museum, who published their findings in the Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand.  Description  Australornis grew roughly to about long, and has been likened to a pied shag in size. It is thought to have weighed between . Australornis is known from the following remains: * right coracoid (extremitas omalis) * right scapula (caudal portion) * right humerus (less the distal end) * right ulna (proximal end only) * fragments of the shaft of a radius * left os carpi radiale The wing and pectoral girdle bones of this avian fossil have been found to be quite distinct. While there is not enough fossil material from Australornis to enable a phylogenetic study linking it with extant bird groups, it has been found to share certain derived characteristics with a number of modern bird taxonomic groups, namely Procellariiformes, Gaviiformes and Rallidae. Australornis lovei has similarities to two fossil avians from Antarctica - the similarly-sized Vegavis iaai (Noriega & Tambussi 1995) from the late Cretaceous (68 - 66 Ma) of Vega Island, Antarctica and Polarornis gregorii (Chatterjee 2002) from the Late Cretaceous López de Bertodano Formation of Seymour Island of Antarctica. Though Australornis was found near the fossils of Waimanu manneringi, the oldest fossil penguin, found in the same level of strata in Waipara and regarded to be of the same age, it lacks any morphological resemblances to penguins. In 2017 a phylogenetic study Agnolín and colleagues have found Australornis to be stem-anseriforms along with Polarornis, Neogaeornis and Vegavis in the family Vegaviidae.

Claplanhoo was the first Makah to earn a bachelor's degree. Claplanhoo was the chairman of the Makah during the excavation of the Ozette Indian Village Archeological Site in the 1970s. He is credited with keeping the artifacts uncovered at Ozette in Neah Bay. Under his leadership, the Makah Museum, which houses the Ozette collection, was established at Neah Bay in 1979. He also established Fort Núñez Gaona–Diah Veterans Park in Neah Bay in 2008. Biography =Early life and education= Claplanhoo was born on August 8, 1928. He was adopted by Arthur Claplanhoo (1895-1973) and Ruth Claplanhoo (1902-2002) and raised in Neah Bay, Washington, on the Makah Indian Reservation. His mother, Ruth Claplanhoo, a cedar basket weaver who died in August 2002 at the age of 100, was the last native speaker of the Makah language. His father, Art, worked as a fire lookout for the forestry division of the Bureau of Indian Affairs from 1938 to 1947. In 1947, he enrolled as a student at Washington State College (present-day Washington State University) on a full scholarship awarded by the Washington State Department of Education. Claplanhoo was a member of the WSC ROTC when he was drafted into United States Army. He left college and took a bus to Fort Lewis, where he was sworn into the Army on November 17, 1950, at 1:30 p.m. He was assigned to the 369th Engineer Amphibious Support Regiment, Boat Battalion, eventually rising to the rank of sergeant first class. During his military service, Claplanhoo was stationed in Washington at Fort Worden in Port Townsend and at Fort Lewis; as well as Naval Base Coronado; the Presidio of San Francisco; Fort MacArthur; a base in Thule, Greenland; and Rochefort, France. Claplanhoo returned to Washington State College in 1953, shortly after his honorable discharge from the Army in 1952. He received a bachelor's degree in agriculture and forestry from Washington State in 1956, becoming the first Makah to graduate from college. He was hired by the Washington Department of Natural Resources shortly after graduation. =Makah chairman= In 1970, a winter storm uncovered the remains of a village on Cape Alava, now known as the Ozette Indian Village Archeological Site, which had been buried by a mudslide in the 1700s. Claplanhoo, who was chairman of the Makah at the time of storm, immediately recognized the importance of the discovery. He soon contacted Richard Daugherty, an archeologist at Washington State University. Daugherty was the WCU freshman class adviser during the 1950s when Claplanhoo had served as class treasurer. Edward Claplanhoo and Richard Daugherty, who led the Ozette excavation, collaborated to preserve the artifacts found at the site. Claplanhoo lobbied researchers and Washington state officials in an effort to keep the artifacts on Makah land. Claplanhoo spearheaded the creation of the Makah Museum in Neah Bay, which houses the Ozette artifacts within the Makah Cultural and Research Center. The Makah museum and cultural center opened in 1979. In 2010, Ruth Kirk, wife of Richard Daugherty and author of a book on the Ozette excavation, noted the contributions that both men made to the dig and the museum: \\"Ed and Dick were really instrumental in getting the museum set up. Usually, back then, artifacts were taken back to the university, but here Dick always wanted them, and Ed worked with him because the Makah wanted them to stay in Neah Bay...Now it is common to do that, but back then it was a new idea.\\" Claplanhoo remained actively involved with his community. He served as the chairman of the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation of Seattle, a member of the Makah committee to promote higher education, and a Neah Bay Assembly of God Church elder. Edward Claplanhoo was a member of the Makah Whaling Commission, which drew worldwide attention for killing a gray whale in May 1999 after a seventy-five year abstention in whaling. (The Makah are the only tribe permitted to hunt whales in the continental United States. The right was granted to them in an 1855 treaty in exchange for much of their traditional lands.) Claplanhoo and his wife, Thelma, (together with two other Makah families) donated land to establish Fort Núñez Gaona–Diah Veterans Park in Neah Bay in May 2008. The Claplanhoo's property had been inherited from his parents. After the death of his father, Art, in 1973, Edward Claplanhoo and his mother, Ruth, jointly inherited the property. Edward Claplanhoo approached his mother with the idea of eventually building a memorial to Neah Bay's military veterans on the land, \\"When my dad passed away, my mother [Ruth] and I inherited this piece of property...Before she passed away, I said to her if you give me your share, I will build a veteran's memorial to honor all the people who left Neah Bay to go to all the wars.\\" His mother agreed to the idea. Fort Núñez Gaona–Diah Veterans Park marks the site of a Spanish fort, called Fort Núñez Gaona (named for Admiral Manuel Núñez Gaona), constructed in 1792, which was the first European settlement in the continental United States west of the Rocky Mountains and north of San Francisco. Spanish explorer Salvador Fidalgo had arrived on the May 29, 1792, and soon established the fort near the Makah village of Deah (present-day Neah Bay, Washington). The Spaniards were expelled from the site following four months of attacks, led by Makah Chief Tetaku. Claplanhoo had known about the history of his property long before the dedication, even taking the time to place a memorial sign at the site. However, he began planning for a full park and memorial following a conversation Lieutenant Governor Brad Owen in 2002. Claplanhoo became further interested in the park when Owens invited Edward and Thelma Claplanhoo to a 2004 opening reception for an exhibit on Spanish exploration from 1492 to 1819 at the Seattle Art Museum. Other prominent guests at the reception included King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia of Spain. Claplanhoo was impressed that sketches of Makah people and their canoes were displayed alongside depictions of Spanish vessels at the exhibit. Negotiations soon commenced to establish Fort Núñez Gaona–Diah Veterans Park. Claplanhoo worked closely with the Makah Tribal Council, office of the Lieutenant Governor of Washington, the government of Spain, and the Spanish Honorary Vice Consul Luis F. Esteban during the planning stages. The Embassy of Spain, Washington, D.C. also donated $40,000 dollars to build the memorial. Edward Claplanhoo was also inducted into the Washington State University Wall of Fame in 2008, an honor reserved for just one percent of the university's alumni. Claplanhoo died of a heart attack on March 14, 2014, at the age of 81. He had suffered from cardiac problems, with his heart working at only partial capacity during his later life. He was survived by his wife, Thelma Claplanhoo; daughter, Karen, and son, Vern; five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. Nearly 1,000 people attended his memorial in Neah Bay. He was buried at Tahoma National Cemetery in Kent, Washington. The 2010 Makah Days celebration, which is held annually in August, marked the first time that Claplanhoo did not serve as master of ceremonies since 1965.

The purpose was to defend or attack a certain perspective or idea. Pamphlet wars have occurred multiple times throughout history, as both social and political platforms. Pamphlet wars became viable platforms for this protracted discussion with the advent and spread of the printing press. Cheap printing presses, and increased literacy made the late 17th century a key stepping stone for the development of pamphlet wars, a period of prolific use of this type of debate. Over 2200 pamphlets were published between 1600–1715 alone.\\"British Pamphlets, 17th Century.\\" British Pamphlets, 17th Century. The Newberry. Web. 14 March 2015. http://www.newberry.org/british-pamphlets-17th- century Pamphlet wars are generally credited for powering many key social changes of the era, including the Protestant Reformation and the Revolution Controversy, the English philosophical debate set off by the French Revolution.  History of the pamphlet in England  Henry VIII The growth of British literature started in the 1520s. It was generally used in this decade and several following for debates over different religious practices. It was a pattern in Europe that the press was used in order to war over religion, and England was no exception. Henry VIII used literature to try to rewrite history, attempting to justify his break from Rome and the Catholic Church.Raymond, Joad. Pamphlets and Pamphleteering in Early Modern Britain. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2003. Print. During the subsequent reigns of Edward and Mary, literature was used not only for religious purposes, but also as a sort of propaganda war. The written word had enormous potential to sway the common opinion. In the 1560s, print was first used for conveying news. In 1562, the first pamphlets were reported, which discussed the English forces sent to aid the French Huguenots. In 1569, pamphlets were again used to report the revolt of the Northern Earls and the Rebellion of 1569. Beginning in the 1580s pamphlets began to replace broadsheet ballads as the means to convey news to the general public. The pamphlet gained more and more popularity over the next century until 1688, by which time it was the main way to gain public support for an idea. After the Glorious Revolution, the pamphlet lost some popularity due to the emergence of newspapers and periodicals,\\"Pamphlet  Literature.\\" Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica. Web. 14 March 2015. but continued to be an important factor, as illustrated by the Revolution Controversy a full century later in the 1790s. Pamphlet printing Coming from a Latin word, \\"pamphlet\\" literally means \\"small book.\\" In the early days of printing, the format of the book or pamphlet depended on the size of the paper used and the number of times it was folded. If a page was only folded once, it was called a folio. If it was folded twice, it was known as a quarto. An octave was a paper folded three times. A pamphlet was usually 1-12 sheets of paper folded in quarto, or 8-96 pages. It was sold for one or two pennies apiece. The printing of a pamphlet involved many people: the author, the printer, suppliers, print-makers, compositor, correctors, pressmen, binders, and distributors. Once the pamphleteer had written the pamphlet, it was sent to the printing house to be corrected, set into type, and printed. The papers were then given to the printer's warehouse-keeper, who bundled the copies and sent them to the bookseller, who was probably the one financing the printing. He was responsible to bind the pamphlets, usually by sewing them, and then sold them wholesale to individual bookselling vendors. The booksellers then sold them from a stall in the marketplace.  Pamphlet subjects  Pamphlets began as the means of conveyance for religious debates, and therefore religious topics were one of the main subjects they dealt with. The definition of a pamphlet came to mean a short work dealing with social, political, or religious issues. Typical topics included the Civil war, Church of England doctrines, Acts of Parliament, the Popish Plot (see below), the Stuart Era, and Cromwell propaganda. In addition, pamphlets were also used for romantic fiction, autobiography, scurrilous personal abuse, and social criticism. They contained much of the propaganda of the 17th century in the midst of the religious and political turmoil. They were also used for debates between the Puritans and the Anglican. During the Glorious Revolution, pamphlets were political weapons.  Authors  Thomas Hobbes There were many authors of pamphlets. However some of the more popular authors include Daniel Defoe, Thomas Hobbes, Jonathan Swift, John Milton, and Samuel Pepys. Also included in the midst are Thomas Nashe, Joseph Addison, Richard Steele, and Matthew Prior. In 1591–1592, Robert Greene released a series of pamphlets which later inspired many other authors including Thomas Middleton and Thomas Dekker.  Critics  Pamphlets, along with their vast popularity, received criticism. There were many in the time period who believed that pamphlets were full of foolishness. They thought the pamphlets were not good enough literature and that they would turn people from \\"good\\" writing. They believed that pamphlets would be the end of the great volumes of literature and that great writing would be forgotten. News reporting Pamphlets made a great difference in the way news was reported to the general public. With the publication of pamphlets, it was no longer difficult for people to hear of events taking place far away. The closer the occurrence was to London, the easier and faster people heard of it. For example, the Battle of Edgehill took place on 23 October 1642. The first pamphlet reporting the incident was printed on 25 October 24 hours after some of the orders reported had been given. While not entirely accurate, and hurriedly made, the pamphlet nonetheless was able to tell the general public what had happened in the battle. A more accurate, specific, and readable account was available in a pamphlet printed on 26 October, and the \\"authorized\\" version was available only five days after the battle took place.Greenburg, Steven. \\"Dating Civil War Pamphlets, 1641–1644.\\" The North American Conference on British Studies. Web. 14 March 2015.  Marprelate pamphlets  In 1588, a series of pamphlets marked the turning point for the Puritans, dividing them from other Protestants in the country. These pamphlets set forth Puritan doctrines and aroused a lot of controversy. The authors wrote under the pseudonym of Martin Marprelate, and his two sons of the same name. The true authors were never discovered. The series of pamphlets was written with the aim to provoke a response from authorities in regards to action they wanted taken against censorship. The series was among the first to engage the audience, asking questions and addressing the reader directly.  Early pamphlet wars  =Elizabethan pamphlet wars= As a means of forming or swaying public opinion, pamphlets like these had a in both influencing society, and the content being influenced by society. During the 16th century and continuing for a short while in the early 17th century in England there was rise in the use of pamphlet wars to discuss a myriad of issues spanning from the civil war, to religious freedoms and the roles of women in society. The Queen herself participated in these discussions, making sure that she was widely read and understood by her people in order to gain favor and establish herself as the monarch despite being a woman. Examples of her use of this medium appear in To the Troops at Tilbury written in 1588, On Mary's Execution written in 1586, and many more. Another famous writer of this period to take advantage of the pamphlet was Emilia Lanier, famous for her arguments about the role of women. A common idea promoted by many literary works and the general attitude towards females, Lanier's work \\"Eve's Apology in Defense of Women\\" refuted the belief that Eve is responsible for the fall of man. A very uncommon and unpopular stance to take, Lanier accomplishes her defense through structuring it as an apology, one of the earliest subversive feminist texts. Similarly, Francis Bacon wrote his Essays to promote his idea of morality and other complicated social issues. For example, his work, \\"Of Love\\" examines the various understandings of the concept of love, particularly as it was perceived during the Elizabethan era. = Eikon Series = In 1649, and until 1651, some five pamphlets were published in a debate about the execution of Charles I, the king of Ireland, Scotland, and England. The king himself, pre- death, wrote the first pamphlet in the discussion (Eikon Basilike: The Portraiture of His Sacred Majesty in His Solitudes and Sufferings), painting himself a martyr. In the following months, what came to be known as the \\"Eikon\\" series were published: Eikon Alethine, Eikon e Pistes, Eikonoklastes, and Eikon Aklastos, (\\"eikon is greek for \\"image). all alternately attacking or defending the idea surrounding the king's death and his own pamphlet. This war of words was about preserving or erasing the memory and thoughts of Charles I. It was a battle about the significance of his execution, and the execution of a monarch in general, which was seen as an execution of the personification of law and power.  Popish Plot and Elizabeth Cellier  Front page of the pamphlet Malice Defeated published in 1680 In the 1680s, after being acquitted of the \\"Meal-Tub Plot\\" for which she was accused, Elizabeth Cellier wrote Malice Defeated, which, along with The Matchless Picaro, sparked a pamphlet war surrounding debate of the ascension of a Catholic king to the throne. She, and many associates, published several dozen works regarding the issues of their time in dealing with the Popish Plot. The repercussions of Cellier's writings were widespread as members of her company were arrested and punished. Cellier herself was convicted of libel and received harsh punishment, including being stoned and imprisoned for a time.  Effects  These early pamphlet wars served to change the way literary, and even social, conversations were viewed and carried out. They also created new ways of conversation, and new styles of language. Elizabeth Cellier was also a key figure in her defiance of normal gender roles and willingness to publicly submit her writings and vocalize her views. Throughout history they have allowed for discussion on a widespread and influential level.  Notes   References  * Grossman, Marshall.

The cemeteries were founded in 1884 in what was known as \\"Block 32\\". On February 1, 2007, \\"Block 32\\" was renamed Pioneer and Military Memorial Park. The Pioneer and Military Memorial Park is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The historic Smurthwaite House, which is also listed in the National Register of Historic Places, is located on the grounds of the Pioneer and Military Memorial Park and is used as the cemetery's main office. Pioneer and Military Memorial Park is the final resting place of various notable pioneers of Arizona. History Prior to the establishment of the Pioneer and Military Memorial Park, there were other cemeteries already in existence as early as 1850. The citizens of the newly founded city became concerned with the \\"old\\" cemetery, which was once located between 5th and 7th Avenues and Jackson and Madison Streets, near a newly built train station. They feared that the sight of the \\"old\\" cemetery would be an unpleasant one to the railroad passengers who would visit the city in the newly established railroad system.Pioneers' Cemetery Association, Inc. Phoenix Government In 1884, the city counsel decided to purchase Block 32 in what archaeologists have now determined were the ruins of a pre-Columbian Hohokam community which they named \\"La Villa\\".La Villa Fast Facts The families who had their loved ones buried in the old cemetery, had them moved to the new one. The city also reburied the unclaimed bodies in a common grave in the new cemetery. On October 8, 1884, John R. Loosley became the owner of some of the western portion of \\"Block 32\\". He moved bodies from the potters field of the old cemetery and buried them in what became known as the \\"City\\" or \\"Loosley\\" cemetery. In 1888, Lulu G. Porter, wife of DeForest Porter, acquired the south half of Block 32 and had it laid out as a cemetery, which is now known as Porter cemetery.Cemetery history The \\"Block 32\\" cemetery is made up of seven historic cemeteries which were in use between 1884 and 1914. Each of the seven cemeteries has its own name: the \\"Ancient Order of United Workmen\\" (AOUW), \\"Independent Order of Odd Fellows (IOOF)\\", \\"Knights of Pythias\\" (K of P), \\"Loosley\\" (also known as City Cemetery), \\"Masons\\", \\"Porter\\" and \\"Rosedale\\". In 1914, a law forbidding further burials within city limits went into effect and the seven cemeteries were declared closed. The cemeteries fell into a state of abandonment. After years of disrepair, the citizens of Phoenix rallied to restore the cemeteries. After the cemeteries were restored, they were officially designated, in May 1988, as the \\"Pioneer and Military Memorial Park\\". It is estimated that there are 3,700 burials; however, fewer than 600 of these graves have headstones. The area which comprises the Pioneer and Military Memorial Park is bounded by 13th and 15th Avenues and Jackson and Harrison Streets. The main entrance is located at 1317 W. Jefferson Street.National Register of Historic Places In 1930, the Pioneers' Cemetery Association was founded. The association began the preservation and restoration of the cemeteries in the Pioneers and Military Memorial Park. They were also in charge of researching the history behind the burials. However, their work was interrupted by the death of Thomas Hayden, the prime researcher, and by World War II. The present Pioneers' Cemetery Association was formed in 1983 and has continued the work which was previously interrupted by the events previously mentioned. The association has a working relationship with the City of Phoenix. The Smurthwaite House The Smurthwaite House was designed and built in 1897 by Creighton & Millard, a local firm, for Dr. Darius M. Purman and his wife, Mary. The house, which was originally located at 602 N. 7th Street, was intended to be used as a boarding house.Connell Smurthwaite House In 1903, the Purman's sold the house to National Bank of Arizona of Phoenix. That same year Captain Trustrim Connell, recipient of the Medal of Honor, and his wife Ann purchased the house. In 1938, it was deeded to their daughter Caroline who married Charles Smurthwaite. Later, the house was passed on to the Smurthwaite's daughter, Carolann Smurthwaite, who lived there until her death in 1982. Carolann had willed the house to be jointly administered by the Phoenix Art Museum, The Museum of Northern Arizona and the Heard Museum. In 1991, the Heritage Fund approved a grant of $50,000 to restore the Smurthwaite House and in 1994, the house was moved to its current location at 1317 W. Jefferson Street.

Appropriated as a coded message for escape, by the end of the American Civil War it had become known through much of the eastern United States. In the 19th century, it helped inspire blues, and it remains a staple in gospel music. History The tune known as \\"Roll, Jordan, Roll\\" may have its origins in the hymn \\"There is a Land of Pure Delight\\" written by Isaac WattsGuenther, Eileen, \\"Music of the Soil and Soul,\\" The Choral Journal, Vol. 57, No 7 (2017), p. 66-67; Southern, Eileen, An Origin for the Negro Spiritual,\\" The Black Southern Scholar, Summer 1972, p. 12; Tallmadge, William H. \\"Dr. Watts and Mahalia Jackson-The Development, Decline, and Survival of a Folk Style in America,\\" Ethnomusicology, Vol 5, No 2 (1961), p. 97 in the 18th century. It was introduced to the United States by the early 19th century, in states such as Kentucky and Virginia, as part of the Second Great Awakening, and often sung at camp meetings. The song soon became popular with the slaves. According to Ann Powers of NPR, it became a \\"primary example of slaves' claiming and subverting a Christian message to express their own needs and send their own messages\\". The River Jordan of the song became a coded message for escape, calling to mind the Mississippi or Ohio Rivers, both of which led to the slave-free northern United States and thus freedom. The song was collected and arranged by Lucy McKim in 1862. In the same year, she sent a letter with some recordings from her trip to St. Helena Island to Dwight's Journal of Music, where it was published in 1863. The American war journalist Charles Carleton Coffin, who heard a performance of the song in Blythewood, South Carolina, in 1863, described \\"Roll, Jordan, Roll\\" as already having become a favourite song, with many versions to be found. A year later, a version was published in Slave Songs of the United States (compiled by abolitionists William Francis Allen, Lucy McKim Garrison, and Charles Pickard Ware). The editors, who positioned the song \\"in a place of honor\\" as the first entry in the book, noted that the song could be found from South Carolina down to Florida, and described it as \\"one of the best known and noblest\\" of Black spirituals. By 1920 over fifty publications had reproduced or referenced the song. \\"Roll, Jordan, Roll\\" influenced a variety of songs. The refrain of Stephen Foster's \\"Camptown Races\\", for instance, is considerably similar to the spiritual, and the melodies likewise have parallels. By the early 20th century, Stephen Calt writes, \\"Roll, Jordan, Roll\\" had influenced the creation of a new genre, blues, though likely through an undocumented secular version of the song. He finds compositional similarities in \\"Roll, Jordan, Roll\\" and all blues songs. Early blues songs, such as \\"Bad-luck Blues\\" (1927) and \\"Cool Drink of Water\\" (1928), used a similar structure to that of \\"Roll, Jordan, Roll\\". \\"Roll, Jordan, Roll\\", meanwhile, became a standard of the Fisk Jubilee Singers and has remained a staple of gospel music. Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961). In 1962 Eugene D. Genovese began writing his book Roll, Jordan, Roll. He took a different stand between ideology and idealism, the most studies of slavery theme, and postulated which master and slave must be studied together. His work is a critique to the ideology, and the best way to understand the American slavery is to understand his structure. He adapted the Gramsci's notion of hegemony to reinterpret the slave relationship, and he focused on slave culture, ignoring the economic determinism. The song was adapted, together with several other Black spirituals, by Nicholas Britell for the 2013 film 12 Years a Slave, Steve McQueen's adaptation of the memoir by Solomon Northup. Britell, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, stated that he felt compelled to rearrange the song because \\"it was very important to create a world that was very unique\\", and the original lyrics were already well known. Powers found that the film's use of \\"Roll, Jordan, Roll\\" served as a counterpoint to \\"Run, Nigger, Run\\", a song of warning appropriated by the White overseer John Tibeats (portrayed by Paul Dano): where \\"Run, Nigger, Run\\" is used as a \\"taunt\\" to break the slaves' spirits, \\"Roll, Jordan, Roll\\" serves to reaffirm the character Northup's desire to not just survive, but live. The Canadian post-hardcore band Alexisonfire took inspiration from the song for their song \\"The Northern\\" on their 2009 album Old Crows / Young Cardinals. Composition, contents, and performance Version of the song included in Four Years of Fighting (1866) \\"Roll, Jordan, Roll\\" is constructed as four-bar phrases, with a ten-beat line followed by a six-beat refrain. The first two phrases close with a keynote, and the lyrics are presented with an AABB rhyme scheme. This construction, according to Calt, was reflected in the construction of blues songs in the early 20th century. The Jordan of the song's lyrics is a reference to the River Jordan, which in Biblical tradition the Israelites crossed to enter the Promised Land. As such, by crossing the Jordan River, the singers are expected to be able to set down their burdens and live life without trouble. Owing to this symbolism, songs related to the River Jordan were not uncommon; Newman Ivey White, writing in 1928, noted that several writers had commented on slaves' fondness for including the river in their spirituals. Coffin recorded performances of the song as substituting the names of audience members or participants as sitting on the Tree of Life, for instance a Mr. Jones, with each progressive rendition of the song substituting a different individual. Elizabeth Kilham, who listened to the song in a church, noticed a similar trend. However, rather than name members of the congregation, the version sung by the church went through a number of Biblical figures, including Jesus, the archangel Gabriel, and the prophet Moses. This was followed by friends and relatives, including \\"my fader\\" and \\"my mudder\\", before ultimately culminating with a number of people respected by the congregation, including former president Abraham Lincoln and Union general Oliver O. Howard. As the performance continued, it became more enthusiastic.
