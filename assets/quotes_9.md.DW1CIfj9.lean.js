It is a shrub or small tree which grows on dunes and coastal cliffs, is very salt tolerant and widely used in horticulture.Myoporum insulare fruit Description Boobialla varies in form from a prostrate shrub to a small, erect tree growing to a height of . It has thick, smooth green leaves which are long and wide with edges that are either untoothed or toothed toward the apex. The leaves are egg-shaped and the upper and lower surfaces are the same dull green colour. White flowers with purple spots appear in the leaf axils in clusters of 3 to 8 and are in diameter. There are 5 glabrous, smooth sepals and the tube formed by the petals is long with the lobes of the tube about the same length. The four stamens usually extend slightly beyond the tube. Peak flowering times are July to February in Western Australia and October to December in south-eastern Australia. Flowering is followed by the fruit which is a smooth, rounded purple to black drupe in diameter. Taxonomy and naming Myoporum insulare was first formally described by botanist Robert Brown in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae in 1810. The specific epithet insulare is a Latin word meaning \\"from an island\\". Distribution and habitat Myoporum insulare occurs in coastal areas of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. In New South Wales it occurs from Eden southward, although an isolated occurrence was recorded much further north on Brush Island. It is also found on Lord Howe Island. In Victoria it is found in coastal areas but also inland in the west of that state. Boobialla is common along the coast of South Australia and in Western Australia it occurs south from Shark Bay to the South Australian border. It grows in sandy soils, often between rocks or near sandstone.Myoporum insulare is invasive in several African countries and in the western coastal areas of the USA. Invasive populations may include some other species of this genus. In South Africa this species is known as manatoka.Glen, Hugh & Van Wyk, Braam (2016) Guide to trees introduced into Southern Africa. pp230-231. Struik Nature, Cape Town Uses Horticulture Myoporum insulare may be used as a fast-growing hedge or windbreak species which withstands coastal winds and drought.

The book triggered a lengthy debate in articles, internet newsgroups, and web-site chat areas. The core argument of the book is that XP is fragile rather than agile, as its practices are interdependent but that few practical organizations are willing/able to adopt all the practices; therefore the entire process fails. On the book's first page he points out that he is not \\"anti-agile\\", rather that the XP process is a fragile implementation of the values described in the Agile Manifesto. In Use Case Driven Object Modeling with UML, Stephens outlines an extension to the ICONIX object modeling process which he and co- author Doug Rosenberg termed Design Driven Testing (DDT), a deliberate reversal of Test Driven Development (TDD), a core tenet of XP. DDT provides a method of creating unit tests and customer acceptance tests that are driven from the design and behavioral requirements (use cases). DDT and the ICONIX modeling process have been adopted in a variety of large-scale software projects e.g. the image processing software in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).Designing the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope with Enterprise Architect (case study) In Design Driven Testing, Stephens compares DDT with TDD, and applies DDT on a real project run by ESRI Systems, to create a GIS mapping system for travel website VResorts.com.

Life Raised a Protestant, he was educated at Oxford (Hart Hall, and perhaps Christ Church), 1583-1587. Going to the University of Paris, he became a zealous protagonist of Protestantism, \\"with the firm intention to have died for it, if need had been\\". But having engaged in controversy with \\"an owld English Jesuit, Father Thomas Darbishire, to my happiness I was overcome.\\" Having embraced Catholicism, he visited Rome and Flanders, where in 1592, he \\"elected to militate under the Jesuits' standard, because they do most impugn the impiety of heretics\\". In 1595 there was a call for Jesuits in Ireland, which had been deprived of them for ten years. With Father Archer he refounded the mission there. Keeping chiefly to Dublin and Drogheda, he reconciled Protestants, and persistently challenged the chief Anglican divines. He laughed at his capture in 1600. \\"Now\\", he said, \\"my adversaries cannot say that they do not know where to find me\\", and he would shout challenges from his prison window at every passing parson. His major opponents in controversy were James Ussher, Meredith Hanmer, and John Rider. Banished in 1604, he visited Spain, Rome, and Flanders, 1611-1620. At the outbreak of the Thirty Years War in 1620, he served as chaplain to the Irish soldiers in the imperial army, and published a diary of his experiences. He probably returned to Flanders in 1621 and in 1630 went back to Ireland where he continued to work until the outbreak of the Civil War (1640). He was under sentence of death, from which he escaped in the winter of 1641 to the Wicklow Mountains, and died, probably, in Kilkenny.

The Grenelle de l'environnement was an open multi-party debate in France that brings together representatives of national and local government and organizations (industry, labour, professional associations, non-governmental organizations) on an equal footing, with the goal of unifying a position on a specific theme. The aim of the \\"Grenelle Environment Round Table\\" (as it might be called in English), instigated by the former President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy in the summer of 2007, was to define the key points of public policy on ecological and sustainable development issues over the following five-year period. The \\"Grenelle Environnement\\" brought together the government, local authorities, trade unions, business and voluntary sectors to draw up a plan of action of concrete measures to tackle the environmental issue. The name \\"Grenelle\\" came from the first conference bringing all these players together which took place in May 1968 in the Rue de Grenelle. Officially launched on 6 July 2007, the \\"Grenelle Environnement\\" combined the state and civil society in order to define new actions for sustainable development in France. Six working groups, composed of representatives of the central government, local governments, employer organizations and trade unions and NGOs first gathered to debate around the themes of climate change and energy, biodiversity and natural resources, health and the environment, production and consumption of ecological democracy, development patterns and environmental employment and competitiveness. Two groups devoted to the issues of GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) and waste were also established. They all submitted their proposals on 27 September 2007. After a public debate during the first two weeks of October, these proposals led to 20 measures on 25 October. Measures The working groups at Grenelle have set ambitious goals in many areas: biodiversity and natural resources, climate change, relations between the environment and public health, modes of production and consumption, issues of \\"environmental governance\\" and \\"ecological democracy\\", the promotion of sustainable patterns of development favorable to competitiveness and employment, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), management of waste. More high-speed railways will be built to curb transportation pollution. The main commitments are: *Building and housing: generalization of standards of low consumption in new housing and public building, plus setting up incentives for the renovation of housing and building heating. *Transportation: construction by 2012 of 2000 km of high speed railway, creating a tax system favoring the least polluting vehicles, establishing an environmental tax levied on trucks on the roads, various urban transport projects including light rail. *Energy: development of renewable energy to achieve 20% of total energy consumption by 2020, ban on incandescent lamps by 2010, project of a tax based on goods and services energy consumption (\\"carbon tax\\"). *Health: banning sales of building materials and plant protection products containing possibly dangerous substances, mandatory reporting of the presence of nanomaterials in products for general public, establishment of a plan on air quality. *Agriculture: tripling of the share of organic farming which is expected to reach 6% of total agricultural land by 2010, halving the use of pesticides, adopting a law to regulate the coexistence between genetically modified and other cultures. *Biodiversity: creation of a \\"green grid\\" linking natural areas, to enable flora and fauna to live and travel throughout the territory, giving priority to new urban developments. Implementation To realize these commitments, thirty-three operational sites were launched in December 2007 to determine the proposals for action for implementing the conclusions of the Grenelle. They were to deliver their first plans in March 2008, for inclusion in the environment bill debated by in spring 2008. However, the debate on the bill for the implementation of the Grenelle Environment was postponed several times, finally was begun in October, and was adopted by the National Assembly on 21 October 2008 and then sent to the Senate. This text, known as \\"First Grenelle Act\\", sets the general policy and describes the choices made while not specifying their practical implementation or funding. It simply reflects the legislative commitments made in October 2007. This first bill focuses on climate and seeks to divide, by four, all emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050. The industrial sectors most affected are construction and transport, which together account for 40% of total emissions. The bill includes construction of 1,500 km of public transport, and the rehabilitation of 800,000 housing units to halve their energy consumption by 2020. Other provisions are related to energy (promotion of renewable energy), products incorporating nanomaterials, agriculture (increase in the share of organic agriculture to 20% by 2020, halving the amount of pesticides). The only measure actually implemented in 2008 was the bonus-malus system on new vehicles, establishing penalties for purchasers of the most polluting vehicles and instead introducing a bonus for the least polluting cars. This measure was introduced by decree for the bonus (decree of 26 December 2007) and an amendment to the 2007 Rectificative Finance Act (which allows to change during the year the initial Finance Act) for the penalty (malus). Already implemented, the system has actually shifted consumption to cleaner vehicles. Among the measures already taken, the law of 25 June 2008 on genetically modified organisms aims to implement several provisions of the Grenelle, although some environmental organizations are challenging some of its provisions. Funding The funding and the detailed rules for the implementation of the provisions of the first Grenelle act were specified in the Finance Act (law which determines, for a year, the nature, the amount and the allocation of resources and expenditure of the government), adopted in December 2008. The funding is also to be specified in a so-called \\"Grenelle 2\\" in 2009 or 2010. At the end of 2008, there were growing concerns about the funding of the Grenelle, due to the economic crisis. The total cost of the bill \\"Grenelle 1\\" has been estimated at around 120 billion euros, representing an annual average of 12 billion euros investment (0,6% of GDP). The establishment of a \\"climate energy contribution\\" or \\"carbon tax\\" (tax on products for their environmental nuisance) was to bring in near 9.7 billion euros a year, according to a study by the ADEME (French Agency for Environment and Energy Management). But the measure has not been included in any bill yet, and even though the Government has announced its future implementation it has not set any timetable. Another funding source was to come from a tax on heavy vehicles which would be levied from 2011, but its level and its base are not yet determined. Investments in renewable energy should also generate additional revenue (for example, 75% of expenditures to rehabilitate public buildings would be financed by the savings on reduced consumption). Savings in other sectors should also play a part .

Finotti (born at Ferrara, Italy, 21 September 1817; died at Central City, Colorado, 10 January 1879) was an Italian Jesuit, writer and editor, active in the United States. Life In 1833 he was received into the Society of Jesus in Rome, and for several years taught and studied in the colleges of the order in Italy. He was one of the recruits whom Fr. Ryder, in 1845, brought from Europe to work in the Maryland Province. After his ordination at Georgetown, D.C., Finotti was appointed pastor of St. Mary's Church, Alexandria, Virginia, and given charge of outlying missions in Maryland and Virginia. In 1852 he left the Society of Jesus and went to Boston. For many years he held the position of literary editor of The Pilot, while acting as pastor of Brookline and later of Arlington, Massachusetts. The last few years of his life he spent in the West, becoming, in 1877, pastor of Central City, Colorado, and retaining charge of that parish up to the time of his death. Works Among his literary productions are: *\\"Month of Mary\\", 1853, which reached a sale of 50,000 copies; *\\"Life of Blessed Paul of the Cross\\", 1860; *\\"Diary of a Soldier\\", 1861; *\\"The French Zouave\\", 1863; *\\"Herman the Pianist\\", 1863; *\\"Works of the Rev. Arthur O'Leary\\"; *\\"Life of Blessed Peter Claver\\", etc. Most of these publications were translated or edited by him. His best-known work, never completed, is his Bibliographica Catholica Americana, which took years of compilation. It was intended to be a catalogue of all the Catholic books published in the United States, with notices of their authors, and epitomes of their contents. The first part, which brings the list down to 1820 inclusive, was published in 1872; the second volume, which was to include the works of Catholic writers from 1821 to 1875, was never finished, though much of the material for it had been gathered. His last literary effort, which he did not live to see published, entitled \\"The Mystery of the Wizard Clip\\" (Baltimore, 1879), is a story of preternatural occurrences at Smithfield, West Virginia, involving Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin.

Peasants who lost their land because of debt or other circumstances could also become kaimynai. Kaimynai and their families were allowed to form a farm, have tools, and earn their own living independently. However they had no personal freedoms and were dependent on the nobles.

All states have legal same-sex marriage, while others have the options of civil unions, domestic partnerships, or reciprocal beneficiary relationships. The federal government only recognizes marriage and no other legal union for same-sex couples. Hawaii was the first state to recognize limited legal same-sex unions, doing so in 1997 in the form of reciprocal beneficiary partnerships. Federal law The legal issues surrounding same-sex marriage in the United States are complicated by the nation's federal system of government. Traditionally, the federal government does not attempt to establish its own definition of marriage. Instead, any marriage recognized by a state was recognized by the federal government, even if that marriage was not recognized by one or more other states (as was the case with interracial marriage before 1967 due to anti-miscegenation laws). According to the federal Government Accountability Office (GAO), more than 1,138 rights and protections are conferred to U.S. citizens upon marriage by the federal government; areas affected include Social Security benefits, veterans' benefits, health insurance, Medicaid, hospital visitation, estate taxes, retirement savings, pensions, family leave, and immigration law. The federal Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, prompted by fears of an adverse result in Hawaii's lawsuit Baehr v. Miike, defined a marriage explicitly as a union of one man and one woman for the purposes of all federal laws (See ), which was ultimately ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in United States v. Windsor on June 26, 2013. As a result, shortly after Windsor was decided, a number of federal areas ranging from veteran benefits to immigration were clarified as applying equally to same-sex couples. Marriage The movement to obtain civil marriage rights and benefits for same-sex couples in the United States began in the 1970s but remained unsuccessful for over forty years. On May 17, 2004, Massachusetts became the first U.S. state and the sixth jurisdiction in the world to legalize same-sex marriage following the Supreme Judicial Court's decision six months earlier. Before nationwide legalization same-sex marriage became legal in 37 states; 25 states by court order, 10 by legislative action, and 3 by referendum. Some states had legalized same-sex marriage by more than one of the three actions. On June 26, 2015 the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that states must license and recognize same-sex marriages. Consequently, same-sex marriage is legal in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands and Northern Mariana Islands. Officials in American Samoa are discussing whether the ruling applies to the territory; currently same-sex marriages are neither licensed nor recognized there.  Native American Tribal Nations  The Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage in the states and territories did not legalize same-sex marriage on Native American lands. In the United States, Congress (not the federal courts) have legal authority over Indian country. Thus, unless Congress passes a law imposing same-sex marriage on Native American tribes, federally recognized Native American tribes have the legal right to form their own marriage laws. As of the time of the Obergefell ruling, 24 tribal nations legally recognize same-sex marriage. Some tribes have passed legislation specifically addressing same-sex relationships and some specify that state law and jurisdiction govern tribal marriages. Civil unions thumb400px State laws regarding same-sex unions similar to marriage in the United States1 \\\\---- 1Not recognized by the federal government. However, same-sex marriage is legal nationwide (excluding some territories and Native American tribal jurisdictions) and is recognized by the federal government.

However, same- sex marriage is legal nationwide (excluding American Samoa and some Native American tribal jurisdictions) and is recognized by the federal government. 2Domestic partnerships in Washington are only available when at least one of the partners is 62 years of age or older. Civil unions are a means of establishing kinship in a manner similar to that of marriage. The formalities for entering a civil union and the benefits and responsibilities of the parties tend to be similar or identical to those relating to marriage. Various names are used for similar relationships in other countries, but civil union was first applied in Vermont. The Supreme Court's invalidation of DOMA Section 3 in 2013 heightened the difference between marriage and civil unions; while marriage provides federal benefits, civil unions do not. Following the legalization of same-sex marriage in their jurisdiction Vermont, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Delaware, ceased to offer civil unions. Civil unions are still legal in Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey, and Colorado; civil unions are also still legal in six municipalities of Arizona. Domestic partnerships Domestic partnerships are any of a variety of relationships recognized by employers or state or local government. The benefits of domestic relationships range from very limited rights to all the rights afforded to married people by the state, except where federal law makes providing benefits impossible. While most domestic partnership schemes grant those partners limited, enumerated rights, the Oregon, Washington, and Nevada schemes provide substantially the same rights as marriage and are therefore, essentially, civil unions. In Oregon, same-sex couples can access domestic partnerships or marriage, as of May 19, 2014. Example of California domestic partnership certificate. thumb400px Some U.S. cities, including New York, San Francisco, and Toledo, offer domestic partnership registries. These registries afford registered partner specified rights otherwise reserved to married couples. The rights afforded include access to city services and rights created by city ordinances. Some private employers within such cities use the domestic partnership registries for the purpose of determining employee eligibility for domestic partner benefits. Six U.S. states and the District of Columbia have some form of domestic partnership. One of these, Hawaii, calls its scheme a \\"reciprocal beneficiary\\" registry. Domestic partnership benefits vary widely, ranging from enumerated lists of benefits similar to municipal domestic partnerships to benefits equal to marriage. When state governments legalize same-sex unions in some form, municipalities and counties in these states may sometimes choose to sunset their own domestic partnership registries (as Cook County, Illinois did in May 2011), while others which enacted such local registries prior to the state's own registry may retain their registries for various reasons. Such registries continue to be separate from state-level registries and unions, and usually must be filed after the dissolution of a state-level union. Those states include California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, and Washington. Employment benefits Some public- and private-sector U.S. employers provide health insurance or other spousal benefits to same-sex partners of employees, although the employee receiving benefits for his or her partner may have to pay income tax on the value of the benefit. Partner benefits are more common among large employers, colleges and universities than at small businesses. The qualifications for and benefits of domestic partnership status vary from employer to employer; some recognize only same-sex or different-sex couples, while others recognize both. According to data from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, the majority of Fortune 500 companies provided benefits to same-sex partners of employees as of June 2006.Human Rights Campaign Foundation ‚Äì State of the Workplace for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Americans, 2005‚Äì2006 . Hrc.org. Overall, 41 percent of HR professionals indicate that their organizations offered some form of domestic partner benefits (opposite-sex partners, same- sex partners or both). Because the U.S. federal government does not recognize same- or opposite-sex partners, tax benefits provided to opposite-sex spouses are generally not available to same-sex partners and spouses or opposite-sex partners.Human Rights Campaign ‚Äì What the Defense of Marriage Act Does. Hrc.org. While there are certain exceptions, generally under the Internal Revenue Code Section 152, the imputed value of the benefit will be considered taxable income. The proposed Tax Equity for Domestic Partner and Health Plan Beneficiaries Act would remove the disparity in tax treatment between such partners and married people, who are not taxed on benefits.

Virgil was educated at the Cheshire Academy, then went to Springfield, Vermont to study surveying. In 1801 he entered Dartmouth College. Virgil was ordained an Episcopal priest and in 1807 became pastor of St. John's Episcopal Church in Waterbury, Connecticut. He then married Jerusha Booth of Vergennes, Vermont.Mitchell SJ, Hudson. \\"Virgil Horace Barber\\", Woodstock Letters, Volume LXXIX, Number 4, November 1, 1950 In 1814, Barber became principal of the Episcopalian Academy at Fairfield, New York. He said that the first step leading to his conversion to Catholicism was the reading of \\"A Novena to St. Francis Xavier\\", a book belonging to an Irish servant girl. This raised doubts concerning his Protestant faith, which his bishop, Dr. Hobart, and other Episcopalian ministers could not solve for him. Meehan, Thomas. \\"The Barber Family.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 21 August 2019 By this time, his father had begun to have some religious reservations and shared with Virgil some books he had been given by Roman Catholic Bishop of Boston, Jean-Louis Lefebvre de Cheverus. During a visit to New York City, in 1816, he called on Father Benedict J. Fenwick, S.J., with the result that he resigned his Episcopalian charge at Fairfield, and went to New York, where he and his wife Jerusha were received into the Roman Catholic Church with their five children, Mary (born 1810); Abigail (born 1811); Susan (born 1813); Samuel (born 1814); and Josephine (born 1816). At first he opened a school in New York, but this lasted only seven months. Both he and his wife determined to enter religious life, he in the Society of Jesus, and she in the Visitation Order. Under the direction of Fenwick, in June 1817 they set out for Georgetown, D. C., where Barber and his son Samuel went to the college of the Jesuit Fathers. Jerusha entered the Georgetown Visitation Monastery, where the three oldest girls were received as boarding students. The youngest child, Josephine, then ten months old, was taken care of by Father Fenwick's mother. The superior at Georgetown, Father John Grassi, S.J., shortly after sailed for Rome and took Barber with him as a novice. Barber remained there a year and then returned to Georgetown, where he continued his studies until December 1822, when he was ordained a priest at Boston. After his ordination he was sent to his old home, Claremont, New Hampshire, where in 1823, he built St. Mary's Church, the first Roman Catholic Church in the state.\\"Old St. Mary's, Old Church Rd., Claremont\\", St. Mary's RC Church, Claremont, New Hampshire He laboured there for two years and then spent some time on the Indian missions in Maine, and was after recalled to Georgetown College, where he passed the remainder of his days. Nearly three years after their separation, February 23, 1820, husband and wife met in the chapel of Georgetown Visitation Monastery to make their vows in religion. She first went through the formula of the profession of a Visitation nun, and he the vows of a member of the Society of Jesus. Their five children, the eldest being ten and the youngest three and a half years old, were present. Mrs. Barber had been admitted into the Visitation monastery on July 26, 1817, taking the name of Sister Mary Augustine. Her novitiate was one of severe trials, as well on account of her affection for her husband as on account of her children, who were a burden to the community then in a state of poverty. She served in the monastery of Georgetown, and the convents of Kaskaskia, St. Louis, and Mobile, where she died January 1, 1860. Mary, the eldest daughter, entered the Ursuline convent, Mt. Benedict, near Charlestown, Massachusetts, as Sister Mary Benedicta, August 15, 1826, and died in the convent of the order in Quebec, May 9, 1844. Abigail, and Susan also became Ursulines at Canadian convents. Josephine became a Visitandine sister, like her mother. Abigail died in Quebec, December 8, 1879, and Susan in the convent at Three Rivers, Canada, January 24, 1837. Samuel, the son, graduated at Georgetown College in 1831 and immediately entered the Society of Jesus. After his novitiate he was sent to Rome, where he was ordained.

It is part of the theory of consumption proposed by English economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946). The hypothesis was refined extensively during the 1960s and 1970s, notably by American economist James Tobin (1918-2002).\\"absolute income hypothesis \\", wisdomsupreme.com. Retrieved 2019-03-01 Background Keynes' General Theory in 1936 identified the relationship between income and consumption as a key macroeconomic relationship. Keynes asserted that real consumption (ie adjusted for inflation) is a function of real disposable income, which is total income net of taxes. As income rises, the theory asserts, consumption will also rise but not necessarily at the same rate. When applied to a cross section of a population, rich people are expected to consume a lower proportion of their income than poor people. The marginal propensity to consume is present in Keynes' consumption theory and determines by what amount consumption will change in response to a change in income. While this theory has success modeling consumption in the short term, attempts to apply this model over a longer time frame have proven less successful. This has led to the absolute income hypothesis falling out of favor as the consumption model of choice for economists.Kuznets, S. (1946) National Income: A Summary of Findings, New York: National Bureaus of Economic Research. Model The model is : C_{t} = \\\\alpha + \\\\lambda Y_{t} where: * C_{t} is consumption at time t, *\\\\alpha is autonomous consumption, a constant, * \\\\lambda is the marginal propensity to consume ( 0<\\\\lambda<1), * Y_{t} is income at time t.

Background At 14 she fled from the Ursuline convent in Bordeaux, she was there engaged by an acting troupe and ‚Äî in love with a handsome young actor ‚Äî embarked for America. She then became the mistress of Burson, Intendant of Martinique, establishing her own dress shop in Saint-Domingue. On her return to Paris, she installed herself in the house of an aunt by marriage, Mme Montansier, a dress-seller from whom she took her stage name. She opened a gaming house on the rue Saint-Honor√©, frequented by the gilded youth of Paris and allowing her to enter high society.  Royal theatre director  Having obtained through her liaison with the marquis de Saint-Contest the leadership of a small theatre on rue Satory in Versailles, she turned her attention to queen Marie- Antoinette and through her in 1775 gained the exclusive rights to balls and shows at the Palace of Versailles, followed in 1779 by rights over the theatres in Fontainebleau, Saint-Cloud, Marly, Compi√®gne, Rouen, Caen, Orl√©ans, Nantes and Le Havre. Backed by such supporters, she built her first theatre at Versailles - at first called \\"Th√©√¢tre de la rue des R√©servoirs\\", but soon renamed \\"Th√©√¢tre Montansier\\" - which she opened on 18 November 1777 in the presence of Louis XVI and his queen. Profiting from the French Revolution, she set herself up in Paris in the company of her lover, Honor√© Bourdon (stage name \\"de Neuville\\"), and took possession of the Th√©√¢tre des Beaujolais under the arcades of the Palais-Royal. After major restoration works, she re-opened it on 12 April 1790 with Les Epoux M√©contents, a four-act opera by Dubuisson and Storace. Renamed \\"Th√©√¢tre Montansier\\", then \\"Th√©√¢tre du P√©ristyle du Jardin Egalit√©\\", then \\"Th√©√¢tre de la Montagne\\", then \\"Vari√©t√©s- Montansier\\" and finally simply \\"Vari√©t√©s\\", she led it until 1806. Still holding the rights from the former court at the Tuileries, she successfully put on Italian operas in French translations, attracting the envy of the Acad√©mie Royale de Musique, exiled to the Porte Saint-Martin.  Com√©diens de la R√©publique fran√ßaise  She and 85 artistes and employees of her theatre followed the armies of Charles Fran√ßois Dumouriez into the Austrian Netherlands, helping at the battle of Jemmapes and then taking over the leadership of the troop at the Th√©√¢tre de la Monnaie in Brussels in January 1793 (renaming that company \\"Com√©diens de la R√©publique fran√ßaise\\"). Returning to Paris in March on the withdrawal of French troops and restoration of the Austrian government, she built \\"Th√©atre-National\\" on rue de la Loi (now square Louvois), opening it on 15 August. Imprisoned by the Terror on 25 Brumaire (15 November) on the pretext of having received funds from the English and from Marie-Antoinette or having wanted to set fire to the neighbouring Biblioth√®que Nationale, the troupe of \\"chanteurs-com√©diens\\" which she had created were merged into that of the \\"Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais\\" on Faubourg Saint-Germain, with their former building passing into the control of the Paris Op√©ra (it would be destroyed in 1820 in reprisals for the assassination of the duc de Berry). Declared innocent, she was freed ten months later and received large sums of money as compensation.  Later life  She married de Neuville on 5 September 1799 and then in 1801 set up a new troupe of Italian singers known as \\"Op√©ra- Buffa\\" (quickly nicknamed \\"Italiens\\"), at Th√©√¢tre Olympique on rue de la Victoire. Nevertheless, the regime change at this time was not favourable to her - the troupe was transferred to the salle Favart in 1802, then placed under the direction of Louis-Beno√Æt Picard in 1804, and in 1803 - when Montansier was in prison several weeks for debt - de Neuville died. Forced to leave the Palais-Royal by decree in 1806 (the neighbouring Com√©diens-Fran√ßais finding that she kept them in the shade) but still infatigable, she convinced Napoleon to authorise her to build a new theatre on the boulevard Montmartre, despite a decree limiting the number of theatres in Paris to just 8. She transferred her Vari√©t√©s there and on 24 June 1807, the Tout-Paris assisted in the first production of the Panorama de Momus, a vaudeville by Marc-Antoine D√©saugiers. She delegated the success - and the criticism - that this brought to the actor Mira Brunet and died peacefully on 13 July 1820 at 90 years old.  Legacy  A four-act comedy entitled La Montansier, with prologue, was put on in tribute to her in 1904 at the Th√©√¢tre de la Ga√Æt√©, written by Robert de Flers and Gaston Arman de Caillavet and directed by R√©jane.

Barber served two terms as a soldier in the Continental Army. At thirty years old, he was ordained a minister of the Episcopal Church at Schenectady, New York.

A visit he made there greatly impressed him, and Miss Allen's change of faith indirectly had much to do with his own conversion. His son, Virgil Horace Barber, who was a minister in charge of an Episcopal academy at Fairfield, near Utica, New York, read John Milner's \\"End of Controversy\\" after a visit to Claremont. This visit resulted in the conversion of both husband and wife in 1817. The following year Virgil returned to Claremont from New York, taking with him Father Charles Ffrench, a Dominican who was officiating there at St. Peter's church. The priest remained a week in Daniel Barber's house preaching and saying Mass, with the result that he had seven converts, including Chloe Barber and her children, Mrs. Noah Tyler, who was Daniel Barber's sister, and her eldest daughter Rosetta. Mrs. Tyler was the mother of William Tyler, first Bishop of Hartford, Connecticut. Her husband and six other children were subsequently converted. Daniel Barber's son and grandson, Vergil and Samuel, eventually entered the Jesuits. Vergil's wife Jerusha joined the Visitation order.

One of the motivations for studying hyper-heuristics is to build systems which can handle classes of problems rather than solving just one problem.E. K. Burke, E. Hart, G. Kendall, J. Newall, P.

Bilgin, E. E. Korkmaz, A Comprehensive Analysis of Hyper-heuristics, Intelligent Data Analysis, 12:1, pp. 3-23, 2008. There might be multiple heuristics from which one can choose for solving a problem, and each heuristic has its own strength and weakness. The idea is to automatically devise algorithms by combining the strength and compensating for the weakness of known heuristics.E. Ozcan, B. Bilgin, E. E. Korkmaz, Hill Climbers and Mutational Heuristics in Hyperheuristics, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, The 9th International Conference on Parallel Problem Solving From Nature, 2006, pp. 202-211. In a typical hyper- heuristic framework there is a high-level methodology and a set of low-level heuristics (either constructive or perturbative heuristics). Given a problem instance, the high-level method selects which low-level heuristic should be applied at any given time, depending upon the current problem state (or search stage) determined by featuresAmaya, I., Ortiz-Bayliss, J.C., Rosales-Perez, A., Gutierrez-Rodriguez, A.E., Conant-Pablos, S.E., Terashima-Marin, H. and Coello, C.A.C., 2018.

Hyper- heuristics versus metaheuristics  The fundamental difference between metaheuristics and hyper-heuristics is that most implementations of metaheuristics search within a search space of problem solutions, whereas hyper-heuristics always search within a search space of heuristics. Thus, when using hyper-heuristics, we are attempting to find the right method or sequence of heuristics in a given situation rather than trying to solve a problem directly. Moreover, we are searching for a generally applicable methodology rather than solving a single problem instance. Hyper-heuristics could be regarded as \\"off-the-peg\\" methods as opposed to \\"made-to-measure\\" metaheuristics. They aim to be generic methods, which should produce solutions of acceptable quality, based on a set of easy-to-implement low-level heuristics.  Motivation  Despite the significant progress in building search methodologies for a wide variety of application areas so far, such approaches still require specialists to integrate their expertise in a given problem domain. Many researchers from computer science, artificial intelligence and operational research have already acknowledged the need for developing automated systems to replace the role of a human expert in such situations. One of the main ideas for automating the design of heuristics requires the incorporation of machine learning mechanisms into algorithms to adaptively guide the search. Both learning and adaptation processes can be realised on-line or off-line, and be based on constructive or perturbative heuristics. A hyper-heuristic usually aims at reducing the amount of domain knowledge in the search methodology. The resulting approach should be cheap and fast to implement, requiring less expertise in either the problem domain or heuristic methods, and (ideally) it would be robust enough to effectively handle a range of problem instances from a variety of domains. The goal is to raise the level of generality of decision support methodology perhaps at the expense of reduced - but still acceptable - solution quality when compared to tailor-made metaheuristic approaches.Burke E.K., Landa Silva J.D., Soubeiga E.: Multi-objective Hyper-heuristic Approaches for Space Allocation and Timetabling, In Meta-heuristics: Progress as Real Problem Solvers, Selected Papers from the 5th Metaheuristics International Conference (MIC 2003), pp 129-158, 2005. In order to reduce the gap between tailor-made schemes and hyperheuristic-based strategies, parallel hyperheuristics have been proposed.C. Segura, G. Miranda and C. Le√≥n: Parallel hyperheuristics for the frequency assignment problem Special issue on nature inspired cooperative strategies for optimization, In Memetic Computing, Special issue on nature inspired cooperative strategies for optimization, ( ), 2010.  Origins  The term \\"hyperheuristics\\" was first coined in a 2000 publication by Cowling and Soubeiga, who used it to describe the idea of \\"heuristics to choose heuristics\\".Cowling P. and Soubeiga E. Neighborhood Structures for Personnel Scheduling: A Summit Meeting Scheduling Problem (abstract), in proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on the Practice and Theory of Automated Timetabling, Burke E.K. and Erben W. (eds), 16-18 Aug 2000, Constance, Germany They used a \\"choice function\\" machine learning approach which trades off exploitation and exploration in choosing the next heuristic to use.Cowling P., Kendall G. and Soubeiga E., A Hyperheuristic Approach to Scheduling a Sales Summit, 2001, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 2079, Springer-Verlag, pp. 176‚Äì190, 2001, , ( Subsequently, Cowling, Soubeiga, Kendall, Han, Ross and other authors investigated and extended this idea in areas such as evolutionary algorithms, and pathological low level heuristics. The first journal article to use the term appeared in 2003.Burke E. K., Kendall G., and Soubeiga E. (2003) A Tabu-Search Hyper-Heuristic for Timetabling and Rostering. Journal of Heuristics, 9(6):451-470. ( ) The origin of the idea (although not the term) can be traced back to the early 1960sH. Fisher and G. L. Thompson, Probabilistic learning combinations of local job-shop scheduling rules, Factory Scheduling Conference (Carnegie Institute of Technology), 1961.* H. Fisher and G. L. Thompson, Probabilistic learning combinations of local job-shop scheduling rules,Industrial Scheduling (New Jersey) (J. F. Muth and G. L. Thompson, eds.), Prentice-Hall, Inc, 1963, pp. 225‚Äì251. and was independently re-discovered and extended several times during the 1990s.R. H. Storer, S. D. Wu, and R. Vaccari, New search spaces for sequencing problems with application to job shop scheduling, Management Science, 38 (10), 1992, 1495‚Äì1509.H. L. Fang, P. Ross, and D. Corne, A promising genetic algorithm approach to job shop scheduling, rescheduling, and open-shop scheduling problems, Fifth International Conference on Genetic Algorithms (San Mateo) (S. Forrest, ed.), Morgan Kaufmann, 1993, pp. 375‚Äì382.U. Dorndorf and E. Pesch, Evolution based learning in a job shop scheduling environment, Computers and Operations Research, 22(1), 1995, 25‚Äì40. In the domain of Job Shop Scheduling, the pioneering work by Fisher and Thompson, hypothesized and experimentally proved, using probabilistic learning, that combining scheduling rules (also known as priority or dispatching rules) was superior than any of the rules taken separately. Although the term was not then in use, this was the first \\"hyper-heuristic\\" paper. Another root inspiring the concept of hyper- heuristics comes from the field of artificial intelligence. More specifically, it comes from work on automated planning systems, and its eventual focus towards the problem of learning control knowledge. The so-called COMPOSER system, developed by Gratch et al.,J. Gratch, S. Chien, and G. DeJong, Learning search control knowledge for deep space network scheduling, Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Machine Learning (Amherst, MA), 1993, pp. 135‚Äì142.J. Gratch and S. Chien, Adaptive problem- solving for large-scale scheduling problems: a case study, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 4, 1996, 365‚Äì396. was used for controlling satellite communication schedules involving a number of earth-orbiting satellites and three ground stations. The system can be characterized as a hill-climbing search in the space of possible control strategies.  Classification of approaches  Hyper-heuristic approaches so far can be classified into two main categories. In the first class, captured by the phrase heuristics to choose heuristics, the hyper-heuristic framework is provided with a set of pre-existing, generally widely known heuristics for solving the target problem. The task is to discover a good sequence of applications of these heuristics (also known as low-level heuristics within the domain of hyper-heuristics) for efficiently solving the problem. At each decision stage, a heuristic is selected through a component called selection mechanism and applied to an incumbent solution. The new solution produced from the application of the selected heuristic is accepted/rejected based on another component called acceptance criterion. Rejection of a solution means it is simply discarded while acceptance leads to the replacement of the incumbent solution. In the second class, heuristics to generate heuristics, the key idea is to \\"evolve new heuristics by making use of the components of known heuristics.\\"M. Bader-El-Den and R. Poli, Generating sat local-search heuristics using a GP hyper-heuristic framework, Artificial Evolution, 8th International Conference, Evolution Artificielle, EA 2007, Tours, France, October 29‚Äì31, 2007, Revised Selected Papers. Lecture Notes in Computer Science 4926 Springer, 2008, pp. 37-49. The process requires, as in the first class of hyper-heuristics, the selection of a suitable set of heuristics known to be useful in solving the target problem. However, instead of supplying these directly to the framework, the heuristics are first decomposed into their basic components. These two main broad types can be further categorised according to whether they are based on constructive or perturbative search. An additional orthogonal classification of hyper-heuristics considers the source providing feedback during the learning process, which can be either one instance (on-line learning) or many instances of the underlying problem studied (off-line learning).  Methodologies to choose heuristics  Discover good combinations of fixed, human-designed, well-known low-level heuristics. * Based on constructive heuristics * Based on perturbative heuristics  Methodologies to generate heuristics  Generate new heuristic methods using basic components of previously existing heuristic methods. * Based on basic components of constructive heuristics * Based on basic components of perturbative heuristics  On-line learning hyper-heuristics  The learning takes place while the algorithm is solving an instance of a problem, therefore, task-dependent local properties can be used by the high- level strategy to determine the appropriate low-level heuristic to apply. Examples of on-line learning approaches within hyper-heuristics are: the use of reinforcement learning for heuristic selection, and generally the use of metaheuristics as high-level search strategies over a search space of heuristics.  Off-line learning hyper-heuristics  The idea is to gather knowledge in form of rules or programs, from a set of training instances, which would hopefully generalise to the process of solving unseen instances. Examples of off-line learning approaches within hyper-heuristics are: learning classifier systems, case-base reasoning and genetic programming. An extended classification of selection hyper-heuristics was provided in 2019Drake J. H, Kheiri A., Ozcan E., Burke E. K., (2019) Recent Advances in Selection Hyper- heuristics. European Journal of Operational Research (accepted to appear). ( ), to provide a more comprehensive categorisation of contemporary selection hyper-heuristic methods.  Applications  Hyper-heuristics have been applied across many different problems. Indeed, one of the motivations of hyper- heuristics is to be able to operate across different problem types. The following list is a non-exhaustive selection of some of the problems and fields in which hyper-heuristics have been explored: * bin packing problem * boolean satisfiability problem * educational timetabling * job shop scheduling * multi-objective problem solving and space allocation * nurse rostering * personnel scheduling * traveling salesman problem * vehicle routing problem * multidimensional knapsack problem * 0-1 knapsack problem * maximum cut problem * quadratic assignment problem * wind farm layout  Related areas  Hyper- heuristics are not the only approach being investigated in the quest for more general and applicable search methodologies. Many researchers from computer science, artificial intelligence and operational research have already acknowledged the need for developing automated systems to replace the role of a human expert in the process of tuning and adapting search methodologies.

These are used in Automated teller machines to ensure that the unencrypted PIN is not stored or transmitted anywhere in the rest of the system and thus cannot be revealed accidentally or through manipulations of the system. Apparatus The apparatus includes a pad, an encrypting circuit that is adjacent the pad and a link coupling the pad and the encrypting circuit. The pad is for entering an identifier, and the circuit for encrypting the entered identifier. The pad may be a physical touch pad such as an N-wire technology touch pad. Alternatively, the pad may be a virtual touch screen. The encrypting circuit may be a CPU along with a memory coupled to the CPU and programmed to encrypt. The CPU and programmed memory may be the first CPU programmable to encrypt the entered identifier, through which the identifier passes. The encrypting circuit may be a micro controller programmed to encrypt. In still another variation, the encrypting circuit may be an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). The apparatus may include a housing that encloses the encrypting circuit and link. The housing would be resistant to access, tampering or tapping. The housing may be at least partially of chip-on-glass technology. The encrypting circuit may be embedded in the housing, as may the link.

The novel tells the story of the rivalry between the powerful Este sisters, Beatrice and Isabella, princesses of the House of Ferrara, as they competed for the attentions of both the Duke of Milan and Leonardo da Vinci when the artist was court painter in the High Renaissance. Also included are excerpts from Leonardo‚Äôs own journals and letters, which reflect the contents of each chapter. The Washington Post praised Essex‚Äô portrayal of Leonardo. ‚ÄúLeonardo's character is one of the great surprises of this book, and in portraying him the author never seems to engage in post-Dan Brown opportunism. The reader may be constantly reminded of Leonardo's genius, but he is an understated figure, a brilliant but disorganized mind whose twitchy intelligence makes him interested in starting countless projects but able to finish few. One of the pleasures of reading this book is learning the secret history behind paintings like The Last Supper and The Virgin of the Rocks.The Washington Post, March 12, 2006, Page BW05.

It is the process of bending/folding the flange of the outer panel over the inner one. The accuracy of the operation significantly affects the appearance of the car‚Äôs outer surfaces and is therefore a critical factor in the final quality of a finished vehicle. Hemming processes Press hemming Hemming presses are widely used in automotive manufacturing for hemming of sheet-metal body components. The process uses traditional hydraulically operated ‚Äòstamping presses‚Äô to hem closure parts, and, being the last forming process in stamping, it largely determines the external quality of such automotive parts as doors, hood and trunk lid. =Hemming press features and benefits= * Die storage systems * Fully automatic die-changing systems with parameters that change with each die * Pressing capacity typically 60 to 180 tons * Large panel-size capacity * More than one part can be produced on same line * Electric hemmers do not need hydraulic oil, are quiet and eco-friendly =Hemming press limitations= * Restricted to flat, uncomplicated panel profiles * High cost Table top hemming Tabletop hemming machines are utilised for the manufacture of medium to high production volumes, with the ability to achieve cycle times as low as 15 seconds. =Table top features and benefits= * Optimum panel quality guaranteed through the hemming principle of the closed ring =Table top limitations= * Dedicated to one panel * Relatively high cost * Cost lower than press hem, but higher than robot roller hem Robot (roller hemming) Robot hemming is utilized for the manufacture of Low to medium production volumes. It uses a standard industrial robot integrated with a roller hemming head to provide a flexible method for forming closures. The flange of the outer panel is bent over the inner panel in progressive steps, by means of a roller-hemming head. One advantage of this process is that it can use the robot-controlled hemming head to hem several different components within a single cell. Another is that minor changes or fluctuations in panel-hemming conditions can be quickly and cost-effectively accommodated. If equipped with a tool-changing system, the robot could serve a variety of additional functions within the same assembly cell, such as operating dispensing equipment for adhesives and sealants, or carrying out panel manipulations, using a gripper unit. =Robot hemming features and benefits= * The ideal solution for all volume production demands, via multiple robots and split operations * Overall quality better than press or tabletop with MBE hemming technologies implemented * Flexibility: ** Robot can hem various panel shapes that press and tabletop can't achieve due to flange attack angles and physical accessibility ** Can perform panel shape changes via quick program changes, while saving the original programs for future recall ** Can perform other tasks by changing the hemming tool with another tool such as a dispensing nozzle * Low cost, simple and quiet in operation when used with standard industrial robot * Reduced mechanical effort for tryout See also * Hemming and seaming * Sheet metal bending References Category:Automotive engineering ","title":"Automotive hemming"},{"id":"17667732","text":"Dianne Odell (February 13, 1947 - May 28, 2008) was a Tennessee woman who spent most of her life in an iron lung. She contracted \\"bulbo-spinal\\" polio at age 3 in 1950 and was confined to an iron lung for the rest of her life. Due to a spinal deformity caused by the polio, she was unable to change to a portable breathing device introduced in the late 1950s. Odell's condition was not as severe in youth and she could spend short periods outside the machine until her 20s, from then on she needed to be in it 24 hours a day. Caregivers could still slide Odell's bedding out of her iron lung for basic nursing care but only briefly. Odell was one of the longest time users of an iron lung, being confined to it for nearly 60 years. By 2018, only 3 people in the United States still rely on iron lungs. Odell's iron lung, which was seven feet long and weighed 750 pounds, produced positive and negative pressures that forced air into her lungs and then expelled it. She lay on her back with only her head exposed and made eye contact with visitors through an angled mirror. She was able to operate a television set with a small blow tube. She was cared for by her parents, other family members and aides provided by a nonprofit foundation. Odell had many successes in her life despite her condition. Although she could not attend high school, she completed her studies by having her classmates or teachers bring school assignments to her home, where she would read the answers into a Dictaphone or have friends or family transcribe them. She also learned to write with her toes. She graduated from high school in 1965 and subsequently took long-distance classes from Freed-Hardeman University. Although she was unable to earn a degree, she received an honorary degree in 1987. In 1992, Odell was profiled in Woman's World magazine and received the Paul Harris Fellow Award from the Jackson Rotary Club, one of the club's highest honors. In 1991, Odell began writing a children's book using a voice activated computer, even though it took 10 years to accomplish. Published in 2001, about 5,000 copies of the book, Blinky, Less Light, have been sold. Shortly after the book was published, Dianne met former Vice President Al Gore at a Christmas Gala in her honor. This book was briefly mentioned by actress Jane Seymour in her 2004 work Remarkable Changes: Turning Life's Challenges into Opportunities. Dianne first met Seymour in 2003 who also introduced her to Christopher Reeve. Despite her condition, friends say that Odell accepted her life with grace. In a 1994 interview with the Associated Press, she stated that \\"I've had a very good life, filled with love and family and faith. You can make life good or you can make it bad.\\" In a 2001 interview with The Associated Press, Odell said she wrote her children's book to show youngsters, especially those with physical disabilities, that they should never give up. \\"It's amazing what you can accomplish if you see someone do the same thing,\\" she said. Her medical costs were approximately $60,000 per year. However, her family refused to institutionalize her. To help the family, the West Tennessee Healthcare Foundation and the Campbell Street Church of Christ established the Dianne Odell Fund. In 2001, a website was set up to provide users with a brief biography of Odell and a way to donate money or services to help with her care. A number of fundraisers, some featuring celebrities, were also held to raise money to allow her to remain at home. On February 17, 2007 (the Saturday following her 60th birthday), she was temporarily moved to The New Southern Hotel in Jackson, for celebrations attended by approximately 200 guests and with a nine-foot birthday cake. She also received letters from well-wishes from people all over the country. That same month, a German film crew visited Dianne to do a story about her life. Odell's life was threatened by power outages in 1957 and 1974 which disabled her respirator. However, she survived with the help of her family who hand- pumped the respirator until power was restored. In 1995, the Tennessee Valley Authority provided the Odell family with a generator large enough to power the house, in case of future power outages. Odell died on May 28, 2008 at age 61. A power failure and the failure of an emergency generator cut off her breathing device's functions. Family members attempted to use the emergency hand pump attached to the iron lung to keep her breathing, but their efforts were unsuccessful.

Life Irish by descent, he was educated at Sedgley Park School. At the age of eighteen he proceeded to Oscott - that is \\"Old Oscott\\", now known as Maryvale - to study for the priesthood. The president at that time was Henry Weedall, under whose supervision the new college buildings were about to be erected. The students and professors migrated there in 1838, after the summer vacation, Flanagan being thus one of the original students at the new college.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 19 January 2019 In 1847 Flanagan brought out his first book, a small manual of British and Irish history, containing numerous statistical tables. The same year he became prefect of studies and acted successfully in that capacity until 1850, when he was appointed vice-president and then president of Sedgley Park School, and he became one of the first canons of the newly formed Birmingham Diocese in 1851. He resumed his former position at Oscott first in 1853 and again for an 18-month period beginning in 1858. The last years of his life were spent as assistant priest at St. Chad's Cathedral, Birmingham. He died at Kidderminster. Works His chief work was a History of the Church in England. In order to allow him more leisure for this, he was appointed chaplain to the Hornyold family at Blackmore Park in Worcestershire, and his history appeared in two volumes, during his residence there, in 1857. It was at that time the only complete work on the Roman Catholic Church in England, continued down to his times, and, though marred by some inaccuracies, it showed work and research on the part of the author. His style, however, was somewhat concise, and Bishop William Ullathorne remarked that Canon Flanagan was a compiler of history rather than a vivid historian.

The design of this was done by a consultant Thomas Ashcroft (known as Tim) with the brief of producing \\"Britain's finest 1100 cc engine\\". The engine was originally intended to be cast in light alloy but to save cost it was eventually made in cast iron using the original patterns making it rather heavy. It did, however, produce at 5400 rpm, a very good output for the time. Production of the engine was sub- contracted to Coventry Climax. The chassis was designed by Charles King and consisted of steel sections bolted together. The engine was connected to a four-speed preselector gearbox with right-hand change lever and the Girling system rod operated brakes had large drums. Half-elliptic springs provided the suspension controlled by friction dampers.

Polk directed the Navy's collection of historic flags be sent to the new Naval School at Annapolis for care and display, establishing one of the museum's oldest collections. After the Civil War, the Navy Department began forwarding many types of objects to the Naval Academy Lyceum, including trophies of war, items from exploration/survey expeditions, diplomatic missions, and naval related art. The Lyceum also became the repository for the collections of the U. S. Naval Lyceum at the New York Navy Yard in 1892, and received an extensive collection from the Boston Naval Library and Institute in 1922, significantly growing the collection. The Naval Academy Lyceum of the 19th and early 20th centuries was located in several places around the Naval Academy Yard, before the construction of Preble Hall in 1939. From 2007‚Äì2008, Preble Hall underwent a complete renovation to turn the building into a modern museum, which officially reopened in the summer of 2009. Collection The collection reflects much of American naval history and partly the naval forces of other countries. That includes thousands of two- and three-dimensional objects such as flags, uniforms, weapons, medals, books, instruments and photographs as well as art. Major collections are The Rogers Ship Model Collection, the Naval Academy Art Collection (including c. 1,200 paintings), the Malcolm Storer Naval Medals Collection (including ancient coins) and The Beverley R.

He was given the name 'Chufty' by his friends at University, due to Ashby's frequency of using the term \\"chuffed\\". Ashby picked up poker at his local tennis club, as well as playing for pennies with his father. In the mid nineties, he played his first tournament, a ¬£10 Stud tournament. A few years later, he earned entry into the Aussie Millions. After he bust from the first tournament, he put his entire $4,000 bankroll on the line in a cash game and spun it up to $100,000. By the end of the week, he had lost it all. Ashby's first recorded win came at the 2001 Grosvenor UK Open in Luton when he won ¬£10,500 in the ¬£100 Pot Limit Seven Card Stud Event. Since then, he's accrued over half a million dollars in live tournament winnings including final table finishes at the 2007 Manchester GUKPT and the 2009 Aussie Millions, the latter of which earned him A$150,000 for his seventh-place finish. However, Ashby openly admits that he needs to work on his live game, and is much better known as an online player, in particular on Black Belt Poker where was recently acquired as one of their sponsored pros in September 2010. Ashby can often been seeing playing on the site in some of the highest stakes available, and against many of the biggest names in poker. Ashby's favoured game is Omaha and he is good friends with fellow Omaha specialist Ben Grundy. For a while, they played in the same games but eventually realised that it was a pointless exercise and decided to avoid each other from there on in. In addition to Grundy, Ashby considers France's David Benyamine to be the best Omaha player in Europe, although he cites Phil Ivey as the only player he would consider sitting out against. In July 2009, Ashby emerged as online poker's biggest cash winner when he earned a total of $1,824,074 over the four-week period. This success garnered him much interest, in particular on the Two Plus Two forums where the nosebleed stakes are avidly followed. On 13 June 2010 Ashby won the World Series of Poker Event #21, a $1,500 seven card stud event, winning $140,467 in the process. He followed that success less than two weeks later by finishing 2nd in World Series of Poker Event #43, the $10,000 H.O.R.S.E. World Championship, netting him $378,027 in winnings. On 24 September 2010 Ashby won Event #54 of the World Championship Of Online Poker, the $2,100 Pot Limit Omaha 6-max event. He was successful out of a field of 480 players, collecting his first WCOOP bracelet along with $185,760 in winnings.

Currently based at St. Margaret's Hospital in Epping it broadcasts two radio services to five different units within the West Essex Primary Care Trust and the North Essex Mental Health Partnership Trust. Radio Forest is a member of the Hospital Broadcasting Association and is run by a team of unpaid volunteers. Forest One broadcasts 24 hours a day to everyone at St. Margaret's Hospital and the Derwent Centre and is aimed at a younger audience. Playing only the biggest songs from the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s (decade) together with today's new music. Classic Hits Forest Gold was launched in 2002 and caters for the older audience at St. Margaret's, Brentwood Community Hospital and Saffron Walden Community Hospital. Forest Gold broadcasts 24 hours a day the best music from the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s with specialist music shows playing, country, classical and showtunes. History Radio Forest (originally known as 'Forest Radio') was established in November 1976, the brainchild of local estate agent Heather Thirtle, providing music and entertainment to the patients and staff of the Forest Hospital in Buckhurst Hill, Essex. A small team of eight people including co founder Nick Churchill, Noel Carter, Christopher Potter and Kenneth Warriner, built studios and equipment and got the station on air. In 1978 Stuart McDonald became the first elected Chairman and registered Radio Forest as a charity \\"to relieve sickness through entertainment\\"! By 1980 the organisation had grown with 30 people providing a radio service six nights a week. The studios expanded and moved to St. Margaret‚Äôs Hospital, Epping in 1980 but continued to broadcast to the Forest Hospital via a landline until it eventually closed. By the mid 1980s over 40 volunteers were broadcasting, ward visiting and raising funds seven days a week. Radio Forest continued to expand and in 1990 opened its third on air studio. Further new equipment enabled the station to provide recorded music and information overnight. In 1996 Radio Forest was granted a license by the Radio Authority (later Ofcom), to broadcast on FM for 28 days to the Epping Forest area over the Christmas period. The public response was incredible, enabling the station to compete commercially with other local stations and raise much needed funds. A move within St. Margaret's Hospital in 1999 meant the building of a new studio and the embracing of modern digital technology. Radio Forest was once again a pioneer by developing its own digital sustaining service, with the ability to provide a true 24-hour service including local and national news. In 2002 Radio Forest opened a dedicated Production Area allowing more flexible programming, audio production and volunteer training. In November 2002 Radio Forest launched its second radio service 'Classic Hits Forest Gold'. Broadcasting a non stop mix of hits form the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. 'Classic Hits Forest Gold' proved to be a popular addition to the St. Margaret's Hospital airwaves. In 2003 'Classic Hits Forest Gold' launched at Ongar War memorial Community Hospital, in Essex, via a radio link and in 2005 Radio Forest was also able to provide 'Classic Hits Forest Gold' to Plane, Poplar and Orchard wards at St. Margaret's Hospital. A complete refurbishment of the audio distribution system at St. Margaret's Hospital was completed in 2006, replacing the original system first installed during the 1950s. In 2007 a brand new hospital on the St. Margaret's site was completed and Radio Forest installed speakers and bedside audio facilities to the four new ward areas, allowing a choice of listening including 'Radio Forest FM' and 'Classic Hits Forest Gold'. A new on-air studio was also completed and the original studio dating from 1999 was re-furbished, allowing for more live programmes on both radio services. In 2008 Radio Forest Community Broadcasting expanded its service to the Derwent Centre in Harlow and 'Radio Forest FM' was renamed 'Forest One'. Ongar War Memorial Hospital closed in October 2008 but \\"Classic Hits Forest Gold\\" was extended to Saffron Walden Community Hospital instead just as the hospital completed a 2 million pound refurbishment. In 2009 The Spencer Close Unit (within the grounds of St. Margaret's Hospital) was closed and some of the patients transferred to a new home in Epping. Forest One followed them to their new accommodation and continues to provide a service for them. In 2010 Brentwood Community Hospital became the latest hospital to have \\"Classic Hits Forest Gold\\" installed in all its public areas and wards. This project was part funded by the Brentwood Community Hospital League of Friends. In 2012 \\"Classic Hits Forest Gold\\" celebrated its 10th birthday and was launched as an online internet radio station (www.forestgold.org.uk) while at the same time maintaining its core hospital radio ethos.

She is the model of Madame Verdurin in Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. Life Born into a wealthy Jewish family as a banker's daughter, she married Albert Arman. Arman's mother's maiden name was Caillavet and so they called themselves Arman de Caillavet. They had one child, the playwright Gaston Arman de Caillavet. Neither of them was faithful to the other, though they never divorced. Beautiful in her youth, with clear blue eyes, black hair, and a mocking mouth, she was intelligent, cultivated and spoke four languages. She often attended the salons of Lydie Aubernon and it was there that she met Anatole France, in 1883. From 1888 there followed years of a passionate, exclusive liaison between the pair, often all the stormier for the jealousy of both parties. She inspired his Tha√Øs (1890) and Le Lys rouge (1894). Salon Mme de Caillavet started her own salon \\"...a Jewish friend, Mme. Caillavet.. gave [Anatole France] a salon in her house...and she probably had a good deal to do with his championship of Dreyfus, which contributed to bring about the retrial and pardon of 1899.\\" Edmund Wilson, To the Finland Station, p. 57 in the h√¥tel particulier at 12 avenue Hoche, near the Place de l'√âtoile.

He was known as Uncle James, saying Mass as often as the opportunity of time, place, and company gave leave. He was eventually arrested by the Earl of Derby about midnight 19 November 1585, at the house of a very poor man, eight miles from the earl's seat, Newpark, in the Parish of Ormskirk, Lancashire. As he would not commit himself to the royal supremacy, though he acknowledged the queen as temporal sovereign, and as he confessed that he regarded her ecclesiastical policy as contrary to God's law and refused to give up saying Mass, he was committed to the New Fleet, Manchester.

Considered one of the most important Chinese artists in the latter half of the 20th century, he was also an influential professor at the Central Academy of Fine Arts where he taught a generation of Chinese artists. Although trained in Western oil painting, he was known for his traditional literati paintings with influences from Qi Baishi and Huang Binhong, two renowned masters in Chinese painting. Li's paintings are highly valued at auctions, with several fetching hundreds of millions of yuan. His personal auction record was set by Thousands of Hills in a Crimsoned View (also translated as Landscape in Red), one of his most celebrated works, which sold for (US$46 million) in June 2012. Biography Former Residence of Li Keran in Xuzhou Li was born Li Yongshun () on 26 March 1907 in Xuzhou, Jiangsu province; his parents were illiterate. He showed a talent in art from an early age, and studied painting from Qian Shizhi, a local painter. He enrolled in Shanghai Art Academy in 1923. After graduating in 1925, he returned to Xuzhou and worked as a teacher. In 1929, Li entered National Academy of Arts in Hangzhou for graduate studies in Western art. There, he studied oil painting under the president Lin Fengmian and the French professor Andr√© Claudot. In 1931, he joined the Eighteen Art Society (or Yiba Art Society, ‰∏ÄÂÖ´Ëâ∫Á§æ), which was closed by the government for its leftism. Since the postgraduate school of the academy was defunct, he had to leave, along with other members, in the next year. He went back and taught in Xuzhou again. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Li worked for the Nationalist government, creating many anti-Japanese posters and murals for war propaganda. He became a lecturer in Chinese painting at the National Academy of Arts exiled in Chongqing, in 1943. His talent was appreciated by Xu Beihong, who invited him to teach at the National Peping Academy of Arts in 1946. He was mentored by the renowned traditional artists Qi Baishi and Huang Binhong at the academy. In 1954, Li, Zhang Ding and Luo Ming teamed up for a three-months tour in the lower Yangzte, created some landscape paintings on-site. Li had another longer tour among southern China since the summer of 1956, he finished more paintings meantime which are significant for the contemporary Chinese paintings. The works illustrating Mao Zedong's poems had been mainstream in mainland China since the 1950s, Liupanshan was Li's first step into that, and his style changed afterward. His celebrated painting, Wan Shan Hong Bian (‰∏áÂ±±Á∫¢ÈÅç, Thousands of Hills in a Crimsoned View, also translated as Landscape in Red),The title from a verse of Mao Zedong's Changsha, to the tune of Qin Yuan Chun (Ê≤ÅÂõ≠Êò•¬∑ÈïøÊ≤ô) has several translation versions, in Xu Yuanchong's, is \\"Hill on Hill All in Red, And Wood on Wood in a deep dye\\" which influenced many Chinese landscape painters, was completed in 1964. During the Cultural Revolution, Li was severely criticized for his signature style, the black landscape paintings. After the end of the revolution, he resumed painting and was appointed as the first president of China National Academy of Painting in 1979. In later life Li had many followers, who formed the \\"Li School\\" of the 1980s. Li innovated Chinese landscape painting by integrating native and western techniques, inasmuch as he was inspired by Rembrandt's chiaroscuro. By introducing shadowing, he developed \\"backlighting landscape\\". Besides, he also advocates the practice of sketching or painting from nature on-site. Li is also noted for the enlivened water buffaloes in his paintings. His calligraphy is deemed to be distinctive, and he is also a competent huqin player.  Art market  Li Keran is one of the most valued Chinese artists in art market. In May 2012, his painting Shaoshan, which depicts Mao Zedong's former residence in Shaoshan, was sold by China Guardian Auction for , breaking his previous record of 107 million set by the painting Long March. Wan Shan Hong Bian (Thousands of Hills in a Crimsoned View, or Landscape in Red), Li's 1964 masterpiece inspired by Mao's famous poem \\"Changsha\\", was sold at Poly Auction in June 2012 for a personal record price of (US$46 million). It was the largest of seven versions Li painted between 1961 and 1964. In 2015, the smallest version of the seven was sold by China Guardian for . The painting had been acquired for just 80 yuan forty years earlier by Beijing's Rong Bao Zhai, which sold it in 2000 for 5 million yuan. In October 2017, Li's Magnificent Mountains With Gushy Cascades was sold at Sotheby's Hong Kong auction for HK$122 million (US$15.6 million).  Personal life  Li married Su E in 1931, and they had four children. After Su died in 1938, he remarried sculptor Zou Peizhu in 1944. They had another three children.

It took place at the Jack Harris Vaudeville Saloon and Theater in San Antonio, Texas. The ambush was in revenge for Ben Thompson's shooting of Jack Harris two years earlier. Background King Fisher and Ben Thompson were both noted gunmen of the Old West. Thompson had killed several men by 1884, including the 1882 death of popular theater owner Jack Harris in San Antonio. That shooting had been ruled self defense. Thompson had been appointed Chief of Police for the city of Austin, Texas, a job in which he had been extremely successful, and for which he was extremely popular in Austin. Thompson had only recently left that job, resigning after being cleared on the Harris shooting. King Fisher, a noted gunman in his own right with several killings to his credit also, was a good friend to Thompson, and by 1884 Fisher had settled into a more peaceful life with his family near Leakey, Texas, where he had become a successful rancher. Fisher had recently left the office of sheriff for Uvalde County, Texas, and on March 11, 1884, was in San Antonio on business. Theater owner Jack Harris had been the leader of San Antonio's \\"sporting crowd\\". Originally from Ireland, Harris emigrated to Connecticut, then moved from there to Texas. He had previously worked for the San Antonio Police Department, and had served during the Civil War in the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, Harris may have served Emperor Maximilian during the Franco- Mexican War, but although it has been claimed, that was never confirmed. In 1868 Harris rejoined the police force, and bought a small saloon with a partner, selling his portion in 1872. With his profits he opened his own saloon, first calling it the Jack Harris Bar and Billiard Room, but then changing the name to the Vaudeville Variety Theater. It quickly became the most popular place in San Antonio and helped anchor what would become known as the Sporting District, the city's red-light district. Harris knew gunman Ben Thompson from their service in the army. In 1880, Thompson spent some time at the Vaudeville, gambling heavily alongside Harris' partner, Joe Foster, and with Thompson losing. Thompson left in what was referred to as a \\"bad mood\\", and although it was reported he made threats, that has never been substantiated. Thompson returned to Austin, where in addition to being Chief of Police, he owned the Iron Front Saloon. Harris and Foster sent word to Thompson that he was no longer welcome in their establishment. Had Harris simply told Thompson that, rather than vocally expressing that Thompson was not welcome in his business in public, the matter would have likely stopped there. However, upon receiving word that Harris was telling many people that he told Thompson he wasn't welcome and he wasn't to return, Thompson simply returned on July 11, 1882. Vaudeville Variety Theater manager Billy Simms met Thompson on the street, and tried to persuade him to avoid the Vaudeville, but was unsuccessful. Thompson entered, and approached the bartender, and told him to pass word to both Foster and Harris that he intended to \\"close this damn whorehouse\\". Although it can be taken different ways, he likely meant that he intended to stay all night there, rather than meaning it literally. Thompson had a drink with jeweler Leon Rouvant, then departed. Meanwhile, Billy Simms went upstairs and put on his guns and warned Harris, who then went and obtained a shotgun, after which he placed himself behind a screen in view of the front door, where he waited for Thompson for at least ten minutes. This would be the second mistake Harris would make in the matter. Thompson had gone outside, visiting with people on the street that he knew. Thompson returned, not actually entering but rather standing just outside the doorway, and saw Harris with the shotgun, but at first said nothing. After a few minutes, with Harris still watching Thompson, the latter finally said \\"What are you going to do with that shotgun you damned son of a bitch\\", to which Harris replied \\"You kiss my ass you son of a bitch\\". Within seconds, two shots rang out. At least one witness would later state that after the verbal exchange, it was one or two minutes later that the shots were fired, but in fact it was only a matter of a couple of seconds at the most. According to some witnesses, Thompson had seen Harris, but did not initially enter the saloon. Instead, he waited, watched, allowed two ladies to enter by holding the doors for them, then passed the before mentioned verbal exchange, after which the two shots were fired almost immediately. Harris staggered, having not discharged his shotgun, made it upstairs, then collapsed. A doctor was summoned, to which Harris is alleged to have said \\"He took advantage of me and shot me from the dark\\". However, this in fact was not exactly true. Although Harris never fired, he was armed openly, and the area was lighted, Thompson was in fact standing just outside the doorway, which was darkened, but Harris' stance of producing and brandishing the shotgun placed Harris at a distinct disadvantage, as it was an easy case for self-defense on the part of Thompson. Further, although Thompson was standing in a more darkened area than Harris, there was nothing to suggest it was a planned point from which to fire, it simply was, in fact, where he happened to be standing. Thompson returned to his hotel room at the Menger Hotel, where he remained the rest of the night without being approached by police. The following morning he surrendered himself to Bexar County, Texas Sheriff Thomas P. McCall and San Antonio Police Chief Shariden. A written battle of words began between two newspapers, the San Antonio Light and the Austin Statesman, one screaming for justice against Thompson, the other defending him. Newspapers from across the state editorialized and followed suit, some pro-Thompson, others con. Many citizens in San Antonio felt the town was better off without Harris, while others denounced Thompson as a murderer. An indictment was handed down on September 6, 1882, and although a change of venue was considered, by that time sentiment was leaning in Thompson's favor, so the case was tried in San Antonio. In the subsequent trial that followed, Thompson was acquitted on January 30, 1883. This caused ill will from many of the citizens of San Antonio, especially those who were close friends to Harris. Friends to Thompson cheered outside the courtroom when the verdict was announced, and upon his return to Austin he was met by a large crowd of supporters. Ambush On March 11, 1884, while in San Antonio on business, Fisher came into contact with his old friend Ben Thompson, also visiting town on business. Thompson was still very unpopular in San Antonio after the death of Harris. A feud over that killing had been brewing since between Thompson and friends of Harris, to include Joe Foster. King Fisher would, ironically, become a victim in a situation in which he played no part whatsoever, short of being present on that day. Fisher and Thompson attended a play on March 11 at the Turner Hall Opera House, and later, at around 10:30pm, they went to the Vaudeville Variety Theater. A local lawman named Jacob Coy sat with them. Thompson wanted to see Joe Foster, the theater owner and friend of Harris's who was now partnered with Billy Simms, and who was one of the main people fueling the ongoing feud. Thompson had already spoken to Billy Simms, with whom he'd had a cordial and almost friendly conversation. Despite the feud and the general dislike for Thompson felt by many in San Antonio, both he and Fisher were feared men. Their reputations as gunmen, and their having proven their skills in that trade in many documented events made anyone wishing to face them have second thoughts. It is likely that this was what led to Thompson's enemies deciding on an ambush rather than an armed face to face confrontation. Fisher and Thompson were directed upstairs to meet with Foster. Coy and Simms soon joined them in the theater box. Foster refused to speak with Thompson. Fisher allegedly noticed that something was not right. Simms and Coy stepped aside, and as they did Fisher and Thompson leapt to their feet just as a volley of gunfire erupted from another theater box, with a hail of bullets hitting both Thompson and Fisher. Thompson fell onto his side, and either Coy or Foster ran up to him and shot him in the head with a pistol. Thompson returned fire with two shots, dying almost immediately afterward. Fisher was shot thirteen times, and did fire one round in retaliation, possibly wounding Coy, but that is not confirmed, as Coy may have been shot by one of the attackers. Coy was left crippled for life, and never recovered completely. Foster, in attempting to draw his own pistol at the first of the fight, shot himself in the leg. Foster was carried down the street for medical attention, and his leg was amputated, but he died of blood loss during the operation. The exact description of the events of that night are contradictory, as it was totally dependent on anti-Thompson witnesses, or the attackers themselves. At first, the attackers attempted to claim that Thompson and Foster had argued, and that Thompson had drawn his gun on Foster prompting Foster to draw, which resulted in an open gun battle. That, however, was disproved over time. What is certain is that the two gunmen were ambushed with no prior knowledge of the attack, which put aside any self-defense claims by the attackers. There was a public outcry for a grand jury indictment of those involved, not only from Austin and other parts of Texas, but from many inside San Antonio, who felt the ambush was cowardly. However, no action was ever taken. The San Antonio Police and the prosecutor showed little interest in the case, and eventually it simply went away. Fisher was buried on his ranch. His body was later moved to the Pioneer Cemetery in Uvalde, Texas. Thompson's body was returned to Austin, and his funeral was one of the largest in Austin's history at that time. Thompson was buried at the Oakwood Cemetery in Austin.

His signature is often a painted ring or with the Latinised form of his name, P.Ab.Annulo. Biography De Ring was born either in Leiden, or in Ypres in Flanders, but there is no trace of his birth in the Leiden archives, and the Ypres Archives were destroyed in August 1914.

There are no records in the Leiden Archive on his marriage or children. He appears not to have bought a house there nor wrote a will. What is known is that he became one of the founders a member and of the Guild of St. Luke in 1648,Pieter de Ring in the RKD De Ring died in Leiden and was buried in the Pieterskerk, Leiden on 22 September 1660 and taken to church from a house in the Nonnensteeg. If he had his studio there he probably had a view on the Leiden Academy building. If he lived on the east side of the alley he had a beautiful view on the Hortus Botanicus of Leiden, the work of Clusius. Pieter may have had a brother called Jan de Ringh, who became a citizen of Leiden in 1651. Jan originally came from Ypres, his profession was textile worker, just like his sons Daniel, Benjamin, and Pieter and many of the other Flemish immigrants in Leiden. The members of the Ringh family were specialized workers in serge, camlet or cloth. The painting by Pieter de Ring in the Museum Geelvinck-Hinlopen Huis has a beautiful cloth on the table. He knew how to make it look real. De Ring's early work reveals the influence of Willem Claesz Heda.

Life Originating in Luxemburg, his family emigrated to France and were naturalised as French citizens in the 1920s. He studied engineering in Strasbourg and then in Germany, where he was recruited by the Abwehr in 1928. In 1934 he participated in building works on the Maginot Line and passed on the plans (to which he had access) to the German intelligence services. Unmasked as a spy in 1935, he was condemned in 1936 to 10 years in jail (which he served at the ) and 20 years' exile from France. During the debacle of the Battle of France, hundreds of thousands of prisoners roamed the roads of France. On 14 June, at Bar-sur-Aube, a group of prisoners was evacuated from the central prison at Clairvaux, including Rudy de M√©rode and other spies, who all took advantage of the anarchy to escape and request help from the Germans. In July 1940, he returned to Paris and set himself up at German military intelligence's HQ in the H√¥tel Lutetia. Attached to a supply office at 18 in Paris as a cover, he spied for the Abwehr alongside another SD agent, the Dutchman (called the Baron d'Humi√®res). At first, he gathered intelligence via a team of thirty, under his orders, who he trained himself. Most of them were fugitives from justice, and he used them to gather equipment and buildings. His team requisitioned several apartments and h√¥tels particuliers under the cover of being French or (more often) German policemen. His speciality was bank convoys, of money gathered from different sources or in the form of gold, jewels, art objects or ingots. In 1941, he set himself up at 70 boulevard Maurice-Barr√®s in Neuilly-sur-Seine, but van Houten and de M√©rode separated after a disagreement in 1942. With the aid of the DSK (Devisenschutzkommando) he opened bank vaults, buying gold and silver objects from their owners at a debased price or, if they refused to cooperate, having them deported. If the property belonged to Jews, it was entirely confiscated and the Gestapo had the owner imprisoned and often deported. The \\"gestapo de Neuilly\\" team confiscated over 4 tonnes of gold, and de M√©rode's network accumulated enormous sums of silver and had over 500 people arrested and deported. Escape to Spain At the start of 1944, the Abwehr charged him with secretly setting up an office in Spain. At first setting himself up in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, in mid 1945 he was initially to be found in San Sebasti√°n before reaching Madrid, where he dubbed himself \\"the prince de M√©rode\\". In 1953, he was still living in Spain, now 60 km north of Madrid in a brickyard. He was never brought to justice, and the date of his death remains unknown to this day, though 1970 has been suggested.

The university's leadership, including its first president, Chris Spirou, and most faculty members, reside in Greece. Initial funding for the university came from the Hellenic American Union (HAU), a non- profit Greek association established in 1957 with U.S. government encouragement to promote U.S.-Greek educational and cultural relations, including through English-language teaching and testing.

This series was never produced, and Molly returned as a regular character partway through the short-lived Hunter: The Age of Magic series. Background The Books of Magic To capitalise on the success of The Books of Magic miniseries by Neil Gaiman, Vertigo turned the series into a monthly comic which would continue the story of teenaged magician Tim Hunter. Vertigo chose John Ney Rieber as writer for the series, which debuted with Arcana: The Books of Magic Annual #1 (part of the crossover series The Children's Crusade). Rieber expanded the character of Tim, using his own memories of teenage life to create a realistic picture of a young boy struggling to decide who he is going to be. As counterpoint to Tim's uncertainty Rieber created Molly O'Reilly (a young girl \\"who'd already figured out the best thing you could possibly do with your life was live it\\") to allow the series to explore the magical world and Tim's real life. As the series progressed, Molly proved popular with readers. Rieber (who sometimes found the central character too close to his teenaged self for comfort) created Molly partly as wish-fulfillment: \\"Yes this is the perfect girlfriend, if you could have had a girlfriend like Molly at 13 oh my God\\". His artist for the series, Peter Gross, admitted that this sometimes caused Molly to eclipse Tim as the more-interesting character. This may have been particularly true during the extended Rites of Passage storyline which became Molly's swan song, with its focus on her enforced stay in Faerie ensuring that Tim was absent for entire issues of the comic. When Rieber decided to leave The Books of Magic, he initially asked that the character of Molly be discontinued; he planned to write a story focused more on Molly, detailing how she lost her virginity before she met Tim and the effect that experience had on her. Although this request was later withdrawn, his replacement had already plotted a 25-issue run without her and decided not to include her (except for a one-issue story to give her closure with Tim). Despite this, such was the character's popularity that \\"almost everyone\\" writing to the comic's producers asked if (and when) she would return. The Books of Faerie In 1999, Vertigo announced that Molly would be returning in two projects. The first would be a third volume of The Books of Faerie called Molly's Story, written by the character's creator John Ney Rieber. The four issue mini-series was published at the end of 1999, and established a new status quo (and connection with Faerie) for the character; Vertigo planned to explore this in The Books of Faerie monthly series, with Molly as the central character. The series would be written by Bronwyn Carlton, who wrote two \\"well received\\" (according to Editor Stuart Moore) The Books of Faerie collections, with Linda Medley inking her own pencils. The new series was intended to focus on Molly, Sturm the Troll and the Gyvv (the last two characters introduced in previous The Books of Faerie comics) to tell stories of modern-day Faerie. However, Vertigo reconsidered and decided to reduce the release from a monthly comic to a five- issue mini-series instead. The Books of Faerie: Serpent's Tooth would have shown Molly undertaking \\"a quest to save the faerie realm from ultimate destruction\\" (discovering the true nature of her role as protector of Faerie), with a preview of the series published in The Books of Magic suggesting that the intention was to make Molly a future Queen of Faerie. The mini-series was planned for release in June 2000, before being indefinitely shelved. Final appearances Molly eventually returned in Dylan Horrocks' Hunter: The Age of Magic, initially making brief guest appearances before becoming a supporting character shortly before the series was cancelled by Vertigo after 25 issues. An alternate version of the character appeared in Books of Magick: Life During Wartime, written by Si Spencer and co-plotted by Neil Gaiman. Character history Molly grew up as the only daughter of a large Irish family on a farm in Crossmaglen, constantly having to assert herself against her brothers. She learned detailed, practical knowledge about magic and fairies from her \\"mad\\" paternal grandmother (who had second sight). For example, Molly knew her friend Marya would be able to ride a unicorn to escape an attack from Daniel because she was still a virgin (with her decision not to ride it herself implying that she was not); she also demonstrated knowledge of the danger of accepting gifts or eating Faerie food when she was trapped in the realm. This knowledge was not the only thing she inherited from her grandmother: Molly takes medication to prevent the auditory and visual hallucinations which run in her family. These are a version of her grandmother's \\"sight\\" when she is trapped in Faerie without her medicine. When Molly's father moved the family to London they moved into the Ravensknoll estate, next to Tim Hunter and his parents. She developed a crush on Tim, pestering him at school and eventually claiming him as her boyfriend after helping him accept his father's disfigurement in a fire (although she did not tell Tim, who only found out when their mutual friend Marya announced that Molly's boyfriend was a magician). Tim also had feelings for Molly, and the two began a relationship. Molly is level-headed and tough, standing up to assailants like Daniel (and Tim, when he needs her no-nonsense advice) as she stood up to her brothers. She has deep feelings for Tim; their first kiss transforms a corner of hell into a blossoming field and some mistake her for Tim's Other because of her importance to him, but when she discovers Tim might become abusive she carefully considers her options. When Tim heard her discussing those options with Marya, he ran away from home to protect his loved ones from further harm. Molly was shipped back to her grandmother's farm, and resolved that she owed it to Tim to discuss the situation honestly with him; this meant finding him. With her grandmother's help Molly attracted the attention of the Amadan, hoping to win the fairy gift of her heart's desire: to see Tim. The conversation took an unexpected turn, however, and Molly accidentally challenged the Faerie to a contest to see which was the greatest fool. With the contest due to take place in Faerie, Molly is transported from the real world and left to fend for herself until it can be arranged. She knows that if she eats Faerie food, she will never be able to return home; touching the ground would wither her and eating real food would starve her, so she would be forced to stay in Faerie. Instead, she attempts to grow her own real food; her efforts attract the Faeries' attention, and her stubbornness the ire of Titania. The Queen tricks Molly into eating Faerie food by making her crops grow overnight. The trick backfires, though, as Molly's anger transforms her into \\"the burning girl\\", who cuts a swath of destruction across Faerie. She finds a friend in a horse named Prince, who reveals himself to be Titania and Auberon's son Taik. He is enchanted by Molly and proposes to her, but is also possessed by a demon and attempts to kill her. The Queen's loyal fairy Yarrow helps Molly defeat Taik, and Tim and Molly are reunited. Titania tempers her curse as best she can; Molly's feet will not touch the ground and she will have Faerie food to eat, so she can return to the mundane world with Tim. Molly tells him about her adventures in Faerie, but Tim is more interested in learning magic from his new mentor Zatanna. He fails to notice that her feet no longer touch the ground, and when she discovers that Tim slept with the succubus Leah while Molly was trapped in Faerie her pragmatic nature comes to the fore. Although it breaks her heart, she breaks up with Tim and returns home to her family. For a long time, Molly does not see Tim again; when she thinks she gave him a last chance to talk things through she was really talking to his Other, who convinced her that he was a lost cause. She remains with her family in London and tries to deal with her newfound celebrity; since her feet no longer touch the ground, she has been declared a saint. She finds life a struggle; unable to eat her normal comfort food, she gets over Tim as best she can. When passing a toy shop, Molly finds that Yarrow has been enchanted and sold as a toy; in rescuing her, she travels back to Faerie. The demon Barbatos is capturing the residents of Faerie and transforming them into a new range of toys; in defeating him, Molly is claimed by the magical gemstone Twilight as the new Protector of the Summerland (an \\"ancient obligation, to be worn by a person of honour, wisdom, dignity, wonder and courage\\"). She returns to earth with Titania's curse lifted; now ignored by the media, she appears to be a normal human girl again. Molly leaves London, attends art school in Paris and finds a new boyfriend. Returning to London after graduation, she sees Tim again (denying that any of the strange things which had happened in her life were true). She is forced to admit the truth when she is sucked through a painting into an alternate world with Tim; although the two reconcile their differences, they do not resume their relationship.

Their indigenous language is the Q ºeqchi º language. Before the beginning of the Spanish conquest of Guatemala in the 1520s, Q ºeqchi º settlements were concentrated in what are now the departments of Alta Verapaz and Baja Verapaz. Over the course of the succeeding centuries a series of land displacements, resettlements, persecutions and migrations resulted in a wider dispersal of Q ºeqchi º communities into other regions of Guatemala (Izabal, Pet√©n, El Quich√©), southern Belize (Toledo District), and smaller numbers in southern Mexico (Chiapas, Campeche).See Kahn (2006, pp.34‚Äì49) for an account of Q ºeqchi º migrational history and the impetus behind these movements, and in particular pp.41‚Äì42. While most notably present in northern Alta Verapaz and southern Pet√©n,As indicated by 1998 SIL data, see in Ethnologue (Gordon 2005). contemporary Q ºeqchi º language-speakers are the most widely spread geographically of all Maya peoples in Guatemala.Kahn (2006, p.34)  History  Not much is known about the lives and history of the Q ºeqchi º people prior to being conquered by Spanish conquistadors; however, it is known that they were a Maya group located in the central highlands and northern lowlands of Guatemala. Their land was formally known as Tezulutlan or ‚Äúthe land of war\\" and the Q ºeqchi º people were ruled by a king and had their own laws and government. When the Spanish began their conquest, the Q ºeqchi º were hard to control due to a dispersed population. Bartolom√© de las Casas was given permission to try to convert the Q ºeqchi º people to Christianity, however, only a small portion were converted and the church lost the ability to govern the Q ºeqchi º. This led to the exploitation of the Q ºeqchi º by plantation owners and slavers.Knowlton, Autumn. \\"Q ºeqchi º Mayas and the Myth of ‚ÄúPostconflict‚Äù Guatemala.\\" Latin American Perspectives 44, no. 4 (July 2017): 139-151. Social Sciences Full Text (H.W. Wilson) During the nineteenth century plantation agriculture was a big part of the Q ºeqchi º people's lives. This led to the seizure of the Q ºeqchi º's communal land by plantations and the service of the Q ºeqchi º to farm the plantations. By 1877, all communal landownership was abolished by the government which edged some of the Q ºeqchi º to move to Belize. This seizure of communal land along with the effects of the Spanish Conquest created a long lasting poverty in the Q ºeqchi º people.  Religion and culture   Religion  Traditionally the Q ºeqchi º people believe in the Tzuultaq ºa‚Äù which are the gods of the mountains and valleys. However, they have mixed those beliefs with the beliefs of the Catholic church. The Q ºeqchi º believe in the Christian god and celebrate the saints. They also believe that Tzuultaq ºa º presides over nature and dwells in the caves of the mountains. They also have three specific religious specialists that are from the Tzuultaq ºa º side of their religion. There are the ilonel which are the curers who use different types of herbs and ceremonies. The aj ke who advise and predict things in the village. The last is the aj tul which are believed to be the sorcers who can cast spells. They also believe in similar rituals to those in other Latin American countries like the celebration of the Day of the Dead. They also prefer a ritual to the dead which consists of wrapping the body in a petite which is a straw mat. They are then buried with items they would need for the journey into the afterlife.  Marriage  Marriage in the Q ºeqchi º culture is not so different from the culture of arranged marriages in the Hindu religion. Marriages are arranged by the parents of the children. The parents of both children meet over time and if all goes well the children are married. This happens at the ages of 12 to 15 for the women and 15 to 18 for the males. After that the family would look very similar to the normal family picture; a mother, a father, and a couple of children. When it comes to inheritance parents usually give the property and assets to the child who offers to care for the parents during their life.\\"Q ºeqchi º.\\" Encyclopedia of World Cultures. . Encyclopedia.com. (November 1, 2017). http://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and- maps/qeqchi  Food and agriculture  The agricultural production of the Q ºeqchi º people consists mostly of subsistence farming. This means they only farm for the needs of their families not external markets. At first the Q ºeqchi º were polycultural. The plants they farmed were edible weeds, banana plants, and other companion crops. They also acquire some of their food from wild plants and some villages still hunt. However for most present day Q ºeqchi º people today their food comes from the corn fields. This comes mainly from a time where plantations dominated the Q ºeqchi º society. From the 1880s to around the 1940s the plantation owners forbid the growing of any crops other than corn and beans, so they could easily identify which crops belonged to them. This created a corn-dependent diet of the Q ºeqchi º people. While corn doesn't prove every profitable for the Q ºeqchi º economy or their diet it does have other merits. The Q ºeqchi º use agriculture as a way to commune with God the creator in a very physical and spiritual way. It was a way to feel like a co-creator when planting new life into the soil. All the parts of planting, cultivating, and harvesting are all rituals and worship in their religion.\\"Q ºeqchi º Agriculture.\\" Community Cloud Forest Conservation.

It was first proposed in 2007 to obtain a better display of moving images with, for example, frame rates of 100‚Äì120 Hz to improve the temporal response of LCDs. This operational mode for LCDs also does not require anisotropic alignment layers (e.g., rubbed polyimide) and thus theoretically simplifies the LCD manufacturing process. History Figure 1: Perspective view on a double twisted structure with two helical axes, h1 and h2. The directors perform a rotation of 90¬∞ across the diameter. In Reinitzer's reports from 1888 on the melting behaviour of cholesteryl benzoate, there is a note that the substance briefly turned blue as it changed from clear to cloudy upon cooling. This subtle effect remained unexplored for more than 80 years until experimental results were published during the late 1960s and early 1970s that indicated that the blue color was due to at least two new and very different liquid crystalline phases.Timothy J. Sluckin, David A. Dunmur, Horst Stegemeyer: Crystals That Flow - Classic Papers from the History of Liquid Crystals, Liquid Crystals Series, Taylor & Francis London 2004, For almost 100 years, scientists assumed that the most stable cholesteric helical structure could be described by a single helical axis about which the director rotates. It turned out that in the new structure the director rotates in a helical fashion about any axis perpendicular to a line as illustrated in fig. 1. Although an unlimited number of helical axes are actually present, this structure was named double twist structure. Figure 2: Top view on a double twist cylinder. The plane containing the various helical axes, h, (three of them shown here) is the plane of the figure. The director points out of the plane of the figure in the center and it rotates as you move away from the center. This double twist structure is more stable than the single twist structure (i.e., the normal helical structure of chiral nematics) only up to a certain distance from the line at the center. Since this distance is on the order of the pitch of the chiral nematic liquid crystal (typically 100 nm) and since the geometries of usual liquid crystal samples are much larger, the double twist structure occurs only rarely. Figure 3: Perspective view on the double twist cylinder. The lines on the outside are supposed to indicate a 45¬∞ rotation of the director at that distance from the center line. Blue phases are special cases when double twist structures fill up large volumes. When double twist structures are limited in all directions to the distance from the center line where the twist amounts to 45¬∞ a double twist cylinder results. Because of its small radius, such a cylinder is more stable than the same volume filled with a single twist chiral nematic liquid crystal. Figure 4: Illustration of a cubic lattice formed by double twist cylinders. All angles are supposed to be right angles. A large structure can be composed from these double twist cylinders, but defects occur at the points where the cylinders are in contact as illustrated in fig. 5. These defects occur at regular distances and tend to make the structure less stable, but it is still slightly more stable than the single twist structure without defects, at least within a temperature range of about 1 K below the transition from the chiral nematic phase to an isotropic liquid. The defects that occur at regular distances in three spatial dimensions form a cubic lattice just as we know it from solid crystals. Blue phases are thus formed by a regular three- dimensional lattice of defects within a chiral liquid crystal. Since the spacings between the defects of a blue phase are in the range of the wavelength of light (several hundred nanometers), for certain wavelength ranges of the light reflected from the lattice constructive interference occurs (Bragg reflection) and the blue phase reflects colored light (note that only some of the blue phases actually reflect blue light).Peter J. Collings, Liquid Crystals - Natures Delicate Phase of Matter, Adam Hilger, Bristol, 1990 Figure 5: Disclinations form where the double twist cylinders are in contact. The core of the disclination as it crosses the triangular area is shown as a white dot. Figure 6: Structures of double twisted cylinders in liquid crystal blue phase I (left) and II (right). Wide temperature range blue phases In 2005, researchers from the Centre of Molecular Materials for Photonics and Electronics at the University of Cambridge reported their discovery of a class of blue-phase liquid crystals that remain stable over a range of temperatures as wide as 16-60 ¬∞C. The researchers showed that their ultrastable blue phases could be used to switch the color of the reflected light by applying an electric field to the material, and that this could eventually be used to produce three-color (red, green, and blue) pixels for full-color displays. The new blue phases are made from molecules in which two stiff, rod-like segments are linked by a flexible chain, and are believed to be stabilized due to flexoelectricity. Furthermore, electro-optical switching with response times of the order of 10‚àí4 s for the stabilized blue phases at room temperature has been shown. Blue Phase crystals are regarded as 3D photonic crystals, as they possess a periodic cubic structure in the nanometer range with a selective bandgap in the visible wavelengths. However, standard blue phase crystal manufacturing produces polycrystalline samples, the single crystal size being in the micrometer range. Recently, blue phases obtained as ideal 3D photonic crystals in large volumes have been stabilized with a controlled crystal lattice orientation. Electro-optical switching from monocrystalline blue phases show increased modulation and less scattering than in polycrystalline samples First blue phase LC-display In May, 2008 Samsung Electronics announced that it has developed the world's first Blue Phase LCD panel which can be operated at an unprecedented refresh rate of 240 Hz. Samsung unveiled a 15 inch prototype model of its Blue Phase LCD panel at the SID (Society for Information Display) 2008 international Symposium, Seminar and Exhibition, which was held in Los Angeles from May 18 to 23, 2008.Samsung Develops World's First 'Blue Phase' Technology to Achieve 240 Hz Driving Speed for High-Speed Video (access date 23 April 2009) Developed with a look at cost-efficiency, Samsung's Blue Phase mode does not require liquid crystal alignment layers, unlike today's most widely used TFT LCD modes such as Twisted Nematic (TN), In-Plane Switching (IPS) or Vertical Alignment (VA). The Blue Phase mode can make its own alignment layers, eliminating the need for any mechanical alignment and rubbing processes. This reduces the number of required manufacturing steps, resulting in savings on production costs. Additionally it has been claimed that Blue Phase panels would reduce the sensitivity of the liquid crystal layer to mechanical pressure which could impair the lateral uniformity of display (e.g. luminance, chromaticity). In a blue phase based LC-display for TV applications it is not the selective reflection of light according to the lattice pitch (Bragg reflection) that is used for display of visual information, but an external electric field induces a birefringence in the liquid crystal via the Kerr effect. That field induced birefringence becomes apparent as a change of transmission when the Blue Phase Mode LC layer is placed between crossed polarizers. Response time compensation by voltage overdriving as currently applied in many LCD panels with 120 Hz frame frequency for improvement of the display of moving images in LCD TVs could become obsolete since the Blue Phase mode features a superior response speed (in the range of 10 - 100 microseconds, see ref. 1), allowing images to be reproduced at 240 Hz frame rate or higher without the need for any overdrive circuit. For a detailed discussion of the blue phase LCs in in-plane switching (IPS) structures and related modeling method based on the Kerr effect in a macroscopic scale see references. With an isotropic dark state, blue phase LCDs show many interesting electro-optic performances. Presently, the driving voltage of blue phase LCs in IPS structures is still a little bit too high. To reduce the voltage, material engineering for developing high Kerr constant mixtures is critically important. Moreover, device design is also an effective way. With proper device structure design, the driving voltage can be largely reduced. References Further reading *O.D. Lavrentovich, M.

NAPICU is committed to developing and promoting the specialty of psychiatric intensive care and low secure services. We are dedicated to improving patient experience and outcome, and to promoting staff support and development. We promote research, education and practice development using quarterly meetings and annual conferences, our journal, training initiatives and this website and our social media. Our members are mostly located in the United Kingdom, and become members when working in specific wards or units, which join our association, or as individual mental health professionals from any discipline. We also attract members from outside the UK. The association holds quarterly meetings, academic seminars and an annual national conference. The associations' Executive Committee works with key stakeholders at regional and national levels, to shape policy and practice in the area of acute inpatient psychiatry, including psychiatric intensive care and low secure services. Journal of Psychiatric Intensive Care Since 2005 the association has published the Journal of Psychiatric Intensive Care. This peer-reviewed journal is devoted to issues affecting the care and treatment of people with mental disorders who manifest severely disturbed mental or behavioural functioning. The journal is international and multi-disciplinary in its approach. It serves the interest of people concerned with these topics in PICUs, Low Secure Units, Challenging Behaviour, Emergency Psychiatry, Intensive Treatments or other parts of the wider mental health system. The journal seeks to encourage informed debate and exchange of opinion. The content of the journal includes; editorials, original articles, brief reports, reviews, conference reports, news and notices. Preference is given to original research of scientific quality. NAPICU executive committee The NAPICU executive committee is multi-disciplinary and includes clinicians, managers, service user representatives and carers. The executive meets four times a year to take forward projects, respond to consultation documents and debate wider policy issues. History of NAPICU The creation of NAPICU was driven by the need for standard-setting in Psychiatric Intensive Care Units (PICU) and LS services. NAPICU was formally established in 1996 by Dr Dominic Beer, Dr Stephen Pereira and Carol Paton and began discussion among clinicians regarding standards of care, ethical issues, service specifications and patient profiles within PICU and LS services. The disparity between units of that era was highlighted by a survey published in 1997 . A PICU policy, research and development group was established at the North East London Foundation Trust by Dr Stephen Pereira in 1999. This group conceptualised and initiated a project to develop the National Minimum Standards in psychiatric intensive care and low secure environments given the absence of such national standards in the UK. A multidisciplinary group of clinicians in the field of psychiatric intensive care and low secure care was established and produced clinical standards, which were subsequently adopted by the Department of Health in 2001. The National Minimum Standards in psychiatric intensive care units and low secure environments was launched as a policy implementation guide in 2002. This group also initiated the PICU and low secure practice development network to help units meet with the national standards. The main aim of the 2002 National Minimum Standards was to develop standards of psychiatric intensive care and low secure environments with a multidisciplinary and patient focus. The National Minimum Standards have influenced the successful development of psychiatric intensive care units and low secure environments in a standardised manner across the UK, whilst allowing for local creativity and innovation ultimately leading to high quality care for patients who find themselves in these environments. After a lengthy process of engagement with all stakeholders these standards have now been revised and published in 2014 as the National Minimum Standards for Psychiatric Intensive Care in General Adult Services Updated 2014. Appendix 1 lists the sections contained within the National Minimum Standards of 2014. NAPICU is also now in the process of undertaking another National Survey of PICU and LS care across the UK. The intention is that this will be combined with benchmarking tools to enable local services to assess their own performance against national data. Since 1996 NAPICU has worked to achieve its aims by promoting: the development of PICU and LS services, the clinicians working within these services and most importantly by improving the experience of patients within these services.

Life Hobday was born in Birmingham, the eldest of 4 sons of Samuel Hobday (1746‚Äì1816), a rich Birmingham spoon manufacturer.Stuart Hobday. \\"A brush with history\\" (2007) Showing a capacity for drawing, he was sent to London when still a boy, and articled to an engraver named William Barney, with whom he remained for six years, studying at the same time in the Royal Academy schools. He then established himself in Charles Street, near the Middlesex Hospital, as a painter of miniatures and watercolour portraits, and commenced to exhibit at the Royal Academy in 1794. He was fortunate in soon securing a fashionable clientele, married Elizabeth Ivory (from Worcester), and in 1800 moved to Holles Street, Cavendish Square, where, supported largely by his father, he lived for a short time in a recklessly expensive manner. In 1804 he left London for Bristol, where for some years he was largely employed in painting the portraits of officers embarking for the Peninsular War. Though Hobday earned large sums, he continued to be extravagant and in financial difficulties. In 1817, after the war ended, Hobday returned to the capital, and took a large house in Broad Street, hoping to renew his earlier artistic and social connections. In this he was disappointed even though patronised by N. M. Rothschild, for whom he painted a family group at the price of a thousand guineas.Hobday's paintings in the Rothschild archive In 1821 he moved to 54 Pall Mall, which had large galleries attached to it and, after a disastrous speculative venture in a panoramic exhibition, called the \\"Poecilorama\\" at the Egyptian Hall, opened these galleries for the sale of pictures on commission. Though supported by all the leading English and many French artists, the venture proved a complete failure, and in 1820 Hobday went bankrupt. In 1831, Hobday married Maria Pearce Ustonson (born Maria Pearce in Exeter in 1784). He died on 17 February of that same year. One of Hobday's sons was George Armfield Smith (1808‚Äì1893) who became a celebrated dog painter. His daughter, Harriet Eliza, married English composer Robert Lucas de Pearsall (1795‚Äì1856). Work Throughout his chequered career Hobday was a constant exhibitor at the Royal Academy, frequently contributing even during his residence at Bristol. In 1819 he exhibited there a portrait of the Duke of Sussex. His best work was a picture of Carolus the Hermit of Tong - whereabouts presently unknown. His portrait of Miss Biggs in the character of Cora, and that of Richard Reynolds, the Bristol Quaker philanthropist, were engraved, the latter by William Sharp. He was always well patronised, and obtained good prices for his works, but the quality of his art suffered greatly from his restless and improvident habits. Hobday's more important clients included the pioneer vaccinologist Dr Edward Jenner, King George IV (the portrait last being sold at Christie‚Äôs in 1911) and the Rothschild family. Hobday was also a close friend of fellow artist George Morland, and painted his portrait. Notes ;Attribution Further reading Arnold, M.

History In Kannada, the language of a majority of the inhabitants of the city of Bangalore, Naagarabhaavi means literally \\"a well of snakes\\". It is not conclusively known, however, why it is called so. One school of thought is that the name is due to the high number of snakes present in the area. Also, some believe that it is called a \\"well\\" because of the surrounding hillocks that are no longer present due to urbanization. Nagarbhavi got its prime importance due to the establishment of Institute for Social and Economic Change (ISEC) in 1973. The site was chosen by Late Professor VKRV Rao for ISEC. A road was laid and that changed the culture of Naagarabhaavi, with professors from all over the country coming and settling down in this locality.

The lamp operates on electricity from batteries, charged through the use of solar photovoltaic panel. Solar-powered household lighting can replace other light sources like candles or kerosene lamps. Solar lamps have a lower operating cost than kerosene lamps because renewable energy from the sun is free, unlike fuel. In addition, solar lamps produce no indoor air pollution unlike kerosene lamps. However, solar lamps generally have a higher initial cost, and are weather dependent. Solar lamps for use in rural situations often have the capability of providing a supply of electricity for other devices, such as for charging cell phones. American investors have been working towards developing a RS. 10 / unit solar lantern for replacement of kerosene lamps.  History  Global market-share in terms of annual production by PV technology since 1990 Some solar photovoltaics use Monocrystalline silicon or poly-crystalline silicon panels, while newer technologies have used thin-film solar cells. Since modern solar cells were introduced in 1954 at Bell labs, advances in solar cell efficiency at converting light into electric power, and modern manufacturing techniques combined with efficiencies of scale have led to an international growth of photovoltaics. As of 2016, LED lamps use only about 10% of the energy an incandescent lamp requires. Efficiency in production of LED lamps has led to increased adoption as an alternative to older electric lightings Components The complete structure of a solar lamp is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Solar panels  Most solar panels are made out of single crystalline silicon, a semiconductor material. A solar cell has two different layers of silicon. The lower layer has less electrons and hence has a slight positive charge due to the negative charge nature of electrons. In addition, the upper layer has more electrons and has slightly negative charge. A potential barrier is created between these two layers. When the stream of light particles called photons enter, they give up their energy to the atoms in the silicon. It promotes one electron from a covalent bond to a next energy level from upper layer to the lower layer. This promotion of an electron allows freer movement within the crystal which produces a current. More light shines through, more electrons move around hence more current flows between. This process is called photovoltaic and photoelectric effect. Photovoltaic systems directly convert sunlight into electricity. Solar panels are made out of layers of different materials, as you can see in Figure 2, in order of glass, encapsulate, crystalline cells, encapsulate, back sheet, junction box and lastly frame. The encapsulate keeps out moisture and contaminants which could cause problems. Figure 2  Battery  A battery is usually housed within a metal or plastic case. Inside the case are electrodes including cathodes and anodes where chemical reactions occur. A separator also exists between cathode and anode which stops the electrodes reacting together at the same time as allowing electrical charge to flow freely between the two. Lastly, the collector conducts a charge from the battery to outside. Batteries inside solar lamps usually use gel electrolyte technology with high performance in deep discharging, in order to enable use in extreme ranges of temperature. It may also use lead-acid, nickel metal hydride, nickel cadmium, or lithium. This part of the lamp saves up energy from the solar panel and provides power when needed at night when there is no light energy available. In general, the efficiency of photovoltaic energy conversion is limited for physical reasons. Around 24% of solar radiation of a long wavelength is not absorbed. 33% is heat lost to surroundings, and further losses are of approximately 15-20%. Only 23% is absorbed which means a battery is a crucial part of solar lamp.  Charge controller  This section controls the entire working systems to protect battery charge. It ensures, under any circumstances including extreme weather conditions with large temperature difference, the battery does not overcharge or over discharge and damage the battery even further. This section also includes additional parts such as light controller, time controller, sound, temperature compensation, lighting protection, reverse polarity protection and AC transfer switches which ensure sensitive back-up loads work normally when outage occurs.  Working principles  Figure 3 LED lights are used due to their high luminous efficiency and long life. Under the control of a DC charge controller, non-contact control automatically turns on the light at dark and switches off at daytime. It sometimes also combines with time controllers to set curtain time for it to automatically switch light on and off. As shown in Figure 3, the chip includes microchip(R), B-, B+, S- and S+. S+ and S- are both connected to solar panels with wire, one of which has plus charge and the other minus charge. B- and B+ are attached to two batteries in this case. The light will be shown through the LED light when all of these are connected.  Benefits  Solar lamps can be easier for customers to install and maintain as they do not require an electricity cable. Solar lamps can benefit owners with reduced maintenance cost and costs of electricity bills. Solar lamps can also be used in areas where there is no electrical grid or remote areas that lack a reliable electricity supply. There are many stories of people with lung disease, eye deterioration, burns and sometimes even death simply because they do not have a healthy alternative to light at night. Women have felt unsafe walking to the toilet outside after dark. Babies are being delivered by midwives using only a candle, and students cannot study when the sun goes down for lack of light leading to increased illiteracy and perpetual poverty. These are the realities for over 1 billion people around the globe. Lack of lighting equates to continued poverty felt around the world.https://esperanzamarket.com/blogs/news/93744963-changemakers- spotlight-unite-to-light In solar energy lamp it converts light energy into electrical energy, i.e. It is convenient to our daily life. Solar energy output is limited by weather and can be less effective if it is cloudy, wet, or winter. Households switching to solar lamps from kerosene lamps also gain from health risk associated with kerosene emissions. Kerosene often has negative impacts on human lungs. The use of solar energy minimizes the creation pollution indoors, where kerosene have been linked to cases of health issues. However, photovoltaic panels are made out of silicon and other toxic metals including lead that can be difficult to dispose of. The use of solar lights improves education for students who live in households without electricity. When the nonprofit Unite to Light donated solar-lamps to schools a remote region of Kwa Zulu Natal in South Africa test scores and pass rates improved by over 30%. The light gives students added time to study after dark.Unite To Light https://esperanzamarket.com/blogs/news/93744963-changemakers-spotlight-unite- to-light A 2017 experimental study in unelectrified areas of northern Bangladesh found that the use of solar lanterns decreased total household expenditure, increased children‚Äôs home-study hours and increased school attendance. It did not however improve the children's educational achievement to any large extent.  Uses   Solar street light  These lights provide a convenient and cost-effective way to light streets at night without the need of AC electrical grids for pedestrians and drivers. They may have individual panels for each lamp of a system, or may have a large central solar panel and battery bank to power multiple lamps.Solar LED lantern  Rural  In rural India, solar lamps, commonly called solar lanterns, using either LEDs or CFLs, are being used to replace kerosene lamps, candles and other cheap alternatives of lighting. Especially in areas where electricity is otherwise difficult to access, solar lamps are very useful and it also improves the quality of life.

Keane served as her husband's inspiration and model for the \\"Mommy\\" character in his long running comic strip and was instrumental in restoring the copyrights for The Family Circus to her husband.  Early life Keane was born Thelma Carne in Gympie, Queensland, Australia, in 1926. Her father was a banana farmer. For much of her early childhood, Carne lived in a four-room canvas tent within the borders of the Amamoor Forest Reserve while her father worked on a local reforestation project. She lived with relatives in Gympie while in high school and returned home to her family on the weekends.  Personal life  The Bil and Thelma Keane house located at 5815 E. Joshua Tree Ln. in Paradise Valley Thelma Carne met her future husband, Bil Keane, an American, while working in the United States war bonds office in Brisbane, Australia, during World War II. Bil Keane was a United States Army promotional artist who drew posters and flyers for the war effort. Thelma had been hired as an accounting secretary for the office. Their desks and workstations were next to each other. Cartoonist Bil Keane later spoke of meeting Thelma in the office saying, \\"Thel was a very pretty 18-year-old with a gorgeous figure, long brown hair and I just happened to have a desk drawing next to her and I got the nerve to ask her out. We started laughing then and never stopped.\\" Thelma and Bil were married in 1948. She moved from Australia to her husband's hometown of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and eventually settled in the suburb of Roslyn, Pennsylvania. The couple would have five children between 1949 and 1958. Thelma, her husband and their children moved to Paradise Valley, Arizona in 1959.  The Family Circus  The grave of Bil and Thel Keane in the Holy Redeemer Cemetery in Phoenix, Arizona Bil Keane began drawing The Family Circus comic strip in 1960. He modeled the Mommy in the cartoon on his wife, Thelma. The Mommy character in the comic was even named \\"Thel\\" after his wife's nickname. Bil Keane later told the Associated Press after Thelma's death in 2008, \\"She was the inspiration for all of my success. When the cartoon first appeared, she looked so much like Mommy that if she was in the supermarket pushing her cart around, people would come up to her and say, 'Aren't you the Mommy in 'Family Circus?' And she would admit it.\\" Keane later altered the \\"Mommy\\" character's hair in 1996 because the style had become outdated. Thelma Keane worked as the full-time financial and business manager for her husband while he continued to draw The Family Circus. Her family credited Thelma's business skills as the main reason that Bil Keane became one of the first syndicated newspaper cartoonists in the country to regain the full rights to his comic. She led the 1988 negotiations with King Features Syndicate to return the copyrights for The Family Circus. King Features finally agreed to return the rights to the cartoon to Bil Keane after long and protracted talks with Thelma Keane. as of 2008, the comic strip runs in approximately 1,500 newspapers. Thelma Keane died at the age of 82 at the Barton House assisted living facility in Paradise Valley, Arizona on May 23, 2008. She had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Keane was survived by her husband, Bil Keane, and the couple's five children, Gayle, Neal, Glen, Jeff and Christopher. Her youngest son, Jeff Keane, continued to help his father draw and publish The Family Circus as an assistant inker and colorist, taking the full-time role of being the lead cartoonist after Bil Keane died in 2011.

Course and features The Nymboida River rises in the northern foothills of the Barren Mountain, on the slopes of the Great Dividing Range, within Bellinger River National Park, west of Dorrigo. Annual high rainfall on the Dorrigo Plateau produces strong river flows during most seasons. The river flows in a meandering course generally northeast, joined by nine tributaries including the Little Murray, Bielsdown, Blicks, Little Nymboida, and Boyd rivers, before reaching its confluence with the Mann River, below Mount Gundahl, within the Nymboida National Park. The river descends over its course. Flowing through Nymboi-Binderay National Park from Platypus Flat to The Junction confluence with the Little Nymboida River, there is a section of rapid and pool sequences, making this a popular kayaking and white water rafting venue. Located from the source is Rob Roys Falls, a cascade while further down river lies The Silent Pool, a geological mystery where the river goes underground via a fault line and returns under a large pool. The river is also a stronghold for the endangered Eastern Freshwater cod where it is quite common in several reaches. Until 2012 waters released from the hydro-electric power station on the Nymboida River created one of Australia‚Äôs most difficult canoe courses and as such was the site of many kayaking and canoeing competitions.

Since the area A may be small while the length l is large, when C looks elongated, the relationship can only take the form of an inequality. What is more, such an inequality would be an upper bound for A: there is no interesting lower bound just in terms of the length. Mikhail Gromov once voiced the opinion that the isoperimetric inequality was known already to the Ancient Greeks. The mythological tale of Dido, Queen of Carthage shows that problems about making a maximum area for a given perimeter were posed in a natural way, in past eras. The relation between length and area is closely related to the physical phenomenon known as surface tension, which gives a visible form to the comparable relation between surface area and volume. The familiar shapes of drops of water express minima of surface area. Room with a pillar The purpose of this article is to explain another such relation between length and area. A space is called simply connected if every loop in the space can be contracted to a point in a continuous fashion. For example, a room with a pillar in the middle, connecting floor to ceiling, is not simply connected. In geometry, a systole is a distance which is characteristic of a compact metric space which is not simply connected. It is the length of a shortest loop in the space that cannot be contracted to a point in the space. In the room example, absent other features, the systole would be the circumference of the pillar. Systolic geometry gives lower bounds for various attributes of the space in terms of its systole. It is known that the Fubini‚ÄìStudy metric is the natural metric for the geometrisation of quantum mechanics. In an intriguing connection to global geometric phenomena, it turns out that the Fubini‚ÄìStudy metric can be characterized as the boundary case of equality in Gromov's inequality for complex projective space, involving an area quantity called the 2-systole, pointing to a possible connection to quantum mechanical phenomena. In the following, these systolic inequalities will be compared to the classical isoperimetric inequalities, which can in turn be motivated by physical phenomena observed in the behavior of a water drop. Surface tension and shape of a water drop Water beading on a leaf Perhaps the most familiar physical manifestation of the 3-dimensional isoperimetric inequality is the shape of a drop of water. Namely, a drop will typically assume a symmetric round shape. Since the amount of water in a drop is fixed, surface tension forces the drop into a shape which minimizes the surface area of the drop, namely a round sphere. Thus the round shape of the drop is a consequence of the phenomenon of surface tension. Mathematically, this phenomenon is expressed by the isoperimetric inequality. Isoperimetric inequality in the plane The solution to the isoperimetric problem in the plane is usually expressed in the form of an inequality that relates the length L of a closed curve and the area A of the planar region that it encloses. The isoperimetric inequality states that : 4\\\\pi A \\\\le L^2,\\\\, and that the equality holds if and only if the curve is a round circle. The inequality is an upper bound for area in terms of length. Central symmetry Recall the notion of central symmetry: a Euclidean polyhedron is called centrally symmetric if it is invariant under the antipodal map : x \\\\mapsto -x. \\\\, Thus, in the plane central symmetry is the rotation by 180 degrees. For example, an ellipse is centrally symmetric, as is any ellipsoid in 3-space. Property of a centrally symmetric polyhedron in 3-space There is a geometric inequality that is in a sense dual to the isoperimetric inequality in the following sense. Both involve a length and an area. The isoperimetric inequality is an upper bound for area in terms of length. There is a geometric inequality which provides an upper bound for a certain length in terms of area. More precisely it can be described as follows. Any centrally symmetric convex body of surface area A can be squeezed through a noose of length \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi A}, with the tightest fit achieved by a sphere. This property is equivalent to a special case of Pu's inequality, one of the earliest systolic inequalities. For example, an ellipsoid is an example of a convex centrally symmetric body in 3-space. It may be helpful to the reader to develop an intuition for the property mentioned above in the context of thinking about ellipsoidal examples. An alternative formulation is as follows. Every convex centrally symmetric body P in {\\\\mathbb R}^3 admits a pair of opposite (antipodal) points and a path of length L joining them and lying on the boundary \\\\partial P of P, satisfying : L^2 \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4} \\\\mathrm{area}(\\\\partial P). Notion of systole Shortest loop on a torus The systole of a compact metric space X is a metric invariant of X, defined to be the least length of a noncontractible loop in X. We will denote it as follows: : \\\\mathrm{sys}(X). \\\\, Note that a loop minimizing length is necessarily a closed geodesic. When X is a graph, the invariant is usually referred to as the girth, ever since the 1947 article by William Tutte. Possibly inspired by Tutte's article, Charles Loewner started thinking about systolic questions on surfaces in the late 1940s, resulting in a 1950 thesis by his student P. M. Pu. The actual term systole itself was not coined until a quarter century later, by Marcel Berger. This line of research was, apparently, given further impetus by a remark of Ren√© Thom, in a conversation with Berger in the library of Strasbourg University during the 1961‚Äì62 academic year, shortly after the publication of the papers of R. Accola and C. Blatter. Referring to these systolic inequalities, Thom reportedly exclaimed: Mais c'est fondamental! [These results are of fundamental importance!] Subsequently, Berger popularized the subject in a series of articles and books, most recently in the march '08 issue of the Notices of the American Mathematical Society. A bibliography at the Website for systolic geometry and topology currently contains over 170 articles. Systolic geometry is a rapidly developing field, featuring a number of recent publications in leading journals. Recently, an intriguing link has emerged with the Lusternik‚ÄìSchnirelmann category. The existence of such a link can be thought of as a theorem in systolic topology. The real projective plane An animation of the Roman Surface representing RP2 in R3 In projective geometry, the real projective plane \\\\mathbb {RP}^2 is defined as the collection of lines through the origin in \\\\mathbb {R}^3. The distance function on \\\\mathbb {RP}^2 is most readily understood from this point of view. Namely, the distance between two lines through the origin is by definition the angle between them (measured in radians), or more precisely the lesser of the two angles. This distance function corresponds to the metric of constant Gaussian curvature +1. Alternatively, \\\\mathbb {RP}^2 can be defined as the surface obtained by identifying each pair of antipodal points on the 2-sphere. Other metrics on \\\\mathbb {RP}^2 can be obtained by quotienting metrics on S^2 imbedded in 3-space in a centrally symmetric way. Topologically, \\\\mathbb {RP}^2 can be obtained from the M√∂bius strip by attaching a disk along the boundary. Among closed surfaces, the real projective plane is the simplest non-orientable such surface. Pu's inequality Pu's inequality for the real projective plane applies to general Riemannian metrics on \\\\mathbb {RP}^2. A student of Charles Loewner's, Pao Ming Pu proved in a 1950 thesis (published in 1952) that every metric g on the real projective plane \\\\mathbb {RP}^2 satisfies the optimal inequality : \\\\mathrm{sys}(g)^2 \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\mathrm{area}(g), where \\\\mathrm{sys} is the systole. The boundary case of equality is attained precisely when the metric is of constant Gaussian curvature. Alternatively, the inequality can be presented as follows: : \\\\mathrm{area}(g) - \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} \\\\mathrm{sys}(g)^2 \\\\geq 0. There is a vast generalisation of Pu's inequality, due to Mikhail Gromov, called Gromov's systolic inequality for essential manifolds. To state his result, one requires a topological notion of an essential manifold. Loewner's torus inequality Shortest loop on a torus Similarly to Pu's inequality, Loewner's torus inequality relates the total area, to the systole, i.e. least length of a noncontractible loop on the torus (T^2, g): : \\\\mathrm{area}(g) - \\\\tfrac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\mathrm{sys}(g)^2 \\\\geq 0. The boundary case of equality is attained if and only if the metric is homothetic to the flat metric obtained as the quotient of {\\\\mathbb R}^2 by the lattice formed by the Eisenstein integers. Bonnesen's inequality The classical Bonnesen's inequality is the strengthened isoperimetric inequality : L^2 - 4\\\\pi A \\\\geq \\\\pi^2(R-r)^2. \\\\, Here A is the area of the region bounded by a closed Jordan curve of length (perimeter) L in the plane, R is the circumradius of the bounded region, and r is its inradius. The error term \\\\pi^2(R-r)^2 on the right hand side is traditionally called the isoperimetric defect. There exists a similar strengthening of Loewner's inequality. Loewner's inequality with a defect term The explanation of the strengthened version of Loewner's inequality is somewhat more technical than the rest of this article. It seems worth including it here for the sake of completeness. The strengthened version is the inequality : \\\\mathrm{area}(g) - \\\\tfrac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\\\mathrm{sys}(g)^2 \\\\geq \\\\mathrm{Var}(f), where Var is the probabilistic variance while f is the conformal factor expressing the metric g in terms of the flat metric of unit area in the conformal class of g. The proof results from a combination of the computational formula for the variance and Fubini's theorem (see Horowitz et al, 2009).

Followers of the Swaminarayan Sampraday maintain that even Gunatitanand Swami recited the original ashtak every day and is established in the Satsangi Jeevan for all Satsangi's to recite.http://www.swaminarayan.nu/youth/aarti.shtml Lyrics Navinajimutasamanavarnam, ratnollasat kumdalasobhikarnam; Mahakiritagramayuraparna, Shri radhikakrishnamaham namami (Chorus) .. 1 Nidhaya pani dvitiyena venum nijadhare sekharayatarenum; ninadayantam ca gatau karenum, Shri radhikakrishnamaham namami .. 2 vissuddhahemojjvapittavistram hatariyutham ca vinapisastram; vyarthikrtanekasuradvidastram, Shri radhikakrishnamaham namami .. 3 adharmatisyadinasadhupalam, sddhrmavairasurasamghakalam; puspadimalam vrajarajabalam, Shri radhikakrishnamaham namami .. 4 gopipriyarammbhitarasakhelam, rasesvariramjanakrtprahelam; skandhollasatkumacinhacelam, Shri radhikakrishnamaham namami .. 5 vrmdavane pritataya vasantam, nijascitanpada uddharantam; gogopagopirabhinamdayantam, Shri radhikakrishnamaham namami .. 6 visvadvisanmamathadarpaharam, samsarijivasrayaniyasamsram; sdaiva satpurusaukhyakaram, Shri radhikakrishnamaham namami .. 7 ananditatmavrajavasitokam, namdadisamdarsatadivyalokam; vinasitasvasritajivasokam, Shri radhikakrishnamaham namami .. 8 IN HINDI FONTS. ‡§®‡§µ‡•Ä‡§®‡§ú‡•Ä‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§§‡§∏‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ ‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§Æ , ‡§∞‡§§‡•ç‡§®‡•ã‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡§∏‡§§ ‡§ï‡•Å‡§Ç‡§°‡§≤ ‡§∏‡•ã‡§≠‡•Ä‡§ï‡§∞‡§£‡§Æ ; ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∞‡•Ä‡§ü‡§æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§∞‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§£, ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ß‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§ï‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§π‡§Ç ‡§®‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø (‡§ï‡•ã‡§∞‡§∏ ) .. ‡•ß ‡§®‡§ø‡§ß‡§æ‡§Ø ‡§™‡§æ‡§£‡•Ä‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§§‡•Ä‡§Ø‡•á‡§® ‡§µ‡•á‡§£‡•Å‡§Ç, ‡§®‡§ø‡§ú‡§æ‡§ß‡§∞‡•á ‡§∂‡•á‡§ñ‡§∞‡§Ø‡§æ‡§§‡§∞‡•á‡§£‡•Å‡§Æ ; ‡§®‡§ø‡§®‡§æ‡§¶‡§Ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ‡§ö ‡§ó‡§§‡•å ‡§ï‡§∞‡•á‡§£‡•Å‡§Æ, ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ß‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§ï‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡§Æ‡§π‡§Ç ‡§®‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø .. ‡•® ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§π‡•á‡§Æ‡•ã‡§ú‡•ç‡§ú‡§µ‡§≤‡§™‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ ‡§π‡§§‡§æ‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§•‡§Ç ‡§ö ‡§µ‡§ø‡§®‡§æ‡§™‡§ø ‡§∂‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§Ç ; ‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∞‡•ç‡§•‡•Ä‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§æ‡§®‡•á‡§ï‡§∏‡•Å‡§∞‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§°‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§Ç , ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ß‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§ï‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡§Æ‡§π‡§Ç ‡§®‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø .. ‡•© ‡§Ö‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§§‡•Ä‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∞‡§¶‡§ø‡§®‡§∏‡§æ‡§ß‡•Å‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡§Ç, ‡§∏‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§µ‡•à‡§∞‡§æ‡§∏‡•Å‡§∞‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ò‡§ï‡§æ‡§≤‡§Ç ; ‡§™‡•Å‡§∑‡•ç‡§™‡§æ‡§¶‡§ø‡§Æ‡§æ‡§≤‡§Ç ‡§µ‡•ç‡§∞‡§ú‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡§¨‡§æ‡§≤‡§Ç , ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ß‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§ï‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡§Æ‡§π‡§Ç ‡§®‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø .. ‡•™ ‡§ó‡•ã‡§™‡•Ä‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∞‡§Ç‡§Æ‡•ç‡§≠‡§ø‡§§‡§∞‡§æ‡§∏‡§ñ‡•á‡§≤‡§Ç , ‡§∞‡§æ‡§∏‡•á‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡•Ä‡§∞‡§Ç‡§ú‡§®‡§ï‡•É‡§§‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•á‡§≤‡§Æ ; ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡§®‡•ç‡§ß‡•ã‡§Ç‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡§∏ ‡§∏‡§§‡§ï‡•Å‡§Ç‡§ï‡•Å‡§Ç‡§Æ ‡§ö‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§π ‡§ö‡•á‡§≤‡§Ç, ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ß‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§ï‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§π‡§Ç ‡§®‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø .. ‡•´ ‡§µ‡•É‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡§æ‡§µ‡§®‡•á ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§§‡§§‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§µ‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç , ‡§®‡§ø‡§ú‡§æ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§™‡§¶ ‡§ä‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡§∞‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç ; ‡§ó‡•ã‡§ó‡•ã‡§™‡§ó‡•ã‡§™‡•Ä‡§∞‡§≠‡§ø‡§®‡§Ç‡§¶‡§Ø‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§Ç , ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ß‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§ï‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§π‡§Ç ‡§®‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø .. ‡•¨ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§µ‡§¶‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§£‡•ç‡§Æ‡§Æ‡§•‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§™‡§π‡§æ‡§∞‡§Ç , ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞‡§ø‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ç‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§Ø‡§£‡•Ä‡§Ø‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ‡§∞‡§Æ ; ‡§∏‡§¶‡•à‡§µ ‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å‡§∏‡•å‡§ñ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞‡§Ç , ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ß‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§ï‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§π‡§Ç ‡§®‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø .. ‡•≠ ‡§Ü‡§®‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§Æ‡§µ‡•ç‡§∞‡§ú‡§µ‡§æ‡§∏‡§ø‡§§‡•ã‡§ï‡§Ç , ‡§®‡§Ç‡§¶‡§æ‡§¶‡§ø‡§∏‡§Ç‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§∂‡§ø‡§§‡§¶‡§ø‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï‡§Ç ; ‡§µ‡§ø‡§®‡§æ‡§∏‡§ø‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ç‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§§‡§ú‡§ø‡§µ‡§∂‡•ã‡§ï‡§Ç , ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ß‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§ï‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡§æ ‡§Æ‡§π‡§Ç ‡§®‡§Æ‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø .. ‡•Æ Translation Whose bodily complexion is like the dark monsoon clouds, Whose ears are decorated with earrings bedecked with various gems and diamonds; Who is decorated with peacock feathers in the front of His helmet, Shree is Laxmi, So I pay my obeisances to Shree RadhaKrishna along with Laxmiji .. 1 His turban is decorated with different beautiful flowers, whose scented pollen is falling on the flute imparting its fragrance to the flute.

He was born in 951 in Ghent and because of this he is also known as Arnulf of Ghent. Arnulf was the son of Dirk II, Count of Holland and Hildegard, thought to be a daughter of Arnulf of Flanders. Career Arnulf is first mentioned (together with his parents) in 970. Like his father, his name appears in numerous Flemish documents at the time. In 983 Arnulf accompanied Emperor Otto II and future Emperor Otto III on their journey to Verona and Rome. As count he managed to expand his territories southwards. Arnulf donated several properties to Egmond Abbey, amongst others Hillegersberg (which was previously called Bergan, but renamed after Arnulf's mother) and Overschie, which may have been rewards for the land-clearing activities of the monks of Egmond. Arnulf was the first count to come into conflict with the West-Frisians and in 993 he invaded deep into their territory, but on 18 September of that year he was defeated and killed in a battle near Winkel in West-Friesland. His son Dirk was still a boy at this time, but Arnulf's widow Luitgard managed to retain the county for her son with support from first Emperor Otto III and later her brother-in-law, Emperor Henry II. Family In May 980 Arnulf married Lutgard of Luxemburg, a daughter of Siegfried, Count of Luxemburg. The couple had (at least) two sons; the future Count Dirk III and Siegfried (also known as Sicco). Arnulf, his wife and his sons were all buried at Egmond. He also had a daughter, Adelina of Holland, who was married to Baldwin II, Count of Boulogne and Enguerrand I, Count of Ponthieu. On 20 September 993 Liutgard donated her properties at Rugge to Saint Peter's abbey of Ghent for the soul of her husband. In June 1005 she made peace with the West-Frisians through mediation by Emperor Henry.

Technical details There are slight difference between the BRP Pangasinan as compared to some of her sister ships in the Philippine Navy, since her previous configuration was as a patrol craft escort (PCE), while the others are configured as rescue patrol craft escort (PCER) and minesweepers (Admirable class) ships. Armaments Originally the ship was armed with one Mk.26 /50 caliber dual purpose gun, three twin Mk.1 Bofors 40 mm guns, four Mk.10 20 mm Oerlikon guns, 1 Hedgehog depth charge projector, four depth charge projectiles (K-guns) and two depth charge tracks.NavSource Online: Patrol Craft Escort Photo Archive. PCE-881 . This configuration applies before its overhaul in the early 1990s. During its overhaul and refit in 1992, the Philippine Navy removed her old anti-submarine weapons and systems, and made some changes in the armament set-up. Some sources claim the loss of its three Bofors 40mm cannons during the 1990-1991 overhaul and refit period, but photos at of 2009 show the Bofors guns still present, although in singles instead of twins. Final armaments fitted to the ship are one Mk.26 3\\"/50-caliber gun (fore), three single Bofors 40 mm cannons (aft), four Mk.10 Oerlikon 20 mm cannons (2 each on bridge wings), and four M2 Browning 12.7 mm/50 caliber machine guns (2 besides main bridge, 2 aft near the ship's end). This made the ship lighter and ideal for surface patrols, but losing her limited anti-submarine warfare capability. Electronics Also during the refit the ship's SPS-21D surface search radar and RCA SPN-18 navigation radar was replaced by a Raytheon AN/SPS-64(V)11 surface search and navigation radar system.

Sociologists are concerned with the social implications of the technology; new social networks, virtual communities and ways of interaction that have arisen, as well as issues related to cyber crime. The Internet‚Äîthe newest in a series of major information breakthroughs‚Äîis of interest for sociologists in various ways: as a tool for research, for example, in using online questionnaires instead of paper ones, as a discussion platform, and as a research topic. The sociology of the Internet in the stricter sense concerns the analysis of online communities (e.g. as found in newsgroups), virtual communities and virtual worlds, organizational change catalyzed through new media such as the Internet, and social change at-large in the transformation from industrial to informational society (or to information society). Online communities can be studied statistically through network analysis and at the same time interpreted qualitatively, such as through virtual ethnography. Social change can be studied through statistical demographics or through the interpretation of changing messages and symbols in online media studies. Emergence of the discipline The Internet is a relatively new phenomenon. As Robert Darnton wrote, it is a revolutionary change that \\"took place yesterday, or the day before, depending on how you measure it.\\"Robert Darnton, The Library in the New Age, The New York Review of Books, Volume 55, Number 10. June 12, 2008. Retrieved on 22 December 2009. The Internet developed from the ARPANET, dating back to 1969; as a term it was coined in 1974. The World Wide Web as we know it was shaped in the mid-1990s, when graphical interface and services like email became popular and reached wider (non-scientific and non-military) audiences and commerce.Paul DiMaggio, Eszter Hargittai, W. Russell Neuman, and John P. Robinson, Social Implications of the Internet, Annual Review of Sociology, Vol. 27: 307-336 (Volume publication date August 2001), Internet Explorer was first released in 1995; Netscape a year earlier. Google was founded in 1998. wikipedia was founded in 2001. Facebook, MySpace, and YouTube in the mid-2000s. Web 2.0 is still emerging. The amount of information available on the net and the number of Internet users worldwide has continued to grow rapidly. The term 'digital sociology' is now becoming increasingly used to denote new directions in sociological research into digital technologies since Web 2.0. Research trends According to DiMaggio et al. (1999), research tends to focus on the Internet's implications in five domains: # inequality (the issues of digital divide) # public and social capital (the issues of date displacement) # political participation (the issues of public sphere, deliberative democracy and civil society) # organizations and other economic institutions # participatory culture and cultural diversity Early on, there were predictions that the Internet would change everything (or nothing); over time, however, a consensus emerged that the Internet, at least in the current phase of development, complements rather than displaces previously implemented media. This has meant a rethinking of the 1990s ideas of \\"convergence of new and old media\\". Further, the Internet offers a rare opportunity to study changes caused by the newly emerged - and likely, still evolving - information and communication technology (ICT). Social impact The Internet has created social network services, forums of social interaction and social relations, such as Facebook, MySpace, Meetup, and CouchSurfing which facilitate both online and offline interaction. Though virtual communities were once thought to be composed of strictly virtual social ties, researchers often find that even those social ties formed in virtual spaces are often maintained both online and offline Lauren F. Sessions, \\"How offline gatherings affect online community members: when virtual community members ‚Äòmeetup‚Äô.\\"\\"Information, Communication, and Society\\"13,3(April, 2010):375-395Bo Xie, B. ‚ÄòThe mutual shaping of online and offline social relationships.\\"Information Research, 1,3(2008):n.p.

It is often said the Internet is a new frontier, and there is a line of argument to the effect that social interaction, cooperation and conflict among users resembles the anarchistic and violent American frontier of the early 19th century.Richard Jensen. \\"Military History on the Electronic Frontier: wikipedia Fights the War of 1812,\\" The Journal of Military History (October 2012) 76#4 pp 1165-82 online In March 2014, researchers from the Benedictine University at Mesa in Arizona studied how online interactions affect face-to-face meetings. The study is titled, \\"Face to Face Versus Facebook: Does Exposure to Social Networking Web Sites Augment or Attenuate Physiological Arousal Among the Socially Anxious,\\" published in Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking. They analyzed 26 female students with electrodes to measure social anxiety. Prior to meeting people, the students were shown pictures of the subject they were expected to meet. Researchers found that meeting someone face-to-face after looking at their photos increases arousal, which the study linked to an increase in social anxiety. These findings confirm previous studies that found that socially anxious people prefer online interactions. The study also recognized that the stimulated arousal can be associated with positive emotions and could lead to positive feelings. Recent research has taken the Internet of Things within its purview, as global networks of interconnected everyday objects are said to be the next step in technological advancement. Certainly, global space- and earth-based networks are expanding coverage of the IoT at a fast pace. This has a wide variety of consequences, with current applications in the health, agriculture, traffic and retail fields. Companies such as Samsung and Sigfox have invested heavily in said networks, and their social impact will have to be measured accordingly, with some sociologists suggesting the formation of socio-technical networks of humans and technical systems.Kranz, Matthias, Luis Roalter, and Florian Michahelles. \\"Things that twitter: social networks and the internet of things.\\" What can the Internet of Things do for the Citizen (CIoT) Workshop at The Eighth International Conference on Pervasive Computing (Pervasive 2010). 2010. Issues of privacy, right to information, legislation and content creation will come into public scrutiny in light of these technological changes.  The impact on children  Technological devices can be used intensively.Researchers have investigated the use of technology (as opposed to the Internet) by children and how it can be used excessively, where it can cause medical health and psychological issues. The use of technological devices by children can cause them to become addicted to them and can lead them to experience negative effects such as depression, attention problems, loneliness, anxiety, aggression and solitude. Obesity is another result from the use of technology by children, due to how children may prefer to use their technological devices rather than doing any form of physical activity.http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/132/5/958.full.pdf Parents can take control and implement restrictions to the use of technological devices by their children, which will decrease the negative results technology can have if it is prioritized as well as help put a limit to it being used excessively. Children can use technology to enhance their learning skills - for example: using online programs to improve the way they learn how to read or do math. The resources technology provides for children may enhance their skills, but children should be cautious of what they get themselves into due to how cyber bullying may occur. Cyber bullying can cause academic and psychological effects due to how children are suppressed by people who bully them through the Internet. When technology is introduced to children they are not forced to accept it, but instead children are permitted to have an input on what they feel about either deciding to use their technological device or not. Social exclusion in the classroom occurs to children who associate themselves more with using computers, which causes them to exclude themselves from the classroom's everyday context due to how they grow more attached to the device. Children who are socially popular are the ones who try and get away from using any form of technological skills they can possibly develop due to how they believe technological devices, such as a computer can be a threat to their social identities.https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/33364239/valentine_antipode.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires;=1522504675&Signature;=IVvNJYVynCtVOCv4FPrBS03xq0Y%3D&response- content- disposition;=inline%3B%20filename%3DThe_Digital_Generation_Children_ICT_and.pdf The routines of children have changed due to their use of the technological device they have been introduced to, but \\"while the children's health and quality of life benefited from the technology, the time demands of the care routines and lack of compatibility with other social and institutional timeframes had some negative implications\\".https://www.york.ac.uk/res/iht/projects/l218252023/Heatonhsc_571.pdf Children prioritizing their technological device has put a limit on their capabilities to take part in employment, school and in having a social life overall. Technology can have negative impacts on the lives of children and can be an essential learning tool that can encourage cognitive, linguistic and social development. Children that use technological devices have had greater gains in problem-solving, intelligence, language skills and structural knowledge in comparison to those children who have not incorporated the use of technology in their learning.https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ898529.pdf In research conducted, \\"studies did find improvements in student scores on tests closely related to material covered in computer-assisted instructional packages\\", which demonstrates how technology can have positive influences on children by improving their learning capabilities.https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED452818.pdf Problems have arisen between children and their parents as well when parents limit what children can use their technological devices for, specifically what they can and cannot watch on their devices, making children frustrated. \\"Communication, Conflict, and the Quality of Family Relationships\\" by Alan Sillars, Daniel J. Canary and Melissa Tafoya in Handbook of Family Communication, edited by Anita L. Vangelisti. Mahwah, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Aassociates, Publishers, 2004. Studies have found that \\"the average child in this country spends over 6 hours each day with some form of mediated communication\\", meaning that children spend more time with their technological device rather than spending that time with their family or friends. The introduction of technology to children has the positive outcome of increasing a child's learning capabilities, but can have the negative outcome of affecting a child's behavior in acting more isolated from the rest of society. Political organization and censorship The Internet has achieved new relevance as a political tool. The presidential campaign of Howard Dean in 2004 in the United States became famous for its ability to generate donations via the Internet, and the 2008 campaign of Barack Obama became even more so. Increasingly, social movements and other organizations use the Internet to carry out both traditional and the new Internet activism. Governments are also getting online. Some countries, such as those of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Myanmar, the People's Republic of China, and Saudi Arabia use filtering and censoring software to restrict what people in their countries can access on the Internet. In the United Kingdom, they also use software to locate and arrest various individuals they perceive as a threat. Other countries including the United States, have enacted laws making the possession or distribution of certain material such as child pornography illegal but do not use filtering software. In some countries Internet service providers have agreed to restrict access to sites listed by police. Economics While much has been written of the economic advantages of Internet-enabled commerce, there is also evidence that some aspects of the Internet such as maps and location-aware services may serve to reinforce economic inequality and the digital divide.\\"How the Internet Reinforces Inequality in the Real World\\" The Atlantic February 6, 2013 Electronic commerce may be responsible for consolidation and the decline of mom-and-pop, brick and mortar businesses resulting in increases in income inequality.\\"E-commerce will make the shopping mall a retail wasteland\\" ZDNet, January 17, 2013 Philanthropy The spread of low-cost Internet access in developing countries has opened up new possibilities for peer-to-peer charities, which allow individuals to contribute small amounts to charitable projects for other individuals. Websites such as Donors Choose and Global Giving now allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice. A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy is the use of peer-to-peer lending for charitable purposes. Kiva pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding. Kiva raises funds for local intermediary microfinance organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves.Kiva Is Not Quite What It Seems , by David Roodman, Center for Global Development, Oct. 2, 2009, as accessed Jan. 2 & 16, 2010Confusion on Where Money Lent via Kiva Goes, by Stephanie Strom, in The New York Times, Nov. 8, 2009, as accessed Jan. 2 & 16, 2010 However, the recent spread of cheap Internet access in developing countries has made genuine peer-to-peer connections increasingly feasible. In 2009 the US-based nonprofit Zidisha tapped into this trend to offer the first peer-to-peer microlending platform to link lenders and borrowers across international borders without local intermediaries. Inspired by interactive websites such as Facebook and eBay, Zidisha's microlending platform facilitates direct dialogue between lenders and borrowers and a performance rating system for borrowers. Web users worldwide can fund loans for as little as a dollar.\\"Zidisha Set to \\"Expand\\" in Peer-to-Peer Microfinance\\", Microfinance Focus, Feb 2010 Leisure The Internet has been a major source of leisure since before the World Wide Web, with entertaining social experiments such as MUDs and MOOs being conducted on university servers, and humor-related Usenet groups receiving much of the main traffic. Today, many Internet forums have sections devoted to games and funny videos; short cartoons in the form of Flash movies are also popular. Over 6 million people use blogs or message boards as a means of communication and for the sharing of ideas. The pornography and gambling industries have both taken full advantage of the World Wide Web, and often provide a significant source of advertising revenue for other websites. Although governments have made attempts to censor Internet porn, Internet service providers have told governments that these plans are not feasible. Also many governments have attempted to put restrictions on both industries' use of the Internet, this has generally failed to stop their widespread popularity. One area of leisure on the Internet is online gaming. This form of leisure creates communities, bringing people of all ages and origins to enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games. These range from MMORPG to first-person shooters, from role-playing video games to online gambling. This has revolutionized the way many people interact and spend their free time on the Internet. While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with services such as GameSpy and MPlayer, to which players of games would typically subscribe. Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of gameplay or certain games. Many use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation. As discussed above, there are paid and unpaid sources for all of these, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies. Discretion is needed as some of these sources take more care over the original artists' rights and over copyright laws than others. Many use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book holidays and to find out more about their random ideas and casual interests. People use chat, messaging and e-mail to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had pen pals. Social networking websites like MySpace, Facebook and many others like them also put and keep people in contact for their enjoyment. The Internet has seen a growing number of Web desktops, where users can access their files, folders, and settings via the Internet.

While many folding bicycles are small- wheel bicycles, not all small-wheel bicycles can fold. Some small-wheel bicycles neither fold nor separate, such as the Moulton, which comes in both fixed-frame and separable-frame versions. While BMX bikes also have 20\\" wheels, they are not normally categorised as \\"small-wheel bikes\\". History An early proponent of small-wheeled adult bicycles was Paul de Vivie, better known by his pen name \\"Velocio\\". His approach was to use a balloon-width tire of about 2.25\\" (57 mm) on a 20\\" (500 mm) rim, giving a wheel of approximately 24\\" (600 mm) in diameter.De Vivie, P. (writing as \\"V√©locio\\"), Le Cycliste, France, 1911. (French original provided by Raymond Henry. English translation commissioned by Tony Hadland.) 1965 Series 2 Moulton Deluxe The man credited with being the father of modern small-wheel bicycles is Alex Moulton who pioneered the field with his F-framed Moulton Bicycle in 1962. His original small-wheeled design notably featured full suspension. Raleigh introduced the RSW-16 as a direct competitor, but it lacked the suspension of the Moulton and compensated for this by using very wide 2-inch \\"balloon\\" tires. The RSW-16 \\"Compact\\" was a folding version. In 1968 Raleigh introduced the Raleigh Twenty, which later went on to become one of Raleigh's biggest sellers. A large number of European manufacturers made U-frame small-wheeled and folding bicycles in the 1970s. Advantages and disadvantages Smaller wheels are more maneuverable. For this reason, and in some cases for comic effect, they are used in some clown bicycles. Smaller wheels more faithfully follow the terrain, giving a harsher ride on bumpy roads that are effectively smoothed by larger ones. It may be desirable for bicycles with smaller wheels to also be fitted with some form of suspension to improve riding characteristics. Bicycles with small wheels normally have their gearing adjusted to provide the same effective wheel radius as large ones, so pedalling cadence is not different. Smaller wheels tend to weigh less than larger ones, thus bringing the performance benefits of light wheels. Small wheels, all else being equal, have slightly higher rolling resistance. On the other hand, they may have lower aerodynamic drag due to their smaller area, which is proportional to their radius.

In 1878, the church separated from St. Simon & St. Jude and became its own parish. In 1890, the original church burned down, and was replaced by the now-existing church in 1892.

The lovely church, so little known to Islanders in general, is an architectural gem of considerable importance, not only to the island, but to Canada as a whole. This is so not only because of its fine design and craftmanship, both inside and out, but also because of its association with Francois Xavier Meloche, an artist/architect who has yet to take his proper place in the annals of Canadian art. In 2007, it was proposed by overseeing Bishop Vernon Fougere that the Immaculate Conception parish be dissolved and merged with nearby St. Simon & St. Jude parish due to declining church attendance. This proposal was largely rejected by Immaculate Conception pastor Fr. Arthur Pendergast and parishioners alike.

Life According to Joseph Gillow he was probably a son of Thomas Pibush, of Great Fencote, and Jane, sister to Peter Danby of Scotton. He came to Reims on 4 August 1580, received minor orders and subdiaconate in September, and diaconate in December, 1586, and was ordained on 14 March 1587. He was sent on the English mission on 3 January 1588-9, arrested at Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, in 1593, and sent to London, where he arrived before 24 July. The Privy Council committed him to the Gatehouse at Westminster, where he remained a year. He was then tried at the Gloucester Assizes under 27 Eliz., c. 2, for being a priest, but not sentenced, and was returned to Gloucester gaol, whence he escaped on 19 February (1594-5). The next day he was recaptured at Matson and taken back to Gloucester gaol, whence he was sent to the Marshalsea, London, and again tried under the same statute at Westminster on 1 July 1595. He was sentenced to suffer the penalties of high treason at St. Thomas's Waterings, and in the meantime was to be returned to the Marshalsea. However, by the end of the year he was in the Queen's Bench prison, where he remained for more than five years. The sentence was carried out after one year's notice.

The name Charlemont came from Charles Blount's Christian name. It was situated on the Armagh bank of the River Blackwater, it was armed with 150 men under the command of Sir Toby Caulfield, whose descendants took the name Charlemont from the place. The Stronghold of Charlemont proved to be of great strategic importance in the Irish Confederate Wars in the 1640s, as it was one of only a handful of modern fortresses to be found in Ireland at that time. It was captured by the forces of Felim O'Neill in 1641 and the Ulster army of the Irish Confederates managed to hold on to the fort throughout the 1640s. It was eventually captured by Charles Coote after he had been reinforced by New Model Army soldiers in late 1650, but hundreds of Coote's soldiers were killed in the effort. During the 1689-1691 Williamite War in Ireland, it was occupied by a Jacobite force under Teague O'Reagan; while the defences were strong, the garrison was short of provisions and it surrendered to Williamite forces in April 1690. The fort ceased to be used as a garrison on 14 February 1858. It was destroyed in 1920 by fire and the only building remaining today is the gatehouse.

Episcopal ministry In 2005, he was appointed Bishop of Woolwich, an area bishop of the Diocese of Southwark. He was consecrated a bishop on 21 April 2005. He is a passionate advocate of overseas church links.Diocese of Southwark ‚Äî Bishops' biographical notes (Accessed 10 June 2017) Having served as an area bishop for over five years, his appointment as Bishop of Southwark was confirmed before a congregation at St Mary-le-Bow, Cheapside on 17 January 2011. His enthronement at Southwark Cathedral took place on 6 March 2011. In March 2011 he began public ministry as the 10th Bishop of Southwark. He is a strong advocate for the parish system as the most effective means of church presence and engagement in the life of local communities, including the need to proclaim the Gospel afresh amid the rapid changes in church and community life. As Bishop of Southwark, his residence is Bishop's House, Streatham. Chessun is also the lead Bishop for Urban Life and Faith for the Church of England. This offers him an opportunity to contribute to debates and discussions on the importance of the churches' contribution to urban and public policy within society. In 2012, a number of Evangelicals criticised him for the appointment of Liberal Catholics to his leadership team. In May 2011, the Church of England declared that three members of the diocese participating in the Anglican Mission in England, ordained in Kenya, were in an impaired state of communion with Chessun due to a conflict of views on homosexuality. These \\"irregular\\" clergy would have to seek other bishops to ordain their candidates. His views are similar to those of his predecessor, Tom Butler, who appointed Chessun as Bishop of Woolwich.

He ruled one of the three Kingdoms on Sulu during his time. Journey to China and Demise of the Sultan During 1417, the East King of Sulu, Paduka Pahala, sailed with his family and 300 other people of noble descent. He was to pay tribute to the Yongle Chinese emperor, Zhu Di, who was of the Ming Dynasty. While he was welcomed by the emperor upon his arrival in China, he nevertheless contracted a mysterious disease on his way home and died at Dezhou, a town in Shandong province in China. The emperor immediately commissioned artisans and sculptors to build a tomb for the deceased monarch, which still stands today. Descendants Tradition dictates that the descendants of Paduka Pahala remained in China and were subsequently classified as members of the Hui nationality since they converted to Islam while in Shandong and were attended to by Hui people living there. The surnames of the descendants of the two sons Paduka left in Shandong are An and Wen.

The music was composed by Harumi Fujita for the YM2151 sound chip. The game was advertised in the United States as a sequel to Commando, going as far to refer to the game's main character as Super Joe (the protagonist of Commando) in the promotional brochure, who was originally an unnamed member of a \\"special commando unit\\" in the Japanese and international versions. The protagonist of the game is a commando equipped with a bionic arm featuring a grappling gun, allowing him to pull himself forward or swing from the ceiling. The series is notable for being one of few instances of a platform game in which the player cannot jump. To cross gaps or climb ledges, the hero must use his bionic arm. It was later released for several home systems (ported by Software Creations and published by Go!). Capcom later produced a home version for the Nintendo Entertainment System, also titled Bionic Commando, that was drastically different from the original arcade game.  Plot  The story takes place ten years after an unspecified World War between two warring factions. The game follows a commando who must infiltrate an enemy base and foil the enemy's plot to launch missiles. The hero must stop a missile from launching and then fight the final boss, the leader of the enemy forces, guarded by an armed bodyguard.  Gameplay  Unlike most platform games, the player is unable to jump, instead navigating the level via the use of a mechanical arm that can pull him up ledges. The arm may also be used to collect pickups. Prizes like points and power-ups can only be obtained from crates that come on the screen in a parachute, which can be revealed by shooting them. Unlike most of the later games, the player cannot use the arm and shoot at the same time, the arm cannot be used in the air and the only power-ups are weapon enhancements.  Ports  There are home ports for MS- DOS, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amiga, and Atari ST. For the Commodore 64, there are two distinct versions: a US version by Capcom, and a UK version by Software Creations. In some versions, there is an additional level between levels 3 and 4, featuring enemy helicopters. The music for the ZX Spectrum, Atari ST, Amiga, and Commodore 64 PAL conversion was arranged by Tim Follin, using a music playback engine programmed by Follin's brother. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Bionic Commando on their April 15, 1987 issue as being the fifth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Home versions generally received average or decent reviews, apart from the ZX Spectrum version which was greeted by some critical praise, receiving ratings of 9/10 and 92% from Your Sinclair and CRASH. The UK Commodore 64 version seems to be the most well-received computer port, while the US version is considered poor. The game was voted Best 8-bit Soundtrack of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards. Legacy The world record high score for Bionic Commando was set in October 2007 by Rudy Chavez of Los Angeles, California. Chavez scored 2,251,090 points. An emulation of the arcade version is included in Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 1 for PlayStation 2 and Xbox; and Capcom Classics Collection Remixed for PlayStation Portable.

As a Broadway producer, he won three Tony Awards for Best Musical and one Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical, out of 10 nominations. Personal life Despite that Richards was gay, he became the third husband of Johnson & Johnson heiress and producer Mary Lea Johnson Richards; reportedly, the couple \\"adored each other\\". Prior to their marriage, Johnson was married to her second husband, bisexual child psychiatrist Dr. Victor D'Arc. In 1976, Johnson publicly declared that her estranged husband and his homosexual lover had conspired to murder her and had hired a hitman; a hired bodyguard was beaten almost to death during a break-in that almost killed Johnson and Richards. Subsequently, the Bronx D.A's office made a case, and opened an investigation, though no charges were brought; the pair divorced in 1978. Johnson predeceased him, in 1990, leaving Richards a $50 million fortune. Subsequent to her death, Johnson's family waged a 12-year court battle seeking to render Richard's ineligible for a share of the Johnson & Johnson fortune. The court ruled in favor of Richards. He created the New York Center for Children to care for abused children and their families, in her memory.

Board of Education. The case outlawed segregation nationwide in all of the United States' public schools. The ruling served as a harbinger of the American Civil Rights Movement and paved the way for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed segregation in all public facilities. Early life Henderson was born as Zelma Cleota Hurst in Colby, Kansas, on February 29, 1920. Her family, The Hursts, were one of only two African American families living in Colby at the time. Her parents grew wheat and raised cattle for a living. The family moved to Oakley, Kansas, when she was still young. Kansas state law at the time permitted that elementary schools in towns with a population of 15,000 or more could be racially segregated. However, the law did not apply to either Colby or Oakley, since both towns had populations of under 15,000 people. As a result, Henderson attended integrated elementary schools in both towns alongside both black and white children. The law did not apply to Kansas middle schools or high schools, which were integrated throughout the state. Brown v. Board of Education Hurst encountered much more blatant discrimination and segregation when she moved to the city of Topeka, Kansas, in 1940. She studied to become a cosmetologist at a segregated school, the Kansas Vocational School. She was known to be a very good typist, but could not find a clerical position in the city due to her race. She was instead offered domestic work, such as a housekeeper or maid. Henderson married her husband, Andrew Henderson, in 1943. She opened her own beauty salon within her home soon after her marriage. The Hendersons had two children, Donald Henderson and Vicki Henderson, who were bused to a segregated, all black school on the other side of the city of Topeka. This discrimination angered Henderson, who had been educated in integrated schools as a child. She later told the Boston Globe in an interview, \\"I knew what integration was and how well it worked and couldn‚Äôt understand why we were separated here in Topeka.\\" Henderson became involved in the legal fight against the city's segregated schools in 1950, when the local Topeka chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) began preparing for a class action suit against the Topeka public school system. The NAACP asked 13 parents of African American public school students, which included Oliver Brown and 12 women, including Zelma Henderson, to serve as plaintiffs in the case. Henderson quickly agreed. In the case, whose full name was Oliver L. Brown et al. v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Henderson was the last et al. listed on the plaintiff's side of the original case. The lawsuit, with Henderson as one of the 13 plaintiffs, was first filed in 1951 in the United States District Court in Kansas. The U.S. District Court ruled against the plaintiffs, citing the 1896 \\"separate but equal\\" ruling by the United States Supreme Court in Plessy v. Ferguson. The 1951 ruling was appealed to the United States Supreme Court after it was combined with four similar cases originating from the District of Columbia, Delaware, Virginia and South Carolina under the shortened case name of Brown v. Board of Education. The United States Supreme Court unanimously struck down school segregation in its decision on May 17, 1954. Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote for the unanimous majority decision, \\"Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal,\\" in agreement with Henderson and the other plaintiff's original suit. Henderson appeared in numerous events commemorating the decision throughout her life. In a 1994 Dallas Morning News interview, she told the interviewing reporter, \\"None of us knew that this case would be so important and come to the magnitude it has. What little bit I did, I feel I helped the whole nation.\\" Death Zelma Henderson died in Topeka, Kansas, at the age of 88 of pancreatic cancer on May 20, 2008. She was the last survivor of the original Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka case. She was survived by her son, Donald, five grandchildren and fifteen great-grandchildren. Her husband, Andrew Henderson, died in 1971 and their daughter, Vicki, died in 1984.

It was directed by Florestano Vancini and adapted by Vancini, Ennio De Concini and Pier Paolo Pasolini from a short story by Giorgio Bassani. The film stars Enrico Maria Salerno, Gino Cervi, Belinda Lee, Gabriele Ferzetti and Andrea Checchi. It was also known as The Long Night of '43 or It Happened in '43. The original Italian title was La lunga notte del '43. In 2008 the film was selected to enter the list of the \\"100 Italian films to be saved\\".Massimo Bertarelli, Il cinema italiano in 100 film: i 100 film da salvare, Gremese Editore, 2004, . Plot In a town in Ferrara during the year 1943, a pharmacist, Pino, is permanently crippled and unable to move without crutches. He observes the town's activities from his upstairs window while his lonely wife Anna begins an affair with an old friend, Franco, a deserter from the army. Local Fascist leader Carlo Aretusi, better known as 'Sciagura' ('Calamity'), wants to stage an assassination attempt to get rid of his opponents in the Fascist party. He intends on blaming it on some resistance supporters. Among them is Franco's father. On the night of 15 December, while Anna is out meeting Franco, Sciagura orders the usual suspects to be shot in the night against the wall of Estense Castle. Pino can see everything from his window but doesn't say a word. Anna returns from Franco's home to find the bodies of the murder victims lying where they fell in the street, and confronts Pino. Anna is rejected by Franco and leaves town. The townspeople follow the fascists into the town square for a rally to celebrate the defeat of 'traitors'. It is revealed Pino's disability is due to syphilis, caught after participating in the March on Rome, when Sciagura forced him at gunpoint into a brothel. Years later, after the war, Franco returns to the town with his wife (not Anna) and son, and shows them a plaque where his father was killed. He runs into Sciagura, who seems happy and content and not regretful over what he has done. He says Franco looks like his father.

Hur (Arabic: ÿ≠ÿ± meaning \\"free\\", \\"not slave\\") is a Sufi Muslim community in the province of Sindh, Pakistan. Soreh Badshah (ÿ¥ŸáŸäÿØ ÿ≥Ÿàÿ±ŸáŸäŸá ÿ®ÿßÿØÿ¥ÿßŸáŸá) (the Victorious King) is the title given him by his admirers. He was hanged by British rulers on 20 March 1943 in the Central Jail Hyderabad, Sindh. His burial place remains unknown, despite requests to the British from people in Sindh.  Independence Movement  According to Lutaf Mangrio and Nadeem Wagan, the Hur movement began with Sibghtullah Shah Badshah I [1831-1779]. It reached its peak in the time of Sibghtullah Shah Shaheed Suraih Badshah when the Hurs became aggressive against British rule. Many were imprisoned in the Vasarpur district Ahmed Nagar. Sibghatullah Shah I provided forces to Syed Ahmed Shaheed to fight the Sikhs. Since that time these people have been called \\"Hurs\\" [free people]. The independence struggle was started by Syed Sibghtullah Shah Shaheed Awal in 1246 [Hijri]. Pagaras' and their followers fought against the British for 108 years, from 1843 to 1951. In 1922, Sibghtullah Shah II (Soreh Badshah) became Pir Pagara at age 12. He believed that British officers' behaviour towards Hur Jamat and the Sindhi people was insulting and humiliating. He resented their behaviour and raised his voice against British rule. He organised the struggle against British rulers and encouraged others to do the same. As a result, martial law was imposed to control the Hur movement. Pir Sahib established Gring Bungalow as his general headquarters. He recruited and trained followers to continue an armed struggle. Their slogans were \\"homeland or death\\" and \\"freedom or death\\". The \\"Lahore mail\\" railway train was derailed by Hurs on 16 May 1942. When Hurs attacked the army and police they raised the slogan of \\"Bhej Pagaara\\". In an effort to rush the Hurs, their center Gring Bungalow was bombarded and destroyed on 26 May 1943. Pir Soreh Badshah was arrested on 24 October 1941 and imprisoned in Seoni in India. The Hurs intensified their activities against the colonial government by attacking police stations, government buildings and railway stations as well as telephone and irrigation systems to paralyse society and to pressure the British to release their spiritual leader. Dargah Sharif and the bungalow in Pir Jo Goth were destroyed in 1943. In 1942 important leaders in Sindh Prant were arrested. Pir Sahib Pagara was brought from Seoni to Sindh in January 1943 and was detained in the central jail in Hyderabad. The Hurs established the Makhi forest as their base. The Government then began air bombing Gring Bungalow, Makhi Forest and Dargah Sharif. They arrested thousands of Hur leaders along with their families and kept them in concentration camps until 1952. Jail employees told the writer Nasir Jamal that they had heard from the ancestors that Soreh Badshah was buried outside of Phasi Ghat (place of execution) in the central jail at Hyderabad, Sindh, Pakistan. Because they anticipated an extreme reaction by the Hur Mujahid. The British authorities did not disclose the place of burial. They also flattened the surrounding land.  History of the Hur Movement  During British rule (according to Voice of Sureh by Lutaf Mangrio and Nadeem Wagan), Pir Pagaro declared his community \\"Hur\\" (free from British slavery). The British tried to crush the uprising and that resulted in an armed resistance by Hurs. Ultimately the British passed the Hurs Act, where the entire Hur community was declared criminals and were ordered to be shot on sight. The Hurs continued their struggle even after the hanging of Pir Sahib, right up to the time of Pakistan's independence. Pir Pagaro Syed Sibghatullah Shah II was hanged on 20 March 1943 and the British left the South Asia four years later on 14 August 1947. After the end of British rule, Pir Pagaro's two sons, who were in British custody in England, were released and came back to lead their community. Sindh was a province in the newly independent Pakistan. The sons of Sibghatullah Shah Shaheed, Pir Syed Shah Mardan Shah Rashdi-II alias Pir Syed Sikandar Ali Shah Rashidi and Pir Syed Nadir Ali Shah Rashidi were brought to Pakistan in December 1951 after long negotiations. The elder son, Pir Syed Shah Mardan Shah-II became the new Pir Pagara on 22 February 1952.

Description Caravanim are constructed of aluminum or other metal siding with a corrugated metal roof, and are often attached to a cement-block base. They are not insulated but can be outfitted with heating and air-conditioning units, water lines, recessed lighting, and floor tiling to function in a full- service capacity. The establishment of caravanim on disputed land by Jewish activists is considered the first step toward the establishment of an Israeli settlement. In its initial stage of a few caravanim, the establishment is called an \\"outpost.\\" As more settlers move in, the establishment is upgraded to a \\"settlement\\". Alternately, caravanim have been established on disputed land by Israeli and Palestinian activists as a sign of protest. Classrooms Tel Zion, a Haredi settlement in the West Bank. Interior of a synagogue housed in a caravan in Neve Yaakov, Jerusalem. Caravanim are popularly employed by schools -- especially in Haredi neighborhoods of Israel -- that are unable to finance a permanent structure. A 2008 report by the State Comptroller of Israel reported that 125 out of 186 Haredi schools in Bnei Brak, Elad and Modi'in Illit were situated wholly or partially in caravanim, some older than 15 years. The report criticized these structures for lack of ventilation, lack of bomb shelters, and lack of proper yards or playgrounds for the children. Though the construction of some caravan schools violate local planning and building laws, the government does not dismantle them. Synagogues Many start-up religious congregations establish their synagogues in caravanim rather than the more expensive permanent concrete-and- stone structures. Synagogues housed in caravanim are common sights at Israel army bases. Living space Caravanim are sometimes used as inexpensive houses in new or extensions of existing localities within Israel. Settler housing Most often, caravanim are employed by both settlers and the government as housing in Israeli settlement areas in the territories occupied since 1967. Residents usually live in caravanim until permanent homes are built. The caravan may also be a more permanent low-rent option, particularly for young couples. The overnight installment of caravanim for housing is a popular means of establishing a new, unauthorized settler outpost on disputed land. Caravillas Vacant caravillas in Nitzan, 2005 In 2005 prefabricated homes, named caravillas (), a portmanteau of the words caravan and villa, were set up to house the Jewish families evicted from their homes in Gush Katif in the Gaza Strip as part of Israel's unilateral disengagement plan. A caravilla is composed of several prefabricated sections that are joined on a foundation. Caravillas, which vary in size from about 650 to 1,000 square feet, are akin to the Israeli concept of a villa, or single-family home. They were instrumental in pacifying objections to the disengagement plan. The biggest of these caravilla camps was established in Nitzan, north of Ashkelon with 250 caravillas, which has grown to accommodate over 500.

Locis parallelis evangeliorum apocryphorum et patrum adhibitis edidit\\", Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart 1996, p. XXI. Mark 14-16 is illegible.  Description  The codex, which has survived in a fragmentary condition, was written on 160 thick parchment leaves (). The text was written in two columns, 45 lines per page, in small, upright uncial letters, by a \\"very elegant\\" hand with breathing marks, accents and some compressed letters. The codex contains portions of the four Gospels in the order of: John, Luke, Matthew and Mark. Matthew followed by Mark is also found in the Latin codex k (4th century CE). The text of the Gospels contains a patristic commentary (except Mark) written in minuscule letters. There are no divisions such as œÑŒØœÑŒªŒøŒπ (titles), and the Ammonian sections and Eusebian Canons are absent. The texts of Matthew 16:2b‚Äì3 and John 7:53-8:11 are omitted. Mark has the longer ending, but the word Œ≥Œ¨œÅ is missing at the end of Mk 16,8.  Text  The Greek text of this codex is a representative of the Byzantine text-type, with occasional readings deemed to be from the Alexandrian text-type. Aland gave it profile 1051, 381/2, 12, 11S and placed it in Category V. In Mark 9:49 it has the textual variant œÄŒ±œÇ Œ≥Œ±œÅ œÄœÖœÅŒπ Œ±ŒªŒπ Œ±ŒªŒπœÉŒ∏Œ∑œÉŒµœÑŒ±Œπ instead of œÄŒ±œÇ Œ≥Œ±œÅ œÄœÖœÅŒπ Œ±ŒªŒπœÉŒ∏Œ∑œÉŒµœÑŒ±Œπ.NA26, p. 121.  History  The codex was held in Innsbruck in 1757. It has been in Rome, Ingolstadt (as a present from Gerard Vossius (1577‚Äì1649)), and in 1827 arrived in Munich. Now the codex is located in the Munich University Library (fol. 30) in Munich. The codex was examined by Joseph Dobrovsky, who collated some of its readings for Johann Jakob Griesbach. Scholz collated it again, but wasn't a good collation. Tischendorf collated its text in 1844 and Tregelles in 1846. Burgon examined the manuscript in 1872.

It is known for Arulmigu Amirthakateshwarar Thirukkoil temple, constructed during the reign of Cholas by Kulothunga Chola. The temple and the village are well known in Ponniyin Selvan history, as they are more than 1,000 years old. The Sivan temple at Melakadambur is a paadal petra thalam. This Sivalinga is self- manifested or Swayambhu Linga. Ponniyin Selvan Ponniyin Selvan is a historical novel written by Tamil writer Kalki Krishnamurthy, from Tamil Nadu, who is also known as Krishnamurthy. This historical novel appeared in serial in the Tamil weekly Kalki, in the name of the author, many times and attracted many readers. Devara shrine It is a Devara shrine of north shored Kaveri river. There are 63 shrines along the North bank of River Kaveri, including Melakadambur that lists as the 34th. The well known Nalvar praised the Lord of this shrine and made three pathigams on him. Also Arunagirinathar, Vannacharabamn Thandapani Swamigal, and Vallalar came here to sing in praise of this Lord. In every Yuga some Devas visited this place to worship this Lord Amirthakadeswara. In Threthayuga Surya, Chandra, Indira, Romarishi came to worship. In Threthayuga Ashtaparvathas and Parvatharajan came to worship. In Kaliyuga, Pathanjali came to worship this sthala. Karakkoil There are nine types of Hindu temple structures. Amongst them, Karakkoil also called Mela Kadambur Amirthakadeswarar Temple is a structure that the vimana is in chariot like structure. The structure is pulled by horses looks an enchanting appearance. Karakkoil This Karakkoil was built by emperor Kulottunga Chola I in the year 1113 AD, the king's 43rd governing year. This temple is like a chariot like structure with two horses pulling the car or Ratha. The temple is finely sculptured with many purana stories like Ramayan, Krishna Leela, Nayanmar stories and other stories of siva. The basement is called Adhittanam this temples adhittanam is laid of 18 layered adittanam called pathmaga pandham, and manjapathram. Sun worship It is rare scene to view. During the 3rd, 4th, 5th day of the Tamil month of Panguni, twelfth month of the Tamil calendar, early during sunrise at 6.15 am, the Sun's rays will fall on Lord Amirthakateshwara Lingam for about fifteen minutes. At that time special poojas are offered to the Lord. The shrine Goddess Jothiminnammai seems as Kalaimagal in morning and Thirumagal in evening and Malaimagal in night. Vinayaga When Narasimhavarma Pallavan won the war on Chalukya, a Ganapati statue brought from the Chalukyan capital of Vatapi ‚Äî by Sirutondar, like that cholas made a war towards Ganga region by the King Rajendra I at that time they taken a Ganapathy statue and Dvarabalaka statue from vengi region, that statue was positioned in Kadambur temple, the Davarabalaka statue kept in the entrance of Gangai konda cholapuraam temple. Dasa Bhuja Rishaba Thandavamoorthy Pala dynasty image of Nataraja A special idol kept in this temple, called Dasa Bhuja Rishaba Thandavamoorthy, depicts Lord Shiva dancing on a bull with all ten hands spread and holding weapons, with all Devas surrounding his feet. This is believed to be a Pala dynasty idol that came to Tamil Nadu-Melakadambur along with victorious King Rajendra Chola I of the Bengal war. After Rajendra this idol has been kept in this Melakadambur temple built by the king Kulothunga I, who donated this idol and some Vidangars in 1110 AD. Devotees can see this idol only on Pradosha days. Kadamba tree The Kadambu tree is the sthala vriksha of the Siva temple situated here. This village is named as Kadambur because of the Kadambu tree, named in botany as Anthocephalus Cadamba of Rubicea family. This Kadambur then bifurcated into Melakadambur and Keezhakadambur. Festivals of this village This village was called as Thirukkadambur in 6th‚Äì19th century. We can know this by means of the padhigams of Thirunavukkarasar and Thirugnanasambandar nayanmars.

Unlike the rest of New South Wales, Broken Hill operates as part of South Australia's ABC Local Radio network, and takes network feeds from 891 ABC Adelaide whenever it isn't producing its own content. This is because Broken Hill is on Central Time, while the rest of NSW is on Eastern Time.  History  The station went to air in the evening 29 July 1948 as station 2NB/760 AM. A ceremony was held in honour of the opening at the Broken Hill Town Hall and was attended by Acting Mayor Alderman W. F. Riddiford, Local Federal Member for Parliament J. J. Clark, Postmaster General Senator Cameron and Vice-Chairman of the ABC Mr E. R. Dawe, who stated that \\"2NB would bring programs nearer to the local Broken Hill people\\" and that \\"the Commission hoped that the people of Broken Hill would be better informed\\". The Quartet Club, Zinc Corporation Orchestra, Philharmonic Society, and Barrier Industrial Unions Band provided the music entertainment that night. During the station's first year, there were only two staff, Jeff Medwell and Frank Scott. The original studios on 194 Argent Street were completely destroyed by a fire at 1:06 AM on 1 February 1966, which caused around 6000 pounds/10700 dollars of damage. New studios were built at 454 Argent Street and opened on 23 February 1971 by ABC Chairman Robert Madgwick and the station thus resumed broadcasts. The station celebrated 50 years of broadcasting in 1998.

Photon antibunching generally refers to a light field with photons more equally spaced than a coherent laser field,Anti- bunching and Entanglement - https://web.archive.org/web/20110615173635/http://www.ucd.ie/speclab/UCDSOPAMS/peoplehtml/quantumoptics2006/lecture5.pdf a signature being signals at appropriate detectors which are anticorrelatedChandra, N., & Prakash, H. (1970). Anticorrelation in two-photon attenuated laser beam. Physical Review A, 1(6), 1696. . More specifically, it can refer to sub-Poissonian photon statistics, that is a photon number distribution for which the variance is less than the mean. A coherent state, as output by a laser far above threshold, has Poissonian statistics yielding random photon spacing; while a thermal light field has super-Poissonian statistics and yields bunched photon spacing. In the thermal (bunched) case, the number of fluctuations is larger than a coherent state; for an antibunched source they are smaller. The variance of the photon number distribution is : V_n=\\\\langle \\\\Delta n^2\\\\rangle=\\\\langle n^2\\\\rangle-\\\\langle n\\\\rangle^2= \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\left(a^{\\\\dagger}a\\\\right)^2\\\\right\\\\rangle-\\\\langle a^{\\\\dagger}a\\\\rangle ^2. Using commutation relations, this can be written as : V_n=\\\\langle {(a^{\\\\dagger}})^2a^2 \\\\rangle+\\\\langle a^{\\\\dagger}a\\\\rangle-\\\\langle a^{\\\\dagger}a\\\\rangle ^2. This can be written as : V_n-\\\\langle n\\\\rangle=\\\\langle (a^\\\\dagger)^2 a^2\\\\rangle -\\\\langle a^{\\\\dagger}a\\\\rangle^2. The second-order intensity correlation function (for zero delay time) is defined as : g^{(2)}(0)={{\\\\langle (a^\\\\dagger)^2 a^2\\\\rangle}\\\\over{\\\\langle a^{\\\\dagger}a\\\\rangle^2}}. This quantity is basically the probability of detecting two simultaneous photons, normalized by the probability of detecting two photons at once for a random photon source. Here and after we assume stationary counting statistics. Then we have : {{1}\\\\over{(\\\\langle n\\\\rangle)^2}}(V_n-\\\\langle n\\\\rangle) =g^{(2)}(0)-1. Then we see that sub- Poisson photon statistics, one definition of photon antibunching, is given by g^{(2)}(0) < 1. We can equivalently express antibunching by Q< 0 where the Mandel Q Parameter is defined as : Q\\\\equiv \\\\frac{V_n}{\\\\langle n \\\\rangle}-1. If the field had a classical stochastic process underlying it, say a positive definite probability distribution for photon number, the variance would have to be greater than or equal to the mean. This can be shown by an application of the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality to the definition of g^{(2)}(0). Sub- Poissonian fields violate this, and hence are nonclassical in the sense that there can be no underlying positive definite probability distribution for photon number (or intensity). Photon antibunching by this definition was first observed by Kimble, Mandel, and Dagenais in resonance fluorescence. A driven atom cannot emit two photons at once, and so in this case g^{(2)}(0)=0. An experiment with more precision that did not require subtraction of a background count rate was done for a single atom in an ion trap by Walther et al. A more general definition for photon antibunching concerns the slope of the correlation function away from zero time delay. It can also be shown by an application of the Cauchy‚ÄìSchwarz inequality to the time dependent intensity correlation function : g^{(2)}(\\\\tau)={{\\\\langle a^{\\\\dagger}(0)a^{\\\\dagger}(\\\\tau)a(\\\\tau)a(0)\\\\rangle}\\\\over{\\\\langle a^{\\\\dagger}a\\\\rangle^2}}. It can be shown that for a classical positive definite probability distribution to exist (i.e. for the field to be classical) g^{(2)}(\\\\tau) \\\\leq g^{(2)}(0). Hence a rise in the second order intensity correlation function at early times is also nonclassical. This initial rise is photon antibunching. Another way of looking at this time dependent correlation function, inspired by quantum trajectory theory is : g^{(2)}(\\\\tau)={{\\\\langle a^{\\\\dagger}a\\\\rangle_C}\\\\over{\\\\langle a^{\\\\dagger}a\\\\rangle}} where : \\\\langle O \\\\rangle_C \\\\equiv \\\\langle \\\\Psi_C O\\\\Psi_C\\\\rangle. with \\\\Psi_C\\\\rangle is the state conditioned on previous detection of a photon at time \\\\tau=0.

The film entered the 1955 Venice Film Festival, where it received a special mention. It is the directorial debut of Francesco Maselli. The music was composed by Giovanni Fusco and arranged by Ennio Morricone. In 2008 the film was selected to enter the list of the 100 Italian films to be saved. Plot In the summer of 1943, Countess Luisa and her son Andrea left Milan to escape the bombings and retired to their country villa, where they hosted two of Andrea's peers, his cousin Carlo, the son of a fascist hierarch who fled to Switzerland, and the friend Ferruccio, son of an army officer engaged in war. The three young people pass the time in the dolce far niente, sunbathing along the river, only vaguely aware of the ongoing conflict, thanks to the broadcasts of Radio London. They begin to become aware of the seriousness of the situation when displaced people arrive from the city and Andrea, out of weakness and not out of solidarity, is forced to accept to host some in the villa, to the annoyance of his mother. Among the displaced there is the young worker Lucia, whom Andrea falls in love with and thanks to whom he finally comes out of his golden world to face the tragic reality that surrounds them and take responsibility. In the absence of his mother, to whom he is linked by a morbid relationship and towards whom he is in complete awe, he seems to mature and, when Italian soldiers arrive in the village, escaped from a German convoy that was taking them to the labor camps, he finds the courage to hide them in the villa, supported by Carlo and Lucia. But Ferruccio tells what is happening to the old fascist authorities of the country, who inform the Germans. Having discovered the boy's denunciation, the runaway soldiers flee by truck towards the mountains and the partisans. Lucia, Carlo and Andrea should go with them, but the arrival of the countess, accompanied by a German officer, extinguishes all the initiative of the last, who agrees to stay with her and abandon her companions to their fate. As he drives away, safe, Andrea sees the German soldiers searching the villa and then when he hears gunshots he realizes, with desperation, that Lucia has been killed.

Built 1828-1831 by free African-Americans, it is Maine's oldest African-American church building, and the third oldest in the nation. Throughout the years, the Abyssinian was a place for worship and revivals, abolition and temperance meetings, speakers and concerts, the Female Benevolent Society, the Portland Union Anti-Slavery Society and negro conventions, and the black school in Portland from the mid-1840s through the mid-1850s. The building is the only Underground Railroad site in Maine recognized by the National Park Service. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.  A House of Worship (1828‚Äì1917)  The Abyssinian was the cultural center for African-Americans in southern Maine. It was formed to meet the demand from African-Americans in Portland to have a place to worship. Christopher Christian Manuel, his brother-in-law Reuben Ruby, Caleb Jonson, Clement Thomson, Job L. Wentworth, and John Siggs published a letter on September 19, 1826, in the Eastern Argus newspaper which condemned the Second Congregational Church in Portland for treating non-white members as second-class citizens. At the time, church pews were segregated and African-Americans were designated balcony seating or discouraged from attending services at all. Manuel, Ruby and three others petitioned the state of Maine for incorporation of the Abyssinian Religious Society in 1828. The building became the Abyssinian Congregational Church.Price, H.H.; Talbot, Gerald E. (2006). \\"Early History\\". Maine's Visible Black History: The First Chronicle of Its People. Tilbury House. p. 43. Reuben Ruby (1798‚Äì1878) played a central role in the beginning of the Abyssinian. He transferred the original land to the Society in March 1831 and performed work on the interior of the building. Throughout the Northeast, he enjoyed a reputation as an unwavering spokesman against slavery and was a major participant in forming the Maine Anti-Slavery Society in 1834. He was self-employed as a hackman and, through his business, transported escaped slaves. Ruby also hosted William Lloyd Garrison in his home. In 1836, Ruby brought a suit against the Society for non-payment on the mortgage he held and improvements he had made to the building. Ruby was a defendant in an 1837 case brought against him by Samuel W. Chase, minister the Abyssinian.Price, H.H.; Talbot, Gerald E. (2006). \\"Social Change\\". Maine's Visible Black History: The First Chronicle of Its People. Tilbury House. pp. 254 and 271. The Abyssinian housed an active congregation for 86 years, from 1831 to 1917. In 1842, some black parishioners from the Fourth Congregational Church in Portland merged with the Abyssinian Religious Society to form the Abyssinian Congregational Church and Society. It also was known as the Sumner Street Church and then the Newbury Street Church, as the name of the street changed.Price, H.H.; Talbot, Gerald E. (2006). \\"Living and Working\\". Maine's Visible Black History: The First Chronicle of Its People. Tilbury House. pp. 145-146. The Reverend Amos No√© Freeman (1810‚Äì93) was the first full-time minister at the Abyssinian. His tenure was from 1841 to 1851 and was focused on employment, temperance, and abolishing slavery. As a known Underground Railroad agent, he used the building to host and organize anti-slavery speakers, Negro conventions and testimonies from runaway slaves. By 1845, he took on the role of principal of a segregated school for black children where it saw great improvements, including the addition of music education.Price, H.H.; Talbot, Gerald E. (2006). \\"Living and Working\\". Maine's Visible Black History: The First Chronicle of Its People. Tilbury House. pp. 160-164. In 1846, the location of the school for black children moved from the North School to the vestry of the Abyssinian. In 1851, there were 75 scholars numbered in the school with an average attendance of 55 students. The school was discharged in 1856 and African-American students have attended integrated schools ever since.Price, H.H.; Talbot, Gerald E. (2006). \\"Living and Working\\". Maine's Visible Black History: The First Chronicle of Its People. Tilbury House. p. 164. It is one of the few buildings to survive the 1866 Great Fire of Portland, Maine. Local folklore includes stories about parishioners fighting to protect the building.  Mandated dissolution  The church's congregation declined in size over the course of the 19th century, due in part to the growing number of churches in the city, and a gradual dispersal of the African-American population. In 1898, when the SS Portland was shipwrecked, it took with it seventeen male congregants, including two trustees. This was a severe blow to the congregation, which was thereafter reduced to minimal activity. An act of the Maine Legislature, passed February 24, 1917, dissolved and sold the Abyssinian on July 28, 1917. Most of the parishioners became members of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, now known as the Green Memorial A.M.E. Zion Church located on Sheridan Street in Portland.Price, H.H.; Talbot, Gerald E. (2006). \\"Living and Working\\". Maine's Visible Black History: The First Chronicle of Its People. Tilbury House. p. 147. The proceeds of the sale of the building and furnishings went to the Congregational Conferences and Missionary Society of Maine. As stated in the act, any income gained after repayment of loans was to be entered into an Abyssinian Fund. Accurate expense records were to be kept in the event of \\"erection, repair or alteration of any church building for colored people in the City of Portland, or for the support of any church, or religious work among the people of that race in said city.\\" Direction of the fund is at the discretion of the Missionary Society. After the sale, the Abyssinian was used as a stable and an antique store, then developed into tenement apartments in 1924. It was seized for unpaid taxes by the City of Portland in 1991.Abyssinian Meeting House focus of regional mapping Portland Daily Sun, February 18, 2010  Landmark status and restoration  After sitting vacant for six years, the Abyssinian was bought for historic preservation by the Committee to Restore the Abyssinian in 1998. It is the third oldest African-American meeting house in the United States after Boston and Nantucket, Massachusetts.http://www.mainepreservation.org/Endangered/02.shtml 2002 Maine's Most Endangered Historic Properties The Committee purchased the building from the City of Portland for $250, the original price for which the Society purchased the land from Ruben Ruby in 1828.Price, H.H.; Talbot, Gerald E.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006, the year the restoration began, and on the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom in 2007. In April 2008, an archeological dig was conducted to obtain further information on the Meeting House.Volunteers, Archaeologists Dig At Old Abyssinian Meeting House WCSH6.com, April 26, 2008 While removing construction added during the 1920s, original wooden beams were uncovered. Included in the find are joists which are believed to have been part of the choir loft. During restoration efforts, a clay pipe broke in the basement and a steady stream began to run. In 2011, a project was undertaken to contain the free flowing water and a wooden water pipe was discovered on the site. It is speculated that it provided water to the Grand Trunk Railroad in the 1850s. The pipe was reburied to preserve it. In September 2012, Greater Portland Landmarks named the Abyssianian as one of seven historic sites in peril due to lack of restoration funding.

Early life Dugald Stewart Walker was a native of Richmond, Virginia, and studied drawing at the University of Virginia and the New York School of Art. Work Illustration \\"I did not call you over to give me a bath,\\" cried Squeaky Snythergen (1923) Walker's first comprehensive suite of colour and monotone illustrations appeared in Stories for Pictures (1912) and in the Foreword for that title written by Mackay, Walker was described in the following terms: > \\"Dugald Stewart Walker, a new artist of remarkable talent, suggesting > Rackham and Dulac but entirely original in spirit and execution.\\" Two years after that debut, his generously illustrated version of Fairy Tales from Hans Christian Andersen (1914) appeared - a title that benefited significantly from Walker's editorial involvement in the project - and over the following decade, many other commissions followed. Walker's Foreword to Fairy Tales from Hans Christian Andersen (1914) provides some insight into his approach, inspiration and intentions through his work: > \\"I have never been anywhere except Richmond, Virginia, and New York, because > I have always been told that only grown-up people were allowed to travel. > But the good East Wind and the kindly Moon have taken me on rapturous > journeys high above the world to get an enchanted view of things. In this > book I have put some of my discoveries, but if you are looking here for real > likeness of the things that any one could see if he were grown up, you had > better close the covers now. You cannot expect me to draw an exact picture > of the North Pole or of a Chinese lady's feet or of a sea-cucumber. But if > you are interested in what the East Wind or the Father Stork or the Moon > told me, then look with my eyes and you will not mind very much if the > courtiers in the ogre's court, or the dock leaves in the Garden of Paradise, > are not just as a grown-up person thinks they should be. After all is said > and done, what the young ones say about it is the all-important matter.\\" A decade after his significant literary contribution to Fairy Tales from Hans Christian Andersen (1914), Walker published a short story (dedicated to Charles White Whittlesey) entitled The Dust of Seven Days. The frontispiece to that Limited Edition appears to depict Mr Valiant-for-Truth from The Pilgrim's Progress as he is transported to Heaven - a particularly fitting subject given Walker's dedication. His work was noted for its fine detail, elaborate stippling, and lavish design. Bookplate by Dugald Stewart Walker Bookplates Walker sold his art in many forms. Though his gallery work brought him international acclaim, it was not popular in Richmond, where he sold his art instead in the form of prints on commissioned bookplates and cards. These monochromatic prints are reminiscent of Aubrey Beardsley. Walker's bookplates use the personalized iconography of his clients‚Äîimages associated with a client's person, or occupation‚Äîand included them in modernist heraldic images.

It is based on the 1987 arcade game of the same title. As Ladd, a member of the FF Battalion, the player has to explore each stage and obtain the necessary equipment to progress.Top Secret: Hitler no Fukkatsu Instruction Manual , p. 4. Ladd is equipped with a mechanical arm featuring a grappling gun, allowing him to pull himself forward or swing from the ceiling. As such, the series is one of few instances of a platform game in which the player cannot jump. To cross gaps or climb ledges, Ladd must use his bionic arm. In the game's instruction manual, the character is only known as \\"Player\\". In the game, his name is revealed to be \\"Ladd\\" during the ending.Bionic Commando (Ending). Ladd: \\"This is Ladd. Our mission accomplished. Super Joe is safe. We are returning now.\\" The game Boy version, a retelling of this game, calls the character \\"Rad\\". In the Game Boy Color remake, the main character is unnamed. It wasn't until 2009's Bionic Commando for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 that the full name ‚ÄîNathan \\"Rad\\" Spencer‚Äî was revealed. Gameplay Since Ladd cannot jump in the game, he uses his bionic arm to swing across gaps and obstacles. Bionic Commando is a platformer in which the player controls Ladd, whose mission is to rescue Super Joe and to stop the Albatros project. Players begin the game on an overworld map, where, Starting at Area 0, players can move Ladd's helicopter to any connected Area on the map in a nonlinear fashion. However, once Ladd's helicopter moves, the enemy ground vehicles will also move. Once the helicopter reaches its destination without crossing over the path of an enemy vehicle, the player can choose to \\"descend\\" and play that area or to \\"transfer\\" to a different Area.Bionic Commando Instruction Manual, pp. 7‚Äì9. However, if the helicopter is intercepted by an enemy vehicle, then Ladd must engage the enemy in an overhead shooter level similar to Capcom's own Commando. Ladd, armed with a weapon and his grappling hook that he can swing around in a circle to deflect bullets and enemies, must defeat the enemy soldiers and reach the end of the stage to continue on. These stages are the only stages where the player can earn a continue. When Ladd descends into an Area, the player must choose which equipment to take with him,Bionic Commando Instruction Manual, pp. 10‚Äì12. And is then dropped into a sidescrolling platformer level, where the player must first find one or multiple Communications Rooms - where the player can communicate with allies or wiretap enemy conversations - and then proceed each Area's Computer Room, where a boss will be guarding the computer core the player must destroy to clear the Area. Ladd cannot jump, so the player must use Ladd's weapons and his bionic arm to defeat enemies and navigate platforms and obstacles. Players can extend his bionic arm overhead, directly in front, and above at a 45-degree angle, and can grapple to higher platforms, swing across chasms, and pick up items. Additional equipment such as weapons, protective gear, and communications devices can be found by clearing Areas or finding them in levels, some of which are vital to progressing further in the game. In addition to the regular \\"combat areas\\", there are also safe \\"neutral areas\\"; non-hostile zones where Ladd can gain additional information from allied and enemy soldiers and find items. If Ladd fires his weapon in any neutral area, an alarm sounds, and all soldiers will become hostile to Ladd. Plot Bionic Commando takes place sometime in the 1980s and centers on two warring states: the Federation and the Empire. One day, Federation Forces discover top secret documents about \\"Albatros\\", an unfinished project developed by the Empire's predecessor, the \\"Badds\\"Bionic Commando (Introduction). Joe: \\"In 198X we've found the Badds' top secret material called Albatros which was never put into practice.\\" (also known as the \\"Nazz\\"Bionic Commando Instruction Manual, p. 4. \\"In 198X we've found Nazz's top secret material called Abatros, a plan which was never put into practice.\\" or Nazis in the Japanese version). Imperial leader Generalissimo Killt decides to complete the project himself. Upon learning the Empire's plot, the Federation sends in their national hero, Super Joe (the main character from the 1985 Capcom title Commando) to infiltrate the Empire, but he is captured. The Federation then sends in a second operative named LaddBionic Commando (Ending). Ladd: This is Ladd, our mission accomplished. to rescue him and to uncover the secret behind the Albatros project. Ladd is a member of the FF (Double Force) Battalion, a team of commandos specially trained to use wired guns to infiltrate enemy bases. Ladd starts in Area 1, in which he is told that the first several areas, already infiltrated by Federation troops, have communication devices and rooms that can be used to stay in contact with the Federation and for wiretapping to gain intelligence from the Empire.Bionic Commando (Area 1). MA-1: \\"This is MA-1. I've been waiting for you. Many of our agents have already infiltrated the sectors you will be travelling. To contact them you must find a communication room. Your success depends on staying in touch. You should be able to wiretap and intercept important information.\\" Upon reaching Area 3, Ladd finds through enemy intelligence that Super Joe has been transported to the Imperial \\"disposal area\\",Bionic Commando (Area 3). Anonymous Imperial Commander: You transported Joe? Anonymous Imperial Soldier: Yeah, over to disposal area. Heroes always look good. which a Federation spy later confirms.Bionic Commando (Area 5). Federation Spy: \\"Are you from the Federation? I'm a spy for the Federation. I just saw that Joe was taken away, they headed towards area 8.\\" However, upon reaching the disposal area, an Imperial commander tells Ladd that Super Joe has been transported elsewhere.Bionic Commando (Area 9). Imperial Commander: \\"Your effort is wasted. We've just transferred Joe to another location.\\" Eventually, Ladd rescues Super Joe,Bionic Commando (Area 7). Ladd: \\"Mr. Joe, I've come to rescue you.\\" Super Joe: Thank you. I'm sorry to cause so much trouble.\\" who informs Ladd that the Albatros project is a powerful laser cannon the Badds were unable to complete.Bionic Commando (Area 7). Super Joe: \\"Captain, something terrible is going to happen. Remember there was a plan in the Badds' secret documents' about building a huge laser cannon. The empire is trying to accomplish what the Badds' couldn't do.\\" However, the one person vital to the project's completion, Master-D (Hitler), is dead, and Generalissimo Killt has been unsuccessfully trying to resurrect him. Super Joe tells Ladd that they must stop Killt before he succeeds, and he asks Ladd to accompany him to the Imperial base located in Area 12.Bionic Commando (Area 7). Super Joe: \\"However they cannot complete this project because the person with the key knowledge is dead. His name is Master-D. To finish the project, Killt is trying to resurrect him but has been unable to do so. Captain, we must stop him before this project gets too big. I'm going to Area 12 now. Can you fight with me?\\" When Ladd reaches the Imperial base, Super Joe tells him to break the power system in order to release two power barriers that are guarding the incomplete project.Bionic Commando (Area 12). Super Joe: \\"This is Super Joe. This area is divided by 2 barriers. In order to break the barriers, you should break the power system.

I'm going to destroy the power source of the base. Defeat the leader and get out!\\" When Ladd reaches Killt's chamber, Killt boasts that the Albatros project has been completed without Master-D's help, turning off the device that would have resurrected him.Bionic Commando (Area 12). Generalissimo Killt: \\"But you're too late. The Albatros has begun to move. Not necessary to wait for Master-D to revive. I've just cut off the switch for the revival device. Master-D will never rise again.\\" As Killt is about to kill Ladd , electric shocks begin to occur around the holding tank containing Master-D's body, reviving Master-D and instantly killing Killt. Master-D then exits the tank and approaches Ladd, saying that he will use the Federation's forces to take over the world.Bionic Commando (Area 12). Master-D: You woke me from a long sleep. Now I have no more use for you. I'll take over your army and rule the world. Ladd vows to fight against Master-D, who calls Ladd a \\"damn fool\\" and unveils the Albatros.Bionic Commando (Area 12). Master-D: \\"What, you're going to fight against me? You damn fool. If that's what you want, I'll show you the horror of the Albatros!\\" After destroying the Albatros, Ladd encounters a dying comrade named Hal, who gives Ladd a bazooka and tells him that Master-D is escaping and that he needs to shoot the bazooka into the cockpit of Master-D's escape chopper.Bionic Commando (Area 12). Hal: \\"I'm Hal, Master-D is...leaving. I won't last long. I take this bazooka. Go get him! Th ... there is a chopper down here. Aim at the cockpit as you jump. You can do it!\\" Ladd uses his bionic arm to swing himself towards Master-D's escape chopper and fires the bazooka into the cockpit; upon doing so, Ladd screams: \\"Your number's up! Monster!\\" Then, in a series of slow-motion frames, the game shows Master-D's head explode.Bionic Commando (Area 12). The alarm inside the Imperial base then sounds off, saying: \\"This base will explod in 60 seconds.\\"Bionic Commando (Area 12). Voice: This base will explod in 60 seconds. Evacuate right away. Ladd manages to escape the base when he realizes that Super Joe is still inside, and he runs back in to rescue him. The Federation's commander then orders the full evacuation of the base, but then, as the base explodes, a chopper appears with Ladd holding on to Super Joe while hooked on the chopper with his bionic arm.Bionic Commando (Ending). Ladd: \\"Is Joe still inside?\\" [runs back into the base] Commander: \\"What happened to the Captain? We cannot wait any longer. We are going to escape now!\\" MA-1: \\"Please wait just little longer... Hey, what's that?\\" Ladd then informs the commander that he has Joe and that they are returning to the Federation base.Bionic Commando (Ending). Ladd: \\"This is Ladd. Our mission accomplished. Super Joe is safe. We are returning now.\\" The game's ending then shows Federation troops around Ladd and Super Joe as they celebrate their victory. Super Joe then says how the Federation has a new hero in Ladd, while saying how different he feels from the praise given by his comrades.Bionic Commando (Ending). Super Joe: \\"Battle has ended and we have a new hero now. I was feeling different as I received the blessings from comrades.\\" Then, after showing the ending credits, the game forwards to August 2, 2010, which an old Super Joe recalls the entire story and hope that it will live on.Bionic Commando (Ending). Super Joe: \\"Now, so much time has elapsed and I'm old now. I think it's time for me to tell you the whole story. I hope this story will be told for a long time. 2010.8.2 Joe.\\" Development Localization The use of the Nazi Swastika in the Japanese Famicom version (above) was replaced with a new avian symbol for the English NES version (below) For the release of the international version of the game, several changes were made. All references to Nazism in text and imagery were removed for the English localization. The Empire in the Japanese version was actually a neo-Nazi nation and the Imperial Army's insignia was a Nazi Swastika with a thunderbolt behind it. In the English version, the Nazis were referred as the \\"Badds\\" (though the back-story in the American version's manual referred to them as the \\"Nazz\\"). The Imperial Army's Swastika insignia was changed into a new one resembling an eagle, and the leader of the villains, originally called Weizmann in the Japanese version, was renamed Killt. One of the most prominent differences involves the ultimate antagonist of the game, who is meant to be a revived Adolf Hitler in the Japanese version. For the English version, the character was renamed \\"Master-D\\". There is a notably gory ending sequence in which Hitler's face explodes, which was kept intact in the English version.Sandvik, Per Arne (2002-11-15) The Horror! Encyclopedia Obscura. Retrieved on 2008-07-09 In addition to the graphical changes, the difficulty of the game was rebalanced and some of the areas were made less difficult. Music The music for the game was created by videogame music composer Junko Tamiya, who was credited under the pseudonym \\"Gondamin\\". Two songs from the Arcade versions are used in some areas. The music for the original arcade game was developed by Harumi Fujita. Tamiya adapted two of the original arcade tracks (The \\"Bionic Commando Theme\\" and \\"The Powerplant\\") and expanded the soundtrack by adding several more new songs in the console versions for the Japanese Famicom and the NES ports of the game. Reception According to Capcom employee Ben Judd, the game did not sell well in Japan. In 1997 Electronic Gaming Monthly ranked it the 32nd best console video game of all time, assessing that the fact that the player could not jump and had to instead swing around with his bionic arm added an unexpected level of depth to the platform genre. Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article (on page 100) explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible. Nintendo Power ranked it as the 17th best Nintendo Entertainment System video game, describing it as one of the console's most original action games due to the ability to swing. GamesRadar ranked it the fourth best NES game ever made. The staff called it a classic and praised its grappling mechanic. The Japanese magazine Famitsu gave it 26 out of 40. Remakes and re-releases A portable adaptation of Bionic Commando was released for the Game Boy in 1992. The Game Boy version is based on the NES game, featuring the same gameplay and stages, as well as a similar plot, but changes the present day setting of the NES version into a futuristic one. A second remake, titled Bionic Commando Rearmed, was developed by GRIN and released in 2008 as a downloadable title for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC. The original NES version of Bionic Commando is one of three NES games featured in the Game Boy Advance compilation Capcom Classics Mini-Mix, the other two games being Strider and Mighty Final Fight. Novelization The game was novelized as Bionic Commando by J. B. Stamper as part of the Worlds of Power series of novels based on the NES version. The main character is identified as Jack Markson, who loses an arm when ninjas attack his hotel room and kidnap Super Joe. The Federation replaces his missing limb with a bionic arm that has a grappling hook and a number of other gadgets that are not featured in the game, like a flame thrower and a device that forces prisoners to tell the truth. Like most books in the series, violence was toned down to non-lethality in most cases (he usually shoots enemy soldiers with tranquilizers), although certain events, like the deaths of Hal and Killt, are kept. Much of the game's middle is skimmed over in order to fit it all into the book.

McGonigle, Thomas C. McGonigle, James F. Quigley, A History of the Christian Tradition: From the Reformation to the present (1996), p. 94, . When laypersons are among the trustees, the Church seeks agreement with the civil authorities to have the property administered under principles of canon law. The Church often appoints deputies who are responsible to herself. Technically, such administrators, whether cleric or lay, are called the \\"fabric\\" of the Church (Fabrica Ecclesiae). History In very early times ecclesiastical goods were divided into three or four portions, and that part set aside for the upkeep of the Church began to take on the character of a juridical person. The Eleventh Council of Carthage can. ii in 407 requested the civil power to appoint five executors for ecclesiastical property, and in the course of time laymen were called on to take their share in this administration, with the understanding, however, that everything was to be done in the name and with the approbation of the Church. A number of early and medieval synods have dealt with the administration of curators of ecclesiastical property.e.g. can. vii, Conc. Bracar. (563); can. xxxviii, Conc. Mogunt. (813); can. x, Conc. Mogunt. (847); can. xxxv, Conc. Nation. Wirceburg. (1287) The employment of laymen in concert with clerics as trustees became common all over Christendom. In England such officials were called churchwardens. They were generally two in number, one being chosen by the parish priest, the other by the parishioners, and with them were associated others called sidesmen. The churchwardens administered the temporalities of the parish under the supervision of the bishop, to whom they were responsible. An annual report on the administration of church property was made obligatory in all countries by the Council of Trent:Sess. XXII, can. ix, \\"De Ref.\\" \\"The administrators, whether ecclesiastical or lay, of the fabric of any church whatsoever, even though it be a cathedral, as also of any hospital, confratemity, charitable institution called mont de pi√©t√©, and of any pious places whatsoever, shall be bound to give in once a year an account of their administration to the Ordinary.\\" Fabric of the Church The fabric of the church is distinct from the foundation of the benefice, and sometimes the fabric, in addition to the goods destined for the upkeep of divine worship, possesses also schools and eleemosynary institutions.S.C.C., 27 Apr., 1895, in caus. Bergom. All lay trustees must be approved by the bishop, and he retains the right of removing them and of overseeing the details of their administration. In countries in which the church organization was entirely swept away by Protestant Reformation period, as in the British Isles, laymen are less generally employed.For the trustee system, as far as it can be called such, in use in the Catholic Church in England and Ireland see Taunton, \\"The Law of the Church\\", pp. 15, 316. In Holland, laymen were admitted to a share in the administration of church temporalities by a decree of the Propaganda.21 July 1856 The bishop is to nominate the members of the board, over which the parish priest is to preside. Trustees hold office for four years and may be reappointed at the expiration of that term. When a vacancy occurs the board presents two names to the bishop, from which he selects one. In necessary cases the bishop may dismiss any member and even dissolve the entire board of trustees. In this instance, as in all others where laymen are in question, the Holy See is careful to guard the prescriptions of the sacred canons as to the management and ownership of church goods (see administrator (of ecclesiastical property)). United States In the United States the employment of lay trustees was customary in some parts of the country from a very early period. The practice of lay trusteeism in Catholic parishes was influenced by the polity of Congregational churches. Dissensions sometimes arose with the ecclesiastical authorities, and the Holy See has intervened to restore peace. Pope Pius VII vindicated24 Aug., 1822 the rights of the Church as against the pretensions of the trustees, and Pope Gregory XVI declared:12 Aug., 1841 \\"We wish all to know that the office of trustees is entirely dependent upon the authority of the bishop, and that consequently the trustees can undertake nothing except with the approval of the ordinary.\\" The Third Plenary Council of BaltimoreTit. IX, no.287 laid down certain regulations concerning trustees: It belongs to the bishop to judge of the necessity of constituting them, their number and manner of appointment; their names are to be proposed to the bishop by the parish rector; the appointment is to be made in writing and is revocable at the will of the bishop; the trustees selected should be men who have made their Easter duty, who contribute to the support of the Church, who send their children to Catholic schools, and who are not members of prohibited societies; nothing can be done at a board meeting except by the consent of the rector who presides; in case of disagreement between the trustees and the rector, the judgment of the bishop must be accepted. A decree of the Congregation of the Council29 July 1911 declares that the vesting of the title to church property in a board of trustees is a preferable legal form, and that in constituting such boards in the United States, the best method is that in use in New York, by which the Ordinary, his vicar-general, the parish priest, and two laymen approved by the bishop form the corporation. Legal standing of trustees The legal standing of church trustees according to British law is treated by Taunton, \\"The Law of the Church\\", pp. 15, 315. In the United States the legal rights of trustees vary slightly in different States, but the following prescriptions (selected from Scanlan, \\"The Law of Church and Grave\\") hold almost everywhere: When the statute provides that two lay members of the corporation shall be appointed annually by the committee of the congregation, the members of the congregation have no right to elect said two members, and those appointed in the proper manner are lawful officers. When the election of new trustees is invalid, the old trustees hold over until there shall have been a valid election of their successors. The president and secretary of a church corporation have no authority to make a promissory note unless authorized by the board of trustees. When the laws of the organization give control of matters to the board of trustees, the majority of the members of the church cannot control the action of the trustees contrary to the uses and regulations of the church. A court has no authority to control the exercise of the judgment or discretion of the officers of a church in the management of its funds so long as they do not violate its constitutions or by-laws. Excommunication does not always remove an officer of a church corporation. The legal rights of a bishop in regard to the temporalities of a church, where they are not prescribed by the civil law, must rest, if at all, upon the ecclesiastical law, which must be determined by evidence. When property is conveyed to a church having well-known doctrine, faith, and practice, a majority of the members has not the authority or power, by reason of a change of religions views, to carry the property thus designated to a new and different doctrine. The title to church property is in that part of the congregation which acts in harmony with the law of the denomination; and the ecclesiastical laws and principles which were accepted before the dispute began are the standard for determining which party is right.  Recent issues in the United States  In 2005, an interdict was issued to board members of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church (St. Louis, Missouri) in an attempt to get them to turn over the church property to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis. In 2006, a priest was accused of stealing $1.4 million from his parish, prompting a debate over Connecticut Raised Bill 1098 as a means of forcing the Catholic church to manage money differently. Another concern related to disputes over property ownership is whether the dioceses follow for parish suppression. In some cases, parishes have been liquidated and the assets taken by the diocese instead of being distributed to nearby parishes, which in violation of church financial rules.

It extends to the city's recent cultural and economic renaissance. Native Americans There is evidence of Native American presence in Maine as early as 11,000 BCE. At the time of European contact in the sixteenth century, Algonquian speaking people inhabited present-day Portland. French explorer Samuel de Champlain identified these people as the \\"Almouchiquois,\\" a polity stretching from the Androscoggin River to Cape Ann and culturally distinct from their Wampanoag and Abenaki neighbors. According to Captain John Smith in 1614, a semi-autonomous band called the ‚ÄúAucocisco‚Äù inhabited \\"the bottome of a large deepe Bay, full of many great Iles.\\" This bay would later come to be known as Casco Bay, and include the future site of Portland.Bruce J. Borque, Twelve Thousand Years: American Indians in Maine (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2002), 16; Emerson W.

A combination of warfare and disease decimated Native peoples in the years preceding English colonization, creating a \\"shatter zone\\" of devastation and political instability in what would become southern Maine. The introduction of European wares in the 1500s disrupted long-standing Native trade relationships in the northeast. Starting around 1607, Micmacs began raiding their southern neighbors from the Gulf of Maine to Massachusetts in an effort to corner the lucrative fur trade and monopolize access to European goods. The arrival of foreign pathogens only served to compound the violence in the region. A particularly notorious pandemic between 1614 and 1620 ravaged the population of coastal New England with mortality rates at upwards of 90 percent. In this chaotic milieu, groups like the Almouchiquois disappear from the historical record, as they were likely displaced or incorporated into other tribes. However, larger Native communities maintained a presence in the Casco Bay area until King George's War in the 1740s. French military defeat and increasing English settler migration to the area from primarily southern New England impelled most Native Americans to migrate toward the protection of New France, or further up the coast where they remain today.

Settlement A Voyage into New England, written by Capt. Christopher Levett to spur interest in the Maine colony The first European to attempt settlement was Christopher Levett, an English naval captain who was granted from the King of England in 1623 to found a permanent settlement in Casco Bay. Levett proposed naming it York after York, England, the town of his birth. A member of the Plymouth Council for New England and an agent for Sir Ferdinando Gorges, Lord Proprietor of Maine, he returned to England and wrote a book about his voyage, hoping to generate support for the settlement. Christopher Levett, of York: The Pioneer Colonist in Casco Bay, James Baxter Phinney,1893 But his efforts yielded little interest, and Levett never returned to Maine. He did sail to Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630 to confer with Governor John Winthrop, but died during return passage to England. It's unknown what became of the men he left behind at Machigonne. Fort Levett, built in 1894 on Cushing Island in Portland Harbor, is named for him.The Maine Reader: The Down East Experience from 1614 to the Present, Charles E. Shain, 1997 Christopher Levett: The First Owner of the Soil of Portland, Collections of the Maine Historical Society, 1893 The next (and first permanent) settlement came in 1633 when George Cleeve and Richard Tucker established a fishing and trading village. The town was then renamed Casco. In 1658, the Massachusetts Bay Colony took control of the area, changing its name again, this time to Falmouth after Falmouth, England, the site of an important Parliamentary victory in the English Civil War. An obelisk monument at the end of Congress Street, where it meets the Eastern Promenade, commemorates the four historical names of Portland. Austin J. Coolidge & John B. Mansfield, A History and Description of New England; Boston, Massachusetts 1859Joseph Conforti, \\"Creating Portland: History and Place in Northern New England;\\" Lebanon, New Hampshire 2005  Raid on Portland (1676)  In 1676, the village was completely destroyed by the Abenaki people during King Philip's War. When English colonists returned in 1678, they erected Fort Loyal on India Street to ward off future attacks.  Battle of Portland (1690)  Fort Casco, Portland, Maine built by Wolfgang William Romer; map by Cyprian Southack The village was again destroyed in 1690 during King William's War by a combined force of 400-500 French and Indians in the Battle of Fort Loyal. Portland's peninsula was deserted for more than ten years after the attack. Massachusetts built another fort to the north of the Presumpscot River in present-day Falmouth called Fort New Casco in 1698. Fort New Casco was successfully defended during the Northeast Coast Campaign (1703) of Queen Anne's War. The Fort Loyal fort at the base of India Street was used throughout King George's War and then repaired during the French and Indian War in 1755.p.431  American Revolution  On October 18, 1775, the community was destroyed yet again, bombarded for 9 hours during the Revolutionary War by the Royal Navy's HMS Canceaux under command of Lieutenant Henry Mowat.

Nelson, \\"Burning Falmouth,\\" MHQ: Quarterly Journal of Military History, Autumn 2009, Vol. 22 Issue 1, pp 62-69 Trade and shipping center Portland from the harbor in 1853 Free and Congress Streets in 1857 Following the war, a section of Falmouth called The Neck developed as a commercial port and began to grow rapidly as a shipping center. In 1786, the citizens of Falmouth formed a separate town in Falmouth Neck and named it Portland. Portland's economy was greatly stressed by the Embargo Act of 1807 (prohibition of trade with the British), which ended in 1809, and the War of 1812, which ended in 1815. In 1820, Maine became a state and Portland was selected as its capital. The Abyssinian Meeting House, the 3rd Meeting House founded by Free African Americans, was founded in 1828 on Newbury Street in the East End. In 1832, the capital was moved to Augusta. Austin J. Coolidge & John B. Mansfield, A History and Description of New England; Boston, Massachusetts 1859 In 1851, Maine led the nation by passing the first state law to prohibit the sale of alcohol except for \\"medicinal, mechanical or manufacturing purposes.\\" The law subsequently became known as the Maine law as 18 states quickly followed Maine. Portland was a center for protests against the law, and the protests culminated on June 2, 1855 in the Portland Rum Riot. Between 1,000 and 3,000 people opposed to the law gathered because Neal S. Dow, the mayor of Portland and a Maine Temperance Society leader, had authorized a shipment of $1,600 of \\"medicinal and mechanical alcohol.\\" The protesters believed, falsely, that this shipment was for private use. When the protesters failed to disperse, Dow ordered the militia to fire. One man was killed and seven were wounded. Following the outcome of the Portland Rum Riot, the Maine law was repealed in 1856. William Willis, History of Portland, Maine from 1632 to 1865; Bailey & Noyes, Portland, Maine 1865 The Cumberland and Oxford Canal extended waterborne commerce from Portland harbor to Sebago Lake and Long Lake in 1832. Portland became the primary ice-free winter seaport for Canadian exports upon completion of the Grand Trunk Railway to Montreal in 1853. The city's major passenger rail terminal, Union Station, was opened in 1888. In the 19th century, The Portland Company manufactured more than 600 steam locomotives. Portland became a 20th-century rail hub as five additional rail lines merged into Portland Terminal Company in 1911. Canadian export traffic was diverted from Portland to Halifax, Nova Scotia following nationalization of the Grand Trunk system in 1923; and 20th-century icebreakers later enabled ships to reach Montreal throughout the winter. William Willis, History of Portland, Maine from 1632 to 1865; Bailey & Noyes, Portland, Maine 1865 Regional cosmopolitan capital John Neal Portland's period of greatest cosmopolitan prominence was in the first four decades of the nineteenth century, when the city was \\"a rival, and not a satellite of either Boston or New York.\\" In that period, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow got his start as a young poet and John Neal held a central position in leading American literature toward its great renaissance. Other notable literary or artistic figures who got their start or were at their prime in that period include Grenville Mellen, Nathaniel Parker Willis, Seba Smith, Elizabeth Oakes Smith, Benjamin Paul Akers, Charles Codman, Franklin Simmons, John Rollin Tilton, and Harrison Bird Brown. The Great Fire and rebuilding Old Public Library c. 1905 (now the Baxter Building, The VIA Agency) The Great Fire of July 4, 1866, ignited during the Independence Day celebration, destroyed most of the commercial buildings in the city, half the churches and hundreds of homes. More than 10,000 people were left homeless. After this fire, Portland was rebuilt with brick and took on a Victorian appearance. Prosperous citizens began building mansions in the city's fashionable West End. George J. Varney, History of Portland, Maine; Boston, Massachusetts 1886 The quality and style of architecture in Portland is in large part due to the succession of well-known 19th-century architects who worked in the city. Alexander Parris (1780‚Äì1852) arrived about 1800 and endowed Portland with numerous Federal style buildings, although some were lost in the 1866 fire. Charles A. Alexander (1822‚Äì1882) designed numerous Victorian mansions. Henry Rowe (1810‚Äì1870) specialized in Gothic cottages. George M. Harding (1827‚Äì1910) designed many of the commercial buildings in Portland's Old Port, as well as ornate residential buildings. Around the turn of the century, Frederick A. Tompson (1857‚Äì1919) also designed many of city's residential buildings. William Willis, History of Portland, Maine from 1632 to 1865; Bailey & Noyes, Portland, Maine 1865 But by far the most influential and prolific architects of the West End area were Francis H. Fassett (1823‚Äì1908) and John Calvin Stevens (1855‚Äì1940). Fassett was commissioned to build the Maine General Hospital Building (now a wing of the Maine Medical Center) and the Williston West Church as well as many other churches, schools, commercial buildings, apartment buildings, private residences, and his own duplex home on Pine Street. From the early 1880s to the 1930s Stevens worked in a wide range of styles from the Queen Anne and Romanesque popular at the beginning of his career, to the Mission Revival Style of the 1920s, but the architect is best known for his pioneering efforts in the Shingle and Colonial Revival styles, examples of which abound in this area. In 1895‚Äì1896, electric streetcars replaced horse-drawn carriages as the primary method of transportation into and around Portland. A week-long strike disrupted transportion beginning on July 12, 1916 and lasted until July 17. The laborers, with widespread community support, won union recognition and other improvements.Babcock, Robert H. \\"Will You Walk? Yes, we'll Walk!: Popular Support for a Street Railway Strike in Portland, Maine.\\" Labor History, vol. 35, no. 3, 1994, pp. 372-398. Second World War Casco Bay became destroyer base Sail when the United States Navy began escorting HX, SC, and ON convoys of the Battle of the Atlantic. Destroyer tender provided repair services at Portland from 12 September 1941 until 5 July 1944.Mooney, James L. Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships (1959-1981) Convoy escorts as large as battleships used the large protected anchorage adjacent to good railway facilities for delivery of supplies. Sailors on shore leave enjoyed Portland's recreational opportunities, and the waters offshore were suitable for gunnery practice. Construction of facilities began in the summer of 1941, and ultimately included a Fleet Post Office, Naval Dispensary, Navy routing office, Navy Relief Society office, registered publications issuing office, Port Director, Portland harbor entrance control post, Maritime Commission depot, and headquarters for the Portland sections of the naval local defense force and inshore patrol. There was a Navy recruiting station, an armed forces induction station, and a naval training center. Radio direction finder and LORAN training was at the fleet signal station; and the naval receiving station included schools for destroyer communications officers and signalman, radioman, and quartermaster strikers. Unused piers adjacent to the Grand Trunk Railway yard were converted to training facilities for combat information center (CIC), night visual lookouts, surface and aircraft recognition, search and fire control radar operators, gunnery spotting, anti-aircraft machine guns, and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) attack. Little Chebeague Island was used for a fire fighters school; and torpedo control officers were trained near the navy supply pier, naval fuel annex, and Casco Bay Naval Auxiliary Air Facility (NAAF) seaplane base built on Long Island. Decline and revival First National Bank, corner of Middle and Exchange streets, c. 1910 The erection of the Maine Mall, an indoor shopping center established in the suburb of South Portland during the 1970s, had a significant effect on Portland's downtown. Department stores and other major franchises, many from Congress Street or Free Street, either moved to the nearby mall or went out of business. This was a mixed blessing for locals, protecting the city's character (chain stores are often uninterested in it now) but led to a number of empty storefronts. Residents had to venture out of town for certain products and services no longer available on the peninsula. But now the old seaport is attracting residents and investment. Because of the city government's emphasis on preservation, much of the opulent Victorian architecture of Portland's rebuilding has been restored. In 1982, the area was entered on the National Register of Historic Places. In modern lifestyle surveys, it is often cited as one of America's best small cities to live in. Portland is currently experiencing a building boom, although more controlled and conservative than the 1980s building boom. In recent years, Congress Street has become home to more stores and eateries, spurred on by the expanding Maine College of Art and the conversion of office buildings to high- end condos. Rapid development is occurring in the historically industrial Bayside neighborhood, as well as the emerging harborside Ocean Gateway neighborhood at the base of Munjoy Hill. Since the mid-1990s, Maine College of Art has been a revitalizing force in the downtown area, bringing in students from around the country, and restoring the historic Porteous building on Congress Street as its main facility.

The conference is organised by the member owned company OmnisWorld.org after the conference creator, Fred Brinkman returned to the spiritual world in 2011.  Conference Format  In past years the EurOmnis conference has followed a structured session-based programme, but starting in 2007 centres on smaller sessions that encourage more two-way communication. Main goal for the format change is offering new ways for conference attendees to really learn. The only tracks to remain in structured sessions are the so- called ‚ÄòStudio 101 Course‚Äô, usually held by David Swain, author, trainer and long-term Omnis developer, which shows beginners the basics of using Omnis Studio to develop enterprise applications, and the so-called 'SQL-101 Course', a complete course on connecting Studio to different back-ends, hosted by Joe Maus.  History  EurOmnis was created in 1999 by Fred Brinkman and Nick Harris as a forum for Omnis developers from all over the world to learn and develop new ideas and techniques for using Omnis Studio. It was the follow-up of a highly successful conference put together by Bruno Huyssen in 1998, a conference now known in the Omnis developer community as 'The Woodstock' of all Omnis conferences. In March 2002 the conference format was brought to London, Ontario, in Canada by David Ferri, Clifford Illkay and Fred Haislmaier under the AmerOmnis Banner. Again one year later the EurOmnis format was ported to Australia, laying the foundations for the OzOmnis conferences. In 2003 Gavin Foster took over as joint organizer of EurOmnis as Fred Brinkman retired from the role due to other obligations, in 2007 the latter returned as conference organizer, deploying the 'EurOmnis, The Next Generation'-concept, abandoning the 'class'-format and introducing smaller and more intimate sessions, giving attendees a possibility to choose topics of interest and put together their own conference. EurOmnis, The Next Generation presents attendees with opportunities to get the information they want or solve the problems they have. Formal conferences have never been a place to solve problems but a place to listen to people doing presentations. EurOmnis, The Next Generation, changed that.

It was established in 2010 as a merger of three major Finnish universities: the Helsinki University of Technology (established 1849), the Helsinki School of Economics (established 1904), and the University of Art and Design Helsinki (established 1871). The close collaboration between the scientific, business and arts communities is intended to foster multi-disciplinary education and research. The Finnish government, in 2010, set out to create a university that fosters innovation, merging the three institutions into one. The university is composed of six schools with close to 17,500 students and 4,000 staff members, making it Finland's second largest university. The main campus of Aalto University is located in Otaniemi, Espoo. Aalto University Executive Education operates in the district of T√∂√∂l√∂, Helsinki. In addition to the Greater Helsinki area, the university also operates its Bachelor's Programme in International Business in Mikkeli and the Mets√§hovi Radio Observatory in Kirkkonummi. Aalto University's operations showcase Finland's experiment in higher education. The Aalto Design Factory, Aalto Ventures Program and Aalto Entrepreneurship Society (Aaltoes), among others, drive the university's mission for a radical shift towards multidisciplinary learning and have contributed substantially to the emergence of Helsinki as a hotbed for startups. Aaltoes is Europe's largest and most active student run entrepreneurship community that has founded major concepts such as the Startup Sauna accelerator program and the Slush startup event. The university is named in honour of Alvar Aalto, a prominent Finnish architect, designer and alumnus of the former Helsinki University of Technology, who was also instrumental in designing a large part of the university's main campus in Otaniemi.  History  In 2004, a workgroup led by Anne Brunila of the Finnish Ministry of Finance concluded that Finland had too many universities and other institutes of tertiary education which should be consolidated. Following this, Yrj√∂ Sotamaa, president of the University of Art and Design Helsinki at the time, proposed the merger of Aalto University's founding schools in his president's opening speech in 2005. Sotamaa's line of reasoning was that this move would create a unique interdisciplinary university that was needed to create new innovative thought. The idea received attention within the Finnish Ministry of Education, which appointed Raimo Sailas, a leading official at the Ministry of Finance, to investigate the possibility of a merger. After Sailas' group reported that it considered the merger to be beneficial to the Finnish academic world and economy, the Finnish government decided to go on with the project on November 11, 2007. On May 29, 2008, the government announced that the new university would be named after the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto in honor of his achievements in technology, economics and art. The Finnish Minister of Education at the time, Ms. Sari Sarkomaa, together with representatives of Finnish industries and professional organisations, signed the Aalto University charter on June 25, 2008 in Helsinki. On December 19, 2008, Prof. Tuula Teeri was selected by the Board to be the first President of Aalto University. Aalto University started operating on January 1, 2010. In the process of creating the university the university law of Finland was rewritten for the university to be allowed to collect endowment. The university managed to reach its goal of collecting 200 million euros in private donations. The sum was augmented by 2.5 times by the Finnish state. In a 2017 analysis by The Times Higher Education, Aalto University ranked 55th among technology challenger universities.  Helsinki University of Technology  Surveying students with professor in the early days of the university of technology. As the Aalto University was founded the four schools of science and engineering were formed out of the departments of the Helsinki University of Technology (TKK), founded in 1849 by Grand Duke Nicholas I. It received university status in 1908. In 1966, the University of Technology moved from Hietalahti in downtown Helsinki to its current Otaniemi campus, designed by Alvar Aalto. At the time of creation of Aalto University, TKK had about 250 professors and approximately 15,000 students. This means the largest part of the Aalto University is formed from the former Helsinki University of Technology. In 2011, the former University of Technology (then known as Aalto University School of Science and Technology) was split up into four schools, corresponding to the former TKK faculties: School of Chemical Technology (CHEM), School of Electrical Engineering (ELEC), School of Engineering (ENG), and School of Science (SCI).  Helsinki School of Economics  The Helsinki School of Economics (HSE) was established in Helsinki in 1904 by the business community and was given the status of a university in 1911. It operated as a private university until 1974, when the state of Finland was given the financial responsibility of the university. Following the merger, the university was briefly renamed Aalto University School of Economics, and is currently known as Aalto University School of Business (Aalto BIZ).  University of Art and Design Helsinki  Leo Mechelin served as one of the first presidents of the school of art and design. The University of Art and Design Helsinki has been the largest art university in the Nordic countries. It was founded in 1871. Media Centre Lume - the National Research and Development Center of audiovisual media - is also located in the university. The university awarded the following academic degrees: Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, and Doctor of Arts. The university has been active in establishing research projects and industrial collaborations via the private sector. During the rectorship of Yrj√∂ Sotamaa the university was active in integrating design into Finnish innovation networks. Following the merger, the university was briefly renamed Aalto University School of Art and Design. In 2012, the Department of Architecture, which historically has been a part of the Helsinki University of Technology, was moved to the school, and the name was changed to Aalto University School of Art, Design and Architecture (Aalto ARTS). The department of photography at Aalto University School of Art, Design and Architecture (Aalto ARTS) is home to what is known as The Helsinki School, a selected group of photographers from Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture that has been the model for a new approach to education as well as a vehicle for collaborative thought and cooperation.  Administration and organisation   Governance  The university, which is incorporated as Aalto University Foundation, is governed by the seven-member Aalto University Foundation Board. The Board decides on the Foundation's strategy, operation and financial issues, is responsible for any far-reaching plans and appoints the University president and vice rectors. Formerly working as the Provost of Aalto University, Ilkka Niemel√§ was elected President of Aalto University in 2017. The first President of Aalto University was Tuula Teeri. The university is organized into six schools with their respective deans and administrative structures.  Schools  The university is organized since the beginning of 2011 into six schools formed out of the three merged universities. Each school has several departments and separate laboratories as well as a number of separate research and other units. * School of Arts, Design and Architecture (Aalto ARTS) * School of Chemical Engineering (Aalto CHEM) * School of Business (Aalto BIZ) * School of Electrical Engineering (Aalto ELEC) * School of Engineering (Aalto ENG) * School of Science (Aalto SCI)  Other units and institutes  * Aaltoes (Aalto Entrepreneurship Society), student-run entrepreneurship community * Aalto University Learning Centre * Aalto University Executive Education * Factories ‚Äì interdisciplinary collaboration networks: ** Design Factory ** Media Factory * Aalto Science Institute ‚Äì interdisciplinary research initiative * Helsinki Institute for Information Technology (joint research unit with University of Helsinki) * Helsinki Institute of Physics (operated jointly with University of Helsinki, University of Jyv√§skyl√§, Lappeenranta University of Technology and Tampere University of Technology) * Mets√§hovi Radio Observatory is part of Aalto ELEC.  Academics   Studies  = Study in Science and Technology = A lecture of mathematics for undergraduates inside the main building. All engineering programmes offered by the schools of science and technology lead to the degree of diplomi-insin√∂√∂ri (M.Sc.(Tech.), Master of Science in Technology), a five- year taught master's degree, which is fairly similar to the German degrees. From 2005, according to the Bologna process, all students must also complete a bachelor's degree (B.Sc.(Tech), Bachelor of Science in Technology), in Finnish tekniikan kandidaatti or TkK, before the DI or architect's degree. However, the schools of science and technology do not offer programs terminating in a bachelor's degree; a student may only be accepted to study for the Master's level degree. The schools of science and technology require a bachelor's degree from foreign students studying in English, because only Master's studies are offered completely in English. Undergraduate studies are generally quite similar in between different programs with a considerable part being taken by a tuition of a solid base in mathematics and physics. Apart from numerous programs in Finnish/Swedish, various international Master's programs are offered exclusively for studies in English. The postgraduate degrees given are tekniikan lisensiaatti (Lic.Sc.(Tech.), Licenciate of Science in Technology) and tekniikan tohtori (D.Sc.(Tech.), Doctor of Science in Technology). Finnish students are accepted mainly on the basis of result in the national DIA entrance exam. The exam variant taken by most entrants mainly tests quantitative ability in mathematics, physics and chemistry, but specialized tests are available for students applying to a number of programs. The score required for entry to the Aalto University varies much depending on the intended field of study, however, in general the scores required for the Aalto University are higher than for any other university granting entry through the DIA exam. For example, the mean sum of mathematics and physics DIA exam scores was 7.2 in the year 2010, whereas the mean minimum sum of mathematics and physics exam scores for gaining admission to an Aalto program was 17.1-20.1, depending on the priority point distribution. Aalto also contains five of the most selective programs with respect to the matriculation exam scores, out of approximately total of 50 university technology programs in the nation, of which approximately 30 are outside of Aalto, and the three most selective programs with respect to entrance exam and combined scores. The minimum scores required for these top programs are in the 95th-99th percentile range of the whole applicant pool, and approximately 98th-99.8th percentile of what would be the score distribution of the whole age group. = Study in Arts, Design and Architecture = The School of Arts, Design and Architecture has been a leader in art and design education in Finland for over 138 years.

Research  Radio science done with the receiver in the Planck probe reveals the age and composition of the universe. Aalto University has defined four fundamental competence areas: ICT and digitalisation, Materials and sustainable use of natural resources, Global business dynamics and Art and design knowledge building. In addition to these, the university invests in three integrative multidisciplinary themes: Advanced energy solutions, Health and wellbeing, and Human-centred living environments. Researchers at Aalto University have achieved notability in, among other things, low temperature physics (holding the current world record for the lowest temperature achieved), the development of devices and methods for magnetoencephalography, mobile communications, wood processing, and neural networks, with professor Teuvo Kohonen initiating research in self-organizing maps. Additionally, the first commercialised total synthesis, the synthesis of camphor, was invented by Gustaf Komppa, the first professor of chemistry at TKKKemia-lehti. and the Nobel laureate (chemistry, 1945) Artturi Virtanen held a professorship in biochemistry at TKK. More recently, the university has notably invested in the research of nanotechnology, operating the largest cleanroom facility in Northern Europe and one of the largest microscopy clusters in Europe. MilliLab, a joint laboratory of VTT and Aalto University, built one of the radio receivers in the Planck probe, which maps the cosmic microwave background for determining the age and composition of the universe.  Centres of Excellence  Aalto University participates in seven Centres of Excellence (), selected by the Academy of Finland to represent the top research in the country, and receiving separate, fixed-period funding from the Academy. Currently, the following units are designated Centres of Excellence. * Centre of Excellence in Computational Nanoscience * Centre of Excellence in Computational Inference * Centre of Excellence in Laser Scanning Research * Centre of Excellence in Low Temperature Quantum Phenomena and Devices * Centre of Excellence in Molecular Engineering of Biosynthetic Hybrid Materials * Centre of Excellence in Molecular Systems Immunology and Physiology, together with University of Helsinki and University of Turku * Centre of Excellence in Research on Solar Long-Term Variability and Effects, together with University of Oulu and Finnish Meteorological Institute  Network Memberships  * BALTECH * Conference of European Schools for Advanced Engineering Education and Research (CESAER) * Consortium Linking Universities of Science and Technology for Education and Research (CLUSTER) * Cumulus * Global Education for European Engineers and Entrepreneurs (GE4) * The European Association for the Transfer of Technologies, Innovation and Industrial Information (TII) * T.I.M.E.

Campuses  The main university campus is located in Otaniemi, Espoo. The university also has activities in T√∂√∂l√∂, Mikkeli and . thumb  Otaniemi Campus  Since 2019, all of the Aalto University schools have been primarily located in Otaniemi, Espoo, roughly from the center of Helsinki. The original buildings of the campus were designed by Alvar Aalto. Several high-tech companies, the Finnish forest industry's joint experimental laboratory KCL, and business incubators Innopoli and Technopolis are also situated nearby. It is also directly adjacent to Keilaniemi, with the Life Science Center and the headquarters of several notable Finnish companies, such as Kone and Fortum. The Aalto University metro station connects Otaniemi to Helsinki via the L√§nsimetro line. The \\"Teekkarikyl√§\\" Student Village, home to over 2,000 students, makes up the majority of residences in Otaniemi. There are over one hundred student organizations on campus, which provide a range of opportunities to take part in pastimes of various kinds, from sports to music.  Other locations  Aalto University retains ownership of the former campus of the School of Business, located in T√∂√∂l√∂, Helsinki. As of 2019, the building is under renovation and primarily used by Aalto University Executive Education The School of Business also maintains a Bachelor's Programme in International Business, which is taught in Mikkeli. The university also owns and operates the Mets√§hovi Radio Observatory in Kirkkonummi.  Culture and student life  A traditional Finnish technology student's hat () photographed on top of a mirror. The Aalto University students are known for active student life. An integral part of many student traditions play the brightly colored overalls worn to many events. The color of the overall signals what the student studies (e.g. the economy students are recognized from dollar green overalls). The student community has also organised important charity events. In fact, the name for these events tempaus, has entered common language to describe any carnival-like charity event. The students of technology () are especially noticeable, as they wear a distinctive hat with a tuft on many occasions (both formal and informal). Technology students are also famous for, and Finland's leading practitioners of, student pranks (j√§yn√§), similar in principle to MIT hacks. Their most widely publicised stunt took place in 1961, when a team of students smuggled a statue of Paavo Nurmi onto the 300-year-old wreck of Regalskeppet Vasa just days before its lifting from the bottom of the sea.Ilta-Sanomat 5 July 1961 \\"Vasan veijarit\\", scan available at archive.org dump of ttky.fi. Although student traditions vary in between the different constituent schools common activities started to burgeon early after the foundation of Aalto University. The most noticeable student event of the first year of the university was Aalto on Tracks, where a group of 100 students came together to rent a private train which they traveled 10 000 km on from Helsinki to the Shanghai Expo enjoying multidisciplinary talks and workshops on the way. The event was such a success that the follow-up Aalto on waves is planned to arrange a trip by boat to South America. Aalto on Tracks also spurred students of Tongji University to arrange Tongji on Tracks which essentially takes the journey of Aalto on Tracks in the opposite direction. Aalto Entrepreneurship Society is a multi-disciplinary society uniting students and graduates of all disciplines of the University. It aims to encourage high-tech, high-growth, scalable entrepreneurship by arranging get- togethers to spark ideas and innovations and aid start-up initiatives among the Aalto students.  Aalto Festival  Aalto Festival (formerly known as Masters of Aalto, and the Masters of Arts festival) is an annual event in May where the new professionals of the multidisciplinary university meet the public. An extensive exhibition showcases a wide array of works: everything from distinguished theses, individual statements, concepts and products arising from commercial collaboration to works of art. For the graduating students, the exhibition is an opportunity to interact with society, future employers, the media and other influential parties. Aalto Festival offers a varying program with exhibitions, seminars, discussions, films, workshops and guided tours.  Student Union  Aalto University Student Union (, AYY in short) is the official student union of Aalto University. Every bachelor's and master's degree student enrolled in Aalto University is a member of the Student Union. The purpose of AYY is to represent the students, look after their interests, and support the community of 15,000 students. AYY provides its members with a variety of services such as healthcare, recreation and housing. The Student Union is financed by membership fees, investments and profits from student housing. Aalto University Student Union was formed in the beginning of 2010 through a merger between the respective student unions of the merged universities. The Aalto University is also one of the two universities in Finland to host one or more Nations, a Finnish type of student corporation. AU's only nation is Teknologf√∂reningen (TF) and its goal is to unite Swedish-speaking students at the university. The nation is housed in its peculiar building called Urdsgjallar. Since 1972, when the corresponding Finnish-speaking nation Tekniikan Ylioppilaat was abolished, there are no nations for the Finnish-speaking students, though the 15 regional nations at the University of Helsinki, both Finnish- and Swedish-speaking, do welcome AU students as members.Osakunnat ‚Äì Nationerna.

Associations  The Retuper√§ WBK is a student band that parodies a volunteer fire brigade brass band. In this picture Retuper√§ is performing in central Helsinki on top of their fire truck. In addition to the student union, Aalto university students have formed numerous associations for studies, cultural activity and sports. There are more than 150 associations maintained by university students. = List of student associations = Currently this list includes only the associations known to have English wikipedia articles. * The Polytech Choir () * Polyteknikkojen Ilmailukerho (Flying club) * Helsinki Academic Male Choir KYL ()  Student housing  The housing area of Otaniemi campus, known as Teekkarikyl√§ (technology student village), is owned mostly by the student union and partly by HOAS (Helsinki Student Housing Fund). The housing is characterised by the presence of foreign students of many nationalities. As of 2005, the village offers housing for approximately 2,600 students. Construction of the Otaniemi campus was started in 1950, in order for the first buildings to host the athletes of the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Some of the building material originally used for the campus was acquired from the former Soviet Union embassy, which had been destroyed during World War II, as a result of bombings by the Soviet Union itself. The student housing has been used for housing athletes again in e.g. the 2005 World Championships in Athletics, sometimes to the dismay of the students that have to move out during the events. The quality of the Otaniemi student housing holds a high standard in international comparison. Some student housing is also available in the vicinity of the other campuses. The Otaniemi campus also contains the former student union building Dipoli, named as the second Poli, the successor of the first student union building in downtown Helsinki. Dipoli was designed by Reima and Raili Pietil√§ and completed in 1966. In 1993, the building was permanently rented to the university to act as a conference and continuing education center and later sold due to high maintenance costs. It is regularly used for conventions, congresses and student parties.  Notable people and famous alumni  All three constituent schools have played an integral part in educating many of the top names in their respective fields in Finland. After the Second World War Finland's economy grew and Finnish companies became players in the international markets requiring highly educated expertise and leadership. Both the schools of technology and economy catered to this need as the premier schools of their fields in the country. During the latter part of the 20th century the schools had to increase their student intake considerably to meet the demands of growing markets. File:Gunnar Nordstr√∂m.jpgGunnar Nordstr√∂m D.Sc.

It is located east of Porterville, California within Inyo National Forest and Sequoia National Forest. It is in size and was created by the US Congress in 1978 as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. The wilderness is managed by the U.S. Forest Service. The wilderness is named for and protects the habitat of California's state freshwater fish, the golden trout. Elevations range from about to . Within the wilderness are portions of the Kern Plateau, the Great Western Divide's southern extension, and the main stem of the Kern River, the South Fork of the Kern and the Little Kern River. The wilderness area is bordered on the northeast and northwest by the high peaks of the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains. Cirque Peak is the high point at .  Kern Plateau  Golden Trout Wilderness, one day after a rainstorm, just south of Farewell Gap The Kern Plateau is a large tableland with sprawling meadows, narrow grasslands along streams, and forested ridges and flats. The centerpiece of the plateau is Kern Peak (11,443 ft) which has far-reaching vistas of the middle and upper Kern River drainage and much of the far southern Sierra, including Olancha Peak, the southern Kaweah Range, the mountains of the Mineral King area, and the Dome Land Wilderness of the far southern Sierra. Located in both Sequoia and Inyo national forests, this plateau had been the center of a battle between preservationists and multiple- use advocates. Before 1947, there was little incentive to develop the area, but that changed with the Secretary of Agriculture's plan to manage the area along multiple-use guidelines due to its proximity to population centers. In addition, there was an epidemic of insect damage in the commercial timber, which was estimated at 30 million board feet.Godfrey, Anthony p. 387 A growing market for lumber added more pressure to develop the area and in 1956, a multiple-use management plan was completed that included a timber sale on the plateau. Wilderness advocates wanted to preserve the plateau, and opposed the Forest Service plan at public meetings. But, because no new facts were presented, the Forest Service went ahead with the timber sale which included building an access road. The sale contract contained special provisions to assure that the timber operators recognized them as they logged. A second road was constructed despite strong opposition from the Sierra Club, The Wilderness Society and the Kern Plateau Association. The Kern Plateau controversy in the 1950s deepened the chasm between the Forest Service and wilderness proponents. According to former Regional Forester Doug Leisz, \\"The Kern Plateau use controversy was the beginning of the preservationists vs. use fight which has since touched public lands over the entire country,\\" although an argument can be made that the battle over the Hetch Hetchy Valley with John Muir was the beginning.Godfrey, Anthony pp 388-389  Wildlife  Wildlife includes the large Monache deer herd, the sensitive Sierra Nevada red fox, pine martens, cougars, and black bears.  California state fish  The golden trout The golden trout is California's state fish.The golden trout (Salmo agua-bonita) is native only to California and was named the official state fish by act of the State Legislature in 1947. Originally the species was found only in a few streams in the icy headwaters of the Kern River. Stocking of wild and hatchery-reared fish has extended its range to many waters at high elevation in the Sierra Nevada from El Dorado and Alpine Counties southward. It has also been planted in other states. Source: The golden trout is closely related to two other rainbow trout subspecies found in this wilderness. The Little Kern golden trout (O. m. whitei), found in the Little Kern River basin, and the Kern River rainbow trout (O. m. gilberti), found in the Kern River system. Together, these three trout form what is sometimes referred to as the \\"Golden Trout Complex\\".Inland Fishes of California, By Peter B. Moyle. Page 20. The Little Kern golden trout is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.  Recreation and restrictions  Casa Vieja Guard Station, at Casa Vieja Meadows, Mount Whitney Ranger District, circa 1976. Built in 1959. Recreational activities include backpacking, horseback riding, swimming, day hiking, fishing, hunting, rock climbing, mountaineering, skiing, snowshoeing and Off-roading. There are of trail including the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), which stays above elevation for most of the route through the Golden Trout Wilderness. There are historical sites such as the Tunnel Meadow and Casa Vieja guard stations, and the 12-mile trail to Jordan Hot Springs along Ninemile Creek. The trail was built in 1861 by John Jordan for access to Olancha from Visalia. Past volcanic activity created the hot springs as well as Groundhog Cone and the Golden Trout Volcanic Field. Permits are required for all overnight use and there is a quota in effect for the Cottonwood Pass Trailhead. Other restrictions include a ban on wood-fueled fires along the PCT between Cottonwood Pass to the Sequoia-Kings Canyon Wilderness and also at the Rocky Basin Lake area.

It intersects two county routes, several local roads, and a reference route‚ÄîNY 912T‚Äîwhich connects it with US 9\\\\. NY 373 is the only connector between US 9 and the hamlet of Port Kent and the ferry that serves it. The hamlet of Port Kent and the connecting road were originally built in 1823. The village was planned to act as a source of labor for iron manufacturing and to provide for the industrial needs of Essex County. The hamlet grew and eventually became connected to Burlington, Vermont, via an hour-long ferry across Lake Champlain. The road that accessed Port Kent originally began in Keeseville, but became part of the longer Port Kent and Hopkinton Turnpike in the 1830s. The highway that is now NY 373 was also designated as part of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway in 1919. When NY 373 was designated in 1930, a small portion of it was maintained by the town of Chesterfield. This section was turned over to the State of New York during a maintenance swap with Essex County in 1985. Route description NY 373, located entirely within Adirondack Park, begins at US 9 at the Ausable Chasm, a deep, wooded canyon in the town of Chesterfield. The route intersects with NY 912T, its southern connector to US 9, about in. NY 373 continues farther along and intersects with County Route 71 (CR 71) before heading east-southeast just north of the Ausable River. The highway then intersects CR 17 and several local roads, and then turns east-northeast. alt=A two-lane highway in a forested area on a clear day in early autumn. After a slight curve in the foreground, it goes straight through the woods to a distant vanishing point. The route then passes south of a golf course and enters Port Kent, where it intersects with more local streets, most of which serve homes and businesses. The highway turns northward soon afterward, crosses a pair of train tracks maintained by Canadian Pacific Railway and the Port Kent Amtrak station, makes a U-turn and comes to an end at the Burlington‚ÄìPort Kent Ferry landing. The Burlington‚ÄìPort Kent Ferry connects NY 373 and the hamlet of Port Kent to the city of Burlington, Vermont. This, one of three ferries to cross Lake Champlain, is the longest as it crosses the widest part of the lake. It is maintained by the Lake Champlain Transportation Company, and is open all seasons except winter. History Port Kent and the early highway to Keeseville In 1823, a company was funded to establish a settlement and fishing wharf opposite the city of Burlington, Vermont on Lake Champlain in order to assist in the growth of iron factories and to supply dormant energy to the Essex County area. The newly founded company chose the name \\"Port Kent\\" and located the new hamlet on a site north of Trembleau Point. The original alignment of what is now NY 373 began as a wide road that was built to access Port Kent from the nearby village of Keeseville. NY 373 exists entirely within the boundaries of Adirondack Park, a protected area maintained by the State of New York. Adirondack Park was created in the 1880s after concerns arose about logging trees in the area. The logging was a substantial part of New York's economy, but protests were lodged by The New York Times and others against the clearing of entire mountains and wilderness areas of trees. Public opinion turned firmly against the loggers by the 1880s, and the park was created in 1885. It was the first State Forest Preserve in America. The park was further protected in 1894 when a clause was added to the New York Constitution which banned the selling of timber from state parks.. Old roads and designation alt=A two-lane highway turns to the left as it approaches a body of water. To the right of the highway is a NY 373 shield. On April 16, 1827, a team of three surveyors were commissioned to determine a routing for a new highway leading from Hopkinton, a town in northeastern St. Lawrence County, to Lake Champlain. The task took 26 days, after which it was determined that the highway would meet Lake Champlain at Fort Kent. An act authorizing the construction of the highway was passed by the New York State Legislature on April 18, 1829. A total of approximately $38,500 (equivalent to $ in ) was devoted to the project by the state of New York through the same act. The highway opened in 1833 as a toll road named the Port Kent and Hopkinton Turnpike. The turnpike had only one toll gate, located near the center of the route. Two years later, the turnpike commissioners petitioned to the state of New York, asking for permission to replace the single gate with two gates at opposite ends of the turnpike that would collect half of the toll amount. The commissioners believed that the change in the toll gate locations would result in higher revenue, allowing them to continue maintaining the highway. The change was approved; however, the toll road was dissolved anyway three years later on March 30, 1838. At that time, maintenance of the Port Kent‚ÄìHopkinton highway was transferred to the towns through which it ran. The Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, a transcontinental auto trail extending from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, was established in 1919. In eastern New York, the highway went through Keeseville, Ausable Chasm, and Fort Kent along what used to be the Port Kent and Hopkinton Turnpike before entering Vermont by way of the Burlington‚ÄìPort Kent Ferry across Lake Champlain. The state of New York assumed maintenance of most of the Ausable Chasm‚ÄìPort Kent roadway at some point after 1920. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, the entirety of the highway from Ausable Chasm to the Port Kent ferry landing was designated as NY 373, despite the fact that the small portion of the route east of Lake Street in Port Kent was not maintained by the state at the time. On April 1, 1985, ownership and maintenance of NY 373 east of Lake Street was transferred from the town of Chesterfield to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state and Essex County.

Nygard is now considered one of the most important Norwegian authors of his time, but was, however, not especially acknowledged while alive.  Life and background  Nygard was born in an isolated farm in the rural district of Modalen, Norway, being the second youngest of altogether ten siblings. He started writing relatively early, mainly poems, and was soon determined to become a full-time writer. His childhood, however, was not easy, losing his mother at the age of ten, and having to work at his father's farm after finishing elementary school. He was a very gifted wood carver, creating, among other things, his own fiddle, which he would use playing at local dancing arrangements. He had a special interest in the local dialect, collecting tales and words told by his father. Finally, during his 1904-1905 stay at M√∏re Folkeh√∏gskule in √òrsta, Nygard came in touch with a more academic group of people. He met Petra Kr√∏vel, his first wife, who died of tuberculosis shortly afterwards. From 1909-1910 he lived in Oslo, partially at Labr√•ten, the Asker residence of Arne Garborg. The advice and support of him and his wife Hulda Garborg were of great importance for Nygard, even later on in life. Nygard made his living in several different professions, but mostly as a self- dependent farmer. In 1912 he married Rakel Tvedt, with whom he had a son in 1916. The little family had money problems almost constantly, making Nygard's artistic work difficult. As his first wife, Nygard suffered from tuberculosis. He seemed for a while to be recovering, but eventually died in 1924.  Poetry  Nygard almost exclusively wrote poetry. He was not notably influenced by other Norwegian authors at his time, writing in a fashion quite different from the trend. Henrik Wergeland, though, was a major source of inspiration. So was also British authors like William Shakespeare and John Keats, not to mention Robert Burns, of whom Nygard translated several poems. Nygard is himself within a clearly romantic tradition, but with a very distinctive tone. What most obviously separates him from the increasingly modernistic authors of his own time, is the archaic language he always uses. It is Nynorsk, but shaped by his own dialect and with a vast variety of words, many of them endemic to his own poetic production. He frequently puts words together in unexpected ways, thus creating several hundred new words found only in these poems. Sadly, it is also Nygard's rich language that has become the biggest obstacle for new readers, having sometimes difficulties understanding the content. If one, however, gets to the bottom of possible language barriers, one comes to discover a poetry dealing with many of life's greatest issues. Nygard is said, possibly because of his early death and rather sorrowful life, to be concerned very much with death in his poems. To some extent, this is indeed true. But it is also a vibrant poetry, using powerful images and connecting the forces of life, death and nature in a vital, ambitious way. Nature is often represented in metaphors, sometimes with a mystic and even erotic use of images. Some modernistic patterns can be found especially in his later poetry, such as the occurrence of a \\"meta\\"-perspective on his own role as a poet. But while many authors of his time wrote in a more realistic and concrete fashion, Nygard held on to an almost cosmological style. Although rarely read by most, Nygard is considered an important author in the change from late romantic to modernistic Norwegian literature, and a major poetic talent. Norwegian author Claes Gill is known to have stated about Nygard, that he, \\"[...] if writing in a World language, would have been among the greatest poets in international literature.\\"Nettbiblioteket - Vestlandsforfattere - Olav Nygard - Saknad heiter livet mitt at www.bergen.folkebibl.no  Works  * Flodmaal (1913) * Runemaal (1914) * Kv√¶de (1915) * Ved vebande (1923) * Dikt (Poems) (Translations of Robert Burns' poems) (1923) * Dikt i samling (Collected poems) (1984, new edition 2004) Notes  External links  * Selected poems at Aasentunet * Obituary by Johannes Lavik (in Norwegian) * Article at Norwegian wikipedia * Picture Category:1884 births Category:1924 deaths Category:People from Modalen Category:Nynorsk-language writers Category:20th- century Norwegian poets Category:Norwegian male poets Category:20th-century Norwegian male writers ","title":"Olav Nygard"},{"id":"17670920","text":"The Roman Catholic Diocese of Roraima () is a diocese located in the state of Roraima in the Ecclesiastical province of Manaus in Brazil.

For the concept in physics, see time dilation. Time displacement in sociology refers to the idea that new forms of activities may replace older ones. New activities that cause time displacement are usually technology-based, most common are the information and communication technologies such as Internet and television. Those technologies are seen as responsible for declines of previously more common activities such as in- and out-of-home socializing, work, and even personal care and sleep. For example, Internet users may spend time online using it as a substitute of other activities that served similar function(s) (watching television, reading printed media, face to face interaction, etc.). Internet is not the first technology to result in time displacement. Earlier, television had a similar impact, as it shifted people's time from activities such as listening to radio, going to movie theaters or, talking in house, or spending time outside it.

His father was the portrait painter Norman Macbeth and his niece Ann Macbeth. Two of his five brothers, James Macbeth (1847-1891) and Henry Macbeth, later Macbeth-Raeburn (1860‚Äì1947), were also artists. Life Rosalind (1888) Macbeth studied in London, producing realistic everyday scenes and working for The Graphic magazine. He painted in the Lincolnshire and Somerset countryside, in works influenced by those of George Heming Mason and Frederick Walker. His The Cast Shoe was bought by the Chantrey Bequest in 1890, and is now at Tate Britain. In 1895 he painted a mural Opening of the Royal Exchange by Her Majesty Queen Victoria, 28th October 1844 which can be seen in the Royal Exchange, London. From 1871 Macbeth exhibited at the Royal Academy, Royal Society of Portrait Painters, Grosvenor Gallery, New Gallery and the Fine Art Society in London. There were also exhibitions in the regions at the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists in Birmingham, the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh, the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts, the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool and Manchester Art Gallery. In the same year (1871) Macbeth was made an associate of the Royal Watercolour Society (RWS) becoming a full member in 1901. He became a member of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers (RE) in 1880, and an honorary member in 1909. In 1882 he was elected a member of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours (RI) and in 1883 was elected to be a member of the Royal Institute of Oil Painters (ROI). In 1883 he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy (RA), becoming a full member in 1903. He married Lydia Esther Bates on 9 August 1887 with whom he had a daughter, Phillis Macbeth, better known as the actress Lydia Bilbrook. However, it has been suggested that she was actually the biological daughter of the actor Herbert Beerbohm Tree. He died in Golders Green, north London. References Bibliography *J. L.

Biography Sapah-Gulian Tombstone in New Jersey, USAStepan Sapah-Gulian was born in Djahri, a village just north of Nakhichevan on 14 February 1861. He attended the Nersisian School in Tiflis for his primary and secondary education and was later appointed director of schools in Nakhichevan. In 1887 he was arrested by Tsarist authorities and briefly jailed. Sapah-Gulian met with renowned Hunchakian activist Paramaz (Matteos Sarkissian) in Nakhichevan and Meghri, and discussed revolutionary ideas. He traveled throughout Western Armenia, the Middle East, and was later briefly director of the Armenian school in Jerusalem prior to his departure to Paris for continuation of higher education. In 1895 he graduated from the √âcole Libre des Sciences Politiques with future French Prime Minister Raymond Poincar√©. As an ardent activist for the Armenian cause, Sapah-Gulian joined the Hunchakian in 1894. He became a leader of the party and founded and/or edited several journals, including Yeritasard Hayastan ('Young Armenia', 1903), Hunchak, Veradsnound ('Revival'), and Nor Ashkharh ('New World'). Hunchakian leaders hung during the Armenian Genocide After the restoration of the Ottoman Constitution (1908), along with the party, he declared his opposition to the Young Turk-led Committee of Union and Progress, and urged other Armenian political parties to join the Hunchakians in opposition to the Ittihad movement.Preparation for a Revolution : The Young Turks, 1902-1908: Near Eastern Studies Department Princeton University, Oxford University Press, 2001, p. 207 While in Cairo, Sapah-Gulian was condemned to death (in absentia) along with other Hunchakian party members by the Ottoman government in 1915. He later traveled to the United States to recruit volunteers for the volunteer units and to obtain assistance for the Armenians in the war. In the United States he edited the weekly Yeritasard Hayastan in Providence and fundamentally disagreed on the issue of the dissolution of the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party in favor of the Russian Social Democrats in 1923, showing determination to maintain independence and integrity of the Armenian Social Democrat Hunchak party.

In addition to carrying freight on occasion, it also on occasion operates as a tourist railroad that carried passengers between Lamy and Santa Fe, a distance of . The Santa Fe Rail Trail, a multi-use trail, follows along its route.  History   Beginnings and the expansion of tourist operations  The Santa Fe Southern began operations in 1992, after the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway ended operations on their Lamy to Santa Fe line and a group of local businesspeople purchased the track to continue freight service in the area. Passenger service was added later on. On October 8, 2010, the railroad was purchased by STI-Global, Ltd., an Australian-based company. STI-Global said that the purchase would allow it to test the safety systems the company produces. On May 20, 2011, the railroad was evicted from its headquarters at the depot in Santa Fe to make way for a new visitors' center planned to serve New Mexico Rail Runner passengers. On August 12, 2012, the railroad was featured in the AMC TV series Breaking Bad season 5 episode \\"Dead Freight\\", in which one of the railroad's locomotives was delayed at a highway crossing in order to facilitate theft of 1,000 gallons of the industrial chemical methylamine from a tank car near the end of the train. The locomotive featured was SFSR 07, a GP7u. In the credits, special thanks were given to the railroad for making the episode possible.  Financial troubles and attempted recovery  The railroad's business fluctuated greatly; in 2004, it hauled 401 carloads of freight, and in 2007 carried 25,907 passengers, but in 2009 these counts decreased to 25 and 12,208, both record lows. Towards the end of its existence, the railroad changed from separate freight and passenger operations to mixed trains (which carry both freight and passengers) at least twice a week, depending on the season. The railroad also offered charter and special trains. After the close of the 2012 operating season, things took a turn for the worse. On May 23, 2013, the Santa Fe Southern board chairman announced that he had laid off all of the railroad's full-time staffers and many seasonal employees. The railroad did not operate any trains during the year of 2013. On April 24, 2014, the Las Vegas Railway Express (LVRE) announced that it had reached an agreement with the Santa Fe Southern to jointly operate excursion trains that summer. LVRE would provide the capital to restore the line to operating condition, while Santa Fe Southern would operate the trains.  End of regularly scheduled passenger excursion trains  On September 26, 2014, despite a reportedly successful first summer, LVRE informed the Santa Fe Southern that they would be terminating the operation, effective on the 29th. Those who had purchased tickets for future excursion trains were informed that their trains were cancelled, and received refunds. Remaining freight operations were also suspended. Santa Fe Southern officials commented that they were unsure when the railroad would resume operations, and at the present time the railroad is still shut down for regularly scheduled passenger excursions, although it is still running private charter events (weddings, parties, corporate events, etc.), Private Varnishes, and the occasional movie or TV film shoot. On May 18th, 2020, It was reported that three partners, Bill Banowsky, George R. R. Martin, and Catherine Oppenheimer have bought the railway and trains and plan to revive operations.  Rolling stock  The railroad operates several coaches formerly owned by the Central Railroad of New Jersey, as well as a flatcar, and a caboose. Motive power consisted of one EMD GP7 and one EMD GP16, the latter which was a rebuild from a GP7. SF Southern line in Winter.jpgSF Southern line,Winter 2010.

The use of RDMA makes higher throughput and lower latency possible than what is possible through e.g. the TCP/IP communication protocol. RDMA is only possible with network adapters that support RDMA in hardware. Examples of such network adapters are InfiniBand HCAs and 10 GbE network adapters with iWARP support. While the SRP protocol has been designed to use RDMA networks efficiently, it is also possible to implement the SRP protocol over networks that do not support RDMA. SRP was published as an ANSI standard (ANSI INCITS 365-2002) in 2002 and renewed in 2007.ANSI webstore for purchasing standards - ANSI INCITS 365-2002 As with the ISCSI Extensions for RDMA (iSER) communication protocol, there is the notion of a target (a system that stores the data) and an initiator (a client accessing the target) with the target performing the actual data movement. In other words, when a user writes to a target, the target actually executes a read from the initiator and when a user issues a read, the target executes a write to the initiator. While the SRP protocol is easier to implement than the iSER protocol, iSER offers more management functionality, e.g. the target discovery infrastructure enabled by the iSCSI protocol. In order to use the SRP protocol, an SRP initiator implementation, an SRP target implementation and networking hardware supported by the initiator and target are needed. The following software SRP initiator implementations exist: * Linux SRP initiator, available since November 2005 (kernel version 2.6.15). * Windows SRP initiator, available through the winOFED InfiniBand stack.OpenFabrics Enterprise Distribution for Windows. * VMWare SRP initiator, available since January 2008 through Mellanox' OFED Drivers for VMware Infrastructure 3 and vSphere 4.Mellanox OFED Drivers for VMware Infrastructure 3 and vSphere 4. * Solaris 10 SRP initiator, available through Sun's download page.Sun's download page. * Solaris 11 and OpenSolaris SRP initiator, integrated as a component of project COMSTAR. * The IBM POWER virtual SCSI client driver for Linux (ibmvscsi), available since January 2008 (kernel version 2.6.24Linux kernel version 2.6.24 change log.).

Bandwidth and latency of storage targets supporting the SRP or the iSER protocol should be similar. On Linux, there are two SRP and two iSER storage target implementations available that run inside the kernel (SCST and LIO) and an iSER storage target implementation that runs in user space (STGT). Measurements have shown that the SCST SRP target has a lower latency and a higher bandwidth than the STGT iSER target. This is probably because the RDMA communication overhead is lower for a component implemented in the Linux kernel than for a user space Linux process, and not because of protocol differences.Performance of SCST versus STGT.

The program derives its name from the town of Bluff, Utah, adjacent to the Navajo Nation, in which the campus facility is located. Design Build Bluff projects are a full donation to the client and are noted for being, innovative, sustainable and award winning designs. The program is currently collaborating with the Mexican Water Chapter House on more community based projects.University of Utah College of Architecture + Planning website, DesignBuildBLUFF.DesignBuildBLUFF: Drawing on two-by-foursSustainable Homes for People Who Need ThemSustainably-built House by DesignBuildBluff in Navajo Nation-Southern UtahStudents from the University of Utah Planning For And With Families Who Live Below the Poverty LineDesignBuildBluff Mission & Philosophy The students are empowered ‚Äúwith the practical hard skills needed to test their theories through applied research. With the hope that students will become better, more conscientious, and empathetic architects for the benefit of the larger community.  History  DesignBuildBLUFF was founded in 2000 by University of Utah Professor, Hank Louis. The program is modeled on a design-build program at Auburn University, known as the Rural Studio, which was founded by Samuel Mockbee. In the Rural Studio model, students abandon the comforts of campus and home for a cooperative life, to learn about architecture through action. The design-build paradigm emphasizes experimentation, scale mock-ups, in-process design iterations, consensus-building through ideas and emotions, and juxtaposing diametrically opposed cultures. Since its inception Design Build Bluff has expanded to include The University of Colorado Denver in 2010, and more recently evolved from an independent non-profit to being formally housed within the University of Utah. Hank Louis has since passed leadership, and in 2013 the program welcomed new director, Jos√© Galarza, who came from the Yestermorrow Design/Build School.  Design and Construction  The program emphasizes the design and construction of homes using \\"green-build\\" techniques such as passive solar, rainwater catchment, permaculture, earthen plaster, rammed earth, straw bale construction, cellulose insulation, Icynene foam (a green, water-based, open-celled building insulation product), and materials salvaged from the landscape of the reservation itself such as a substratum of natural clay, and reed from the local riverbed. Design plans are formatted around donated and recycled materials such as lumber, windows, doors and appliances. Additionally, some of the homes are built from a unique material, FlexCrete, a new concrete block product made with fibrous aggregate from the surrounding soil, produced locally on the Navajo Nation, thereby further reducing the need to import building materials. The projects are completed on a modest cash budget, largely due to grant funding, and made possible by the generosity of the local design and construction community. Annual donors such as Big D Construction and 3Form have been involved in the projects for many years. Building sustainable, off-grid homes that have little impact on the environment accomplishes for the Navajo Nation the mission of respecting the landscape while providing adequate housing. As the program includes more community based projects it hopes to reinforce the relationship with the Navajo people, align with community goals, and maintain relevance.

Built by Thomas Wyndham to the designs of Roger Morris, it is the earliest Georgian Gothic Revival castle in England predating better-known examples such as Strawberry Hill House by over twenty years. A home of the Wyndham family for some 150 years, the first half of the twentieth century saw a disastrous fire, and subsequent asset- stripping, which brought the castle close to ruination. Slowly restored from 1954, in the 1970s the castle housed a recording studio used by, among other major bands, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Queen. Now operating as a wedding venue, the castle is a Grade II* listed building. History Charles Wyndham (later Edwin) and his son Thomas Wyndham in 1775 Thomas Wyndham (1686‚Äì1752), the son of Francis Wyndham, a wealthy landowner, and Sarah Darell, was educated at Eton and the University of Cambridge and became a barrister and later a Member of Parliament. He married twice; firstly to his cousin Jane Wyndham, daughter and heir of William Wyndham of Dunraven Castle, secondly to Anne Edwin, daughter of Samuel Edwin of Llanmihangel Place, Glamorgan. Both marriages brought Wyndham considerable wealth. In 1727, he began the construction of a new house, then titled Clearwell Court, on the site of an earlier house. Alistair Rowan suggests that construction was undertaken in two phases, the main frontage in the first building period of 1727-1728, and the rear of the house, with the library on the ground floor and bedrooms above, after his second marriage in the 1730s. After Wyndham's death in 1752, the court was inherited by the eldest son of his second marriage, Charles Wyndham (1731‚Äì1801). In 1862 Charles married Eleanor Rooke. The couple had one son, Thomas Wyndham (1763‚Äì1814). In about 1775 Charles had his portrait painted with his son Thomas who was then about 12 years old. At about the same time he commissioned an etching of Clearwell Court which shows both the house and the stable. Charles died in 1801 and his son Thomas inherited the court. In 1787 he had married Anna Ashby. Of their two children, only the daughter, Caroline, (1789‚Äì1870), survived to adulthood. In 1810 Caroline married Windham Henry Quin (1782‚Äì1850). On the deaths of their fathers, in 1814 and 1824 respectively, they inherited considerable estates in Gloucestershire, Norfolk and South Wales, with Quin also succeeding to the Earldom of Dunraven and Mount-Earl. After her husband's death in 1850, Caroline, then the Dowager Countess, remained at Clearwell until her own death in 1870. In 1890, the Clearwell estate passed out of the ownership of the Wyndham family. The court was renamed Clearwell Castle in 1908. The first half of the 20th century saw the castle suffer a serious fire in 1930, and after the Second World War, the loss of its floors, roofs and many of its internal fittings and decorations prior to intended demolition. The castle was saved through its purchase in 1952 by Frank Yeates, son of a former gardener at the castle. Yeates and his family began a long restoration. In the 1970s the family ran a recording and rehearsal studios at Clearwell. Many major rock bands including Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Mott the Hoople, Black Sabbath, Badfinger, Queen and Whitesnake recorded at the castle. Black Sabbath started writing and recording their album Sabbath Bloody Sabbath when staying at the castle in 1973, and band member Tony Iommi claimed to have \\"definitely\\" seen a ghost in the building. In 1978, the members of Led Zeppelin reconvened at the castle after a period apart, and began writing and rehearsing what became their In Through the Out Door album. The Yeates family sold the castle in the 1980s and it now operates as a wedding venue. Architecture and description Alistair Rowan, in his 1970 essay on the castle, describes Clearwell as \\"next to Vanbrugh Castle, the oldest Georgian Gothic castle standing\\". Alan Brooks, in the revised 2002 Gloucestershire Pevsner, goes further, calling Clearwell, \\"the earliest Gothick Revival castle in England\\". Neither Rowan, nor David Verey in the first edition of the Gloucestershire Pevsner, attributed the castle to a named architect, but both Brooks, and Historic England, firmly ascribe the castle to Roger Morris. Brooks suggests that Clearwell goes further in conveying the \\"castle air\\" than much of Vanbrugh's work, although he notes similarities to Vanbrugh's reconstruction at Lumley Castle, and to Morris's own work at Inveraray Castle, though the latter is almost twenty years after Clearwell in date. The castle comprises a recessed two-storey central block, with paired, three-storey towers to the front and a rear extension at a right angle to the main block. Rowan suggests these two sections represent separate building phases, of 1727-1728, and the mid-1730s. The whole is built of local stone from the Forest of Dean. Little of the original interior has survived; Victorian remodelling in the mid-19th century and the fire and subsequent gutting of the building in the mid-20th, destroyed most of the decoration. The castle is a Grade II* listed building. The main gateway and lodges, the stable lodges, three pairs of gateposts on a green facing the main entrance, and statues of a man, and a child with a sphinx, on the lawn in front of the castle, all have their own Grade II listings.

The line currently runs from the Mondawmin Metro Subway Station in Northwest Baltimore to Brooklyn Homes in South Baltimore through the communities of Rosemont (serving Coppin State College) and the corridors of Hilton Street, Caton Avenue, and Patapsco Avenue. During peak hours, selected trips operate via Violetville Industrial Park. History Route 29 was introduced in January 2001 as Route 16 when Route 22 was split. Service along its route started in 1971 as 22 EXTENDED. Much of the current route of Route 16 historically was not served by a single transit route. Portions that were include North Avenue, which has been served by the no. 13 streetcar since 1890 and also the No. 31 streetcar, which later became the No. 19 streetcar (and is currently Bus Route 91); both these lines currently overlap. Bloomingdale Avenue and Poplar Grove Street were served by the Nos. 4 and 35 streetcars (currently Bus Route 15).Harwood, p. 62-63. Service on Fish House Road (where Patapsco Avenue is now located) between Annapolis Road and Brooklyn was provided by Short Line Routes.1929 Baltimore Streetcar and Bus Map, provided by the Baltimore Streetcar Museum The no. 16 designation has previously been used for several Baltimore area public transit routes, most notably a streetcar that operated from Reservoir Hill to Fells Point from 1893 to 1948, that operated as a bus line until 1956.Harwood, p. 3. Its route is currently served mostly by Bus Route 5. The no. 16 designation was also used for a bus route that operated from 1973 to 1989 between downtown Baltimore and BWI Airport, Odenton, and Ft. Meade, before being replaced by two express buses designated Routes 230 and 240. The current route is served by MTA Route 17 and Connect-a-Ride Route K. Another route designated no. 16 operated express service from 1993 to 1995 between the North Linthicum Light Rail Stop and Ft. Meade/NSA before being replaced by a private carrier. In 2017, Route 16 was renamed as Route 29 under BaltimoreLink, with discontinued service to Violetville Industrial Park due to low ridership.http://baltimorelink.com/routes/route-16 Origin Route 22, which had been operating since 1947 along its current route, succeeding Route S, its parent route, had a very long route up until 2001 that in all served nearly ¬æ the circumference of the city, and only selected trips operated along Route 16's route, with the remainder terminating at Mondawmin. Due to the length and confusion among riders, MTA decided that Route 16 service should be provided on a separate line. When Route 16 started, rush hour service operated every 30 minutes, and service at all other times was provided hourly. Sunday service along the route, which had not been provided on Route 22, was introduced.MTA January 2001 schedule changes In 2005, as part of the Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative, MTA proposed not only to double the frequency, but to modify the route in the Rosemont area to serve the Poplar Grove corridor, leaving Route 51 as the only bus serving the part of Rosemont of Route 16's previous route. The original routing plan would have operated along west from Gwynns Falls Parkway to Bloomingdale Avenue, and would then follow the routing of Route 15 up to Edmondson Avenue, as well as eliminated the Violetville deviation. After riders complained that the new route would not serve Coppin State College, a slight change was made to this modification, in which North Avenue would be used rather than Gwynns Falls Parkway.MTA GBBI Phase II proposals Also, Violetville service remained.

The line currently operates weekdays and Saturdays in a circular fashion, linking the Cherry Hill Light Rail Stop to the Cherry Hill community. Two other MTA bus lines, Routes 27 and 51, also serve the Cherry Hill area. History The Route 29 designation for service in Cherry Hill has been around since June 14, 1993.MTA summer 1993 schedule changes But prior to this date, the Cherry Hill area has been served by, and continues to be served by other routes. The no. 29 designation was never used for any routes in the Cherry Hill area before. The most notable Baltimore transit route of the past that used the no. 29 designation was the No. 29 Streetcar, which operated from Roland Park to downtown from 1908 to 1947, when it was converted into the No. 29 bus. The no. 29 bus operated until 1959, when it was merged into the No. 6 Bus (presently Route 64). The Roland Park bus line was later split again from the no. 6 line in 1977, but it was then designated Route 61. The only other line that was known as Route 29 was an express bus that operated between Timonium and downtown from 1983 to 1988. Prior to the inception of Route 29, the main bus line serving Cherry Hill was Route 28. Route 28 had operated since 1947 between the Liberty Heights Avenue corridor and Cherry Hill. All buses that had operated from Cherry Hill and other locations in South Baltimore had been given the no. 28 designation. All buses that originated from Liberty Heights with a destination other than Cherry Hill were identified as no. 28. But all buses that originated in the Liberty Heights area and had a final destination of Cherry Hill were designated no. 37. This was done to alert white residents of the communities in the Liberty Heights area that the bus's final destination was Cherry Hill, then a low class black community.Woodholme By DeWayne Wickham, pages 84-85 This practice was discontinued in 1974 when the no. 37 designation was dropped, and all buses along this route were given the no. 28 designation. Origin Route 29 started operating in 1993 as a split-off from Route 28, which had been divided when the Light Rail was extended south of Baltimore. On its day of inauguration, the line had operated on all trips between the Cherry Hill and Patapsco Light Rail Stops. Prior to that day, Route 28 had operated on weekdays from the Mondawmin Metro Subway Station to either Cherry Hill or Baltimore Highlands. On the day of the split, a new Route 30 was also formed that operated between the Cherry Hill and Baltimore Highlands Light Rail Stops. After the 1993 split, Route 28 continued to operate between Mondawmin and Camden Yards on all trips. Hourly trips continued south of Camden Yards to the Cherry Hill Light Rail Stop in order to provide service along Russell Street. On Sundays, Route 28 followed its old routing to Cherry Hill and Baltimore Highlands. In 1996, Route 28 was eliminated from service except on Sundays, and replaced with service provided by existing lines or by route modifications. Route 27 was extended to replace the portion of Route 28 along Russell Street, and during late night hours when the light rail was not operating, selected Route 27 trips were extended either to Cherry Hill or Baltimore Highlands. In 2001, Route 28 Sunday service was also eliminated, leaving Route 28, a major Baltimore transit route that had been operating since 1947, something of the past. Route 30 was also eliminated, and service was replaced by extending Route 51 to the Patapsco Light Rail Stop via the Baltimore Highlands area. Route 27 was extended to serve the Cherry Hill area. Route 29 had first become a supplemental service that operated on a coordinated schedule with Route 27, but since 2002, Route 29 has been operating in a circular fashion. In 2005, a Greater Baltimore Bus Initiative plan was proposed that would have once again provided bi-directional routing, and extended selected trips downtown. Later versions of this proposal had other lines providing the service on Russell Street, and Route 29 being extended to Port Covington. None of these plans were implemented. In 2007, GBBI was canceled, and no new plans have been made for Route 29 ever since. June 2011 Adjust service frequency to 20 minutes.

Life and work \\"Comfort in grief\\" (1862) Early Life and training Walker was born at 90 Great Titchfield Street, Marylebone in London, the elder of twins and the 5th son of William Henry, Jeweller, and Ann (n√©e Powell) Walker - he was one of 8 children. His grandfather, William Walker had been an artist of some merit, who had exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy and British Institution between 1782‚Äì1802. Fredrick's mother was an embroideress, and became the family's chief breadwinner when his father died in 1847. Frederick received his education at a local school and later at the North London Collegiate School in Camden. He showed a talent for art from an early age teaching himself to copy prints using pen and ink - he also practiced drawing in the British Museum. From 1855‚Äì57 he worked in an architect's office in Gower Street but gave up architecture to become a student at the British Museum and at James Mathews Leigh's art school. In March 1858 he was admitted as a student at the Royal Academy, and later that year also became a part-time apprentice wood-engraver to Josiah Wood Whymper in Lambeth. It was here that he met fellow artists J W North and George Pinwell. During the 2 years of his apprenticeship he continued to paint in his spare time, in both oils and watercolours. The Illustrator Summer days (1866) In 1859 he joined the Artists' society in Langham Chambers, and from 1860‚Äì65 achieved great success as a black and white illustrator for popular journals of the day such as Cornhill Magazine, Once a Week, Good Words, Everybody's Journal, and Leisure Hour.Walker's first published illustration was in Everybody's Journal, 14 January 1860, for a story by Edmond About called \\"The Round of Wrong\\" (Phillips, p. 11). Much of his work during this period was engraved by Joseph Swain. He was introduced to satirist and author William Thackeray, the Cornhill's editor, for whom he provided drawings (e.g. \\"Comfort in grief\\") for \\"The Adventures of Philip\\", initially published as a serial but then as a book in 1862. He also illustrated Thackeray's unfinished novel \\"Denis Duval\\", magazine stories by Thackeray's daughter Ann Ritchie (many of these drawings later reproduced in watercolour), and provided drawings (e.g. \\"Summer days\\") for the Dalziel brothers which appeared in 2 poetry books, \\"A Round of Days\\" and \\"Wayside Posies\\". The artist Walker produced his first important watercolour, Strange faces in 1862 (Yale Center for British Art, New Haven), and in the following year Philip in Church which won a medal at the Paris Exhibition of 1867. Walker exhibited at the Royal Watercolour Society from 1864 until the end of his life, becoming an associate member in February 1864.'Minor topics of the month', The Art Journal, March 1864, p. 90. He was later made a full member in 1866, which entitled him to add the postnominal initials 'RWS' after his name. He was also elected an honorary member of the Belgian Watercolour Society in 1871. In 1863 Walker exhibited his first oil painting, The Lost Path at the Royal Academy of Arts, and thereafter showed Wayfarers (1866; Private collection), Bathers (1867; Lady Lever Art Gallery), Vagrants (1868; Tate, London), The Old Gate (1869; Tate, London), The Plough (1870; Tate, London), At the Bar (1871; Untraced), The Harbour of Refuge (1872; Tate, London) and The Right of Way (1875; National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne). In 1871 he was elected an Associate Royal Academician (ARA). Final years The Vagrants (1868; Tate, London) Cookham memorial Walker never married and lived all his life in London with members of his family - brother John (d. 1868), sister Fanny (d. 1876) and mother (d. 1874) - residing in Bayswater from 1863. He twice visited Paris (in 1863 and 1867) and Venice (1868 and 1870 - in the latter year with his friend William Quiller Orchardson). In 1873 he travelled to Algiers in an unsuccessful attempt to recuperate from a bout of tuberculosis, which gradually worsened until his death in June 1875 at St Fillans in Perthshire, Scotland.

The founding committee of Quiet Waters met for the first time on 24 October 1985. It was at this meeting that the initial ideas of the development of Quiet Waters were born. History The project began in 1986, and it was officially opened in 1988. It consists of a nature reserve and wilderness area, which covered an area of 8.1 km2 in all. Quiet Waters aims to conserve indigenous fauna and flora, to further the educational pursuits of the college, and to serve as a base for conservation education in other schools. It is also used for scientific research, providing recreational facilities for the college community and visitors. Key facts about the Quiet Waters Conservation Scheme *The scheme was started over 20 years ago. Its 20th anniversary was celebrated in October 2005. *The conservancy, which lies in the attractive hilly country to the north of the college, consists of two parts: The western game-fenced nature reserve of approximately 320 hectares, and the wilderness area of 490 hectares in the east. *It has a very diverse range of fauna and flora. There are 12 recorded mammal species ranging from the giraffe to the minute spiny mouse. Other species, such as baboon, vervet monkey, banded mongoose, hyrax, warthog, klipspringer, duiker, impala, kudu, reedbuck, bushbuck, eland, tsessebe, and zebra are often seen. The last four have been introduced. Also, over 300 bird species have been identified. *There are also over 100 species of trees. 50 grass species have been recorded. *Other recorded fauna are 25 different snakes and 30 butterfly species. *Research continues on other forms of animal and plant life. *The game-fenced nature reserve has an impressive list of facilities, which are available to the Falcon community, which includes parents and friends of the college, as well as other educational institutions. These include nature trails, picnic sites, a campsite with four well-equipped A-framed chalets, viewing points and hides and artificial game pans. *The new Mbonisa weir, which was recently officially opened, by Jimmy and Jenny Goddard has been stocked with bream and bass. *It is a biology, geography and environmental management O and A level classes for fieldwork exercises extensively use the area. *There are Junior and Senior Natural History Societies; the Angling Club and Junior Forms‚Äô Adventure Courses also make regular use of the facilities. *In the past, schools such as Girls‚Äô College, Carmel and Whitestone from Bulawayo and Murray McDougal from Chiredzi, have utilised Quiet Waters for educational purposes. In the case of Carmel and Whitestone, ecology courses have been designed and run by Falcon staff, assisted by schoolboys. *Extensive development plans for specific areas are in the pipeline. There are six picnic sites, set in beautiful surroundings, which are available to parents who visit Quiet Waters.

They provide funding and resources to dioceses and parishes through programs and services investing in people, infrastructure and ministries. This support is given based on need, passion and commitment to the growth of the Catholic faith. History Father Francis Kelley, a priest from Lapeer, Michigan, first envisioned Catholic Extension in 1904. Through his travels, he discovered places and communities that were struggling to keep the Catholic faith alive and growing. The Archbishop of Chicago, James Edward Quigley, agreed to help Father Kelley launch this new organization. As a result, the Catholic Church Extension Society was organized on October 18, 1905. Temporary headquarters were established in Lapeer, Michigan, where a charter was granted to the society by the state of Michigan on December 25, 1905. In January 1907, society headquarters were moved to Chicago, and the president was transferred to that archdiocese. On June 7, 1907, Catholic Extension received its first papal approval by an Apostolic Letter of Pope Pius X addressed to the Archbishop of Chicago. Almost exactly three years later, on June 9, 1910, the Pope issued a brief by which the society was raised to the dignity of a canonical institution directly under his own guidance and protection. By the terms of this brief, the Archbishop of Chicago will always remain chancellor of the Society, and the president must be appointed by the Pope himself. The President's term of office is not more than five years. The board of governors has the right to propose three names to the Holy See for this office, and to elect, according to their laws, all other officers of the society. Mission dioceses generally are rural, cover a large geographic area, and have limited personnel and pastoral resources. Since 1905, the society has given more than $500 million to 94 mission dioceses across the country.Pronechen, \\"Catholic Extension Makes Faith Local\\", National Catholic Register, October 13, 2016 Extension has been active in Puerto Rico for over 100 years, funding about 1,400 building projects.Sadowski, Dennis. \\"Catholic Extension to bring aid to Cuba for the first time\\", CNS, September 28, 2016 Present day In 2012, Catholic Extension approved a $56,000 two year grant to the Archdiocese for the Military Services to support a faith formation program for Catholics in the United States military.\\"AMS Named Recipient of $56,000 Grant from Catholic Extension\\", AMS, August 1, 2012 In 2018, Catholic Extension launched a Mission Immersion Program for pastors from various parts of the country, which allows them to experience circumstances pastors in poor areas of the country face.Smith, Samantha. \\"Atlanta priests join Catholic Extension trip to border\\", The Georgia Bulletin, October 3, 2019 Large-scale raids conducted in August 2019 by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement resulted in the arrest of 680 people at various food processing plants in the state of Mississippi.

Since then, Extension has developed to include a collection of articles illustrating the history of the Catholic Church in America and seeking to inspire its readers with stories about vibrant Catholic communities across the United States. Now a quarterly publication, Extension is the voice of Catholic Extension's mission to strengthen the Church in America's poor mission dioceses.

Knowing how to read and write music gave him the ability to only focus on guitar techniques. The first band he formed was Vision in February 1991, which later changed its name to Labyrinth. The line up consisted of him on lead guitar with Frank Andiver (drums), Andrea Bartoletti (bass guitar), Andrea Cantarelli (lead guitar), and Fabio Tordiglione (vocals). In 1994 the band released its first demo entitled Midnight Resistance, and then later got signed ton to release Piece of Mind, No Limits, Return to Heaven Denied and Timeless Crime. In late 1990s Olaf created what intended to be a solo project at first under the title Vision Divine with his Labyrinth bandmates Mat Stancioiu on drums, Andrew McPauls on keyboards. Also in the line up was Andrea \\"Tower\\" Torricini on bass, and his once-Labyrinth-bandmate Fabio Lione on vocals.

He was also known as \\"George Mason\\" or \\"George Hemming Mason\\". Life Early years Mason was born at Fenton Park in the parish of Stoke-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, the eldest son of George Miles Mason (1789‚Äì1859) and Eliza Heming (daughter of Major Heming of Mapleton, Derbyshire). His grandfather, Miles Mason, was a potter, and the pottery was afterwards carried on by his father and uncle (Charles James Mason) who invented Mason's iron-stone china. His father, who graduated from Brasenose College, Oxford, was a cultivated man, who retiring from his business in 1829, became a country gentleman, devoting himself to literature and painting. In 1832 the family moved to Wetley Abbey, a mansion situated in the midst of a park, near Wetley Rocks in Staffordshire, five miles from the Potteries.The Masons of Lane Delph Mason was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and from 1834 trained to be a doctor under William Royden Watts, a surgeon, of Birmingham, but abandoned medicine in 1844 in order to pursue a career as an artist. As a youth he was passionately fond of literature and athletics, and he inherited his father's taste for painting. An early oil sketch of his exists entitled \\"Dummy's Turn to Play\\" in which he tried to embody a ghastly incident of the time of the plague. He was also art critic to a local newspaper. Life in Italy In the autumn of 1843, Mason left England with his brother Miles on a trip through France, Switzerland, and Italy - the journey was mainly done on foot. They reached Rome in the autumn of 1845, and George took a studio there. Financial difficulties at home soon compelled him and his brother to fend for themselves, and he made a living painting portraits of the English in Rome, and more particularly of their horses and dogs, for which he had a natural talent. Despite a serious illness and severe poverty, Mason's spirits never sank, and when the Italian war broke out in 1848, he helped to tend the wounded. His brother Miles entered Garibaldi's army as a volunteer, and eventually became a captain. During the 1849 Siege of Rome, Mason and two fellow-artists, George Thomas (1824-1868), an accomplished illustrator who worked for the Illustrated London News, and Murray (sic), were arrested as suspected spies, and narrowly escaped death. In 1851, Mason made a tour of the Sabine and Ciociara regions and subsequently spent much time painting cattle as the guest of a gentleman grazier of the Campagna. Mason delighted in the Campagna, and produced a number of pictures there including \\"Ploughing in the Campagna\\", \\"In the Salt Marshes\\" (1856), and \\"A Fountain with Figures\\". When thinking out a composition, which often originated in some literary subject, he usually strolled the neighbouring country in search of particular forms and colours for the accessories. Sometimes a new subject would be thus suggested, as in the case of his \\"Ploughing in the Campagna\\" for which he deserted another work already begun. Mason had many associates amongst the painters and architects who visited Rome, and when Frederic Leighton made the city his winter headquarters, he and Mason became firm friends. Giovanni Costa was for many years Mason's constant companion in Italy. Costa, who in the early days of their intimacy thought Mason's execution childish, recognised from the first the beauty of the sentiment which characterised all his work. They adopted together a system, which they christened \\"the Etruscan\\", of preparing their pictures in monochrome before laying on their final colours. Mason visited the Paris exhibition in 1855, and although he greatly admired the work of Decamps and H√©bert, his confidence that he could excel most contemporary painters was confirmed. In 1857 he is said to have made an income of 600 guineas. Return to England The Cast Shoe (B/W reproduction) In 1858, Mason returned to England and married Mary Emma Wood (daughter of Edward Gittens Wood of Bayston House, Shropshire) on the 5 August. They settled back at the old family mansion Wetley Abbey, and went on to have two sons and five daughters. The exchange of the blue skies of Italy for the grey and misty atmosphere of England at first depressed Mason. His friend Sir Frederick Leighton stimulated him, however, to exertion, and Mason's produced his first painting in England - \\"Wind on the Wold\\". Thenceforward he found inspiration in the exquisite though subdued colours of the Staffordshire country, and there followed from his brush a series of idylls which stamp him as the greatest of the idyllic painters of England. In 1863 Costa visited him at Wetley while Mason was painting \\"The End of the Day\\" and \\"Wetley Rocks\\". Afterwards they visited Paris together, and in 1864 Mason shifted his quarters to Westbourne House, Shaftesbury Road, Hammersmith (London), so as to enjoy the society of his fellow artists, but he still passed much of his time at Wetley. At Shaftesbury Road he painted \\"The Gander\\", \\"The Geese\\", \\"The Cast Shoe\\", \\"Yarrow\\", \\"The Young Anglers\\", \\"The Unwilling Playmate\\" and \\"The Evening Hymn\\". A fastidiousness, which increased with his years, was always characteristic of him. He altered the composition of \\"The Evening Hymn\\" after it was finished, and the exhibition of it was thus delayed for a year. \\"The Blackberry Gatherers\\" was twice repainted - first it was winter, with a hag gathering enchanted herbs, and a fiery-eyed raven on a bare branch overhead, and then he painted it as summer, before completing it as it now stands. A little landscape in Staffordshire was begun as an effect of early spring, then altered to summer, and eventually finished as a late autumn effect, when only the last few leaves were clinging to the trees. Final years In 1869 Mason was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy (ARA) and moved to 7 Theresa Terrace, Hammersmith, where he painted \\"Only a Shower\\", \\"Girls Dancing\\", \\"Blackberry Gathering\\", \\"The Milk Maid\\", and \\"The Harvest Moon\\". During his last years his health grew feeble, and visits to Lord Leconfield at Petworth House, or to a country house placed at his disposal by the Duke of Westminster, failed to restore it. Mason died, at his home, of a heart attack on 22 October 1872, aged 54, just after completing his largest, and in some respects his finest, picture, \\"The Harvest Moon\\".

With food companies, this type of chef is often responsible for the creating of new pre-prepared meals and food products. Within health care, the chef is often responsible for the development of variations on mainstream meals, to fit different types of diets while still having an appetizing meal. Individual restaurants seldom have development chefs but restaurant chains often do. Here the chef is typically responsible for designing dishes and ensuring that the local kitchen staff can create/prepare them to an exact standard. Training Development chefs need sufficient training in Culinary arts, experimental food methods and food science plus sufficient experience in the actual preparation of dishes.

History World War II The 310th Fighter Squadron was constituted on 21 January 1942, as the 310th Pursuit Squadron (Interceptor) and was activated on 9 February at Harding Field, Louisiana, where it flew the Bell P-39 Airacobra and Curtiss P-40 Warhawk aircraft. During 1942 and early 1943 the squadron was both an Operational and a Replacement Training Unit initially under III Fighter Command, being reassigned to I Fighter Command in October 1942. Also was part of the air defense of the Northeast United States, being a component of several Air Defense fighter wings (Philadelphia, New York, Boston), under First Air Force. Was converted into an operational squadron in March 1943 at Bradley Field, Connecticut, being re-equipped with Republic P-47 Thunderbolts. Was deployed to the Southwest Pacific Theater, being assigned to Fifth Air Force in Australia in November 1943. Began combat operations in February 1944, providing protection for U.S. bases and escorting transports initially, then escorting bombers over New Guinea and sea convoys to Admiralty Islands. From Noemfoor, bombed and strafed Japanese airfields and installations on Ceram, Halmahera, and the Kai Islands. Moved to the Philippines in Nov, flew fighter sweeps against enemy airfields, supported U.S. ground forces, and protected sea convoys and transport routes. Beginning in June 1945, the Mexican squad, Escuadron 201 initially flew missions with the 310th Fighter Squadron, often twice a day, using borrowed U.S. aircraft. It received 25 new P-47D-30-RA aircraft in July, marked with the insignia of both the USAAF and Mexican Air Force. The squadron flew more than 90 combat missions, totaling more than 1,900 hours of flight time. They participated in the Allied effort to bomb Luzon and Formosa to push the Japanese out of those islands. Beginning in July 1945, attacked railways, airfields, and enemy installations in Korea and Kyushu, Japan from Okinawa. After V-J Day, flew reconnaissance missions over Japan. Moved without personnel or equipment to the Philippines in Dec to be inactivated in January 1946 at Fort William McKinley, Luzon. Cold War =Fighter operations in Korea= Reactivated during the Korean War at Taegu Air Base, South Korea, being redesignated the 310th Fighter-Bomber Squadron. First equipped with the Republic F-84G Thunderjet, the squadron adopted the North American F-86 Sabre in 1954 and kept it through 1958. During the Korean War, the squadron flew primarily air-to-ground missions supporting ground operations. The 310th participated in the Korea Summer-Fall 1952, Third Korean Winter, and Korean Summer-Fall 1953 campaigns, the squadron again distinguished itself, earning the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. After the armistice in 1953, the squadron moved to Osan Air Base on 19 March 1955. =Tactical missile operations= In 1958 the 310th gave up its F-86s when it became the 310th Missile Squadron on 15 June 1958, assigned to the 58th Tactical Missile Group. It remained the home of the surface-to-air TM-61 Matador missile. As the 498th Tactical Missile Group on Okinawa became operational with the TM-76 Mace, which was more capable and had longer range that the 310th's Matadors, the need for missiles in South Korea ended and the squadron was inactivated on 25 March 1962.Mindling & Bolton, p. 232 Fighter training On 1 December 1969, the squadron resurfaced as the 310th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron 1 December 1969: two weeks later, on 15 December 1969 Luke Air Force Base, assuming the personnel and equipment of the provisional 4514th Combat Crew Training Squadron. Initially flying the new A-7 Corsair II ground attack aircraft, aircraft carrying tail code \\"LA\\" with blue tail stripes. Began transition to the McDonnell F-4C Phantom II in July 1971, assuming training mission from Davis‚ÄìMonthan AFB units. Operated the F-4C until April 1982. aircraft carrying green fin caps. The squadron started phasing out the F-4 for the Block 1 General Dynamics F-16A Fighting Falcon in 1982, with the distinction of operating the first production F-16 #78-0001. Deactivation with the F-4C was on 4 November 1982. F-16s initially tail coded \\"LA\\", recoded to \\"LF\\" on 1 January 1983. In the early years of operation with the F-16, the squadron patch was very different and the squadron name was Falcons. Eventually the 310th would return to the patch style used in World War II with a tophat wearing skull with a pair of dice (see patch top of page). The squadron name changed as well to \\"Top Hats\\" which it has carried through to today. In 1988 the 310th began receiving brand new block 42 F-16C/Ds to replace the F-16A/B. The 310th TFTS became the first unit to receive the block 42 and also became the first F-16 squadron to receive the LANTIRN night vision system. Instructor pilots assigned to the 310th developed and wrote the Replacement Training Unit syllabus for both the Block 40/42 and LANTIRN. They also developed the first LANTIRN tactics. Until the mid-1990s, the 310th was dedicated almost exclusively to the LANTIRN training mission. On 1 November 1991 the 310th was re-designated simply as a Fighter Squadron. Although the word 'Training' was dropped, nothing in that role was changed and was the case for all USAF Tactical Fighter Training Squadrons at that time. During the late 1990s with the growing use of night vision goggles the 310th has become the principle trainer in this role. It was several years later that the squadron began training night-vision goggle qualified pilots. Although now well known for night vision training, the 310th FS is also tasked with other pilot training normally in the realms of advanced pilot training. One such program is Forward Air Controller, of which the 310th FS is currently the only squadron in the USAF that trains F-16 pilots in this role. Each class lasts five weeks and includes twelve sorties intended to test technical knowledge of the program. The 310th Fighter Squadron on average graduates thirteen classes of FAC qualified pilots a year. Beginning in April 2004 the 310th FS was tasked with all night vision goggle training. Pilots going through this training program have to be experienced as the night vision goggles prove to be very challenging. New pilots to the training program have known to follow stars in the sky thinking they are following their flight leader. In bad weather the goggles can be useless as they depend on some source of light. A common training element is to have students fly in a four ship formations on a strike mission having to fight their way in and out against enemy aggressors. In all, a trainee will face three to four weeks of training using the goggles including simulator time and eight sorties in the real jet. Although it fluctuates, the school often turns out 150 night vision goggle trained pilots a year.

(1958). The Three Edwards. pp.193‚Äì95 She was arrested and subsequently imprisoned in the Tower of London for the duration of a year from November 1321 to November 1322, making her the first recorded female prisoner in the Tower's history. She was jailed on account of having ordered an armed assault on Isabella of France, Queen consort of King Edward II of England. Before Margaret had instructed her archers to fire upon Isabella and her escort, she had refused the Queen admittance to Leeds Castle where her husband, Baron Badlesmere held the post of governor, but which was legally the property of Queen Isabella as part of the latter's dowry. Margaret surrendered the castle on 31 October 1321 after it was besieged by the King's forces using ballistas. Edward's capture of Leeds Castle was the catalyst which led to the Despenser War in the Welsh Marches and the north of England. Upon her release from the Tower, Margaret entered a religious life at the convent house of the Minorite Sisters outside Aldgate. King Edward granted her a stipend to pay for her maintenance. Background Margaret was born at an unrecorded place in either Ireland or England on or about 1 April 1287, the youngest child of Thomas de Clare, Lord of Thomond and Juliana FitzGerald of Offaly, and was a granddaughter of Richard de Clare, Earl of Hertford and Gloucester. She had two brothers, Gilbert de Clare, Lord of Thomond, and Richard de Clare, 1st Lord Clare, Lord of Thomond, who was killed at the Battle of Dysert O'Dea in 1318;The Complete Peerage, Vol. III, p.247. and an elder sister, Maud, whose first husband was Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford. Margaret had an illegitimate half-brother, Richard.Cawley, Charles (2014), Medieval Lands, England, Earls of Gloucester (Clare) Foundation For Medieval Genealogy. Retrieved 27 March 2014 Her parents resided in both Ireland and England throughout their marriage;Calendar of Documents relating to Ireland 1252‚Äì1284, No. 2210 it has never been established where Juliana was residing at the time of Margaret's birth although the date is known. Her father died on 29 August 1287, when she was almost five months of age. His cause of death has never been ascertained by historians. Her mother married her second husband, Nicholas Avenel, sometime afterwards, but the exact date of this marriage is not known. Between 11 December 1291 and 16 February 1292, Margaret acquired another stepfather when her mother married her third husband, Adam de Cretynges. Inheritance A series of inquisitions post mortem held in response to writs issued on 10 April 1321 established that Margaret, the wife of Bartholomew de Badlesmere and Maud, wife of Sir Robert de Welle (sisters of Richard de Clare and both aged 30 years and above) were the next heirs of Richard's son Thomas.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 4, No. 275. Thomas' estate included the stewardship of the Forest of Essex, the town and castle at Thomond and numerous other properties in Ireland. First Marriage She married firstly before the year 1303, Gilbert de Umfraville, son of Gilbert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus, and Elizabeth Comyn. Upon their marriage, the Earl of Angus granted Gilbert and Margaret the manors of Hambleton and Market Overton; however, when Gilbert died childless prior to 1307, the manors passed to Margaret. Second Marriage On an unrecorded date earlier than 30 June 1308, when the couple were jointly granted the manor of Bourne, Sussex,Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward II, 1307‚Äì1313, page 83. Margaret married Bartholomew de Badlesmere, an English soldier and court official who was afterwards created 1st Baron Badlesmere by writ of summons. He had held the post of Governor of Bristol Castle since 1307, and during his life accumulated many remunerative grants and offices. It is feasible that Margaret's marriage to Badlesmere had been arranged by her brother-in-law, Baron Clifford; Badlesmere having been one of Clifford's retainers during the Scottish Wars. Clifford was later killed at the Battle of Bannockburn, where Badlesmere also fought. Margaret was styled as Baroness Badlesmere on 26 October 1309 (the date her husband was by writ summoned to Parliament by the title of Baron Badlesmere) and henceforth known by that title.The Complete Peerage, Vol. I, page 372. When Margaret was visiting Cheshunt Manor in Hertfordshire in 1319, she was taken hostage by a group of sixty people, both men and women.Cat. Pat. Rolls. 1317‚Äì1321, p.473 Her captors demanded a ransom of ¬£100 for her release. She was held prisoner for one night before being rescued on the following day by the King's favourite, Hugh Despenser the Younger.

[Reference: Linda Elizabeth Mitchell. Portraits of Medieval Women: Family, Marriage and Politics in England 1225‚Äì1350] Margaret refused the Queen admittance.Haines, p.132 It was suggested by Francis Lancellott that Margaret's antipathy towards Queen Isabella had its origins in about 1317 when she had asked Isabella to use her influence on behalf of a friend who was seeking an appointment in the Exchequer Office. When Isabella refused her request, for reasons unknown, a quarrel ensued and henceforth Margaret became the Queen's enemy.Lancellott, Francis (1858). The Queens of England and Their Times. New York: D. Appleton and Company. p.183.

Retrieved 16-11-10 The unexpected, lethal volley of arrows, which killed six of the royal escort, compelled Isabella to make a hasty retreat from the castle and to seek alternative accommodation for the night.Strickland, p.201 Historian Paul C. Doherty suggests that the pilgrimage was a ruse on the part of the King and Queen to create a casus belli. Edward would have known beforehand that Baron Badlesmere was with the Contrariants in Oxford and had left Leeds Castle in the hands of the belligerently hostile Baroness Badlesmere; therefore he had given instructions for Isabella to deliberately stop at Leeds aware she would likely be refused admittance. Using the insult against the Queen as a banner, he would then be able to gather the moderate nobles and outraged populace to his side as a means of crushing the Contrariants.Doherty, Paul C. (2003). Isabella and the Strange Death of Edward II. London: Robinson. pp.70‚Äì71 . When King Edward heard of the violent reception his consort was given by Margaret, he was predictably outraged and personally mustered a sizeable force of men \\"aged between sixteen and sixty\\", including at least six earls,Costain, p.194 to join him in a military expedition which he promptly led against Margaret and her garrison at Leeds Castle to avenge the grievous insult delivered to the Queen by one of his subjects. Following a relentless assault of the fortress, which persisted for more than five daysAccording to Edward II's biographer, Roy Martin Haines, the siege lasted 15 days. [Reference: Haines, p.132] and with the King's troops using ballistas, Margaret surrendered at curfew on 31 October having received a \\"promise of mercy\\" from Edward.Haines, Roy Martin (2003).

Baron Badlesmere, although supportive of Margaret's conduct, had during that crucial time, sought refuge at Stoke Park, seat of the Bishop of Lincoln; however he did manage to despatch some knights from Witney to augment the garrison troops in the defence of Leeds. Once King Edward had gained possession of the castle and the Badlesmere treasure within, the seneschal, Walter Colepepper and 12 of the garrison were hanged from the battlements.Haines, p.133The Calendar of Fine Rolls names the 13 executed men as Walter Colpepper, Richard Prat, Roger de Coumbe, Richard de Chidecroft, Thomas de Chidecroft, Richard Brisynge, William Colyn, Roger de Rokayle, Simon de Tyerst, Robert de Bromere, Nicholas de Bradefeld, Robert de Cheigny, and Adam le Wayte. [Reference:Calendar of Fine Rolls 1319‚Äì1327. p.76] Margaret was arrested and sent as a prisoner, along with her five children and Bartholomew de Burghersh, to the Tower of London;Ireland, William Henry (1829).

London: Allison and Busby. p.40. Poyser, pp.27‚Äì28 On her journey to the fortress, she was insulted and jeered at by the citizens of London who, out of loyalty to Isabella, had followed her progression through the streets to vent their fury against the person who had dared maltreat their queen.Costain, pp.194‚Äì95 Aftermath The King's military victory at Leeds, accomplished with the help of six influential earls including the Earls of Pembroke and Richmond, encouraged him to reclaim and assert the prerogative powers that Lancaster and the Lords Ordainers had so long denied him.Costain, p.195The Ordinances were repealed at the parliament held in York in May 1322. The dominant baronial oligarchy broke up into factions. Many of the nobles who had previously been hostile to Edward rushed to his side to quell the insurrection of the Marcher Lords, known as the Despenser War, which had erupted in full force after the King defiantly recalled to England the two Despensers (father and son,) whom the Ordainers had compelled him to banish in August 1321.Costain, pp.195‚Äì97 The first sparks to the uprising had been ignited when, prior to his expulsion, the rapacious Hugh le Despenser the Younger had persuaded the infatuated King to grant him lands in the Welsh Marches which rightfully belonged to entrenched Marcher barons such as Roger Mortimer,Costain, p.197 his uncle Roger Mortimer de Chirk, and Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford, a staunch Ordainer albeit the King's brother-in- law.In 1302, Humphrey de Bohun married Edward II's youngest sister, Elizabeth of Rhuddlan; she died in 1316. They had formed a confederation and made devastating raids against Despenser holdings in Wales; and Mortimer led his men in an unsuccessful march on London. These mutinous events, in addition to other incidents which created a tense situation and called for a mobilisation of forces throughout the realm, eventually led to the Ordainers constraining the King to exile the favourites. However, subsequent to his capture of Leeds Castle and the harsh sentences he had meted out to the insubordinate Margaret de Clare and her garrison, King Edward defied the Contrariants by persuading the bishops to declare the Despensers' banishment illegal at a convocation of the clergy, and he summoned them home. This act had dire consequences in addition to the Despenser War: it paved the way for the complete domination of the grasping Despensers over Edward and his kingdom, leading to Roger Mortimer and Queen Isabella's 1326 Invasion of England, their assumption of power, the execution of the two Despensers, and finally, Edward's deposition. Imprisonment Margaret was the first recorded woman imprisoned in the Tower of London Baron Badlesmere excused his wife's bellicose actions at Leeds with his declaration that when he had left Margaret in charge of Leeds, he had given her strict instructions not to admit anyone inside the castle without his specific orders. This, he had insisted, included the Queen, with the words that \\"the royal prerogative of the King in the case of refusal of entry should not be assumed to provide a legal right for the Queen, who was merely his wife\\". As a result of Margaret's imprisonment, Badlesmere remained firmly aligned with the King's opponents; shortly afterwards he participated in the Earl of Lancaster's rebellion. Badlesmere was captured after taking part in the Battle of Boroughbridge on 16 March 1322 which had ended with a royalist victory. Following trial at Canterbury, he was executed at Blean on 14 April 1322. Margaret remained imprisoned in the Tower until 3 November 1322, when she was released on the strength of a bond from her son-in-law William de Ros and five others.Calendar of the Close Rolls, 1318‚Äì1323, p. 604 Presumably her children were released with her, but a record of the exact dates of their liberation has not been found.

Piscataway, New Jersey: Transaction Publishers, Rutgers University. pp.202‚Äì03 On 13 February 1322/3, the King granted Margaret a stipend of two shillings a day for her maintenance, which was paid to her by the Sheriff of Essex.Calendar of the Close Rolls, 1318‚Äì1323, p. 627 She also received a considerable proportion of her late husband's manors for her dowry.Burke's Peerage Edward demonstrated his good will toward Margaret again on 1 July 1324, by giving her \\"permission to go to her friends within the realm whither she will, provided that she be always ready to come to the king when summoned\\".Calendar of Close Rolls (Edward II, 1323‚Äì1327), pp.46, 48, 120, 236 It appears that after then she lived at Hambleton, Rutland as it was from there that on 27 May 1325 she submitted a petition in connection with property at Chilham. Her son Giles obtained a reversal of his father's attainder in 1328, and succeeded by writ to the barony as the 2nd Baron Badlesmere. By this time Edward III had ascended the throne; however, the de facto rulers of England were Queen Isabella and her lover, Marcher Lord Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March (father-in-law of Margaret's daughter Elizabeth), who jointly held the Office of Regent for the new king. Edward II had been deposed in January 1327 and allegedly murdered in September by Mortimer's hired assassins.Costain, pp.236‚Äì37 The regency of Queen Isabella and Lord Mortimer ended in October 1330 when Edward III now nearly 18 had Mortimer hanged as a traitor and Queen Isabella exiled for the remaining 28 years of her life at Castle Rising in Norfolk.

Mayotte had been an overseas collectivity of France since 2003. In contrast to the four other similar regions (Guadeloupe, Martinique, R√©union and French Guiana), Mayotte would not have become an Overseas department (DOM) or an Overseas region (ROM), but would only have had a single assembly; the four other existing DOM/ROM will have the option of changing their status to this format as well.D√©partementalisation de Mayotte : d√©but d'une campagne d'explication , La Gazette, 9 January 2009 As a result of the yes vote, Mayotte became the 101st French department in 2011, and the first with a population overwhelmingly of the Muslim faith. The move has been opposed by the African Union and Comoros, who claim it is \\"occupation by a foreign power\\" and several protests have been held in Moroni, capital of Comoros.Mayotte to hold referendum on whether to become France's 101st d√©partement, Telegraph, 27 March 2009Comorans demonstrate against French referendum for Mayotte, Afrique en ligne, 28 March 2009 The Comoran vice- president said the vote was a \\"declaration of war\\".Mayotte backs French connection, BBC News, 29 March 2009  Background  The population of Mayotte was approximately 186,000 at the time of the election. Ninety-five percent of Mahorans are Sunni Muslims. Many Mahorans are fluent only in local languages, including Shimaore and Bushi, rather than the French language. It is believed that one-third of the population consists of illegal immigrants, mostly from the neighboring, impoverished Comoros islands. Continued political union with France has allowed Mayotte to remain relatively prosperous, at least by regional standards, compared to the independent Comoros. The Comoros, which has suffered from economic and political instability since its independence, continues to claim Mayotte as part of its territory. French President Nicolas Sarkozy promised a referendum on Mayotte's future status during the 2007 French presidential election. Many Mahorans hoped to benefit economically in the future with a possible yes result. The unemployment rate in Mayotte stood at over 25% at the time of the 2009 referendum.  Support  All of Mayotte's major political parties and politicians, including the General Council President Ahmed Attoumani Douchina, supported the \\"yes\\" campaign. For example, Abdoulatifou Aly, a Mahoran legislator, supported the \\"yes\\" campaign arguing that Mayotte has a longer history within France than some areas of the mainland in an interview with L'Express, \\"We may be black, poor and Muslim, but we have been French longer than Nice.\\" The campaign also received strong support from the French government in Paris. Public opinion polls leading up to the referendum showed strong support for closer political union from the vast majority of Mayotte's citizens, and the \\"yes\\" campaign was expected to win by a wide margin. Many saw the comparative advantages of full French citizenship as greater than the need to retain some traditional local customs, such as polygamy, which would be eliminated under French law.  Local opposition  Some Islamic imams and religious leaders had urged a \\"no\\" vote. The imam of Mamoudzou, Mayotte's capital city, campaigned strongly against the referendum due to the expected abolition of polygamy with a \\"yes\\" victory. \\"The law of the Qur'an permits a man to have two or three wives. I'm polygamous. I've already let go of two or three wives in the past.\\"  Results  Early poll results indicated that the \\"yes\\" option had received approximately 95.2% of the total votes cast.Mayotte : 95.2% de \\"oui\\" au final, Le Figaro, 29 March 2009 The estimated voter turnout was a high 61% of eligible Mahorans. French Interior Minister Michele Alliot-Marie hailed the results of the landslide election saying, \\"This will reinforce the place of Mayotte in the republic, reaffirming our founding values, particularly equality between men and women, the same justice for all, and the place of the French language.\\"  Referendum implications  With a yes result, Mayotte, which was an overseas collectivity, became an integral French department on 31 March 2011. Local judicial, economic and social laws and customs were changed to conform with French law. Mayotte banned polygamy before it became a department. Women's rights were increased to French standards. Women didn't have equal inheritance rights in Mayotte, which was later modified to comply with the French justice system. The minimum age in which a person can legally marry was raised from 15 to 18 years old. Mayotte legalised same-sex civil unions, known as PACS in France. The traditional Mayotte local court system, which combined Quranic principles of Islam with African and Malagasy customs, were phased out in favor of the French legal system. Islamic law was abolished and replaced by uniform French civil code.Mayotte vote en faveur de la d√©partementalisation, Le Monde, 29 March 2009 Mayotte had a traditional Islamic legal system consisting of qadis, as religious scholars were known, who acted as judges in cases related to Islamic law. Islamic courts and justice system were replaced by secular courts, though the qadis retained a role as legal consultants. As a department, Mayotte became eligible for expanded French social and economic programs, as well as European Union funds. However, the French government didn't immediately extend the social welfare system enjoyed by metropolitan France. Instead, social service benefits were gradually extended to Mahoran citizens over a period of 20 years, until they are equal to those enjoyed in metropolitan France. The French government also promised financial support to strengthen Mahoran infrastructure. Income taxes were increased as a result of integration with the French republic.

He graduated from Webster Union School, then studied law with James B. Perkins at Rochester. He was admitted to the bar in 1887, and commenced practice in Rochester. On January 2, 1886, he married Adeline Louise Moody (1866-1894). He was delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention of 1894. He was an alderman of Rochester from 1891 on, and as President of the Common Council since 1894 became Acting Mayor of Rochester after the resignation of George W. Aldridge in 1895. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Monroe Co., 1st D.) in 1897, 1899, 1900 and 1901; and of the New York State Senate (43rd D.) from 1902 to 1906, sitting in the 125th, 126th, 127th, 128th and 129th New York State Legislatures. At the New York state election, 1906, he ran for New York State Comptroller, but except for Governor Charles Evans Hughes, the whole Republican ticket was narrowly defeated by the ticket nominated by the Democratic Party and the Independence League. In January 1915, he was appointed as First Deputy by Attorney General Egburt E. Woodbury. Woodbury resigned on April 19, 1917, and six days later Lewis was elected New York Attorney General by joint ballot of the New York State Legislature (vote: Lewis 173, Morris Hillquit 2), and at the New York state election, 1917, he was elected to remain in office until the end of 1918. At the 1918, he declined to run for re-election and ran in the Republican primary for governor instead. In August 1918, he urged the Republican voters to repudiate his opponent, the incumbent Governor Charles S. Whitman, because Whitman was backed by William Randolph Hearst whom he accused of having undermined the United States war effort against Germany. Whitman was re-nominated but was defeated in the election by Al Smith. He died on May 2, 1937, in Rochester, New York.

The name continued to 1988 and was brought back in early 2000s, although it has been nowhere near as successful sales wise as the 1980s item.  Frames  The Raleigh Burner range was split into Six different frames: * Mk1 Burner * MK1 Pro Burner * Mk2 Burner * MK2 Aero Pro Burner * Team Frame  Mk1 Burner  This can be identified by the loop tail frame and gusset with two holes in it. This first version (1982-1983) was originally available in three variants: The basic model was available with either a blue or red frame. It had conventional wire-spoked wheels, matt black front forks, yellow saddle and frame pads, and gold coloured brake calipers and levers. Typical UK retail price of the basic model in 1982 was ¬£120. During this period, the next model up was the 'Tuff Burner'. As per the basic model, the Tuff Burner was available with either red or blue frames, and accompanied by matt black forks, yellow saddle and frame pads, and gold coloured brake levers and calipers, the Tuff Burner was distinguished from the basic model by its yellow, five-spoke 'Mag' (plastic) wheels. Typical UK retail price of the red or blue 'Tuff Burner' in 1982 was ¬£130. The top of the line model in the years 1982-83 was the 'Super Burner', which was distinguished by its apparently gold paintwork (In actual fact, the bike's frame was chrome plated and then covered with a transparent, gold tinted film). It had black frame pads with gold coloured script. In the years 1982-83 the Mark 1 Super Burner was available only with conventional wire-spoked wheels that had gold-painted rims, although a variant with five-spoke mag wheels (in black) became available for the 1984 model year. This later 'Mag' version of the Super Burner was known as the 'Super Tuff Burner'. The typical UK retail price of a Super Burner in 1982 was ¬£140. In 2019, Raleigh re-released the Super Tuff Burner as a limited edition product, where it retailed at ¬£600.  Mk1.2 Burner - AKA Model B  These Burners still had round tubing but several key features changed, among them: Plastic pedals replaced the original metal \\"rat-traps\\", Rubber grips with two- tone coloring replaced the foam ones, and tubing was deemed Carbospec 23 with stickers in key locations such as the fork, replacing the regular Raleigh logo with \\"Competition 23\\" etc.  Mk2 Burner  This has an oval profile rather than round as per Mk1.The looptail was ditched and the frame made longer.A letter 'R' was cut out in the front and rear wheel spindle drop outs. There were also some Burners built using Japanese \\"Tange\\" or \\" Kozumi\\" frames. These were the Cromo Burner, the Aero Pro and the Team Aero Pro. These were top class bikes with quality wheels and brakes. Far better and usually out of the reach of your average working class family wage.  MK3 Burner  In 2007 Raleigh started to release in limited numbers \\"anniversary\\" models.

They released three studio albums on Star Song Records from 1991 to 1994. The group later formed their own record label, We are One/Throne Room Records, and released an extended play in 1998 and a fourth studio album in 2003. Alton Hood and Michael Brown of the group formed Nimisilla Park in 2016, carrying on the D.O.C. tradition of Christian rock and hip hop with a twist of soul.  History  Beginnings The core of the group was Ben Reges (born Alton Hood) and Absalom (Kelvin Harvey) who were attending Oberlin College on football scholarship and friend Prophet (Michael Brown). Hood says of that time, > \\"Basically we were into the world. We both had scholarships to play > football. We didn't have Christ in our lives, so we began to party and live > the high life, hanging out with girls, that whole party life. We had this > void in our lives. So what happened was that I was introduced by some > friends to the occult. It got pretty serious.\\"4th paragraph Hood credits God with cleaning up both him and Harvey from drug addictions born out of their use in occult rituals: > \\"Praise God, through a supernatural manifestation of the Holy Spirit, God's > power came down right there in the room, saved me, delivered me right there > on the spot...\\". Following their conversion to Christianity, the duo began performing raps and beat-boxing at parties. A year later they met third member Prophet (Michael Brown) at a Canton church which they now attended having moved to the Northeast Ohio area. Deal with Star Song Former rock band drummer Matt Stevens was the final member to join. The band met him while in the studio making a demo recording on the advice of friends. According to Hood, they didn't really think anything would happen with it: > \\"We were never into rap for the business or industry standpoint. We were > just doing it as a tool. It was just a good idea to send [our demo] out, it > was not like we put our hopes behind it-it was just something to do. We were > content to be just in the northeastern Ohio area ministering, but God saw > fit, because of our faithfulness to Him, to take it abroad.\\" The demo was noticed by Star Song Records who included the group on a 1990 sampler. The group's debut studio album So How Ya Livin'? was released in 1991. Also that year the group's Alton Hood, Jr made a guest rap appearance on labelmate Whitecross's album In the Kingdom, rapping on the song \\"Holy War\\". In 1993, the group released Pullin' No Punches and did another Christian metal collaboration, this time for Bride's cover of Argent's \\"God Gave Rock and Roll to You\\". The song \\"Innocent Love\\" was released as a single during that year. With their third album, Righteous Funk, in 1994, the group began to resist the rap label and emphasize the 70s funk sounds they grew up on. (\\"We come from the '70s era of funk: Parliament, Earth, Wind & Fire, Heatwave. So, it was really great that we were able to express and come forth with that and introduce the Christian market to something they might not have ever known about.\\")CMO 2nd paragraph The songs \\"Hollywood\\" and \\"Wind Me Up\\" featured funk legends Bootsy Collins, Maceo Parker, Bernie Worrell and Fred Wesley. The album earned the group a Grammy nomination. Forming We are One/Throne Room records Reduced to a duo of \\"Hoody Roc\\" (Alton Hood) and \\"Disciple Paul\\" (David Brooks) and based in Cleveland, Ohio, the group formed their own record label, We are One/Throne Room Records, through which they released the EP Birth of the Rapusical Era in 1998 and their fourth studio album The Antidote in 2003. The album was promoted with a tour merging their music with mime, poetry, dance and drama in a package the group called a \\"Rapusical\\". Discography Studio albums *So How Ya Livin'?

Taxonomy 1765 plate showing Foudia bruante (below), which may instead be a colour morph of the red fody This bird was first mentioned in a report by traveller Gabriel Dellon Cheke & Hume p. 43 & p. 228 and a second time in 1674 by Dubois.Cheke & Hume p. 228 The species, of which no museum specimen exist was formally described as new species by Anthony Cheke and Julian Pender Hume in the Book Lost Land of the Dodo in 2008. A type of fody on R√©union was previously mentioned as Foudia bruante by Philipp Ludwig Statius M√ºller in the work Planches Enlumin√©es in 1776. But after a hypothesis by Cheke and Hume Foudia bruante might be just a colour morph of the red fody which was introduced to R√©union about 100 years after the discovery of Foudia delloni. Description The R√©union fody reached roughly the size of a house sparrow. The head, neck, throat and the wing underparts of the breeding male were bright red. Back and tail were brown. The belly was pale. The head of the females and the juvenile males was brown. Neck and wings were red. The throat was pale brown.Cheke & Hume p. 43 Extinction The R√©union fody was once described as abundant and as pest that destroyed entire crops. It was last seen shortly after 1672. The reason for its extinction might be the predation by rats. Notes References * Anthony Cheke & Julian Hume (2008): Lost Land of the Dodo T. & A.D.

It features the Sixth Doctor, Melanie Bush and Sergeant Benton, and is an exploration both of the origins of the Valeyard and the concept of the Doctor's role as \\"Time's Champion\\" in the Virgin New Adventures. It also features plot elements from Hinton's earlier book The Quantum Archangel. It was published in paperback form in 2008, as a charity venture in aid of the British Heart Foundation.

An Istanbul Armenian, Acharian studied at local Armenian schools and at the Sorbonne, under Antoine Meillet, and the University of Strasbourg, under Heinrich H√ºbschmann. He then taught at various Armenian communities in the Russian Empire and Iran before settling in the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1923, working at Yerevan State University until his death. A distinguished polyglot, Acharian compiled several major dictionaries, including the monumental Armenian Etymological Dictionary, extensively studied Armenian dialects, compiled catalogs of Armenian manuscripts, and authored comprehensive studies on the history of Armenian language and alphabet. Acharian is considered the father of Armenian linguistics. Life Acharian was born in Istanbul (Constantinople) on 8 March 1876 to Armenian parents. Acharian was blinded in one eye at an early age. His father, Hakob, was a shoemaker. He received initial education at the Aramian and Sahagian Schools in Samatya, then at the Getronagan (1889-93), where he learned French, Turkish, and Persian. Upon graduation, he began teaching in Kadƒ±k√∂y, Constantinople, but in 1894 he moved to teach at the Sanasarian College in Erzurum. In 1895 he was accepted to the University of Paris (Sorbonne), where he studied under, among others, Antoine Meillet. In 1897 he became a member of Soci√©t√© de Linguistique de Paris (Linguistic Society of Paris), where he presented a study on the Laz language. He then met Heinrich H√ºbschmann and transferred to the University of Strasbourg in 1898. Acharian moved to Russian (Eastern) Armenia and began a teaching career at the Gevorgian Seminary in Ejmiatsin (1898-1902). He thereafter moved to Shushi (1902-04), Nor Bayazet (1906-07), Nor Nakhichevan (1907-19), and then to Iran: Tehran (1919-20) and Tabriz (1920-1923). He taught Armenian, French, Turkish, Armenian history literature, and accounting. Apart from teaching, he studied Armenian dialects wherever he resided. Acharian moved to Soviet Armenia in 1923. He was one of the most prominent Armenian scholars who moved to Soviet Armenia from the diaspora. He was arrested on 29 September 1937, at the height of the Stalinist purges, on espionage charges. He was accused in being a spy for numerous foreign countries (Britain, Turkey) and being a member of a counter- revolutionary group of professors. He was released on 19 December 1939 due to lack of evidence. He died in Yerevan on 16 April 1953. Adjarian's bust in Yerevan Academic career Acharian became a founding member of the Armenian Academy of Sciences when it was established in 1943. He was a Corresponding Member of the Czechoslovak Oriental Institute since 1937. Acharian taught at the Yerevan State University (YSU) from 1923 until his death in 1953. He mostly taught Persian and Arabic and in 1940 initiated the establishment of the Department of Oriental Philology/Oriental Languages and Literature at YSU. Acharian knew numerous languages: Armenian (both modern and classical), French, English, Greek, Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Hebrew, Russian, German, Italian, Latin, Kurdish, Sanskrit, Chaldean Neo-Aramaic, Avestan, Laz, Georgian, Middle Persian (Pahlavi). Works On Armenian dialects In 1909 Acharian's first ever comprehensive study of Armenian dialects‚ÄîClassification des dialectes arm√©niens (\\"Classification of Armenian Dialects\\")‚Äîwas published in French in Paris. The publication was praised by Antoine Meillet. The Armenian edition (’Ä’°’µ ‘≤’°÷Ä’¢’°’º’°’£’´’ø’∏÷Ç’©’´÷Ç’∂, \\"Armenian Dialectal Studies\\") was published in 1911 with a map of the dialects.Available online at nayiri.com. Acharian proposed a classification based on the present and imperfect indicative particles: -owm/-um (-’∏÷Ç’¥) dialects, -k…ô/-g…ô (-’Ø’®) dialects, and -el (-’•’¨) dialects. In 1913 the Lazarev Institute published his Armenian Dialectal Dictionary (’Ä’°’µ’•÷Ä’ß’∂ ’£’°÷Ç’°’º’°’Ø’°’∂ ’¢’°’º’°÷Ä’°’∂).Available online at nayiri.com. It includes some 30,000 words used in Armenian dialects. His studies on various Armenian dialects have also been published in separate books. These include publications on the dialects of Nor Nakhichevan (1925), Maragha (1926-30), Agulis (1935), Nor Jugha (1940), Constantinople (1941), Hamshen (1940), Van (1952), and Ardeal/Transylvania (1953). In 1902 he published the first ever study of Turkish loan words in Armenian. Armenian Etymological Dictionary Acharian's most cited work is the Armenian Etymological Dictionary (’Ä’°’µ’•÷Ä’ß’∂ ‘±÷Ä’¥’°’ø’°’Ø’°’∂ ‘≤’°’º’°÷Ä’°’∂). It was first published in Yerevan in seven volumes between 1926 and 1935 and includes some 11,000 entries on root words and 5,095 entries on the roots. The latter entries include early Armenian references, definitions, some 30 dialectal forms, and the borrowing of the word by other languages. Its second edition was published 1971-79 in four volumes. It is widely considered a monumental work, that continues to be used as a reference work. Antoine Meillet opined that no such perfect etymological dictionary exists in any other language. John A. C. Greppin has described it as \\"surely the most complete ever prepared for any language.\\" Dictionary of Armenian Proper Names Acharian authored a Dictionary of Armenian Proper Names (’Ä’°’µ’∏÷Å ’°’∂’±’∂’°’∂’∏÷Ç’∂’∂’•÷Ä’´ ’¢’°’º’°÷Ä’°’∂), which was published in five volumes from 1942 to 1962. It includes all names mentioned in Armenian literature from the 5th to the 15th centuries with brief biographies and proper names common among Armenians thereafter. Complete Grammar of the Armenian Language Another monumental work by Acharian is the Complete Grammar of the Armenian Language, in Comparison with 562 Languages (‘º’´’°’Ø’°’ø’°÷Ä ÷Ñ’•÷Ä’°’Ø’°’∂’∏÷Ç’©’µ’∏÷Ç’∂ ’∞’°’µ’∏÷Å ’¨’•’¶’æ’´’ù ’∞’°’¥’•’¥’°’ø’∏÷Ç’©’µ’°’¥’¢ 562 ’¨’•’¶’∏÷Ç’∂’•÷Ä’´), published in six volumes from 1952 to 1971. A seventh volume was published in 2005. Historical studies Acharian authored several major works on history and historical linguistics. The History of the Armenian Language was published in two volumes in 1940 and 1951. It examines the origin and development of Armenian. He also authored the most comprehensive study on the invention of the Armenian alphabet. Its first part, examining the historical sources, was published in 1907. The third part was published in Handes Amsorya in Vienna from 1910 to 1921 and then in a separate book in 1928. The first two parts, examining the historical sources and the life of Mesrop Mashtots were published in Eastern Armenian in 1968. The complete work was first published in 1984. Acharian wrote a History of Modern Armenian Literature (’ä’°’ø’¥’∏÷Ç’©’µ’∏÷Ç’∂ ’∞’°’µ’∏÷Å ’∂’∏÷Ä ’£÷Ä’°’Ø’°’∂’∏÷Ç’©’µ’°’∂, 1906‚Äì12), History of the Turkish Armenian Question (’è’°’≥’Ø’°’∞’°’µ’∏÷Å ’∞’°÷Ä÷Å’´ ’∫’°’ø’¥’∏÷Ç’©’µ’∏÷Ç’∂’®, 1915) covering the period from 1870 to 1915, The Role of the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire (1999), and the History of Armenian Diaspora (2002). He wrote memoirs on Yervand Shahaziz (1917) and Srpouhi Dussap (1951). Manuscript catalogs Acharian compiled catalogs of Armenian manuscripts kept at different locations. His catalog of the manuscripts at the Sanasarian College in Erzurum/Karin was published in Handes Amsorya in 1896-97. He later cataloged the Armenian manuscripts in Tabriz (1910), Nor Bayazet (1924), and Tehran (1936). Recognition Panos Terlemezian's 1928 portrait of Acharian Acharian has been recognized as the father of Armenian linguistics by modern scholars, such as Dora Sakayan, and the greatest Armenian linguist by Samvel Antosian. By the 1940s Acharian had an international reputation greater than Nicholas Marr and Ivan Meshchaninov. Some authors have called him an \\"undisputed authority.\\" Rouben Paul Adalian noted that he \\"single-handedly prepared the central scientific reference works on the Armenian language and, in so doing, vastly expanded modern knowledge and understanding of Armenian civilization through its entire course of development.\\" Jos Weitenberg described him as the \\"most outstanding personality in Armenian linguistic research.\\" The Institute of Language of the National Academy of Sciences of Armenia is named after Acharian. His bronze bust stands at the central campus of the Yerevan State University. Hrachya Acharian University operated from 1991 to 2012. It was one of post-Soviet Armenia's earliest private universities. A bust of Acharian was unveiled in Yerevan's Avan District in 2015. Panos Terlemezian (1928) and Martiros Saryan (1943) painted portraits of Acharian.

Etymology The name Leurospondylus comes from a fusion of two Greek words, leuros (ŒªŒµœÖœÅœåœÇ) meaning \\"even\\", \\"flat\\" or \\"smooth\\", and spondylos (œÉœÄœåŒΩŒ¥œÖŒªŒøœÇ) meaning \\"vertebra.\\" The name of the type species L. ultimus comes from the Latin ultimus meaning \\"last.\\" It was so named because this genus was the latest known occurrence of a fossil plesiosaur when it was described in 1913.\\" Description The first described Leurospondylus was a juvenile.\\"A new plesiosaur, Leurospondylus, from the Edmonton Cretaceous of Alberta\\". Bulletin of the AMNH; v. 32, article 40. The fossil included 12 vertebrae but the animal is thought to have had twice that number, and was estimated to be roughly 2 meters long as a juvenile. Samuel Paul Welles noted that the vertebrae are short and similar to those of pliosaurs,Welles, S. P. 1962. A new species of elasmosaur from the Aptian of Columbia and a review of the Cretaceous plesiosaurs. University of California Publications in Geological Science 46, 96 pp. while the scapulae and coracoids bear resemblance to those of elasmosaurids, thus making it difficult to determine to which family it belongs. There is some speculation that the Leurospondylus specimen is either a juvenile of a known species, or in its own, unrecognized taxonomic group. Distribution The first Leurospondylus was found in the brackish paleoenvironment represented by the Edmonton beds located on the present-day Red Deer River. This area is part of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation in Alberta, Canada. The occurrence of this juvenile fossil in an identifiably brackish environment led to the conclusion that plesiosaurs spent their early lives in rivers and estuaries. However, some plesiosaurs spent their adult lives in fresh water also; whether Leurospondylus grew up and then left, or grew up and stayed in a fresh water ecosystem has not been determined.

Originally a distinct settlement set in green fields, it now merges with the late 19th- and early 20th-century suburban sprawl along London Road below Penkhull village on the outskirts of Stoke-on-Trent and within the ward of Stoke and Trent Vale. Most dating from 1851‚Äì55, The Villas was designed by local architect Charles Lynam, who became a prominent architect in Staffordshire, building the Minton Hollins tileworks, for example. In designing The Villas, he chose an Italianate style similar to other Staffordshire buildings, such as Trentham Hall and Alton Towers railway station. In June 1850, a number of prominent inhabitants of Stoke formed \\"The Stokeville Building Society\\". The purpose of the building society was to provide the means and the financial capability for its members to erect, and ultimately own, houses on copyhold land outside the town of Stoke-upon-Trent. The land, 'Big Meadow and Barker's Meadow', containing seven acres, two rods and 18 perches, belonged to the Reverend Thomas Minton, brother of Herbert Minton and son of the founder of Thomas Minton and Sons (later Mintons Ltd), pottery manufacturer of Stoke, and was finally purchased for ¬£1,582 on 3 May 1859. Conservation Originally built in three distinct classes, all providing accommodation for servants to ‚Äúlive in‚Äù, changing times meant that many were subdivided by the 1940s. In 1956, a resident of number 15 The Villas, Arnold Machin, received publicity in the national press when he chained himself to the old metal lamp-post on the turning circle in protest at its planned removal. Machin's protest, \\"against the destruction of all the beautiful things which is going on in this country.\\" did not prevent the lamp- post from being replaced by a concrete one; however, it was given to him for his own garden and his wife Patricia unlocked him. A similar lamp has since been restored to the position of the original one. The estate subsequently received the distinction, on 19 April 1972, of being the first designated conservation area in Stoke-on-Trent. Some of the houses also receive individual protection as listed buildings. Initially, a couple of the houses were listed, but more houses were listed on 15 March 1993, and The Villas now contains the highest concentration of Grade II listed buildings in the city. The roadway which leads from London Road to The Villas is unadopted, and it remains unmetalled. Stoke on Trent City Council have stated that the ownership of the road is unclear, and have described the pavements as being \\"in an appalling state of repair.\\"https://www.stoke.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/417/the_villas_conservation_area_appraisal.pdf The original building society lapsed, The Villas Vampire Case The area gained national attention in January 1973, when Polish immigrant Demetrious Myicuria was found dead in his bed. Apparently terrified of a vampire attack, Myicuria had strewn his room with salt and garlic in ritual fashion. A post- mortem examination showed he had choked to death on a pickled onion, although PC John Pye believed it to have actually been a clove of garlic.

The current Director is Soumyaa Behrens. It is situated within the College of Liberal & Creative Arts at San Francisco State University, with access to a broad cross-section of educational institutions in San Francisco and the Bay Area. It is a resource for undergraduate and graduate students studying film in the area as well as faculty interested in the artistic and politic dimensions of documentary cinema.  History  Since 2005, DocFilm has organized thematic festivals, premieres, individual film exhibitions, tributes and pre-launch activities which brought national and international films and filmmakers to a broad base of people. DocFilm promotes the work of emerging and established documentary filmmakers through tributes and annual thematic festivals. DocFilm did the west coast premiers of films like Darwin's Nightmare and Grizzly Man which later on gained worldwide recognition among the most important documentaries in recent times. In 2006, the Doc Film Institute launched Oscar Docs (2006‚Äì09, 2011), an annual three-day festival of the Academy Award-nominated short and feature documentaries, featuring introductions and Q&As; by many of the nominated filmmakers. The event is open to general public. In 2011, Daniel Bernardi assumed the directorship of the Institute, and film critic and theoretician Bill Nichols became chair of the advisory committee. Building on the previous work of the Institute, they created an official charter, connected the Institute more firmly to the Cinema Department at San Francisco State University, and began focusing on mini- grants to student filmmakers, the production of independent documentary films and public events such as screenings, lectures and conferences  Productions  DocFilm produces films which provide a deeper introspection of a wide range of socio-cultural topics. Institute staff work with professional filmmakers, some of whom are Cinema Department faculty at San Francisco State University. State students benefit from working as interns on these films. Its productions include the following films: Cachao: Uno mas (2010) Doc Film Institute's first production, this movie is a tribute to Afro-Cuban musician Israel \\"Cachao\\" L√≥pez. Filmed in San Francisco, it was the result of a collaborative effort between professional filmmakers and Cinema Department students. It premiered at the San Francisco International Film Festival (2008) and was selected by festivals worldwide. In 2010 it premiered in the PBS series \\"American Masters\\". Chang Dai-chien in California (2011) This 23-minute film pays tribute to the 20th-century Chinese master painter Chang Dai-chien. The painter was filmed by Art historian Michael Sullivan in 1967. This footage was acquired by San Francisco State University who used the footage to create the documentary. God Willing (In development) The upcoming feature- length document God Willing focuses on the lives of five Iraqi soldiers - one woman and four men - fighting with Allied Forces.  Education  DocFilm offers master classes, production internships, seminars and mentoring to students and audiences at large. Renowned filmmakers like Francis Ford Coppola, Ken Burns, Bertrand Tavernier, D.A. Pennebaker, Richard Leacock, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Christopher Hampton and Hubert Sauper, have presented master classes for San Francisco State University students, sharing their inspirations, experiences, creative process and gave advice on pertinent issues of making films. Some of the classes were videotaped and will be available on the DocFilm website soon. Doc Film Institute is currently cataloging and reorganizing its documentary collection to make it part of the Cinema Department's new Media Library, thus giving the students access to a vast array of the best documentary films of the last decades. Students can also benefit from Doc Film's Internship program, which allows them to become involved with professional filmmakers as well as general production experience and event coordination.

Davis (born August 13, 1950) is Carl W. Blegen Professor of Greek Archaeology at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio and is a former Director of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. Brief biography Jack L. Davis has directed or co-directed regional archaeological projects in several areas of Greece, including the Nemea Valley, the island of Keos, and Messenia near the Palace of Nestor (Pylos Regional Archaeological Project). In addition he has directed regional studies and excavations in Albania in the hinterlands of the ancient Greek colonies of Dyrrachium/Epidamnos and Apollonia. Davis is a recognized authority in the archaeology of the Aegean Islands. He has published reports on excavations on the islands of Keos (at Ayia Irini) and Melos (at Phylakopi). Davis is the author of \\"Review of Aegean Prehistory: The Islands of the Aegean\\" in Aegean Prehistory: A Review, a collection of papers edited by Tracey Cullen for the Archaeological Institute of America. He has also contributed to the Cambridge Companion to the Aegean Bronze Age (2008) and to the Oxford Handbook of Aegean Prehistory (2010). In addition to prehistoric topics his research interests include the history and archaeology of Greece in the Ottoman and early modern periods and the relationship between the history of Classical archaeology and national movements in the Balkans. He is an occasional contributor to \\"The Archivist's Notebook.\\" Davis is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, a Corresponding Member of the German Archaeological Institute, and has served on advisory boards of the American Journal of Archaeology, Hesperia, and Sheffield Studies in Aegean Prehistory, among other journals. Since 1993 his primary academic appointment has been in the Department of Classics of the University of Cincinnati, where he is Carl W. Blegen Professor of Greek Archaeology. From 2007-2012 he was on leave from that post to direct the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Greece. In 2012 he was elected to the Institutional Council of the National and Capodistrian University of Athens. In 2016 he was a co-recipient of the Premio Giuseppe Scicca in Archaeology, jointly with Sharon R. Stocker. In 2017 he received the medal for Special Civil Merits from the Republic of Albania. He has been awarded the Gold Medal Award for Distinguished Archaeological Achievement for 2020 by the Archaeological Institute of America. History of research Davis completed his undergraduate education at the University of Akron in 1972, where he first studied public speaking, theater, and radio broadcasting, then Latin, Greek, ancient Egyptian history and language, and ancient history. In the autumn of 1972, he began post-graduate studies at the University of Cincinnati under the supervision of John L. Caskey and Gerald Cadogan. As a student he had the opportunity to work with Cadogan at Knossos and with Caskey at Ayia Irini on the Cycladic island of Keos. From 1974-76, Davis was in Greece, as a student at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, where he held in successive years the James Rignall Wheeler and Eugene Vanderpool fellowships. In Athens he met John Cherry, then a graduate student at the University of Southampton, and, through him, later had the opportunity to study finds from the recent British excavations at Phylakopi on the Cycladic island of Melos and to learn the methods and aims of systematic intensive archaeological surface survey. After completing his Ph.D., Davis taught at the University of Illinois at Chicago until 1993, under the auspices of which, in the early 1980s, he organized two intensive surveys with Cherry, one on the island of Keos (1983-1984), the other in the Nemea Valley (1984-1989), as part of the Nemea Valley Archaeological Project, directed by James C. Wright of Bryn Mawr College. The results of the former, presented in a monograph co-authored with Eleni Mantzourani, constituted one of the first fully published presentations of the results of an intensive archaeological survey in the Mediterranean.Landscape Archaeology as Long-Term History: Northern Keos in the Cycladic Islands (Los Angeles 1991), winner of the Jo Anne Stolaroff Cotsen Prize. With J.F. Cherry and E. Mantzourani. At the same time, he completed publication of excavated finds from the later Middle Bronze Age at Ayia Irini.Keos V. Ayia Irini: Period V (Mainz 1986) In 1990, Davis, together with colleagues from the Nemea and Keos surveys, organized the Pylos Regional Archaeological Project, an exploration of areas of the western Peloponnese near the Mycenaean Palace of Nestor at Pylos in the province of Messenia. The project was sponsored by the University of Cincinnati, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the University of Texas at Austin, and the University of Michigan. Investigations were completed in 1996 and results have been extensively discussed in a series of articles in Hesperia, journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, and in a book, Sandy Pylos (also available in Greek translation).Sandy Pylos: An Archaeological History from Nestor to Navarino (University of Texas Press 1998; Greek Translation 2004; second edition 2007). With S.E. Alcock, J. Bennet, Y. Lolos, C. Shelmerdine, and E. Zangger. In 1994, after joining the faculty of Classics at the University of Cincinnati, Davis and his wife, Sharon Stocker, traveled to Albania for the first time. In 1996, plans to begin an intensive archaeological survey in the hinterland of the Greek colony of Apollonia, co- directed with Muzafer Korkuti, director of the Institute of Archaeology in Tirana, were interrupted by the collapse of pyramid banking schemes and the ensuing chaos. Subsequently, fieldwork was conducted from 1998-2003 at Apollonia, in 2002 in the hinterland of Dyrrachium/Epidamnos, and the remains of a hitherto unknown Greek temple were investigated in three campaigns of excavation in 2004-2006. Problems in interpreting medieval and post-medieval archaeological remains led Davis to explore, together with colleagues Siriol Davies, Fariba Zarinebaf, and John Bennet, previously underexploited documentary sources that can be employed for reconstructing a social and economic history for Greece during periods of Venetian and Ottoman occupation, particularly in the 17th and 18th centuries.Between Venice and Istanbul: Colonial Landscapes in Early Modern Greece (Princeton: American School of Classical Studies at Athens 2007).

He also continued to pursue the study of the institutional history of foreign schools of archaeology in Greece and assisted his wife in publishing unpublished finds from Carl W. Blegen‚Äôs excavations at the Palace of Nestor.

He served as Solicitor-General and then as a judge, and ultimately as Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. Early life Eyre was the eldest son of Sir Samuel Eyre of New House, Whiteparish, Wiltshire and his wife Martha Lucy, daughter of Francis Lucy of Westminster and Brightwalton, Berkshire. He was admitted at Lincoln's Inn on 2 April 1683 and matriculated at Lincoln College, Oxford on 11 May 1683. In 1690, he was called to the bar. He married Elizabeth Rudge, daughter of Edward Rudge, MP, with ¬£4,000, on 6 December 1694. He succeeded his father in 1698. Career Eyre became deputy recorder of Salisbury in 1693 and became Recorder in 1695 for the rest of his life. At the 1698 English general election, he was returned as Member of Parliament for Salisbury. He was nominally a Whig, but had a tendency to independence, particularly to make trouble. He was returned again at the two general elections of 1701 and at the 1702 English general election. He became Recorder of Southampton in 1703, serving until 1723, and recorder and alderman of Bristol in 1704, serving until 1728. He was returned again as MP for Salisbury at the 1705 English general election. In 1707 he became a QC and bencher of his Inn. Eyre was returned to Parliament again at the 1708 British general election and was appointed Solicitor-General from 1708 to 1710. He became Treasurer of his Inn in 1709. He was particularly active at this time in relation to the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell. In 1710, he was appointed a puisne judge of the Court of Queen's Bench, and was knighted on 6 May 1710. He did not stand for Parliament again. In 1718, he gave an opinion favouring the view of the Prince of Wales, rather than that of the king over the education of the prince's children, and was therefore passed over for promotion to be Lord Chief Justice of King's Bench. However, he was appointed Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer in 1723 and then appointed as Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in 1725, a post in which he served until his death. He was a governor of Charterhouse by 1723. Eyre's wife Elizabeth died in 1724. He died at his house in Bloomsbury Square, Central London on 28 December 1735. He and his wife had three sons and a daughter. He was succeeded by his son Robert.

Splittertarnmuster, Splittertarn or Splittermuster (splinter-pattern) is a four-colour military camouflage pattern developed by Germany in the late 1920s, first issued to the Reichswehr in 1931. Development Splittertarnmuster was first printed on the newly designed and issued triangular tent/poncho called the dreiecks zeltbahn (triangle tarpaulin), just as the Italian 1929 telo mimetico began as a tent pattern. Known in German as Buntfarbenaufdruck 31 (colourful print 31), for its year of introduction, splittertarn was later issued to practically all regular military (Wehrmacht) units. The pattern consists of a disruptive, zig-zag pattern of hard-edged wood-brown and medium green polygons printed on a light field-grey or tan background. A random pattern of green dashes, called raindrops, was applied in places to improve the camouflage effect. Proposed in 1931 and introduced in 1932, the four-colour camouflage patterns incorporated \\"splinters\\" on top of the 1918 colour pattern. The pattern included ochre, rust and brown overlaid on a green foundation, with sharp corners between coloured patches. This new pattern was printed on zeltbahn (triangular tent) material and could also be used as a camouflage rain poncho in the field. Both sides of the material showed the same pattern but the printing was brighter on one side. A subdued grey-beige tint replaced the yellow-ochre colour. On top of this background, green and brown irregular patterns were screen-printed. A final innovation applied to this camouflage colour printing were the \\"splinters\\" irregularly printed on the fabric. Directional, dark-green dashed lines (\\"grass\\" or \\"rain\\") were printed in selected areas to help break up the silhouette. Many similar rain pattern designs inspired by splittermuster were made after the war by Warsaw Pact countries. During the war, cost-saving measures required textiles to be printed with changed colours and many of the lower-cost two-colour options were abandoned. These cost-saving measures caused significant deviations from the original colour patterns. In 1941 splitter pattern jump smocks were issued to German paratroops for the invasion of Crete. Heeres-Splittermuster 31 In 1942, a Tarnhemd (smock) and Tarnhelm√ºberzug (helmet cover), both of a lightweight herringbone twill linen, were issued. Only one side of each was printed in splitter pattern; the other side was left white for snow camouflage.German Army Uniforms and Insignia 1933‚Äì1945, Brockhampton Press (2000), In April 1942, a Wintertarnanzug suit consisted of a padded jacket, trousers, separate hood and mittens. These were also printed only on one side and were left white on the other side. Only a small amount of this was produced; a similar set made in mouse grey or field grey were more common. Many unofficial garments and helmet covers were produced as field expedients or were tailor-made, mostly from zeltbahn material. These included versions of the service dress uniform, parachute-jump smocks, field jackets, rucksacks and panzer jackets. Later materials included rayon.\\"Uniforms and Insignia of the Luftwaffe: 1940‚Äì1945\\", Arms & Armour (April 1999), , .

The Luftwaffe's variant of splittermuster 31 is known in the literature as \\"splinter camouflage B\\". The pattern was used for the Fallschirmj√§ger's parachute Knochensack jump smock and Luftwaffe Field Division field jacket to be manufactured. Other material produced with this equipment included camouflage helmet covers, ammunition bandoliers and grenade bags. The production of the splinter camouflage B ended in 1944.Richardson, Francis.

Its typical square look with the dashed lines has been the national camouflage of Bulgaria and has continually evolved. It was worn as a one piece boilersuitWarsaw Pact Ground Forces, Grodon L Rottman, Osprey Publishing Elite 10, 1987 and as a two piece suit for paratroops, border troops and mountain troops. The mountain version had large patches of reinforcing materials on the knees, elbows, wrists and shoulders and black patches under the arms, around the collar and in the crotch. A Soviet style large beret, pulled down to the left, was worn.Soviet bloc Elite Forces, Osprey, J Zaloga and James Loop, Osprey Publishing Elite 5 1985 For the paratroopers in 1953, a three-colour pattern was introduced, which had been derived directly from the bright colours printed in 1941 for the German paratroopers. The dashed lines here were not aligned uniformly in one direction but could vary within a limited framework. The colours were based on the model but used other tones. The Bulgarian splinter 53 was later issued to special forces and worn until 1991. The Bulgarian Splittertarnmuster was developed in the 1960s and 1970s, with varied shapes and colors. In 1979, the army released another version of the Bulgarian paratroopers colored imprint of 1941, with wavy dotted lines, which was again closer to the German model. In 1991 the production of the pattern was started. In 1997, the current three-color printing for bright colors was launched for the entire Bulgarian army, with the dashed lines appearing again in a spidery waveform. Sweden Swedish M90K desert camouflage Swedish soldier wearing M90 From 1990, the Swedish armed forces carried a four-color M90 Splittertarnmuster, which is close to the bright colors printed 31 through the resumption of sharp linear triangular patches. The differences are in the schematic, because the spots are not distributed freely but directly abut and are not crossed by the dashed lines. Blue, khaki and light green patches are distributed on a dark green background. This camouflage pattern was exported to Latvia for wear as part of SFOR forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

After eleven years on the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, Cromwell was nominated to succeed Michel Bastarache and occupy the seat traditionally reserved for Atlantic provinces on the Supreme Court of Canada by Prime Minister Stephen Harper,. and assumed office on December 22, 2008. Cromwell retired in September 2016, and was succeeded by Malcolm Rowe. Known as a centrist on Canada's highest court, his reasoning as a provincial appellate judge in R v Marshall; R v Bernard was adopted by unanimous decision in the landmark Aboriginal title case of Tsilhqot'in Nation v British Columbia in 2014 during his tenure. Early life and education Cromwell was born in Kingston, Ontario. He attended Queen's University where he earned a Bachelor of Music degree in 1973 and a law degree in 1976. He then earned a Bachelor of Civil Law degree at Exeter College, Oxford in 1977. He also earned an ARCT Diploma from the Royal Conservatory of Music in 1974. Career He practised law in Kingston from 1979 to 1982 and was a sessional lecturer in civil procedure at the Queen's Law School from 1980 to 1982. He was a professor of law at Dalhousie University from 1982 to 1992 and again from 1995 to 1997. Between these two periods he was Executive Legal Officer in the chambers of then-Chief Justice of Canada Antonio Lamer. In 1997, Jean Chr√©tien appointed him to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal as a direct appointment (meaning he did not serve on a lower court). In that role, Cromwell decided in favour of recognizing the claimant's Aboriginal title in R v Marshall; R v Bernard, but his reasoning was overturned by the Supreme Court. When announcing the nomination to the Supreme Court of Canada, Harper stated that Cromwell would not be appointed to the bench until he had answered questions from an ad hoc all-party committee of the House of Commons. Tories set nomination process for new SCC judge. CTV News, May 29, 2008. However, this process was bypassed when Cromwell was officially appointed; Prime Minister Harper had expressed concern that waiting for the committee to meet would hobble the court in executing \\"its vital constitutional mandate effectively.\\" However, Parliament wound up meeting only very seldom after Cromwell's initial nomination, mainly because of a federal election called by Harper for October 14, and then the subsequent proroguing of Parliament on December 4, until its scheduled resumption on January 26, 2009. While on the Supreme Court, Cromwell joined the rest of the court in a unanimous decision in Tsilhqot'in Nation v British Columbia to recognize the existence of Aboriginal title for the Tsilhqot'in. The decision that drew in large part from his previously rejected Nova Scotia Court of Appeal ruling in R v Marshall; R v Bernard, vindicating his earlier judgement. Cromwell wrote the minority opinion in R v Jordan, criticizing the majority's decision to impose strict time limits of 18 months in provincial court and 30 months in superior court after which a case would be stayed for \\"presumptively unreasonable\\" delay except in exceptional circumstances. Cromwell argued that what was unreasonable was specific to each individual case, and the numbers decided by the majority without much discussion, would lead to more stays than necessary. Justice Cromwell retired from the Supreme Court of Canada on September 1, 2016, at the age of 64, fulfilling a personal intention to resign around age 65. Throughout his eight-year service on the Supreme Court, Cromwell authored around a hundred decisions and earned a reputation as a centrist, neither left or right, activist or deferent. After his departure from the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin asked him to remain as the chair of the Canadian Forum on Civil Justice's action committee addressing issues related to access to justice for civil and family matters. Cromwell's departure from the Supreme Court before the mandatory retirement of 75 hurried plans by the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to create an independent nominee advisory board chaired by former prime minister Kim Campbell. In February 2017, Cromwell joined Borden Ladner Gervais as counsel. On February 12, 2019, former Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada Jody Wilson-Raybould retained Cromwell to advise her in the wake of her resignation from the federal cabinet.

It was renamed as Qila Ahmad Abad on 18 March 1999, owing to behemoth furore among the masses of the town, that it should be renamed. Before 1 July 1991 it was under the District Administration of Sialkot and was part of Sialkot District but after 1 July 1991 it was made part of Narowal and on the same date Narowal was declared a district. It is part of Narowal DistrictElection Commission of Pakistan and is located at 32¬∞13'60N 74¬∞46'0E and has an altitude of 240 metres (787 feet).Location of Qila Sobha Singh ‚Äì Falling Rain Genomics  History  There are numerous sources which trace the origins of the town but the authenticity of many of these sources varies. The less-reliable historical sources about the origins of the city have been derived from the oral traditions based on ancient local beliefs which, most historians concur, are full of inaccuracies, concocted legends and erroneous facts and pertain to the Vedic scriptures which give a description of the ancient city. These are, nonetheless, stated here. More reliable and validated historical references relating to the city date back to centuries in which it has been stated that the city is of Persian and/or Greek origin. The evidences reveal that it was a bastion of Sikhism and the town was ruled by a Sikh Maharaja. The origin of the town is related to a Sikh land owner called Sobha Singh. When Sobha Singh was married, his father gave him the lands surrounding the part of Qila Sobha Singh. The name Qila implies a fort; this name originates in the fact that Sobha Singh's family had a very large and tall mansion, which was surrounded by smaller houses. Because there was a wall surrounding the whole town with several gates, the town had the appearance of a fort. Also Sobha sing has three other brothers named as Mian singh, Deedar Singh, During the Indian rebellion of 1857, British troops while tracking down the rebels kept on scouring the area and arrived at the Qila and surrounded it, believing it to be a fort. Representatives of the town people, however, managed to convince the troops that the town was not in fact a fortification. In 1947, the year of Pakistan's independence from the British Indian Empire, Qila Sobha Singh was a very small town with mainly Sikh and Hindu population. Most of the Sikhs and Hindus living in the town moved to the Indian part of the Punjab and many Muslim immigrants moved to the area from the East Punjab and settled over there.  Climate  Lying between 31¬∞30‚Ä≤ North latitude and 73¬∞32‚Ä≤ East longitude at an altitude of 252 m above sea level, Qila Sobha Singh is bounded on the north by Sialkot, northwest by Pasrur, and on the south by Narowal. Qila Sobha Singh features a humid subtropical climate under the K√∂ppen climate classification. Qila Sobha Singh is chilly during winters; and tepid, humid and sultry during summers. May and June are the hottest months. The temperature during winter may drop to 1 ¬∞C. The land is, generally, plain and fertile. Most of the rain falls during the Monsoon season in summer which often results in flooding and deluge.  Saga about construction of Qila  It is widely believed ‚Äì and this yarn has been spun by the people of the town that when ever the Sikh Maharaja thought of constructing the fort and started constructing the fort it kept on dilapidating intermittently. An eminent sorcerer told the Maharaja that when any Muslim will be immolated at the threshold of the fort then it will not dilapidate any more. Meanwhile, a saint, Peer Syed Baba Balaq Shah Walli(R.H)told the Maharaja that if he will drop one drop of blood at the place of fort, instead of the immolation of a Muslim, then it will also not dilapidate. It was witnessed that when the saint dropped one drop of blood from his finger at the threshold of the fort, afterwards it never became dilapidated. A shrine of that saint was built near that fort. The duties of the shrine were on His Grandson's son \\"Peer Syed Saqlain Shah Bukhari\\" but on his death on 14 August 2001, his sons took the duties of the shrine under the leadership of \\"Peer Syed Raza Saqlain Bukhari\\". A large number of believers come to the shrine on every Thursday with firm belief and food called \\"Langar\\" is distributed among them with great respect. The Urs of saint \\"Peer Syed Baba Balaq Shah Wali(RH)\\" is celebrated on \\"28 June\\" every year and \\"27 June\\" in leap years.  Geography  It is geographically located at the eastern side of Pakistan. It has one inundated canal which passes through the town. The town is 21 km from Narowal, on Narowal's northern side by road and rail. 11 km from Pasrur on its southern side by road and rail. The town is 44 km from Sialkot and 127 km from Lahore. It lies 251 m above sea level. The Nala Dek flows to the north west of Qila Sobha Singh.  Demography  It is a small town with a population of more than 50,000, according to local a survey from 2010. There are also few homes of Afghan refugees and migrants from India and Jammu Kashmir who have permanently settled in Qila Sobha Singh.

He was born in Red Island, Newfoundland and Labrador. Barry graduated from Memorial University (BA 1963, BSc 1962), Dalhousie Law School in 1967 and received a Masters (specialization in Jurisprudence and International Law) from Yale Law School in 1968. Prior to his judicial career, Barry was a Newfoundland MHA and Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador leader and Leader of the Opposition from 1984 until 1987 when he was forced to resign as party leader due to opposition by his caucus. Barry was initially elected to the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly as a Progressive Conservative in 1972. He served as Deputy Speaker of the House of Assembly before being appointed to the Cabinet of Frank Moores as Minister of Mines and Energy during which time he took a leading role in developing Newfoundland's oil and gas regulations.http://bondpapers.blogspot.com/2007/05/other-point-of- view-1984.html He was defeated in the 1975 provincial election and served as chairman of the Newfoundland Labor Relations Board for until 1977 when he became a lecturer at Dalhousie University's law school in Halifax. In 1979, Barry returned to Newfoundland and contested the leadership of the Progressive Conservative party placing third, losing to Brian Peckford. He won a seat during the 1979 provincial election and was appointed energy minister in Peckford's cabinet. Barry resigned from cabinet in 1981 due to a disagreement with Peckford over negotiations with the federal government over Newfoundland's claim to offshore resources. On Feb. 21, 1984, he crossed the floor to join the Liberal Party and became the party's leader later that year. As Liberal leader in the 1985 provincial election he increased the number of Liberal seats from four to 15 in the 52 member House of Assembly.Robert Martin, \\"Liberal Party chief drops bid to keep Newfoundland post\\", Globe and Mail, April 29, 1987 Despite his initial success in increasing the Liberal Party's position, he was seen as aloof and arrogant and was not popular with his caucus who saw him as unwilling to put all of his energy into the party. His position became less secure after the Liberals came in third place in two by-elections. In February 1987, after Barry went on a week-long trip to Boston without informing his caucus, he returned to be handed a letter signed by all 14 of his caucus colleagues demanding a leadership convention.\\"Ex-leader in Newfoundland can empathize with Turner,\\" Globe and Mail, April 28, 1988 He initially refused to resign as party leader but agreed to allow a leadership convention in which he would be a candidate. He resigned as Leader of the Opposition on March 23, 1987 and then withdrew from the leadership race and resigned as party leader on April 28, 1987. Clyde Wells was elected party leader in June and went on to lead the Liberal Party to victory in the 1989 provincial election. Barry returned to his legal practice and was appointed to the bench in 1989 becoming a judge of the Trial Division of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2007, he was appointed a judge of the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador. Barry was a rumoured candidate to replace Supreme Court of Canada Justice Michel Bastarache.Tories set nomination process for new SCC judge However, Prime Minister Stephen Harper nominated Thomas Cromwell of Nova Scotia to fill the vacancy.

It is the last of seven novels in the Tillerman Cycle. Plot summary Seventeen Against the Dealer is the final novel in the seven- part Tillerman Cycle. The novel takes up the story of Dicey Tillerman, now 21, who has dropped out of college despite a scholarship in order to start her own business building wooden sailboats. Dicey is the oldest of four Tillerman children, whose journey to Crisfield, Maryland and subsequent life there with their grandmother, Abigail Tillerman, or Gram as the children call her, is described in the preceding novels Homecoming, Dicey's Song, and Sons from Afar. As a continuation of the preceding Tillerman novels, this novel contains characters developed in the previous Tillerman books, notably Dicey's siblings James (now 18), Maybeth (16), and Sammy (15); her boyfriend Jeff Greene (23); her friend Mina Smiths (21), and Gram, the Tillerman's maternal grandmother with whom they have lived for 8 years. The book is set in around 1986, and the events of the novel take place over a short time-span, between New Year's Eve and Valentine's Day. At the start of the novel, Dicey is just beginning her new boatbuilding business, which she has dropped out of college to start. To learn the trade, she has worked hard in a series of low-paid jobs in Annapolis and Crisfield and now she has built up a small amount of savings that she hopes will enable her to start realizing her dream. Dicey becomes increasingly absorbed in and even obsessed by her work, to the detriment of her relationship with Jeff, who asks Dicey to marry him at the start of the book, explaining that he does not want to have a casual relationship with her. Dicey makes some crucial mistakes in her new business, including failing to take out insurance on the tools and equipment in her workshop. When the workshop is broken into, she loses all she has and cannot make it up, despite help from Jeff. Increasingly desperate, Dicey takes help from a smooth-talking drifter who turns out to be a con artist. Eventually Dicey stacks the odds against herself and has to close up shop. As Dicey's preoccupation with her work increases, her family and friends fade from the pages of the novel, reflecting her neglect of them. Eventually, after a series of crises culminating in Gram's serious illness, Dicey realizes that her relationships are as important, if not more so, as her work.. The novel also develops, albeit in a lesser way, the characters of the other three Tillerman children, now young adults. James is a stellar student at Yale but as in previous novels experiences problems associated with reason and ethics. He has made close friends - including with Toby, whom he meets in Dicey's Song and is a chess aficionado. Maybeth has grown into a beautiful young woman, who has many female friends and is attractive to men - yet she is still studying hard and failing most classes in school. As she is courted by older men, the novel is haunted by the danger that she could repeat the mistakes of her mother, who left home to pursue an affair with a drifter twelve years her senior. Sammy is a hardworking young man who has a part-time job pumping gas in a service station; he has learned to take apart engines and helps the Tillermans buy their first car. He is a budding tennis star and wants to attend an expensive tennis summer camp. The Tillermans' home has grown from an isolated place into a centre for social activity - on New Year's Day, for example, a tradition has grown up whereby family and friends gather at the Tillerman home, and a festive meal is eaten with singing and merriment. Gram is a central part of this, having grown considerably since her days of extreme isolation and loneliness. Although Voigt's characters grow and learn over the course of the novel, the ending does not provide any definite resolutions or total closure. The characters still face difficulties and problems, and it is not clear how marriage to Jeff, for example, will bring Dicey, a hardworking and independent young woman, a resolution to her need and desire to express her independence through work.

The maneuver involved the command module pilot separating the Apollo Command and Service Module (CSM) from the adapter, turning the CSM around, and docking its nose to the Lunar Module, then pulling the combined spacecraft away from the upper stage. It was performed shortly after the trans-lunar injection maneuver that placed the Apollo spacecraft on a three-day trajectory to the Moon. The docking created a continuous, pressurized tunnel which permitted the astronauts to transfer internally between the CSM and the LM. The same maneuver was performed on the 1975 Apollo‚ÄìSoyuz Test Project (ASTP) mission to extract a special docking module used to connect the Apollo Command Module with the Soyuz spacecraft.  Procedure  Alfred Worden docks the Apollo 15 Command Module Endeavour to the Lunar Module Falcon Transposition and docking was performed by the Command Module Pilot (CMP) (although, as a backup, the Commander and Lunar Module Pilot (or ASTP Docking Module Pilot) were also trained to perform the maneuver), and involved the following steps: #A \\"CSM/LV Sep\\" button on the control panel was pressed, which ignited detonating cord and separated the CSM from the Spacecraft‚Äìlunar module adapter (SLA), and the four adapter panels from each other and the S-IVB upper stage. This exposed the LM. #The CSM's translation thrusters were used to move it a safe distance away. Rotation thrusters were then used to pitch up the CSM 180¬∞ and roll it to the proper alignment angle for docking. Translation thrusters were then used to move it back to the LM. A T-shaped docking target on the top of the LM aligned optically with a reticle pattern on the CMP's left-hand docking window to ensure proper spacecraft alignment. #A soft dock was achieved when a probe at the top of the CSM was inserted into a hole in the center of a cone-shaped drogue at the top of the LM and three small capture latches closed. Hard dock was achieved by activating a mechanism which retracted the probe and caused twelve more capture latches to close around the command module's docking flange. #A pressure equalization valve in the CM forward hatch was opened to allow oxygen to fill the LM through a similar valve in its hatch that was left open at launch. When the pressure equalized, the pilot removed the CM hatch, removed the probe and drogue, inspected the capture latches, and connected two umbilical cables which electrically connected the CM and LM. He then replaced the CM hatch. #The LM hold-down attachments and umbilical connection to the S-IVB Instrument Unit were released, and the CSM's translation thrusters were used to pull the CSM/LM stack a safe distance away from the S-IVB, which would then be steered by ground control either to a heliocentric orbit, or to a deliberate crash landing on the Moon. The astronauts were in no hurry to complete this maneuver, which nominally took about an hour. It would take longer if problems were encountered; for instance, Stuart Roosa had trouble getting the capture latches to engage for docking on Apollo 14, and the procedure took two hours and eighteen minutes.  Missions  Apollo 7 S-IVB, with docking target inside the SLA. Note the right-hand panel is not fully opened to the same angle as the others, preventing a safe simulated docking approach. Transposition and docking was performed on all Apollo missions which carried both the CSM and the LM, from Apollo 9 onward. Transposition and a mock LM-docking approach was first simulated on the Earth-orbiting Apollo 7 flight (which carried a docking target in the SLA, but no LM). The \\"Block I\\" SLA used on the early Saturn IB launch vehicles had panels that opened at a 45¬∞ angle but did not separate from the S‚ÄëIVB. One of the panels did not open the full angle, preventing the crew from approaching the S‚ÄëIVB for fear they might strike this panel. This was corrected with the \\"Block II\\" SLA design used on all crewed Saturn V Apollo flights (starting with Apollo 8), which detached the panels and pushed them away from the S‚ÄëIVB with springs. The last mission to use the maneuver was the Apollo‚ÄìSoyuz Test Project mission, in which the Apollo CSM docked to a specially designed adapter module which carried docking equipment compatible with the Soyuz 19 spacecraft.

The attraction allows guests to encounter numerous species of ray before boarding a manta ray-shaped train that takes them on a roller coaster ride above the park, reaching top speeds of . Designed by Swiss firm Bolliger & Mabillard, Manta restrains riders in the prone position and features four inversions. The well- received attraction officially opened to the public on May 22, 2009. Their slogan is \\"Dive deep, fly high‚Ä¶\\". History SeaWorld Orlando revealed the concept that was to become Manta to a gathering of travel industry representatives and community leaders on April 2, 2008, although it had been in the planning stages for years. The exact specifications were not immediately revealed, but the park said it would be their largest single investment in an attraction and that it would open sometime in 2009. The park also announced that the attraction would include a roller coaster, but that it would be more than just a roller coaster. Joseph Couceirovice president of sales and marketingdescribed the ride as \\"the next generation SeaWorld attraction\\" that would immerse guests in elements of marine life. Artists' concepts of the new attraction were leaked onto the Internet in April 2008; however, SeaWorld officials would not confirm whether the images were accurate representations of the final design, but said that the roller coaster would have a gliding sensation. Searches of trademark applications uncovered an entry for the use of the term \\"Manta\\" as an amusement ride and construction on a large site within the park had already begun. On May 29, 2008, park officials confirmed that the attraction would be named Manta, and announced additional details about the attraction. Construction of the roller coaster track and attraction buildings began in September 2008. Superior Rigging & Erection built the supports and track. The ride's layout was completed in December 2008 and construction on other parts of the roller coaster continued into early 2009. SeaWorld began previewing the attraction in early May 2009, before it was officially opened on May 22. Design Theme and surrounding experience Manta is an attraction which encompasses a themed queue and a roller coaster. The queue is designed to resemble a seaside village decorated with mosaics and artwork inspired by rays. Within the attraction's site are ten aquaria containing of water. Approximately 3,000 animals representing over 60 species are visibleincluding over 300 rays, such as cownose rays and spotted eagle rays. Other creatures on display include sea horses, leafy seadragons and tropical fish. Portions of the aquarium exhibit can be viewed by guests who do not wish to ride the roller coaster. Non-riding guests can use a second entrance to the attraction area, which is separated from those waiting for the roller coaster. Guests in the ride's queue have access to special exhibit components, such as a Plexiglas \\"pop-up\\" window into the aquarium. Mantas rails, supports and track are filled with sand to reduce noise. Trains and loading procedure Manta is a flying roller coaster, which simulates the sensation of flight. It is designed to resemble the way rays‚Äîmantas in particular‚Äîappear to fly through seawater. Guests are initially seated upright on the trains in one of eight rows that hold four passengers each, accommodating up to 32 riders. Manta operates with three trains. Before departure, mechanisms in the station raise the cars up to the track, such that the riders' spines are parallel to the track. Guests are secured in their seats using a locking lap bar, a vest-like harness and flaps at the riders' ankles to hold their feet in place. The cars are highly stylized. The lead car is shaped like a manta ray with a wingspan of . In the original plans, the wing of the car was intended to make contact with water at a certain point of the ride, but Bolliger & Mabillard said the idea would not work and a fountain was used instead. The roller coaster's wings appear to skim the water's surface. Water jets in the attraction's main lagoon create a splash effect as the train passes. SeaWorld can adjust several features of the splash effect, including its duration and the train's speed when it enters the area. The roller coaster's color scheme includes deep purple, ultramarine blue and cobalt. Track The steel track of Manta is long and lift hill is high. There are four inversions; a pretzel loop, two inline twists and one corkscrew. The track is dark blue and the supports are light blue. Sand is placed inside some sections of track to reduce the noise produced by the trains. Friction brakes are used to control the speed of the train. The track was fabricated at the Ohio-based Clermont Steel Fabricators. In 2015, a clone of Manta opened at Nagashima Spa Land under the name of Acrobat. Ride experience An overview of Manta's track layout Manta features a dual station configuration, which allows two trains to be loaded at the same time, thus increasing the ride's capacity. After departing from the station, the train will make either a slight left or right turndepending on which station it leavesinto the chain lift hill. From the top of the lift hill, the train makes a downward right turn into a -tall pretzel loop, after which it turns left, leading into the first of two inline twists. The train then makes a right turn followed by a slight upward left turn into a corkscrew, before turning right into the mid-course brake run. The train then drops to a point just above a body of water, at the same time making a 270-degree right turn, where water jets spray up near the train to produce the effect of the train actually hitting the water. After exiting the turn, the train goes by a waterfall, goes through the second inline twist, makes a left turn into the final brake run, then makes a left turn into one of the two stations where the next riders board. Reception One of Manta's trains Manta has been lauded by the mainstream media and industry press since its debut in May 2009. Busch Entertainment Corporation, SeaWorld Orlando's parent company, credited Manta with improving park attendance. In July 2009, ThemeParkInsider.com named Manta \\"best new attraction\\". In September 2009, Manta placed third in Amusement Today magazine's poll for the Best New Ride of 2009.

She was a lifelong friend and correspondent of writer Charlotte Bront√´ and, through more than 500 letters received from her, was a major influence for Elizabeth Gaskell's 1857 biography The Life of Charlotte Bront√´. Early years Nussey was the twelfth child of John Nussey (1760‚Äì1826), a cloth merchant of Birstall Smithies, near Gomersal in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and his wife Ellen, n√©e Wade (c. 1771‚Äì1857). She attended a small local school before progressing to Gomersal Moravian Ladies Academy. Nussey met Mary Taylor and Charlotte Bront√´ in January 1831, when they were pupils at Roe Head School, near Mirfield in Yorkshire. They corresponded regularly over the next 24 years, each writing hundreds of letters to the other. In 1839, Nussey's brother, Henry, proposed marriage to Bront√´, but she found him dull and refused his offer. Friendship with the Bront√´s Through her frequent visits to the Parsonage at Haworth, Nussey also became a friend of Anne and Emily Bront√´, and was accepted as a suitable friend for his daughters by their father. In May 1849, Anne decided to visit Scarborough in the hope that the change of location and fresh sea air might be good for her failing health, and give her a chance to live, she went with Charlotte and Nussey. Before the trip, Anne expressed her frustration over unfulfilled ambitions in a letter to Ellen: Nussey in about 1855 En route, they spent a day and a night in York, where, escorting Anne around in a wheelchair, they did some shopping, and at Anne's request, visited York Minster. It became clear that Anne had little strength left and on Sunday, 27 May 1849, she asked Charlotte whether it would be easier for her to go home to die instead of remaining at Scarborough. A doctor, consulted the next day, indicated that death was already close. Anne received the news quietly. She expressed her love and concern for Nussey and Charlotte, and seeing Charlotte's distress, whispered to her to \\"take courage\\".Barker, The Bront√´s, p. 594 Nussey's presence during the weeks following gave comfort to Charlotte Bront√´, who was writing her novel Shirley at the time. Nussey believed that the character Caroline Helstone was based on herself.William Scruton, Reminiscences of the late Miss Ellen Nussey 1897 Nussey was staying with the Bront√´s at Haworth on the night of the 1851 census and is shown on the return as \\"visitor\\". When Charlotte Bront√´ married her father's curate, Arthur Bell Nicholls in June 1854, Nussey was one of two witnesses present. Their engagement had caused a cooling in the friendship on Nussey's part, who was probably jealous of Bront√´'s attachment to Nicholls, having thought they would remain spinsters.The Letters of Charlotte Bront√´ edited by Margaret Smith. Oxford University Press (2004) After Charlotte's death Nicholls became concerned that her letters to Nussey might damage her reputation and asked Nussey to destroy them, but she refused. Nussey sought to have the letters from Charlotte published until she learned that Nicholls held the copyright.Harman, Claire. Charlotte Bronte: A Fiery Heart. New York: Viking, 2015, p. 384. After edited selections from more than 350 letters from Charlotte Bront√´ to Nussey were used in Gaskell's The Life of Charlotte Bront√´, he prevented at least one other publication from using them. Death and legacy Charlotte Bronte's correspondence is archived at the Bront√´ Parsonage Museum Nussey in about 1895 After Charlotte's death in 1855 Nussey devoted the rest of her life to maintaining the memory of her friend, and was often sought out by Bront√´ enthusiasts and biographers. Nussey experienced both health and financial issues in her final years and friends, including her relative \\"Mrs Agnes Nussey of Potternewton Hall\\" provided her with companionship. Agnes was interested in the Nussey family history and corresponded with Ellen. Nussey was the great-aunt of Helen Georgiana Nussey (1875‚Äì1965), a welfare worker.Susan Williams and Tendayi Bloom, \\"Nussey, Helen Georgiana (1875‚Äì1965)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Nussey died in 1897, aged 80, at Moor Lane House in Gomersal in Yorkshire. Following her death, her possessions and letters were dispersed at auction, and many of Charlotte Bront√´'s letters to her have made their way, by way of donation or purchase, to the Bront√´ Parsonage Museum in Haworth in Yorkshire. Nussey Avenue in Birstall is named after her.

From the late 1970s until his retirement from professional cycling in 1993, Davis achieved more wins ‚Äì 328 victories in all ‚Äì than any other US Cyclist. Davis is one of only three Americans who have won multiple stages of the Tour de France. Greg LeMond and Lance Armstrong are the other two. In 2000, Davis was 40 when he was diagnosed with young-onset Parkinson's disease after years of feeling ‚Äúoff.\\" Shortly after his Parkinson's diagnosis, Davis and his family moved to Italy. While living there, Davis was contacted by Kathleen Krumme, a cyclist who asked Davis to let her use his name in conjunction with her ride (the Sunflower Revolution) to benefit Parkinson's. From this connection, the Davis Phinney Foundation was born. Davis realized there were many ways he could improve the quality of his daily life with Parkinson's, including through exercise. He started the Davis Phinney Foundation as a way to fund and advance research that demonstrates the benefits of exercise, speech therapy, and other behavioral elements that are critical to quality of life with Parkinson's.

The Myst series of adventure computer games deals with the events following the player's discovery of a mysterious book describing an island known as Myst. The book is no ordinary volume; it is a linking book, which serves as a portal to the world it describes. The player is transported to Myst Island and must unravel the world's puzzles in order to return home. Myst was a commercial and critical success upon release and spawned four sequels‚ÄîRiven, Exile, Revelation and End of Ages‚Äî as well as several spinoffs and adaptations. While the player, referred to as a Stranger, remains faceless and unnamed, Myst and its sequels introduce a variety of non-player characters. The inhabitants of Myst include the explorer Atrus, a writer of many linking books, and his wife Catherine and their children. Other characters introduced in the series include Gehn, Atrus' power-hungry father; Saavedro, a traumatized victim of Atrus' sons; and Esher, a member of an old civilization whose motives for helping the player are ambiguous. The first Myst titles used pre-rendered graphics, and digitally inserted footage of live actors into the backgrounds. For Myst V: End of Ages, a different approach was taken: a special camera recorded actors' faces and mapped the video onto digital models. The characters of Myst have been generally praised in each installment. Reviewers found that the live action characters increased immersion, while the digital body language and spoken conviction in End of Ages endeared the characters to the player. Dissenting reviewers considered Mysts acting melodramatic and overwrought. Development When the first game in the franchise, Myst, was created, all the characters were created from footage of live actors. The actors were filmed on a bluescreen, then added to the pre-rendered backgrounds via chroma key. Due to a limited amount of time and money, Mysts creators, Rand and Robyn Miller, took on roles in the game themselves. The Ages of Myst were occasionally seen as lonely by players and reviewers. As a result, Cyan added more characters to the sequel, Riven. Villagers scurry away as the player approaches, and major characters such as Gehn and a rebel band known as the Moiety address the player and give or take items away from him or her. For the first time, Cyan directed the live action actors for Rivens scenes; the designers, including Richard Vander Wende, were apprehensive about how the characters would fit in the finished product. Rand Miller reprised the role of Atrus due to fan expectation, even though he hated acting. Later Myst titles improved on the integration of live action sequences in the prerendered environments of the games. Myst III: Exiles developers filmed all the scenes using standard definition cameras, which producer Dan Irish looked back on as a mistake; by not using high definition video cameras, the video did not look crisp at high resolutions. For the next game, Myst IV: Revelation, Ubisoft allowed players to move the game camera and interact with the video while it was playing through the use of the ALIVE game engine. Myst V: End of Ages was developed so that players could freely navigate Ages rendered in real time, which meant that the digital insertion of characters into the settings was not feasible. The models for End of Agess characters were instead computer- generated. A special device was created that captured video of the actors' faces while they spoke their lines, as Cyan did not want to lose the warmth and feeling provided by using a live actor. The video was then manipulated and used as a facial texture that was mapped onto the 3D characters. Motion capture was also used to ensure lifelike movement. Cyan staff worried that the audio syncing for animation would not be finished in time for the E3 unveiling of the game, but were happy with the end results. The player character in Myst, Riven, Exile and Revelation is never given a name and remains faceless at all times. Atrus addresses the player character as \\"my friend\\" in cutscenes. Cyan's intent was for players to feel as though they were themselves there, stranded on a mysterious island with no choice but to explore. Thus, the games' protagonist is an anonymous, gender-neutral entity with no given history, and players are free to imagine themselves as the protagonist. Characters Atrus and Catherine Atrus, as seen in Myst IV: Revelation. Atrus is the main non-player character in the Myst series, appearing in all five games of the main series; he also narrates the opening of Uru: Ages Beyond Myst. He is a member of the ancient D'ni civilization, though his only D'ni inheritance is through his paternal grandfather. The D'ni perfected a craft known as the Art, which allowed them to create portals to other worlds known as Ages by writing a descriptive \\"linking book\\". After the fall of the D'ni civilization, Atrus' father, Gehn, teaches him the Art and Atrus creates many linking books, surpassing his father's skill in writing. Atrus comes to understand his father's power-hungry nature; as punishment for defying him, Gehn traps Atrus on K'veer, an island off of the main D'ni city, with a book leading to Gehn's Age of Riven as the only escape. On Riven, Atrus meets Catherine, a local inhabitant and a brilliant student of Gehn's who shows promise in the Art of writing Ages, despite not being D'ni herself. Together they trap Gehn on Riven. Atrus' grandmother, Anna (\\"Ti'ana\\"), helps Catherine by writing the Age of Myst as an escape route while Atrus destroys every other linking book on Riven. The linking book to Myst is dropped into a starry expanse known as the Star Fissure, where it is presumed lost (but later found by the Stranger, beginning the events of Myst). Catherine and Atrus start a family on Myst, raising their two sons, Sirrus and Achenar; however, both boys grow greedy and seek to strand their parents, trapping Atrus on K'veer and luring Catherine to Riven, where she is captured by Gehn. The Stranger's discovery of the Myst linking book saves Atrus from being trapped in K'veer a second time, and Catherine from Gehn's clutches. Moving to Tomahna, Atrus and Catherine have a third child, their daughter Yeesha, and attempt to resurrect the D'ni by writing a new Age for the people called Releeshahn. By the events of End of Ages, Catherine has died (likely from old age), and an elderly Atrus confines himself in Releeshahn to live out the rest of his life. Atrus is played by Rand Miller in all the Myst installments. Catherine is portrayed by Sheila Goold in Riven, with her voice dubbed by Rengin Altay, and Maria Galante in Exile. Sirrus and Achenar Sirrus and Achenar are the sons of Atrus and Catherine and are the eldest of their three children. They first appear in Myst, trapped in two different books. Each swears that he is innocent of plundering their father's Ages, and that the other brother is to blame. In actuality, both brothers grew greedy, destroyed Atrus' library, killed the inhabitants of the Ages, and attempted to strand their parents forever. They in turn are trapped in special prison books Atrus designed to imprison unwanted travelers. Once he is freed by the Stranger, Atrus burns Sirrus and Achenar's books. Revelation reveals that the brothers remained exiled on two different Ages for almost twenty years, where Atrus and Catherine hoped they would reform. In Revelation, Sirrus and Achenar escape their prisons, and Sirrus plans on swapping bodies with his sister Yeesha in order to learn the Art and kill his parents. Achenar, who has reformed during his imprisonment, instead works with the Stranger to save his sister.Achenar: This is not Yeesha. Sirrus used the machine. He forced the memory chamber to remove all of her memories. This is Sirrus, I tell you!. [...] (to player) You have to set everybody's memories right again. Turn the amber lever to begin the process.‚Äî Sirrus is killed when the mind-switch fails; Achenar is fatally poisoned when he repairs the machinery to save his sister. In Myst, Sirrus was played by Robyn Miller, and Achenar by his brother Rand; in Revelation, the brothers are played by Brian Wrench and Guy Sprung, respectively. Yeesha Yeesha is the only daughter of Atrus and Catherine. She is briefly mentioned in the novel Myst: The Book of D'ni, and is first seen as an infant in Exile. Yeesha is seen by her parents as a correction to the mistakes they made with their wayward sons. Her parents teach her D'ni and the Art. In Revelation, her brother Sirrus attempts to use Yeesha in a plan to learn the Art and kill his parents, but Yeesha is freed by the Stranger and Achenar. An adult Yeesha appears in Uru: Ages Beyond Myst and is one of two main characters in End of Ages, where she tries to persuade the player to help free an enslaved race known as the Bahro by unlocking a powerful Tablet.Yeesha: The Tablet has responded to you. It will be your burden [...] many have taken this Tablet, and they have tried not to let go. [...] I have held it‚Ä¶ tasted its sweetness. But I can hold it no longer. First, collect what‚Äôs been scattered, and then the Tablet will be released. Then, you will hold it.‚Äî Over the course of her life, Yeesha takes on many roles, eventually assuming the aspect of a prophesied D'ni savior-figure known as \\"The Grower\\". Baby Yeesha is played by Exile game producer Greg Uhler's daughter. Juliette Gosselin plays a young Yeesha in Revelation and Rengin Altay voices the character as an adult in Uru and End of Ages. Gehn Gehn, as he appears in Riven. Gehn is the father of Atrus, and the antagonist of Riven. Gehn is born to Master Aitrus of the Guild of Surveyors (for whom his son is named) and his human wife, Anna (or Ti'ana, as she is known in D'ni), shortly before the downfall of the D'ni civilization. Believing that he creates worlds by writing linking books, Gehn considers himself a god and dedicates his life to rebuilding the fallen D'ni empire. Realizing his madness, Atrus turns against his father; with the help of Catherine, he traps Gehn on the Age of Riven, \\"a prison of my own creation\\" as Gehn later relates it, for nearly thirty years. Gehn's inability to grasp the fine aspects of the Art of Writing, leading him to copy or alter sentences from existing books rather than writing original passages, results in his Ages being unstable.Atrus: They held for more than thirty years, but the corrections I made to Riven have finally failed ‚Äî the island has resumed the familiar pattern of decay that is the hallmark of my father‚Äôs work. [...] I did not create the Age of Riven; unlike my father, I have never presumed to have such power, and yet, the future of all those who live there has fallen into my hands. So far, I‚Äôve managed to read the page before it turns; the island continues to appear stable, and I would like to believe that I have saved a dying world...‚Äî Gehn tends to be unimaginative: besides having no talent for the Art, he merely numbers his Ages rather than naming them (Riven is his \\"Fifth Age\\", for instance), and as long as it will give him what he seeks, prefers to smash his way through D'ni puzzle locks made with delicate materials rather than figure them out. When Catherine is stranded on Riven, Atrus must send the Stranger to rescue her, as he is busy making changes to the Age to delay its collapse.Atrus: Thank God you've returned... I need your help [...] There is a great deal of history you must know, but I'm afraid I must continue writing.‚Äî The Stranger tricks Gehn into a special prison book created by Atrus, and Gehn's oppressed subjects are evacuated from Riven before the Age of Riven closes forever. Gehn is portrayed by John Keston. Saavedro Saavedro is the antagonist of Exile. Depicted as a vengeful and broken man, Saavedro is an inhabitant of the Age of Narayan, one of the Ages chosen by Atrus to try to teach his sons Sirrus and Achenar about the Art of writing books linking to other worlds. Saavedro agrees to help tutor Atrus' sons, but is shocked when the brothers instigate a destructive rebellion and abandon the Age to be destroyed from within.Saavedro: This Atrus stayed with us for months. I taught him how to trim the delicate Lattice roots. How to splice old and new growths together so the walls of our houses will grow strong. I tell him the traditions of the Weave. How by using the spores to support the growing branches, we keep the Lattice Tree alive. He wants to learn everything I know. He wants Narayan to survive. [...] This is what I remember. This is why I said he could send me his sons. Sirrus. And. Achenar. The walls run red with steam and strangling branches. I see their bloated faces laughing at everything. I remember how they lied. I remember what they did. The Lattice Roots were black from too much overgrowth. Puffer spores floated up in the hot steam and burst. No one was there to guide the spores to the branches. No one was waiting to perform the ritual Weaves. The fighting had torn my people apart. They didn‚Äôt care. They wanted Narayan to die.‚Äî When Saavedro pursues Sirrus and Achenar to the Age of J'nanin, he is assaulted and left for dead. Trapped on J'nanin and believing Narayan destroyed and his family to be dead, Saavedro's mental health deteriorates during his years of captivity. When Saavedro is unexpectedly freed and travels to Tomahna in hope of finding the brothers, he steals the linking book for Releeshahn in a plan to lure Atrus to Narayan and exact revenge. Once on Narayan, Saavedro discovers that his people have not been destroyed. Cornered by the Stranger, Saavedro gives up the Releeshahn book. In the game's optimal ending, the player enables Saavedro to peacefully return to Narayan, before taking Releeshahn back to Atrus. Saavedro is portrayed by veteran actor Brad Dourif, who accepted the role of Saavedro because he was a Myst fan. Dourif said that his role for the game was much more difficult than working on movie sets, as he could not see the player he was addressing or interact with the game environment. Esher Esher is a D'ni who survived the downfall of his civilization, and the antagonist of End of Ages. Throughout the game he appears to the player, offering advice and background on different Ages. Esher warns the player not to trust Yeesha, suggesting she has tasked the player with unlocking a powerful Tablet in order to steal its power for herself. If the player gives Esher the tablet instead in one of the bad endings of the game, Esher proclaims that he wishes to use the Tablet to control a powerful race of creatures called Bahro for his own purposes, and strands the player on the Age of Myst. The best ending the player can choose results in Esher being handed over to the liberated Bahro to pay for his crimes. Esher is voiced, and portrayed (in the form of video-recorded facial texture-mapping), by David Ogden Stiers, who received acclaim for his performance. Reception The absence of character interaction in Myst and Riven was commented upon in reviews. Adventure Gamers called the lack of characters a bad element of the games. Conversely, Laura Miller of Salon called the isolation a distinctive and welcome touch. In comparison to contemporary games, the deep solitude allowed the player to focus on puzzles. \\"Games with implausible and annoying characters popping up at regular intervals are just too stressful,\\" said Miller. From Exile onward, the characters of Myst were generally praised in each release. The live-action characters in the pre-rendered Myst titles were favorably received; Greg Kasavin of GameSpot said that the series' use of real actors and full-motion video endeared the characters to the player, giving the games a distinctively personal touch. Fellow GameSpot reviewer Scott Osborne stated the actors delivered convincing performances, and were smoothly incorporated into the game's scenes. The reviewers of G4tv, on the other hand, called the acting of the earlier installments overwrought and melodramatic. The change from full motion video to computer generated characters in End of Ages was well received. Macworld stated that the change was initially jarring, but ultimately helped increase the realism of the game. IGN's Juan Castro said that the characters felt more real than the full motion video actors of previous games; one reason, the reviewer stated, was because the actors spoke their lines with real conviction. Gamezone credited each character's individualized body language as contributing to their realism. GameSpot stated that Esher moved and acted like a real person, and that the voice of David Ogden Stiers brought \\"this interesting character to life\\"; the reviewer did feel that the revelation of Esher and Yeesha's motivations was a letdown, as the character's true motivations were revealed \\"with all the unpleasant abruptness of turning on bright, fluorescent lights in a dark room.\\" Dissenting reviewers such as 1UP.com and G4tv considered the character's monologues \\"hyper emotional\\", although reviewer Karen Chu admitted the characters still presented a compelling morality play.

Looney Tunes cartoon, directed by Arthur Davis, and written by Lloyd Turner and Bill Scott. The cartoon was released on November 20, 1948, and stars Daffy Duck. Mel Blanc performs the voices of Daffy Duck and Slug McSlug, an infamous bank robber. Plot Slug McSlug, a notorious criminal (and anthropomorphic dog), is chased by police after successfully robbing the Last National Bank. He reaches his country hideout, where he is promptly visited by an uninvited Daffy Duck, who is a door-to-door salesman of a variety of items. McSlug slams the door in Daffy's face, but Daffy doggedly persists in his efforts to sell something to McSlug, raising the ire of the wanted criminal. McSlug hammers a fake foot by Daffy, who zaps McSlug with a joy buzzer. Daffy is evicted, but brings McSlug more confusion when he gets back inside via this time, in a helicopter (\\"Just a little device to gain entrance to where one is not exactly welcome.\\"). Daffy saws a hole and uses an elevator to gain entry and tells McSlug that he is not leaving until he sells him something. McSlug asks for brass knuckles and when he gets them, the bank robber prepares to punch Daffy, only to shatter them and hit his fist on an iron (Morse code is heard). McSlug opens fire on Daffy with a machine gun, who conveniently is wearing a sample of his company's bullet-proof vests. \\"Guaranteed to get your money back if it fails to work!\\" says Daffy. When Daffy turns on the gas of McSlug's stove to demonstrate the igniting power of his sample lighter, McSlug literally throws Daffy out and tries the lighter himself, which blows the hideout and McSlug sky-high. The victorious Daffy yells toward the sky: \\"Hey, bub! You need a house to go with this doorknob!!!\\" Availability The Stupor Salesman can be found on the four-disc DVD box set Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5, as well as the similar, two-disc DVD Looney Tunes Spotlight Collection: Volume 5.

The office was created in May 2008 after the country was declared as a republic. The first president of Nepal was Ram Baran Yadav. The current president is Bidhya Devi Bhandari, elected in October 2015. She is the first female Nepali head of state. The president is formally addressed as \\"The Right Honourable\\" (, Sam'mƒÅnanƒ´ya). Origin Under the Interim Constitution adopted in January 2007, all powers of governance were removed from the King of Nepal, and the Nepalese Constituent Assembly elected in the 2008 Constituent Assembly election was to decide in its first meeting whether to continue the monarchy or to declare a republic. During the suspension of the monarchy, Girija Prasad Koirala, then Prime Minister of Nepal, acted as Head of State. On 28 May 2008, the Assembly voted to abolish the monarchy. Ram Baran Yadav won the historic election from the Constituent Assembly, and was sworn in as the nation's first president ending a 247 year old monarchy. Appointment of the president  The appointment process of the president of Nepal as per Part 7 Article 76 of 2015 Constitution of Nepal is as follows: # The president shall appoint the parliamentary party leader of the political party with the majority in the House of Representatives as a prime minister, and a Council of Ministers shall be formed in his/her chairmanship. # If there is not a clear majority of any party according to clause (1), the president shall appoint as Prime Minister the member of the House of Representatives who can have the majority with the support of two or more political parties represented in the House of Representatives. # If there is a situation wherein it is not possible to make the appointment of the prime minister as provided for in clause (2) within 30 days of the final result of the election of the House of Representatives, or if the appointed prime minister, as provided for in clause (4), fails to receive a vote of confidence, the president shall appoint the leader of the party with the highest number of members in the House of Representatives as the prime minister. # The prime minister appointed according to clause (2) or (3) shall have to receive the vote of confidence of the House of Representatives within 30 days of his/her appointment. # If a prime minister appointed according to clause (3) fails to receive a vote of confidence pursuant to clause (4), the president shall appoint a member as Prime Minister, who produces bases that he/she may win the vote of confidence of the House of Representatives as provided for in clause (2). # The prime minister appointed according to clause (5) shall have to get the vote of confidence according to clause (4). # If the prime minister appointed according to clause (5) fails to get the vote of confidence or if any member fails to be appointed as prime minister, the president shall, on the recommendation of Prime Minister, dissolve the House of Representatives and fix a date to conduct another election within six months. # The procedure regarding the appointment of the prime minister shall have to be completed within 55 days after the post of the prime minister falls vacant, or the announcement of the final results of the election of the House of Representatives according to this Constitution. # The president shall, on the recommendation of the prime minister, form a council of ministers consisting of members not exceeding twenty-five in number from among the members of the Federal Parliament on the basis of the principle of inclusion. # The prime minister and the ministers shall be collectively accountable to the Federal Parliament, and, a minister shall be personally accountable to the prime minister for the works of his/her ministry, and also to the Federal Parliament. Election and powers The president is elected by an electoral college comprising the Parliament of Nepal and the members of the provincial legislatures. A law shall determine the weight of each of their votes. Whoever receives a majority of the delegates' votes is elected. If no one receives a majority in the first round , runoffs are held between the top two candidates until one receives a majority. Tenure The presidential term is five years. A president may be elected any number of times, but not more than twice in succession. Powers The president's powers are almost entirely ceremonial. In some parliamentary republics, the president is vested with executive powers on paper, but is bound by convention to act on the advice of the prime minister and the government. In Nepal, however, the president is not even the nominal chief executive, as the Constitution explicitly vests executive power in the Council of Ministers and the prime minister. Section 75 of 2015 Constitution of Nepal vests the executive power of federal government of Nepal on Council of Ministers of Nepal. Per Section 76, the President is the chairman of Council of Ministers of Nepal and thus exercises executive power collectively with the mandate of the council of ministers. Section 75 is as follows: # The executive power of Nepal shall rest with the Council of Ministers in accordance with this Constitution and law. # The responsibility of providing general directives, control and enforcement regarding the governance system of Nepal, by adhering to this constitution and law, shall rest with the Council of Ministers. # The entire works relating to the federal executive of Nepal shall be done in the name of the Government of Nepal. # The decision or Order and related certification of credentials as provided for by clause (3) shall be done according to law. Removal The appointment process of the president of Nepal as per Section 77 (1) of 2015 Constitution of Nepal is as follows: The president shall cease to hold office in the following circumstances: # If he/she tenders written resignation to the president, # If a vote of confidence fails to be approved according to Article (100), or a motion of no confidence is passed, # If he/she ceases to be a member of the House of Representatives, # If he/she dies. Furthermore, the Section 77 (3) states: If the president ceases to hold the office according to clause (1), the same council of ministers shall continue to work until another council of ministers is constituted, provided that, in the case of the death of the president , the senior most minister shall continue to act as president until a new president is appointed.

MacKaye was born in New York City, the son of actor Steele MacKaye and Mary (Medbery) MacKaye, and brother of poet Percy MacKaye, theater professional and suffragist Hazel MacKaye and conservationist Benton MacKaye.Walter Lippmann, \\"All the MacKayes\\", The Internationalist, vol. 3, no. 2 (January, 1911), p. 29. He attended Grammar School No. 40 near Groton, MassachusettsLarry Anderson, Benton MacKaye: Conservationist, Planner, and Creator of the Appalachian Trail, Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002, p. 16. and Packard's Business College in New York, and in 1895 obtained an SB degree from Harvard University. In early 1890 MacKaye worked as a patent lawyer with the Census Bureau in Washington, and in April 1891 he became secretary to Nathaniel Southgate Shaler at the Harvard Geological Department, holding for a number of years various minor appointments in that institution.The Papers of The Mackaye Family in the Dartmouth College Library. He joined the Boston firm Stone & Webster in 1899, where he worked as a research engineer. During the 28 years that he remained affiliated to that company he published several books on ethics, economics and politics, including Americanized Socialism, The Logic of Conduct and, most notably, The Economy of Happiness. The Economy of Happiness In this highly original but now largely forgotten work, MacKaye attempted to rescue the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham from the changes that this doctrine had subsequently undergone as a result of John Stuart Mill's moderating influence. MacKaye conceived human beings‚Äîand sentient beings generally‚Äîas mechanisms of transforming resources into happiness, which he argued was the only intrinsic good. The goal of a society was therefore viewed by MacKaye as the problem of finding that arrangement which would produce the highest output of happiness attainable given the inputs available. As he wrote, ::That which society should seek to attain, the maximum surplus of happiness, may be referred to by different names according to the relation in which we think of it, e.g. the utilitarian end, the end or object of utility, of society or of justice, and so forth. It is in the nature of a perfectly definite magnitude. Quantities of pain or pleasure may be regarded as magnitudes having the same definiteness as tons of pig iron, barrels of sugar, bushels of wheat, yards of cotton, or pounds of wool; and as political economy seeks to ascertain the conditions under which these commodities may be produced with the greatest efficiency--so the economy of happiness seeks to ascertain the conditions under which happiness, regarded as a commodity, may be produced with the greatest efficiency--how the maximum output of happiness may be achieved with the means available. In order to ascertain what these conditions are, we need to proceed as any manufacturer trained to his business would proceed, were he endeavoring to ascertain how he could most economically produce beer, or molasses, or oil, or tacks. He would satisfy himself by the inductive or common sense method what laws and resources of nature and of human nature were available under conditions as he found them, and the means thus available he would, to the best of his ability, adapt to his ends. Our problem is a similar one, and we shall adopt similar means to solve it.The Economy of Happiness, pp. 183-184. MacKaye concluded that the form of social organization most conducive to that goal was a particular type of socialism which he dubbed \\"pantocracy\\". The Dynamic Universe In 1930 MacKaye startled the world after announcing an alternative to Albert Einstein's General theory of relativity. His theory of \\"radiation\\" was first presented at the twenty-ninth annual meeting of the American Philosophical Association held at Columbia University. Contrary to Einstein, MacKaye proposed a dynamic universe, assuming that all space was filled with radiation of super-frequency and super-penetration moving in all directions with the speed of light. As he claimed in the concluding paragraph of his paper, subsequently published in The Journal of Philosophy,'The Theory of Relativity: For What Is It a Disguise?', Vol. 27, No. 5 (Feb. 27, 1930), pp. 126-134. \\"If the radiation theory is sound, [...] it is plain that Einstein has discovered nothing about time, space, motion or acceleration unknown to the Newtonians, or shown that what they have hitherto assumed about those magnitudes is contrary to any fact in nature.\\" The theory was described as \\"magnificent\\" by William Pepperell Montague and appears to have been generally well received by the audience. He later expanded his views in the book, The Dynamic Universe, published in 1931.\\"Prof. J. M. M'Kaye Scientist, Dies, 62,\\" The New York Times, January 23, 1935, books art-books sect., p. 17. MacKaye entered the academic profession only in 1931, when he became a lecturer at Rollins College. The following year he was appointed Professor of Philosophy at Dartmouth College.W. K. Wright, Memorial Notice, The Philosophical Review, Vol. 45, No. 2 (March, 1936), p. 176. At the end of 1934 MacKaye was hospitalized at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where he had a gall bladder surgery. Although the doctors predicted recovery, he died a week later.Anderson, Benton MacKaye, p. 259. A service was held on January 24 at the Memorial Church of Harvard University, where his remains were cremated.\\"Prof. J. M.

Hamilton. Plot summary Summary Blood Noir appears to take place a short time after The Harlequin; however it is not noted exactly how much time has elapsed. There are a few main themes in the novel, which are mostly resolved by the end. * In Jason's hometown, one of his ancestors had more than his fair share of offspring. Hence, Jason's features are repeated in various cousins and other relatives. During high school Jason was always confused with two of his cousins who happen to be twins. Keith Summerland used the confusion to his benefit a few times, tricking people to believe he was Jason or letting Jason get the beating for Keith's deeds. ** As soon as Jean-Claude's private jet lands in North Carolina, Jason is confused for Keith. The local and national media is interested in Keith Summerland because he is getting married and his father, who is currently a governor, is thinking of running for the Presidency. Meanwhile, Jason's father has been given only weeks to live, so time is of the essence. In addition, Jason has rented a hotel room in the same location that Keith is supposed to stay in and where the bridal party is taking place. ** Keith Summerland is in trouble again, he's fallen for a vampire and would rather marry her than the girl his father wants to marry him to. However, the vampire is already married and her husband does not take kindly to Keith trying to take his bride. * In The Harlequin Anita was given a charm that is supposed to keep Marmee Noir away. When Anita meets a tiger that calls to one of the tigers inside her, the charm fails or perhaps the Mother of Darkness overpowers it. Previous books have had Anita give her beast to someone else since she cannot shift with a fair amount of success, however Jason would only be able to help Anita if her inner wolf was giving her trouble. Marmee Noir uses Anita to send out a call to every unattached tiger in the nation. ** Specifically, two tigers in the area come to Anita, and Jason, instantly and are essentially raped by her for two days. One is Crispin from Las Vegas (who broaches the rape issue), a stripper and the other is Alexander Pinn, who is a closeted reporter. Crispin is from a white tiger clan, while Alex is from a red tiger clan. ** Once again, Anita could be pregnant. Jason tells the possible-daddies-to-be tigers that the would-be baby is probably his and they then allow her to get a morning-after pill. Otherwise, either tiger would have happily married and taken Anita back to his clan. Crispin appears to have been rolled by Anita and is rather heartbroken when she sends him away, while Alex had a harder time fighting Anita's call. ** Marmee Noir may be thousands of miles physically from Anita, but she can still reach out and touch the necromancer. When Anita loses consciousness, Marmee Noir wakes her and slashes her shirt open despite being so far away. However, she does not reveal why she is so interested in Anita. It could be that she wants Anita for her own human servant, as other Masters of the City may as well. When the link between Anita and Jean-Claude is broken, they believe that Anita may have been marked by Marmee Noir, but once Anita reclaims her anger from Richard the link is back. Marmee Noir cannot understand Anita's rage because it belongs to Anita and was not passed down from her to any of Marmee Noir's vampire descendants. * The last theme is the desire to be \\"normal\\", which most of the main characters admit to wanting. Normal as in what society says most humans want: find a true love, meet the family, get married, have kids, live happily ever after. Unfortunately for Anita, her life is anything but normal, but she's the only one who appears to accept that. When Jason takes Anita home to meet his family, Jean-Claude and Micah both express the desire to do that as well. ** Jean-Claude is jealous because while he would want Anita to meet his family, they have all died so long ago that no one knows him from when he was human is left. Anita tells him that she has in a sense met his mother, she's in some sense met Belle Morte and he replies that she is not 'his people.' Belle Morte may be the head of Jean-Claude's bloodline but she is not the matriarch of his family. ** Micah broke his ties with his family to keep them safe. When Chimera was alive, he would use family against the members of his pard. With Chimera dead, Micah expresses the desire to introduce Anita to his family. However, Nathaniel is also a part of Anita's and Micah's life which leaves Micah uncertain if all three of them should visit. Nathaniel's role in their life is not so clear and simple nor \\"normal\\" as the roles of 'boyfriend' or 'girlfriend.' ** Richard also wants his life to be normal, he wants Anita to be his wife and to live essentially behind a white picket fence. They have quarreled about this many times in many books. When he finds Anita has gained two more lovers to her list or bed post, Richard is distressed. Once Anita takes away her rage from him, he gains a new talent. The talent is the ardor and unfortunately, there is a learning curve to it and at first he tries to use it against her until Jason calls him on it and then Richard simply leaves Anita alone. ** Jason's desire to be normal shows in trying to appease his father one last time. To try to convince him that Anita is his girlfriend is the least he can do, while he still has time left to say goodbye to his father. A media frenzy of poor timing and rumors will not stop him in visiting his abusive father in the hopes for that one perfect moment of acceptance that he never had when he was growing up. Jason had no desire for athletics and his choice of theater was not what his father wanted for him. In fact, nearly everything Jason has tried to do to please his father has failed. It is not until the end of the book, when Jason is nearly taken away from his family that Franklin Schuyler realizes exactly how much Jason means to him. Characters Major characters Blood Noir features the following major characters. * Anita Blake * Jason Schuyler * Jean-Claude * Richard: When Anita loses her tie to Jean-Claude, Richard comes to North Carolina to try to help. Unfortunately, after seeing that Anita has added to her list of lovers, Richard is not pleased. He releases the anger that he gained from her when Jean-Claude connected them in the triumvirate and Anita realizes she can either fight it or embrace it. By the end of the book, Richard is acting and feeling more like he did when he first met Anita. However, by potentially taking away the anger, Anita may have given him something else in return. * Micah: Micah is away from St. Louis, checking out a new leopard who wants to join his and Anita's pard. Anita calls him to tell him about going with Jason to North Carolina. Micah expresses that he too, would like to bring Anita to his estranged family as well, someday. * Nathaniel: Nathaniel plays a role in the beginning of the book only, for he is the one who offered Anita to Jason for moral support. Other characters Recurring characters include: * Jamil and Shang-Da: These two werewolves go with Richard to visit Anita in North Carolina. * Irving: Jason and Anita enroll Irving's help as a news reporter to try to take back the rumor that Anita left Jean-Claude for Jason. Originally, Irving was thrilled to have an insider's scoop on Jean-Claude and other Anita-related topics, but people were beginning to wonder how he was so close to it all. Therefore, Anita left him out of it, albeit rather abruptly. Non-recurring characters as of late include: * Alex Pinn: a tiger with red stripes, who is a closeted news reporter. * Crispin: a white tiger from Las Vegas. * J. J: an Jason's childhood friend and current girlfriend. Critical reception When debuted, Blood Noir made the #1 spot on the New York Times Best Sellers list.

Life and work Saul Leiter was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His father was a well known Talmud scholar and Saul studied to become a rabbi. His mother gave him his first camera at age 12.Sire, Agn√®s. Saul Leiter, Steidl Publishers, G√∂ttingen, Germany 2008. At age 23, he left theology school and moved to New York City to become an artist. He had developed an early interest in painting and was fortunate to meet the Abstract Expressionist painter Richard Pousette-Dart. Pousette-Dart and W. Eugene Smith encouraged Leiter to pursue photography and he was soon taking black and white pictures with a 35 mm Leica, which he acquired for a few Eugene Smith prints. In 1948, he started taking color photographs. He began associating with other contemporary photographers such as Robert Frank and Diane Arbus and helped form what Jane Livingston has termed the New York School of photographers during the 1940s and 1950s. Leiter worked as a fashion photographer for the next 20 years and was published in Show, Elle, British Vogue, Queen, and Nova. In the late 1950s the art director Henry Wolf published Leiter‚Äôs color fashion work in Esquire and later in Harper‚Äôs Bazaar. Edward Steichen included Leiter‚Äôs black and white photographs in the exhibition Always the Young Stranger at the Museum of Modern Art in 1953. Leiter‚Äôs work is featured prominently in Jane Livingston‚Äôs book The New York School (1992) and in Martin Harrison‚Äôs Appearances: Fashion Photography since 1945 (1991). In 2008, The Henri Cartier-Bresson Foundation in Paris mounted Leiter's first museum exhibition in Europe with an accompanying catalog. Leiter is the subject of a 2012 feature-length documentary In No Great Hurry - 13 Lessons in Life with Saul Leiter, directed and produced by Tomas Leach .

He became a well travelled figure, producing accounts and drawings of his travels, and publishing his account of the Royal cruise he was part of aboard the temporarily commissioned HMS Ophir in 1901. He served on a number of ships during the First World War, and later took up a number of occupations. Family and early life Price was born in Birmingham in 1877, the son of parents who had moved from Wales. His father was a master builder in the city.The Royal Tour 1901, notes by Jack Price, pp. i‚Äìii His family produced a minor poet, and a member of the Royal Academy. Price and his family were also keen anglers and became expert coarse fishers, being dubbed the 'champion fishing family of Birmingham'. Price's artistic ability became pronounced and eventually noted. He was sent to the Birmingham School of Art, progressing rapidly through the school until he was told that his natural talent was such that they could not teach him anything. Dissatisfied with life in Birmingham, which he termed 'the land of bricks and mortar', he left home in 1893 and joined the Royal Navy. He only returned to Birmingham to attend his mother's funeral. Royal Navy life Price joined the navy's training establishment HMS Britannia, based at Devonport. He was a keen walker, taking with him his fishing rod and paints. During this time he discovered the village of Drewsteignton, and became so enamoured that he decided to settle there after his retirement from the navy. He was a keen patriot, but had joined the navy with the intention of 'seeing the world', and often rebelled against instances of harsh naval discipline. He briefly led a minor mutiny, but after it began to take on 'ugly proportions', he put an end to it. The naval authorities decided to pardon him. He was a skilled recruit however and rapidly rose through the ranks during his time at Britannia. This good record led to his selection as part of the crew for the planned royal cruise of George, Duke of Cornwall and York, later King George V, and Mary, Duchess of Cornwall and York. The couple were to sail to Australia to open the Parliament.New York Times report, 9 Jun 1901 On the way they were to call at numerous ports of the British Empire, and return to Britain by way of Canada. It was the most ambitious royal tour undertaken to that date. Price, by now a Petty Officer was with the tour from February to November 1901, and made a careful record, later published posthumously in 1980 as The Royal Tour 1901, or the Cruise of H.M.S. Ophir; Being a Lower Deck Account of their Royal Highnesses, The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York's Voyage Around the British Empire. The book was illustrated with Price's own sketches and paintings, which recorded aspects of life on board ship during the cruise, as well as the reception at the various ports of call, details of colonial life and the interactions of warships of many different nationalities encountered on the voyage. The voyage covered over 45,000 miles, but with the exception of Port Said, the ports called at were all part of the British Empire. Price remained in the Navy until 1907, when he became part of the Royal Naval Reserve. He was mobilised on 2 August 1914 with the outbreak of the First World War. He eventually served on five different ships, three of which, including the battleships HMS Ocean and , were sunk in the space of nine months. He spent 14 hours in the water after the sinking of Ocean before he was picked up by a destroyer. He was an excellent swimmer though, and having been born with a caul, he declared 'I could never drown.' He survived the war, receiving the Distinguished Service Medal, and was demobilised in March 1919. Later life Price settled in Drewsteignton and became a talented naturalist, eventually developing a substantial collection of birds' eggs and butterflies. He became a freelance collector for Watkins and Doncaster, of The Strand. Through this he came to be associated with Richard Kearton, who together with his brother Cherry Kearton, were pioneers in the development of bird photography. Price too then took up bird photography. He resumed his fishing, writing a number of books on the subject, including one on carp fishing. He was also an expert gardener, and on occasion sent produce to be exhibited at the Royal Horticultural Society's shows. He also grew tobacco, for he was a moderately heavy pipe smoker, curing it using a method he had developed from observing the tobacco industries at Havana and Rhodesia. He remained an active painter, and also modelled ships, including a fully rigged model of HMS Impregnable. He had made a model ship during his time in the navy, which he used to smuggle tobacco out of the dockyard. He took up wood carving when over 70 years old. He was left disabled following a stroke at the age of 83, and died in hospital in June 1965 at the age of 88. One of his mechanical models of Uncle Tom Cobley and the Grey MareWhen is kept on display at Widecombe St Pancras Church.Inspired by the Devon folk song Widecombe Fair.

The novel was adapted for film by Sydney Boehm and directed by Henry Hathaway. Plot Patrick Martin (Joseph Cotten), known as P.M., is a wealthy attorney and rancher in the border town of Nogales, Arizona. He returns home to find his brother Donald (Van Johnson) hiding in his garage. A former drunkard, Donald had been sent to the penitentiary five years previously for killing a man in a barroom brawl. It was in self-defense but P.M. hadn't defended his brother and he was convicted. Donald has escaped and wants his brother to help him across the Santa Cruz River into the Mexico-side Nogales, where his wife (Shawn Smith) and children (Kim Charney and Sandy Descher) are in dire straits. The straits get even more dire when P.M. tells him the river is flooded and it will be days before anyone can cross. P.M. is all atwitter because his wife Nora (Ruth Roman), whom he married after Donald had gone to prison, doesn't know about his jail-bird brother. He introduces Donald to Nora and the rest of his Cadillac Cowboy and ranch society friends as an old friend, Eric Bell, and is kept busy trying to make sure Donald doesn't find anything harder than ginger ale to drink. Donald gets a telephone call telling him that his family has gone from dire straits to destitution, and when P.M. refuses to help through his contacts in the Mexico side of Nogales, Donald knocks him down, grabs a couple of bottles of whiskey and dashes out of the house into the rain. Nora eventually discovers Donald's true identity and persuades P.M. to help Donald's family. But after a report that Donald has committed a theft, Hal Breckinridge (Jack Carson) forms a posse to bring Donald back. P.M. is reluctant to aid a felon, but eventually shows Donald a place in the river to cross safely into Mexico, but falls off his horse and then nearly drowns.

It has been considered a nomen dubium in a 2016 review. History of discovery Restoration of P. interruptus The type species, P. interruptus is known from an isolated tooth from the Late Cretaceous Chalk Group of southern England. Owen described a second nominal species of the genus, P. continuus, from an isolated tooth collected in the Hythe Formation of Maidstone, Kent. (The macronarian sauropod Dinodocus was mistakenly thought to be conspecific with P. continuus before it was correctly recognized as a dinosaur and not a plesiosaur.) Numerous pliosaurid teeth and vertebrae from England and eastern France have been previously assigned to Polyptychodon, including isolated vertebrae from France which were misidentified as a sauropod.Buffetaut E, Collet√© C, Dubus B, Petit J-L. 2005.

However, a 2016 re-evaluation found Polyptychodon and its types species to be dubious, and that numerous remains from the Chalk Group in England that had been referred to the genus most likely represent different species of plesiosaurs, with some teeth possibly being referable to Polycotylidae.Madzia D.

It is located on the north shore of the Ottawa River across from Horton Township in Ontario. Its settlements include Clarendon, North Clarendon, Charteris, Lawn, Murrell, Radford, Sand Bay, Starks Corners, and Yarm. The town of Shawville is surrounded by, but not part of, Clarendon. Largely cleared of forests, Clarendon is a predominantly agricultural municipality, with an elevation of above sea level. The only notable lake is Green Lake, which is surrounded by cottages. History The township was first surveyed in 1792 and appears on the Gale and Duberger map of 1795. Settlement did not occur until 1825 when James Prendergast, a retired British Army Officer, was commissioned by the government to lead this task. From that year until 1827, free land was granted, resulting in a wave of settlers, starting with 15 settlers near the township's centre (now Shawville). But Prendergast, originally from religiously-divided Ireland, stipulated that settlers only be Protestants in order to avoid similar religious strife. As a result, Clarendon (and Shawville) is known as the heartland of Anglo-Saxon Protestantism in western Quebec. Between 1827 and 1835, Prendergast was responsible for establishing the first four schools and bringing in its teachers. He also built a water-driven sawmill and grist mill at his home along the Ottawa River. In 1833, the Township of Clarendon was officially established. It was named after Clarendon Park, near Salisbury in Wiltshire, England (where Henry II had convened peers and bishops to formulate the Constitutions of Clarendon in 1164). In 1837, the post office opened. From then on and into the 1840s, when the timber industry started to prosper, a second wave of settlement occurred, doubling the population of Clarendon between 1840 and 1850. In 1855, the Township Municipality of Clarendon was created. This style was reformed to Municipality of Clarendon on October 11, 2003.

The relationship between Turkey and Britain shifted dramatically as Germany made a better bargain and in 1914 the Porte (Ottoman government) joined in World War I against Britain. The change was apparent when two recently purchased ships of its navy, still manned by their German crews and commanded by their German admiral, carried out the Black Sea Raid, a surprise attack against Russian ports, on 29 October 1914. Russia replied by declaring war on 1 November 1914 and Russia's allies, Britain and France, then declared war on the Ottoman Empire on 5 November 1914.

The Ottoman Empire, of which Palestine was a part, broke up shortly after the First World War and was officially dissolved in 1923 by the Treaty of Lausanne. In the early years of the First World War, there were several important Ottoman victories against the British Empire, such as the Gallipoli Campaign and the Siege of Kut. Palestine was previously a part of the Ottoman Empire. Britain had declared its intention to support the creation of a Jewish homeland in the Balfour Declaration, 1917. The British had, in the Hussein- McMahon Correspondence, previously been in discussions with the Hashemite family concerning the concept of an independent Arab state. These discussions remained inconclusive and vague but contained the implied support from Britain of an independent Arab state in exchange for a successful Arab Revolt during World War I. The British, under General Allenby during the Arab Revolt under the guidance of British intelligence officers, the most famous being T. E. Lawrence, contributed to the defeat of the Ottoman forces in 1917 in which British and French forces occupied the Sinai and the majority of Greater Syria. The land was administered by the British for the remainder of the war. The Battle of Baku, also known as the Liberation of Baku, was a World War I battle that took place between August and September 1918 between the Ottoman- Azerbaijani coalition forces led by Nuri Pasha and the later Soviet forces between Bolshevik and Dashnak Baku, which the British later succeeded ‚ÄìArmenian-Belarusian forces, led by Lionel Dunsterville, saw briefly how Soviet Russia was entering the war again. The battle was waged as a final part of the Caucasus campaign, but as the beginning of the Armenian-Azerbaijani war. On 14 September, the Ottoman forces captured Baku with their coalition forces. The occupation of Constantinople and ƒ∞zmir led to the establishment of a Turkish national movement, which won the Turkish War of Independence (1919‚Äì23) under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal (later given the surname \\"Atat√ºrk\\"). The sultanate was abolished on 1 November 1922, and the last sultan, Mehmed VI (reigned 1918‚Äì22), left the country on 17 November 1922. The Republic of Turkey was established in its place on October 29, 1923 in the new capital city of Ankara. The caliphate was abolished on 3 March 1924.

Potential tensions such as the status of Mosul province and militarisation and access to the Dardanelles and Bosporus, were resolved.Daniel-Joseph. MacArthur-Seal, \\"Turkey and Britain: from enemies to allies, 1914‚Äì1939.\\" Middle Eastern Studies (2018) 54#4: 737-743. Cyprus dispute The Ottoman Empire leased the island of Cyprus to the United Kingdom in 1878. The UK formally annexed Cyprus as a British colony in 1914 at the outset of the Great War. Britain maintained two sovereign military base areas on the island of Cyprus after the country's independence in 1960. In a response to a coup d'√©tat orchestrated by the military junta of Greece to unite the island with mainland Greece, Turkey invaded the island in June 1974. As a result, more than a quarter of the population of Cyprus were expelled from the occupied northern part of the island, where Greek Cypriots constituted 80% of the population. A little over a year later in 1975, there was also a flow of roughly 60,000 Turkish Cypriots from the south to the north after the conflict. The Turkish invasion ended in the partition of Cyprus along the UN-monitored Green Line which still divides Cyprus. In 1983 the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) declared independence, although Turkey is the only country which recognises it.Salin, Ibrahm . ‚ÄúCyprus: Ethnic Political Components.‚Äù Oxford: University Press of America. 2004, p.29 The UK is a signatory to the Treaty of Guarantee, together with Greece and Turkey concerning the independence and status of Cyprus. Trade The United Kingdom is the second biggest importer of goods from Turkey, after Germany. Turkey exports around 8% of its total goods to the United Kingdom. Annually, around 2.5 million Britons take holidays in Turkey, while 100,000 Turks travel to the UK for business or pleasure. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan and British Prime Minister David Cameron in Antalya, Turkey, 2015 EU membership The United Kingdom has been the strongest supporter for the Accession of Turkey to the European Union. The EU and Turkey are linked by a Customs Union agreement, which came in force on 31 December 1995. Turkey has been a candidate country to join the European Union since 1999. In 2010, the BBC reported Prime Minister Cameron's 'anger' at slow pace of Turkish EU negotiations. Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has historically been a passionate supporter of Turkey's EU aspirations. However, as a supporter of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, he is arguing for Turkey - as the UK - to be outside the EU. As the sixth and seventeenth largest global economies (by GDP) respectively, the UK and Turkey are also the second and seventh largest European economies. Military During Theresa May's visit to Turkey in January 2017, BAE and TAI officials signed an agreement, worth about ¬£100 million, for BAE to provide assistance in developing the TAI TFX aircraft.

At the time of the 2011 Nepal census it had a population of 32,486 people living in 8,639 individual households. The town is located at an altitude of 1554 metres (5101 feet).Charikot, Nepal Page The name of the district Dolakha came from Dolakha Town situated north-east of the headquarters Charikot Bazaar. Boundaries The region is bordered by the Sun Kosi River on the west and the Khimti Khola River on the east. It is divided unequally by the River Tama Koshi, proportionately two-thirds to the west of the river and one-third to the east. To the north east lies the impressive Rolwaling Himal to the western edge of which are such peaks as Gauri Shankar and Melungtse. Gauri Shankar is synonymous with the god Shiva and his consort Parvati. Places around Dolakha District and Bhimeshwar Municipality Dolakha Bhimeshwar This is the one of the oldest temple of Dolakha, this temple is situated at toward the east of Charikot Bazaar which is 4.5 kilometers. Thousands of pilgrims come to this temple every year. According to the Hindu mythology Bhimsen is one of the brothers of Pandava, during their 12 years exile they spent a year in Dolakha and they used to speak a language for that year called Dolakhali Newari language. Newari people regarded the Bhimeswar as a supreme god. Bhimeshwor Kotihom A very religious and historic place situated at the northern-east side of the main town. Approximately 25 mins of walk from the bus stop of Charikot. A Priest from Kalinchok, another religious place in far Northern Himalayan region of the Charikot, initiated the work to establish this holy shrine. The late King Birendra Bikram Shah Birendra of Nepal and late Queen Aishwarya Rajya Laxmi Devi Shah Aishwarya of Nepal were invited for the inauguration of this shrine. In Nepal, Kings and Queens were regarded as reincarnation of the Protector of all living beings, Vishnu, so it was a huge ceremony for the people of Charikot on that auspicious occasion of their visit and inauguration. Every 12 years, people of Charikot and around visit the place to celebrate \\"Holm\\", a religious mass act without any scarification of living creature for peace of the Nation and the World. Pashupati A temple situated at the top of a hill near Purano Bazaar. People like to go there for worship every morning. It is similar to the Pashupati temple of Kathmandu in a sense it also has Shiva Linga. The temple is surrounded by walls and within its perimeters is Lali Guras Youth Club. Gumba It is a monastery at the top of the other corner of this beautiful town in south. A wide road enough for a bus takes from Satdobato through the residential area. It is in wide and open field and has scenic view of almost all the area of Dolakha District-Mahangkal, Mude, Kalinchok, Charikot, Dolakha, Gaurishankar Himalayan Range, Tamakoshi. It is a truly breathtaking spot for scenic sips. Mahangkal When you have sorrows and hurdles, they say, go and pray in this holy place. Females are prohibited to enter into the main temple for unknown reasons. It lies near the bank of Charnawoti river which nearby joins the Tamakoshi. You can walk or you can take ride with local bus or bike. A half-hour tour is available.

The river flows past Kodari and Tatopani (Hot Springs) on the Nepalese side and gradually rushes down into an ever-widening stream of water that becomes the Sun Kosi.The Gaurishankar Himalaya The Khimti Khola drains down from a region of five lakes called Panch Pokhari. They have a specific place in legend and go by the names of Mohi (buttermilk), Jata (hair), Dudh (milk), Bahula (insane), and Bhut (ghost). People believe that if one bathes in Bahula Pokhari one will become insane, whereas the Ghost Lake cannot bear the smell of human perspiration and will pull one inside its murky waters to a certain death if you as much as venture near it. The Khimti Khola joins the Tama Koshi, as do the Khare Khola and Rolwaling Khola to the northeast and the Sangawati, Dolti and Charnewati Kholas to the west. The riverine valleys open out into massive volcanic folds. Sub-tropical settlements on the banks of rivers boast banana trees, guava, and an abundance of fish. Above the banks hover the terraced fields of paddy, make, wheat, and millet. Between Bhimeshwar and Jiri the road descends to 845 metres and is bordered by plantations of sugar-cane. Above these slopes are forests of dark oak, fir and pine, interspersed with tangles of bracken and fem all in the embrace of clinging orchids and coloured in the springtime by the rhododendrons, the national flower of Nepal. Mosses cling to the shaded rocks and in the forests are wild strawberries, loganberries, red berries and thyme. Destination Dolakha is approximately 139 km from the Capital of Nepal, Kathmandu.

Traditional Newari Dolakhali House Brahmins-Indo-Aryan; Referred to twice- born. They have been the dominant priestly cast of Nepal since Prithvi Narayan Shah of Gorkha unified the states of Nepal into a single Kingdom. Jirel- Tibeto-Mongoloid; It is believed that they may be descendants of original inhabitants of Tibet and Tibetan tribes with whom they inter-married. Broadly speaking, Jirels have retained a Buddhist tradition. However, they employ Hindu Brahmins for many rituals. This behavior may date back to the Rana rule, a Hindu dynasty. They live in Jiri and the village nearby. They believe they originated as a result of trade between this region and the adjoining regions in Tibet. At death ceremonies, a Buddhist tradition prevails. However, for many domestic ceremonies they call a Brahmin priest and adhere to the brahmanical tradition. This strange mixture can be explained by their mixed ethnic origins and that sometimes amongst certain of the middle-hill peoples there is no hard, dividing line.

In common with several of his other early novels, the chapter headings have a \\"feature\\". In Spy Story these take the form of excerpts from the fictional Studies Centre's rules. Protagonist As in the earlier \\"Unnamed hero\\" novels, we never learn the protagonist's name, only that he is living under an alias \\"Pat Armstrong\\". Armstrong works for the Studies Centre in London, where wargames are played with computer assistance, using the latest intelligence data on Soviet electronic warfare capabilities. We learn in passing that Armstrong is in his late 30s and that he formerly worked for an unnamed intelligence organisation, which may well be the WOOC (P) of the earlier books ‚Äì Dawlish, the head of WOOC (P) in the earlier novels, appears as a character, where it is revealed that he was Armstrong's superior.he turned for a better view of me,\\"... late thirties, spectacles, clean shaven, dark hair, about six-foot ...\\" An additional character from earlier novels is Soviet KGB Colonel Oleg Stok. Plot The story opens with Armstrong and his colleague Ferdy Foxwell returning from a six-week mission aboard a nuclear submarine, gathering data on Soviet communications and electronic warfare techniques in the Arctic Ocean. He and Foxwell visit \\"The Bonnet\\", a rural Scottish public house. On returning to London, Armstrong's car breaks down on his way home and he decides to use the phone in his old flat, for which he still has the key. He is surprised and disturbed to discover that the flat has been refurnished, including photographs which he owns but with someone else replacing him in the images, wearing identical clothes. He discovers a door hidden in the back of the wardrobe leading into the adjoining flat, which has been fitted out as some kind of sick bay. When he leaves the flat thinking that a taxi he ordered has arrived, he is confronted by Special Branch officers who have a former member of the Studies Centre verify who he is before releasing him. While they were away, the Studies Centre acquired a new boss, the abrasive American, Charles Schlegel, a former Marine Corps Colonel. Foxwell and Schlegel do not get on at all well and even less so when Schlegel makes Armstrong his Personal Assistant. Shortly after his return, Armstrong is about to leave his flat when it is ransacked by KGB Colonel Oleg Stok and two assistants, who even blow open a safe left by the previous occupant. They offer no explanation for this, leaving Armstrong yet more puzzled. At a party at Ferdy Foxwell's palatial London house, Armstrong learns that Foxwell is close to MP Ben Toliver and has even been passing him classified information. Also at the party is Dawlish, the head of the intelligence organisation WOOC (P) of earlier books. We learn that Armstrong worked for Dawlish before deciding to quit intelligence work. Dawlish tries to recruit him but Armstrong turns him down. Toliver has a suspicious car accident returning home from Foxwell's party. Armstrong traces the woman who was reported to be with him to a small French restaurant, where he discovers photos of a Soviet Rear-Admiral and a Soviet Rear-Admiral's uniform being made. He returns to the restaurant later to discover it deserted. Breaking in, he discovers all traces of what he had earlier seen have been removed, along with all paperwork. Armstrong uses the Studies Centre library to find the name of the Soviet Rear-Admiral: Remoziva, whose equally high-achieving sister is leading a Soviet delegation negotiating the re- unification of East and West Germany. Leaving the restaurant, he is met by a high-ranking police officer who escorts him to Battersea, from where a helicopter takes him to Heathrow Airport, from whence he is flown north in a small single-engine aircraft. It takes him to a remote location in the West of Scotland, where he finds Toliver and his co-conspirators. It appears that they have been running their own unauthorised intelligence operation to arrange the defection of Admiral Remoziva, who will die within a year if he does not receive treatment for a kidney condition. The plan is to meet the Admiral on the Arctic ice and leave a corpse in his place. They had planned to keep him at Armstrong's former flat, and use the adjoining medical bay to treat him. Armstrong receives a message from an unidentified member of the clique advising him to leave, which he does. After a nightmare journey through a snow storm, he reaches a road, where he finds Dawlish and Schlegel waiting. They tell him that the defection is still on, though using a USN submarine instead of a British one. Out on the Arctic ice, they rendezvous with Remoziva's helicopter but it turns out to contain Colonel Stok. After a brief struggle the helicopter takes off with one of Stok's men holding on to Foxwell. Armstrong grabs Foxwell's legs and is also hauled aloft. He fires at the man holding Foxwell and they both fall to the ice. He manages to lift Foxwell and staggers off to where their submarine has surfaced but by the time he reaches it Foxwell is dead. At the end of the book it is revealed that the scheme was to discredit Remoziva and by association, his siblings; his sister is forced to step down from the German Re-unification negotiations, causing the talks to collapse. The Studies Centre Len Deighton's fascination with military history and computers are combined in Ferdy Foxwell's Studies Centre. The Centre possesses a mainframe computer, which is used in contract to the Ministry of Defence and its officers for studying likely military scenarios for the Cold War becoming a Hot War. Ferdy is an expert games player, and usually defeats the officers sent to play against him. A noteworthy win involves simulating the ability of Soviet amphibians to land on ice on the Bering Strait in winter, which extends their range and allows them to act as a deterrent to warships, which US Navy officers did not expect. Ferdy and his programmers are also somewhat playful, inserting whimsical error codes into the computer's software (which is programmed in FORTRAN)Deighton, Spy Story, p.49. An example given is \\"I'm only a bloody machine but I know how to print a label once only\\" for a program halt.Deighton, Spy Story, p.49 The Studies Centre does not only run military strategy simulations; it also produces simulations of historical battles, for the education of military professionals. One simulation discussed is a re-run of the Battle of Britain exploring what might have happened if the Germans had fitted drop tanks to Luftwaffe Bf 109 E-4 fighters. \\"During the battle the Germans had long-range drop tanks for the single-seat fighters, but did not use them. Once you programme double fuel loads for the fighters, there are many permutations for the bombing attacks.\\"Deighton, Spy Story, p.45 Ferdy's interest in producing defeats and his success in historical and real situations produces much suspicion from his colleagues and from the Ministry, after only a few years. Patrick Armstrong and the Colonel have been called in by the Minister to investigate possible breaches in security, as Ferdy's passionate activity could be the work of the KGB to break military morale, as well as learning tactical secrets useful in a possible war with the Soviets. Reception The book was a best-seller in Great Britain, reaching number 2 on The Bookseller best-seller list. The Jonathan Cape hardcover sold 40,000 copies. Critics generally praised the book, though several complained about the wafer-thin characterisations and the convoluted plot. The Times Literary Supplement deemed it \\"a vintage Len Deighton thriller\\" but complained that Deighton had made \\"no real advance on his books of ten years ago. Mr. Deighton has, after all, written himself into the position of being judged by rather high standards.\\" The TLS critic praised Deighton's \\"impeccable handling of the widely different locations\\", but complained that \\"the story [and] the characters are empty (though not by the standards of the genre).\\" Despite this, the TLS critic believed \\"there is an overall impression of richness. We have been to these, or similar, locations before on spying trips: an isolated castle in Scotland, a nuclear submarine under the northern ice-pack, a party of brittle richesse in Camden. The action and the high life are familiar enough, but the skill with which each is drawn and integrated is beguiling. Too laconic for an old-fashioned cliffhanger, Mr Deighton yet produces a sort of dispassionate cerebral excitement which, like the polar ice itself, is nine-tenths submerged and all the more menacing for that.\\" Roderick MacLeish, in The Washington Post Book World remarked that Deighton is fun, and unlike John le Carr√©, Deighton recognises the amoral darkness of intelligence, politics and the spiritual rot that infects anyone who gets involved \\"is relegated to the status of cushioning for good, exciting stories.\\" MacLeish says Spy Story is almost as much fun as \\"the superb yarn\\" Funeral in Berlin. MacLeish praised Deighton's sense of place: \\"the atmospherics ring forever true. Deighton seems to know the places he writes about‚Äîthe bone-buckling cold and interminable rain of the Highlands will be familiar to anyone who has ever tramped across those wastes of appalling beauty. The hushed, lifeless world of ice, emptiness and stars that look as if they would break from the sky while submarines, with the power to incinerate the world, play tag miles below, is redolent of the desolation which, said Tacitus, the conquerors of his time called peace.\\" MacLeish said that the polar ice-cap climax is \\"one of the most hair-raising passages ever written about sea warfare.\\" However, writing about the protagonist Patrick Armstrong, MacLeish writes, \\"He needs a bath and loses his mistress in the end because of the things he's done in the beginning and the middle. Deighton is better at plots and settings than he is at people. But the plots are marvelous and the settings alone are worth the price of admission.\\" Gene Lyons, writing in The New York Times Book Review noted that Deighton's success as a writer of spy thrillers \\"has always rested on his recognition of the humorous possibilities of the form.\\" Lyons calls the book a \\"superior entertainment\\" and remarks that \\"Deighton seeks a literate audience\\" but that protagonist Patrick Armstrong \\"display[s] only the vestigial personal memory needed to flesh him out, so that he may neither learn significantly from previous adventures, nor (God forbid) intellectualize overmuch.\\" However Pearl K. Bell writing in The New Leader called the book \\"an impenetrable lemon\\". \\"The artful fuzziness so completely overwhelmed the plot that the book was unreadable, all murk and no menace.\\" Bell said that \\"evasive indirection has been Deighton's trademark since his first spy novel, The Ipcress File, appeared in 1963. At the time, his obsessive reliance on the blurred and intangible, on loaded pauses and mysteriously disjointed dialogue, did convey the shadowy meanness of the spy's world, with its elusive loyalties, camouflaged identities and weary brutality. But Deighton's later efforts have bloated these cryptic and inscrutable mannerisms into a dense fog of unknowing.\\" Film A film adaptation starring Michael Petrovitch as Pat Armstrong was released in 1976, directed by Lindsay Shonteff.

Symptoms include erythema, edema, blisters (vesicles and/or bullae), and delayed hyperpigmentation. Heat and moisture tend to exacerbate the reaction. A reaction may be elicited in any person who has been exposed to adequate amounts of both a photosensitizing agent and ultraviolet light. Phytophotodermatitis is not an immunologic response; no prior exposure to the photosensitizing agent is required. The photosensitizing substances found in phototoxic plants belong to a class of chemical compounds called the furanocoumarins, which are activated by long- wavelength ultraviolet (UVA) light. The most toxic of these organic compounds are the linear furanocoumarins, so called since they exhibit a linear chemical structure. Bergapten and xanthotoxin (also known as methoxsalen), two linear furanocoumarins derived from psoralen, are invariably found in plants associated with phytophotodermatitis. Symptoms A severe case of phytophotodermatitis A reaction typically begins within 24 hours of exposure and peaks at 48-72 hours after exposure. Initially, the skin turns red and starts to itch and burn. Large blisters (or bullae) form within 48 hours. The blisters may leave black, brown, or purplish scars that can last for several years. This hyperpigmentation of the skin is caused by the production of melanin triggered by the furanocoumarins. Although media reports have suggested that eye exposure to the agent can lead to temporary or permanent blindness, the risk of permanent blindness is not supported by existing research. Phytophotodermatitis can affect people of any age. In children, it has been mistaken for child abuse. Phototoxic species Plants associated with phytophotodermatitis mainly come from four plant families: the carrot family (Apiaceae), the citrus family (Rutaceae), the mulberry family (Moraceae), and the legume family (Fabaceae). Apiaceae The carrot family Apiaceae (or Umbelliferae) is the main family of plants associated with phytophotodermatitis. Of all the plant species that have been reported to induce phytophotodermatitis, approximately half belong to the family Apiaceae. False Bishop's weed (Ammi majus), the world's major source of the linear furanocoumarin xanthotoxin, has been used since antiquity to treat vitiligo but accidental or inappropriate use of this plant can lead to phytophotodermatitis. Despite this danger, A. majus continues to be cultivated for its furanocoumarins, which are still used for the treatment of skin disease. Numerous species in the family Apiaceae are cultivated as food products, some of which exhibit phototoxic effects. In particular, celery, parsnip, and parsley have been reported to cause phytophotodermatitis among agricultural workers, grocery workers, and other occupational food handlers. Cited in McGovern and Barkley 2000, section Phytophotodermatitis. Cited in McGovern and Barkley 2000, section Phytophotodermatitis. A number of phototoxic plant species in the carrot family have become invasive species, including wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) and the tall hogweeds of the genus Heracleum, namely, Persian hogweed (Heracleum persicum), Sosnowsky's hogweed (Heracleum sosnowskyi), and giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum). In particular, the public health risks of giant hogweed are well known. Other plant species in the family Apiaceae that are associated with phytophotodermatitis include the blister bush (Notobubon galbanum), cow parsley (Anthriscus sylvestris), wild carrot (Daucus carota), various species of the genus Angelica (e.g., Korean angelica Angelica gigas), and most (if not all) species of the genus Heracleum (esp. the tall invasive hogweeds and the cow parsnips, Heracleum sphondylium and Heracleum maximum). Rutaceae The citrus family Rutaceae is the second most widely distributed family of plants associated with phytophotodermatitis. Effect of the common rue on skin Numerous citrus fruits in the family Rutaceae exhibit phototoxic effects. Of these, perhaps the best known is lime. Phytophotodermatitis associated with limes is sometimes colloquially referred to as \\"lime disease,\\" not to be confused with Lyme disease. In the family Rutaceae, the most severe reactions are caused by the essential oil of the bergamot orange (Citrus bergamia). Cited in CIR 2013. Bergamot essential oil has a higher concentration of bergapten (3000‚Äì3600 mg/kg) than any other citrus-based essential oil, even lime oil, which contains 1700‚Äì3300 mg/kg of bergapten. Other plant species in the family Rutaceae that are associated with phytophotodermatitis include the burning bush (Dictamnus albus), the common rue (Ruta graveolens), and other plants in the genus Ruta. Moraceae The mulberry family Moraceae is often associated with phytophotodermatitis. Multiple species in the genus Ficus are known to exhibit phototoxic effects. Of these, the common fig (Ficus carica) is well known and thoroughly documented. Like Ammi majus in the family Apiaceae, the common fig has been used since antiquity to treat vitiligo but the milky sap of fig leaves can cause phytophotodermatitis if used accidentally or inappropriately. A literature search revealed 19 cases of fig leaf-induced phytophotodermatitis reported between 1984 and 2012. In Brazil, several hospitals reported more than 50 cases of fig leaf-induced burn in one summer. In most cases, patients reportedly used the leaves of the fig plant for folk remedies, tanning, or gardening. Other plant species in the family Moraceae that are associated with phytophotodermatitis include Ficus pumila Cited in Mitchell and Rook 1979. and Brosimum gaudichaudii. Like Ficus carica, the South American species Brosimum gaudichaudii has been shown to contain both psoralen and bergapten.  Prevention  The first and best line of defense against phytophotodermatitis is to avoid contact with phototoxic substances in the first place: * Avoid contact with the plant family Apiaceae, citrus fruits, and other biological agents known to have phototoxic effects. Do not incinerate phototoxic plants and agents since this will serve to disperse the phototoxic substances more widely. * In outdoor situations where contact with phototoxic plants is likely, wear long pants and a long-sleeve shirt. Wear gloves and protective eyewear before handling such plants. * If protective clothing is not available, apply sunscreen to exposed areas. This will provide some measure of protection if contact is made. * After an outdoor activity, take a shower or a bath as soon as possible. Wash your clothing and then wash your hands after handling the dirty clothes. A second line of defense is to avoid sunlight, so as not to activate a phototoxic substance: * If you come in contact with a phototoxic substance, immediately wash the affected area with soap and cold water, and avoid any further exposure to sunlight for at least 48 hours. Heat and moisture can worsen the skin reaction, which is why it‚Äôs important to wash the affected area with soap and cold water. * Stay indoors, if possible. Be sure to avoid light shining through windows. * If staying indoors is not an option, cover the affected area with sun protective clothing. * In lieu of sun-protective clothing, apply sunscreen to the affected areas after washing. Phytophotodermatitis is triggered by long wavelength ultraviolet light (called UVA) in the range of 320‚Äì380 nanometers, so the best sun-protective clothing and sunscreen products will block these wavelengths of UVA radiation. In 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established a \\"broad spectrum\\" test for determining a sunscreen product's UVA protection. Sunscreen products that pass the test are allowed to be labeled as \\"Broad Spectrum\\" sunscreens, which protect against both UVA and UVB rays. There is no equivalent test or FDA-approved labeling for sun-protective clothing. Some clothing is labeled with an Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) but test results from Consumer Reports suggest that UPF is an unreliable indicator of UV protection.  Treatment  Many different topical and oral medications may be used to treat the inflammatory reaction of phytophotodermatitis. A dermatologist may also prescribe a bleaching cream to help treat the hyperpigmentation and return the skin pigmentation back to normal. If the patient does not receive treatment, the affected sites may develop permanent hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. History The photosensitizing effects of plants have been known since antiquity. In Egypt around 2000 B.C., the juice of Ammi majus \\"was rubbed on patches of vitiligo after which patients were encouraged to lie in the sun.\\" In A.D. 50, the Greek physician Dioscorides observed that pigment would return to patches of vitiligo if \\"cataplasmed with ye leaves or ye boughes of ye Black Figge,\\" Cited in McGovern and Barkley 2000, section Phytophotodermatitis. an apparent reference to Ficus carica, the common fig. These ancient practices acknowledged the hyperpigmentation effects now known to accompany phytophotodermatitis. One of the earliest reports of plant-based dermatitis was given by Chaumton in 1815, who noted that the outer rind and root of cow parsnip (a common name for any Heracleum species of plant) contained an acrid sap sufficiently strong to inflame and ulcerate the skin.Chaumton, FP (1815). Flore Med Paris. 2: 32. Cited by Mitchell and Rook (1979), p. 692. Similarly in 1887 Sornevin reported that Heracleum sphondylium caused dermatitis. However, neither of these early reports recognized the crucial role of ultraviolet radiation. \\"Berloque dermatitis\\" (from the French word \\"berloque\\" meaning trinket or charm) is a term coined by Rosenthal in 1925 to describe the pendant-like streaks of pigmentation observed on the neck, face, and arms of patients. Cited in Alikhan 2016. He was unaware that, in 1916, Freund had correctly observed that these pigmentation effects were due to sun exposure after the use of Eau de Cologne, a perfume infused with bergamot oil. Cited in McGovern and Barkley 2000, section Phytophotodermatitis. It is now known that bergamot oil contains a significant amount of bergapten, a linear furanocoumarin that gets its name from the bergamot orange. In 1937, dermatitis from Heracleum mantegazzianum was reported by Miescher and Burckhardt who suspected the possibility of light sensitization. Cited by Mitchell and Rook (1979), p. 696. A few years later, Kuske confirmed this hypothesis. Cited by Mitchell and Rook (1979), p. 696. Cited by Mitchell and Rook (1979), p. 696. In 1942, Klaber introduced the term \\"phytophotodermatitis\\" to emphasize that both plants and light were required to affect a reaction. Cited by McGovern and Barkley, section Phytophotodermatitis. Darrell Wilkinson, a British dermatologist, gave an accurate description of the disease in the 1950s. In 1961, Efremov reported 357 cases of phytophotodermatitis from Heracleum dulce (sweet cow parsnip). He \\"noted the requirement for sunlight in evoking the dermatitis since inunction of the juice of the plant without exposure to sunlight was harmless.\\" Cited by Mitchell and Rook (1979), p. 693. Between 1962 and 1976, numerous reports of phytophotodermatitis from giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum) were reported. By 1980, the photosensitizing effects of various plant species had become well known (as evidenced by the comprehensive work of Mitchell and Rook).

An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) originally found the cause of the accident to be due to the operator texting while driving, but the NTSB later found that the operator of the rear train, Terrese Edmonds, had not been using her cell phone at the time of the crash, but rather went into an episode of micro-sleep, causing her to lose awareness of her surroundings and miss potential hazards up ahead. The collision killed Edmonds, and numerous others were injured. Fourteen passengers were taken to area hospitals; one was airlifted. This crash, along with another similar accident a year later, led the NTSB to set higher standards and regulations regarding the use of cell phones while operating a train. Background The Green Line is a light rail system run by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) in the Boston, Massachusetts, metropolitan area. It is the oldest subway line in the United States. The Green Line splits into multiple branches; the D branch is a grade- separated, dual track line operating from a terminal station at Riverside to Kenmore station, where the D branch merges with the other Green Line branches and operates on shared tracks into downtown Boston. The D branch\\" uses block signaling between Waban and Woodland stations; operating rules require that Green Line trains encountering a single red signal to hold for 1 minute, then proceed at no more than 10 miles per hour past the red signal while being prepared to stop short of any train or other obstruction. Accident The 2008 Massachusetts train collision occurred on the westbound track between Waban and Woodland stations. Trains 3667 and 3681 were both Green Line trains operating in the westbound direction on the D branch at the time of the accident. At approximately 5:50PM, Train 3681 departed Waban station, and passed signal H-64. Signal H-64 changed to display a single red aspect, to indicate that Train 3681 was directly ahead of it. Train 3681 then encountered a single red signal at H-66, and came to a stop. Per operating rules, Train 3681 held at signal H-66 for 1 minute, then began to operate past H-66 at a restricted speed, reaching a speed of 3.4 mph at the time of the accident. Train 3667 departed Waban station westbound behind Train 3681. Although the red signal at H-64 required Train 3667 to stop and hold for 1 minute, an MBTA employee on the rear of Train 3667 told the NTSB that the train never slowed down after departing Waban, and instead accelerated to the maximum authorized speed of 40 mph. Travelling at a speed of 38 mph, Train 3667 crashed into the rear of Train 3681. The front of the lead car of Train 3681 suffered extensive damage, crushing the operating cab. The operator of Train 3667, Terrese Edmonds, suffered blunt force trauma during the collision and was killed; 8 passengers were injured. Investigation Initially, operator error was blamed for the crash. As the investigation began, the crash was suspected to be caused by distraction of Edmonds, who allegedly was using a cell phone while operating the train. However, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) ruled out distraction after it obtained Edmonds' cell phone records and determined that her cell phone was not in use at the time of the crash. Investigators also found that the brakes had not been applied, and the tracks were not faulty. The NTSB determined that an episode of micro-sleep caused by sleep apnea was likely the reason for the operator losing awareness of her environment. Edmonds was a relatively inexperienced operator who had tried for several years to get the job and was happy to have received it. The qualifications for the job included a high school diploma, a valid driver's license, a background check, and seven weeks of training.http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008May29/0,4670,TrainWrecks,00.html Signals, cell phone focuses of Boston train crash Aftermath In 2009, the NTSB released its final report on the crash.

James Livingston Oxford Biography Index entry Early life Livingston was the third son of Alexander Livingston, 1st Earl of Linlithgow and Helenor Hay (the eldest daughter of Andrew Hay, 8th Earl of Erroll). He was probably born during the 1590s. Around 1616 he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Dutch army under the command of his brother, Sir Henry Livingston. Career By 1629, he was an experienced soldier and lieutenant-colonel of one of the three regiments of the Scottish brigade. By 1633, he was a full colonel in the Dutch army. During the same period he also served both James VI and Charles I receiving both a pension and a knighthood for his services to the Crown. During a royal visit to Scotland, Livingston was created Lord Livingston of Almond on 19 June 1633 by Charles I.Almond is also spelt Amont in some sourcesStevenson During the opening phases of the Bishops' War, Livingston at first appeared to support the King by supporting a rival to the National Covenant called the King's Covenant, but then declared that it too upheld Presbyterianism. Pleading the need to go abroad for treatment of gallstones (something he had first suffered in 1637), he avoided any further entanglement in the war. After consulting his surgeon it was decided he did not need an operation, but instead of returning to Scotland he went to Holland and took command of his regiment.Stevenson During the Second Bishops' War Livingston served as lieutenant-general of the Covenanters' army and played a leading role during the invasion of England, but he opposed the policies of the Earl of Argyll and his faction, and signed the Cumbernauld Bond along with the Earl of Montrose and others.Stevenson citing \\"Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie, 1.390\\" After the Cumbernauld Bond was discovered by Argyll, the Committee of Estates considered the matter but in the end it was hushed up and Livingston retained the lieutenant- generalship.Stevenson Livingston's support for the Covenanters' caused lost him his Dutch command at the request of Charles I. However, during negotiations between Charles I and the Covenanters Charles hoped to persuade Livingston to be sympathetic to his proposals by offering Livingston the position of Treasurer of Scotland; however Livingston declined, putting the public good before private gain.Stevenson Livingston was involved in a planned Royalist coup d'√©tat known to history as \\"The Incident\\". It was alleged that a conspiracy to arrest the Earl of Argyll and the Marquess of Hamilton was discussed in Livingston's house, and that Livingston would have played a leading part in the arrests. However it suited neither the King or the Covenanters to investigate the conspiracy too rigorously as they were close to an agreement; as part of the settlement Livingston was created Earl of Callendar on 6 October 1641.Stevenson Livingston declined the offer of a high position in the army raised by Charles, and instead led a division of the Scottish forces into England in 1644 and helped Earl of Leven to capture Newcastle-upon-Tyne. In 1645 Livingston, who often imagined himself slighted, left the army, and in 1647 he was one of the promoters of The Engagement for the release of King Charles I.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition article \\"John Adrian Louis Hope Linlithgow\\" In 1648, when the Scots marched into England in the Campaign of Preston, Livingston served as lieutenant-general under the Duke of Hamilton, but Hamilton found him as difficult to work with as Leven had done previously, and his advice was mainly responsible for the defeat at the Battle of Preston. After Preston, Livingston escaped to Holland. In 1650 he was allowed to return to Scotland, but in 1654 his estates were seized and he was imprisoned (See Cromwell's Act of Grace). He came into prominence once more at the Restoration. Personal life In 1633, he was married to the Hon. Margaret Seton, the widow of Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline. Margaret was the sister of John Hay, 1st Earl of Tweeddale and the only daughter of James Hay, 7th Lord Hay of Yester and Lady Margaret Kerr (third daughter of Mark Kerr, 1st Earl of Lothian). When Livingston died in March 1674, leaving no children, according to a special remainder, he was succeeded in the earldom by his nephew Alexander Livingston, the second son of Alexander Livingston, 2nd Earl of Linlithgow.

Rice (Oryza sativa L) cultivation in Jumla ranges from 2,400 to 3,050 m altitude, which is the highest elevation in the world. The highest elevation at 3,050 m is Chhumjul of Jumla, a record altitude, where rice is cultivated in Nepal. Jumli Marshi, a Japonica variety of indigenous rice, having cold tolerant gene, is probably cultivated since 1,300 years ago in Jumla in the bank of the Tila river. The Tila Valley as well as the Sinja Khola Valley are covered with paddy fields growing the 'Kali Marshi' rice variety, a unique red rice that is sought after for its special taste. Jumla has a STOL airport, Jumla Airport, and the road network first reached it from Surkhet in May 2007.. It is the usual starting point for treks to Rara Lake. Climate Jumla has a highland oceanic climate that is cooled down by its elevation. As a result, the climate retains strong diurnal temperature variation in winter and the moderation is from subtropical influence as opposed to maritime.

This group of Itasha enthusiast will typically only except Japanese cars decorated with images of fictional characters from Japanese anime, manga, or video games. New age Itasha enthusiasts expand the definition of Itasha to include the fictional characters of other cultures.  Etymology  In the 1980s, when Japan was at the zenith of its economic might, Tokyo's streets were a parade of luxury import cars. Among them, the \\"itasha\\"‚Äîoriginally Japanese slang meaning an imported Italian car‚Äîwas the most desired. Since then, itasha (as the decorated vehicle) was derived from combining the Japanese words for and . Itai here means \\"pain(ful)\\", which can be interpreted as \\"painfully embarrassing\\", \\"painful for the wallet\\" due to the high costs involved, or \\"painful to look at\\" (an eyesore).

Involvement in motorsports Good Smile Racing Komatti-Mirai EV, 2013 TT Zero Nowadays, the involvement of itasha in real motorsport events has been a unique feature in Japan's motorsport industry. Race cars in itasha decals can be seen from regional club events to international races (including events under the FIA). Participants are also not limited to amateurs. Many professional teams, or even manufacturer-backed teams, would not mind to turn their race cars into itasha cars; not only does it act as an alternative for sponsorship decals (if the character or design is provided by the sponsor), it is widely considered as one of the many ways of expanding their team's fanbase or promoting the event they are participating in. In the Autobacs Super GT series, Good Smile Racing has run a series of Hatsune Miku-themed racecars since 2008, while Pacific Racing has had collaborations with Squid Girl, Ghost in the Shell: Arise, Love Live! and Girls und Panzer in their involvement with the Super GTLove Live! √ó Pacific Racing Car Revealed, All Œº's Members Drawn on One Car and D1 Grand Prix series.Pacific Racing Team Previews \\"Girls und Panzer\\" Collaboration Good Smile Racing notably is a three-time champion in the GT300 class, the second most successful team in the history of Super GT's GT300 class (only Team Taisan, with seven titles, had a better record). Similar involvement of itasha vehicles can be seen in motorcycle or even open-wheeler events. Internationally, Good Smile Racing sponsored Komatti-Mirai team in TT Zero in 2013 and participated in Spa 24 Hours since 2017. In 2019 Spa 24 Hours Good Smile Racing collaborated with Black Falcon, TYPE-MOON, and Studio Trigger to field three Mercedes-AMG GT3 in the race with Hatsune Miku, Fate, and Promare liveries.

History Bishop Francisco Gomes de Avelar. As happened elsewhere in the Algarve, it is highly probable that Lagoa was raised to the status of a parish in the diocese of Silves at the beginning of the 16th century (while Lagoa itself was still part of the municipality/concelho of Silves. This change in status led to the construction of a new building in the prevailing Manueline style. The usual design of the time for principal churches involved a tripartite nave, five bays, no transept, and three altars at the front.Francisco I.C. Lameiro (n.d.), p.6 This earlier church was badly damaged in the 1755 earthquake. All that has survived is a Manueline doorway integrated into the bell tower, and certain architectural elements visible in the sacristy which were incorporated as fill material in the 18th-century reconstruction and which are occasionally rediscovered during renovations. As for the reconstruction itself, there survives a contract from 1764 between Lu√≠s Coelho da Silva of Monchique and the head of the elected Building Commission (Comiss√£o Fabriqueira), Diogo Tavares, for furnishing wood for the church. (Tavares was a professional builder and the most prestigious stonemason and contractor in the Algarve. At the time he was living in Lagoa). The main door and the three windows of the principle facade were only rebuilt in 1809 by the Faro stonemason, Ant√≥nio Xavier de Mendon√ßa using stone cut in the quarry of S√£o Louren√ßo. The building was finally consecrated on 4 September 1814 by Bishop D. Francisco Gomes de Avelar.Francisco I.C. Lameiro (n.d.), p.3 The columns and arches in the nave date from the third quarter of the 18th century, erected under the supervision of Diogo Tavares. They are similar to what can be seen in the principal churches of Est√¥mbar, Portim√£o, and in Saint Peter (S√£o Pedro) of Faro and represent a style that at the time seems to have been limited to the Algarve.Francisco I.C. Lameiro (n.d.), p.4 Architecture Facade of the Church of Our Lady of Light in Lagoa, Algarve. As for the ornamentation of the chancel and chapels, a contract survives, dated 22 September 1770, between the parish priest, Fr. Ign√°cio de Oliveira e Sousa, and one of the most well-known artists of the Algarve, master-carver Manuel Francisco Xavier, for the commission to create five altar-pieces in the latest style out of wood from Flanders for the price of 700 r√©is. In the end, three of these altar-pieces were never completed (the ones for the chancel and the collateral chapels); the fate of the other two (for the chapels of St. Sebastian and St. Anthony) are unknown. The altarpiece of the chancel is representative of the 19th century. During the episcopal visit of 1803 it was noted that a new altarpiece needed to be constructed as soon as possible. In the following year 500 r√©is was budgeted for it and master-carver Mathias Jos√© de Sousa, a resident of Lagoa at the time, was responsible for the work. An analysis of the piece, however, shows strong ties to 18th-century carving, not only in the dynamism of its design, but also in the preservation of columns with straight channelled shafts and in the two angels set on the curved segment of the upper section. (It is possible that the earlier sketch by Manuel Francisco Xavier was adapted in large part by Mathias.) The image on the main altar is of Our Lady of Light, the patron saint of the church (and of Lagoa).Francisco I.C. Lameiro (n.d.), p.5 The 6 side altarpieces, despite some later interventions, display great similarities to each other, indicating that they belong to a common program and that they were created in the same workshop. There is a certain formality about them ‚Äì a plain or rectangular design contrasting with the dynamism of the pedestals, of the ‚Äútree-trunk‚Äù pillars, and of the ornamentation, especially at the top. Beyond the usual principles of design ‚Äì dignity suiting the House of God, presenting to the faithful one of the possible representations of heaven, and the framing of figures who stand out for their exemplary lives ‚Äì there are other, more specific ones: the adoption of a common decorative program, a strong emphasis on the parish priest, and the possible eventual participation of a confraternity or brotherhood (probably without any members of high social status or wealth).Francisco I.C. Lameiro (n.d.), p.7 Treasurers The church houses a small collection of religious objects (sculpture and reliquaries), about 3 dozen examples from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, some of which come from the Carmelite Convent of Saint Joseph, and from two shrines elsewhere in town. Among these objects is a silver censer, and a carved image of the Christ Child. The censer, in the shape of a boat, is still used today during the most solemn ceremonies. Its profusion of ornamentation with volutes, acanthus leaves, seraphim heads, etc. is characteristic of the Baroque period of the first half of the 18th century. There is no information about its creator, but it was probably one of the Algarve artists well known for this type of work.Francisco I.C. Lameiro (n.d.), p.8 The wooden image of the Christ Child is also Baroque from the first half of the 18th century. It was destined for an oratory and when created it was sitting on some sort of chair. In the third quarter of the 18th century a bed of wood was made for it, in the Rococo style. From the moment it was presented to the church it has had great popular appeal, especially at Christmas time when it is kissed by the faithful.Francisco I.C. Lameiro (n.d.), p.1 The chest of drawers in the sacristy is contemporary with the carving of the side altars but seems to be from a different workshop, and is an important example of Rococo carving.

R. Cornish, 1828 ‚Äì 19 December 1896) was a British physician who served in India for more than thirty years, and became the Surgeon-General‚Äîhead of medical services‚Äîin the Madras Presidency. During the Great Famine of 1876‚Äì78, Cornish, then Sanitary Commissioner of Madras, argued for generous famine relief, which put him at odds with Sir Richard Temple, Famine Envoy for the Government of India, who was promoting reduced rations. Some of Cornish's innovations made their way into the Indian Famine Codes of the late 19th century. Education Cornish was born in Butleigh, near Glastonbury in 1828. After picking up some medical skills from local practitioners (in Somerset county), Cornish proceeded to St George's Hospital, London in 1850 for his medical education. At St. George's, he won a scholarship in Anatomy and Materia medica and prizes in Chemistry and Botany. At the end of his medical training, he took the competitive examination for service in the British East India Company and, in March 1854, joined as Assistant Surgeon in the Army of the Madras Presidency of British India. India Two years into his appointment, Cornish contributed an article, \\"Indian Febrifuges\\" to the Indian Annals of Medical Science in which he described his experiments with the Margosa bark, used in native Indian medicine, in the treatment of intermittent fevers, and showed it to be as effective as Cinchona and Arsenic, which were more popular with British physicians practising in India. He later advocated the growing of Cinchona in India, as the supply from South America was becoming more unreliable. Not only did the plant take to Indian soil, but India soon became a major exporter of quinine. Prison conditions In 1857, Cornish was given medical charge of a large jail in Coimbatore. There, his attention was drawn to the high mortality rate among the prisoners, very few of whom apparently survived beyond seven years. By investigating the problem, he was able to rule out the unsanitary prison conditions as the main cause of increased mortality, and instead concluded that the poor prison diet was the main culprit. His conclusions were published in his report, \\"Prison dietaries and food,\\" published by the Madras government. The physician, Sir Benjamin Ward Richardson, who considered Cornish to be an authority on Indian foodgrains and their chemical composition, often referred to this report in his lectures in Great Britain on public health. Expertise in public health and hygiene In 1858, Cornish returned to Madras City to assume the post of Secretary of the Medical Department of the presidency. Soon afterwards, he was entrusted with investigating and writing a report on the high rates of mortality among British soldiers serving in the presidency army. The first of his reports, \\"Causes of death in Madras,\\" was submitted in 1859 to the Army Sanitary Commission in London and established his reputation as a public hygiene expert (\\"sanitary expert\\" in contemporaneous usage). The report was translated into Indian languages and widely distributed. Another influential report, \\"Cleansing of Indian Towns,\\" was published in 1864. In it, he argued that European methods of wet drainage (using sewers and drains), were not optimal for tropical climates, where waste decomposed faster and where, in the summer months, there was water shortage; in their stead, he advocated \\"dry conservancy,\\" which was ultimately adopted in hospitals, army barracks, and railway stations in many parts of India. Sanitary Commissioner In 1870, Cornish was appointed Sanitary Commissioner of the Madras Presidency. In his new position, he traveled throughout the presidency promoting dry conservancy, clean drinking water, and vaccination against small-pox. His efforts bore fruit when mortality from both cholera and small-pox was drastically reduced in the presidency. During the Great Famine of 1876‚Äì78, which hit the Madras Presidency especially hard, Cornish became embroiled in a public debate with Sir Richard Temple, then Famine Commissioner of India, about what constituted an adequate diet for people on relief, many of whom toiled in the \\"relief works,\\" laying roads and breaking rocks or metal., , Relying on his experience from investigating prison conditions two decades earlier, Cornish advocated more generous rations than Temple, whose reduced rations were being handed out in the early months of 1877. In March 1877, however, the government of the Madras Presidency, tacitly accepting Cornish's general argument, increased the relief rations, although not as much as Cornish himself had advocated. Cornish was recognized for his services during the famine by being made a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire. Many of his recommendations would find their way into the Provisional Famine Code of 1883 and other Indian Famine Codes thereafter. Surgeon-General and retirement In 1880, Cornish was promoted to Surgeon-General‚Äîthe head of medical services in the Madras Presidency. Soon, he was also appointed Honorary Physician to Queen Victoria and nominated to the Legislative Council of the Madras presidency. He also compiled and edited the 1881 Census for the Madras Presidency. His last major effort in India was in the framing of the Act for Local Self-Government in the Madras Presidency. Cornish retired from the Indian Medical Service in 1885 and returned to London. In retirement he played a prominent role in the British Medical Association and the planning of the Institute of State Medicine later to become the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.

Cruc√©, in accordance with Cyneas, made peace central to his philosophical and political thought. Cruc√© took the position that wars were the result of international misunderstandings and the domination of society by the warrior class, both of which could be reduced through commerce which brought people together.Oneal, John R., Oneal, Frances H., Maoz, Zeev; and Russett, Bruce. \\"The Liberal Peace: Interdependence, Democracy, and International Conflict, 1950-85\\", Journal of Peace Research, Vol. 33, No. 1 (Feb., 1996) He is pacifist in tone, and envisages an international body to maintain peace. It should be a permanent gathering of princes, or their representatives, in session at Venice, whose task would be to resolve national or international disputes. Radically, he suggests that the Islamic powers would participate John Bagnell Bury, The Idea of Progress (2004 reprint), p. 88. in this permanent peace congress; Cruc√©'s thinking runs along the lines of a common humanity.Darren J.

His system relies on a measure of free trade,A Brief History of the Quest for Peace and proposes a single currency and standardized weights and measures. There is an emphasis on social and economic objectives, as well as public spending. Cruc√©'s ideas are in sharp contrast to those of Jean Bodin, whose ideas are based on national sovereignty and the acceptance of war.

It has been debated that it is a possible portrait of Julius Caesar.\\"Bust from riverbed reveals face of Julius Caesar\\" Analysis The uncompromising realism of the portrait places it in the tradition of late Republican Roman portrait and genre sculptures of the 1st century BC. The archaeologists suggested that this was a portrait of Julius Caesar and that it should be given a date of about 46 BC, making it, according to France's Minister of Culture Christine Albanel, the oldest known representation of Caesar.Original communique (May 13, 2008); second communique (May 20, 2008); report (May 20, 2008) They further suggested that the bust was discreetly disposed of after Caesar's assassination in 44 BC, when portraits of him could have been politically dangerous possessions.\\"I suspect the bust was thrown in the river after he was assassinated because it would not have been good at that time to be considered a follower of his,\\" said French archaeologist Luc Long, quoted by Agence France Presse at the time the discovery was revealed (Bust from riverbed reveals face of Julius Caesar: archeologist; France24: \\"Un buste de Jules C√©sar d√©couvert √† Arles\\", 14 May 2008 ).

After a further stylistic assessment Zanker dated the Arles bust to the Augustan period. Elkins pointed out the 3rd century AD as the outside terminus post quem for the deposition of the statues, thereby disputing the claim that the bust was thrown away due to feared repercussions from Caesar's assassination in 44 BC.

He has worked with Indigenous Australians since 1969 and has worked with indigenous peoples in Bali, North India, Japan, and Canada. At Toronto, his main area of focus is comparative religion and the role of music in the indigenous societies of Australia, North America, Africa, and India. While conducting his Ph.D at the University of Western Australia, Turner began his fieldwork with the people of Groote Eylandt, in order to better understand Aboriginal social organization and symbolism.Turner, David H., \\"On the Outside Looking In,\\" from Challenging Anthropology, David H. Turner & Gavin A. Smith, eds. p 17. McGraw-Hill Ryerson, 1979. Since then, he has challenged common notions of hunter-gatherer social and spiritual life and sought to bring a deeper understanding of the Australian Aboriginal way of life to the modern world. Indeed, in 1986, after undergoing the second stage of initiation by the Aboriginal people of Groote Eylandt, he was told by his hosts to go back out into the modern world and show its people another way of life, so that they might live more harmoniously with others. Turner was encouraged to become a missionary of sorts, a representative of the Aboriginal world.Turner, David H. 1991. Dreamtime: Life, Afterlife and the Soul in Australian Aboriginal Religion, from India International Centre Quarterly, Vol. Winter 1991, pp 4-18. N.H. Ramachandran. Turner's view of indigenous Australian society The indigenous Australians, far from being a primitive people, have a highly sophisticated society and worldview which, in Turner's view, is in many ways more advanced than those of modern Western civilization. According to Turner, the Aborigines have developed several social mechanisms for ensuring social and environmental harmony that run contrary to conventional Western thinking. In particular, rather than formulate their society around notions of personal or national autonomy and property, they favour a philosophy of mutual dependence. It is this mutual dependence, or interdependence, which ensures peaceful coexistence. This is explicit in the Aboriginal practice of renunciation, which resembles reciprocal altruism but runs much deeper. Rather than reciprocal trading of resources, or sharing them by giving a portion of what one has to another, the Aborigines give everything of what they have to whoever needs it, as codified by the statement: \\"You have nothing, everything I have is yours; I have nothing, everything you have is mine.\\"Turner, David H. 1999, Genesis Regained: Aboriginal Forms of Renunciation in Judeo-Christian Scriptures and Other Major Traditions, pp. 1-9, New York: Peter Lang. Likewise, Turner notes that the Aborigines practice renunciation in their allocation of property. On Bickerton Island, each group of people within Aboriginal society lives within a defined region of land, and each region contains one major resource (such as fresh water or a particular type of food). Rather than having exclusive access to their region's resource (as in conventional concepts of ownership), the group is instead forbidden to consume it. In the Aboriginal world, such resources exist only to be given freely to members of neighbouring groups. Again, this is a method which makes self- sufficiency impossible, ensuring that neighbours must rely on each other and work to make their relations cooperative and peaceful.Turner, David H. 1999, Genesis Regained: Aboriginal Forms of Renunciation in Judeo-Christian Scriptures and Other Major Traditions, p. 32, New York: Peter Lang. Turner's view is that renunciation is not simply a concept or an economic theory, but a literal reenactment of creation as it is perceived by the Aborigines. For the Aborigines, physical and spiritual reality coexist, flowing in and out of each other in an endless process. Spiritual forms are always giving of themselves to make the world and the people in it. In such a world, it makes no sense to hold on to anything, because nothing is ever \\"yours\\" to begin with. So, an act of renunciation‚Äîeven something as simple as giving food to a stranger who does not have any is an action which reflects the fundamental nature of reality itself. In Turner's view, rather than simply failing to develop modern technologies, economics, and ways of living, at some point in their history (upwards of 130,000 years), the Aborigines made a conscious decision to turn toward more socially and spiritually meaningful pursuits. They turned away from technology, and toward each other. In doing so they eliminated poverty, theft, social class, and warfare, and lived in peace for possibly tens of thousands of years.

Its name is derived from the extravagant feathering on the feet and hock joints, which are called vulture hocks or \\"sabels\\" in Dutch. With no large fowl counterpart from which it was miniaturized, the Booted is one of the true bantams. Males usually weigh in at around 850 grams (30 ounces) and females 750 grams (27 ounces). American standards dictate a smaller ideal size of 740 grams (26 ounces) for males, and 625 (22 ounces) for females.  Characteristics  Booted Bantams are angular birds with profuse plumage. They have broad backs, breasts carried well forward, and relatively large, downward-pointing wings following the line of the vulture hocks. They do not quite reach the floor though. Booted Bantams have a single upright comb with five points, horn-colored beaks, red wattles, and red earlobes. Almost exclusively an exhibition chicken raised by poultry fanciers, they appear in more than a twenty colour varieties. Colours accepted in shows include: Barred, Black, Blue, Buff, Cuckoo, Columbian, Gray, Golden Neck, Millefleur (the most common), Mottled, Partridge, Lavender, Lemon Millefleur, Porcelain, Self Blue, Silver Millefleur and White. Long kept as pets in addition to being shown, Booted Bantams are usually friendly and calm. They are good foragers, and are said to do less damage to garden plants because of their heavily feathered feet. However, most breeders keep their Booted Bantams confined and on soft bedding in order to maintain these feathers.Staples pp. 40, 56, 80 Hens readily go broody, and lay very small eggs that are white or tinted in color. Their egg production is respectable for bantams, especially in summer.  History  The Booted Bantam is closely related to the Belgian Barbu d'Uccle. The most significant differences in conformation between the two are the d'Uccle's feather beard and the greater height of the Booted. Some sources assert the two breeds share a singular point of origin, with a Belgian breeder around the beginning of the 20th century.Ekarius p. 111 Other sources point to a clearly documented presence in the Netherlands since the 16th century,Graham p. 135 and note that the Booted Bantam is known to this day in the Netherlands, as the Nederlandse Sabelpootkriel (Dutch, Dutch saber-legged bantam). Whatever their exact relation, Booted Bantams and Bearded d'Uccles are only two of a handful of chicken breeds to possess vulture hocks, (Sultans do too). Popular across Europe for hundreds of years, the Booted Bantam was imported to North America from Germany in the late 19th century. It was officially recognized by the American Poultry Association in 1879. It is also recognized by the American Bantam Association, and is classed in the Feather Legged group.] Booted Bantam UK Booted Bantams in the UK are catered for by the Booted Bantam Society UK. The breed has 11 colours accepted by the Poultry Club of Great Britain. These are black, black mottled, blue, buff mottled, cuckoo, lavender, lemon millefleur, millefleur, porcelain, silver millefleur, white. The black and white Booted Bantams were created in the UK and have been here for over 100 years. In recent years more colours have been imported into the UK from mainland Europe and the most popular colour by far is the Lemon Millefleur Booted Bantam. Although not shown in large numbers at present they are a very popular pet and are becoming more common in people's back gardens. They are a breed that can be susceptible to a form of Mareks Disease although this can be bred out within a few years.

In 1704, two years after becoming the Royal Colony of New Jersey, William Bradford began printing laws for the colony. This included An Act to Regulate the Purchasing of Law from the Indians, the first printed law in New Jersey, and a collection of laws passed between 1703 and 1709. In 1711, the assembly began consistently printing its laws and minutes and, by 1725, the ‚Äúpages of Votes & Proceedings,‚Äù the colonial legislative publication, ‚Äúwere being sent to the printer weekly.‚ÄùShaw, \\"The Origins of a State Library,\\" 12.

By the 1750s, committee reports listed the sources used in each deliberation, which included several reference texts, such as law dictionaries, encyclopedias, and handbooks on parliamentary procedure.Shaw, \\"The Origins of a State Library,\\" 14. In the 1760s, there are several mentions of the assembly ordering boxes, shelving, and cases for their growing collection. The boxes and cases also enabled the assembly to safely transfer necessary documents and books between Perth Amboy and Burlington, the colony‚Äôs two capitals.

OpticStudio is its flagship product and a commonly used optical design program for Microsoft Windows. It is used for the design and analysis of both imaging and illumination systems. History OpticStudio, then called Zemax, was originally written by Ken Moore and was the first optical design program specifically written for Windows. It became commercially available in 1990. The first version was called Max, named after the programmer's dog. The name was later changed to Zemax due to a trademark conflict. The software was rebranded as OpticStudio in 2016. The program was originally sold by Focus Software, which later became Zemax Development Corp. The latter merged with Radiant Imaging in 2011 to form Radiant Zemax. In 2014 Radiant sold Zemax to Arlington Capital Partners, which named the company Zemax, LLC. Arlington Capital Partners sold Zemax to EQT June 26, 2018. Features and applications OpticStudio is an optical design program that is used to design and analyze imaging systems such as camera lenses, as well as illumination systems. It works by ray tracing‚Äîmodelling the propagation of rays through an optical system. It can model the effect of optical elements such as simple lenses, aspheric lenses, gradient-index lenses, mirrors, and diffractive optical elements, and can produce standard analysis diagrams such as spot diagrams and ray-fan plots. OpticStudio can also model the effect of optical coatings on the surfaces of components. It includes a library of stock commercial lenses.Fischer (2008), p. 590. OpticStudio can perform standard sequential ray tracing through optical elements, non-sequential ray tracing for analysis of stray light, and physical optics beam propagation. It also has tolerancing capability, to allow analysis of the effect of manufacturing defects and assembly errors. The physical optics propagation feature can be used for problems where diffraction is important, including the propagation of laser beams and the coupling of light into single-mode optical fibers. OpticStudio's optimization tools can be used to improve an initial lens design by automatically adjusting parameters to maximize performance and reduce aberrations.

The original John Sutter farm was bounded by the present city streets of Sutter, Etzel, Pennsylvania and Olive Street Road. John Sutter (1815‚Äì1867) came from Germany with his family in 1831. In 1850, he and his wife Ursula built ‚ÄúThe Homestead‚Äù (now demolished) on Sutter Avenue near Etzel. Sutter, a dairyman whose business supplied major St. Louis hotels, was the father of 16 children, of whom William Sutter, born in 1846, was one. The Sutter property was located on Olive Street Road, built in 1851 as a plank road to connect St. Louis with outlying farms and communities to the west northwest. A small community on Olive near the Sutter farm became known as Sutter, Missouri, and had the post office for the region. William Sutter sold his house and property in 1875 to Roman Meyer (1847‚Äì1913), another German immigrant. Meyer, like many of his neighbors along Olive, was a truck farmer supplying the growing population of St. Louis. The Sutter lands were subdivided over the years for the suburban residences. In 1906, the area was incorporated into the new municipality of University City. In the following years, as the area developed, the Meyer family continued gardening, providing fresh vegetables and fruit for the surrounding new neighborhoods.Hamilton, Esley: Excerpted from the National Register for Historic Places Nomination for the University City Historic Preservation Committee, 1980.Historical Society of University City: Meyer Property and Environs as shown in the 1909 St. Louis County Atlas, October, 1987 In 1951, much of the remaining undeveloped land of the Meyer farm was replotted as the Keating Subdivision. Chamberlain was extended west to form a cul-de-sac, and the address of the old house changed from 6805 Olive Street Road to 6826 Chamberlain Court. New houses were built on Chamberlain Court in the 1950s. The Sutter-Meyer house remained in the Meyer family until the death of Edward Meyer, Roman Meyer's son, in 1969. Description The house as a 1¬Ω story main block, three bays wide and one deep, with a 1-story wing to the rear and a later 2-car garage attached to the northwest corner. All portions of the house are of brick, painted white. The windows are tall and narrow, 2 over 2 double-hung, with segmental arched heads. Across the east front of the main block is a verandah, whose roof is supported by shaped slat-like brackets and square posts on square pedestals. The floor of the verandah is now concrete. Twin chimneys pierce the rear slope of the main roof, they have elaborately corbelled tops. Original woodwork remains throughout the interior, including shaped lintels over doors and windows, and a fireplace in the south room. The staircase ascends away from the front door and turns into the north room; it once had a second flight into the kitchen. Basement stairs descend from the back porch, which was enclosed in 1951. The kitchen has been modernized.

Drummer Jack Rabid (who founded the music magazine The Big Takeover, also in 1980) was the only constant, as the band lineup changed numerous times over the course of the band's four-year existence. Other members included vocalists John Pouridas, John Berry, Garth Ripton, Rebecca \\"R.B.\\" Korbet and Ken \\"Tantrum\\" Tempkin; guitarists Dave Stein, Robert Weeks, Thurston Moore and Steve Waxman; and bassists Nick Marden (later of the Stimulators), Eric Keil and Tim Sommer. History Even Worse was formed in April 1980 by Summit, New Jersey punk rockers, Rabid and Stein, along with bassist Marden, as the direct result of the Stimulators needing an opening band for their May 1980 show at New York City club Tier 3. With singer Berry (later of the Young Aborigines and Beastie Boys), the teenage quartet performed at various Manhattan clubs, opening for the likes of Bad Brains. Eventually, Marden left to join the Stimulators and Berry and Stein likewise departed. Rabid recruited vocalist Korbet, bassist Keil and guitarist Weeks. This 1981-82 lineup of Even Worse performed at prominent New York City punk concerts and made their recorded debut with two songs on New York Thrash, a legendary document of the early '80s New York City punk and hardcore scene issued only on cassette by ROIR. The tape also featured their contemporaries the Stimulators, Bad Brains, the Undead, Heart Attack and Kraut. Even Worse also recorded an entire studio album in November 1981, which went unreleased until 2002. This most well-known version of the band broke up in early 1982, leaving Rabid to put together another totally different lineup including Tempkin, Waxman, journalist/DJ Sommer and Moore (the latter played guitar in the band during 1982-1983 while concurrently in Sonic Youth). Their first 7\\" single, \\"Mouse or Rat?\\", recorded live in August 1982 at City Gardens in Trenton, featured the Rabid/Moore/Sommer/Waxman/Tempkin lineup, but was not issued (on their own Worse than You!?! label) until 1984. A second single from this period, \\"Leaving\\", released in 1988, featured Rabid (on drums and vocals), Sommer and Stein on the A-side, with Rabid, Sommer, Moore and Tempkin on B-side \\"One Night Stand\\". After his 1982-84 stint in Even Worse, Sommer went on to found Hugo Largo, and later served as a host for MTV and VH1 and as an Atlantic Records A&R; representative. Rabid later formed post-punk trio Springhouse (who released two albums on Caroline Records, 1991's Land Falls and 1993's Postcards from the Arctic) and Last Burning Embers. Springhouse reunited to record a third album, From Now to OK, issued in 2008 by Independent Project Records. The \\"classic\\" 1981-82 Even Worse lineup of Rabid, Korbet, Weeks and Keil reunited in 2002 to perform at the New York Thrash reunion concert at CBGB, coinciding with the Grand Theft Audio CD release of You've Ruined Everything. The disc contained the entire 13-song unreleased album recorded in 1981, as well as a live set recorded in August 1981 at Max's Kansas City (the infamous \\"We Suck\\" from this recording appeared on several 1980s Mystic Records compilation albums).

Plot  Tenussian Vaccuvasco (the word does not have any meaning except perhaps a state of chaos, and is just another word play by Shokof) was made in Berlin, Germany in 2000. It was produced by Taies Farzan, and was shot in 3 days with digital cameras and had a cast of over 100 people who had to undergo amazing physical burdens for the film. Each window in the building shows the life of a crowd and or residents in the apartment in the building block. Residents differ from Boxers to drug dealers to lovers and or a Maniac couple slapping each other in the face for fun. Their funny ritual of slapping each other in the face ends in a bloody finale. As the film continues the stories begin to become more intertwined and complicated. Finally they start to relate to one another and begin to even collide and connect. The hilarious situations peak as people start going into other people's apartments through the open windows in the building block. The party people enter the room of the drug dealer and steal the drugs that actually belongs to bad group of organized crime people who are after the dealer anyway, and will later find him to clear their accounts. Many different situations and absurd dramaturgy of each scene in each apartment keeps the tenants busy and engaged with humorous results. Soon more twists and troubles prevail alongside much fun and comedy moments that give the whole film a layer of lightheartedness. Shokof explained that some of the actors had to run up and down the stairs in order to be ready to act in the next scene and in a different apartment more than 5 times in a single hour to keep the continuity of the scenes intact as they had to shoot without a \\"cut\\". The Boxers had to box for over half an hour in their room on the fourth floor before the crane and camera could have reached them after covering other stories from the first floor up and \\"uncut\\".

An atgeir, sometimes called a \\"mail-piercer\\" or \\"hewing-spear\\", was a type of polearm in use in Viking Age Scandinavia and Norse colonies in the British Isles and Iceland. It is usually translated in English as \\"halberd\\", but most likely closer resembled a bill or glaive during the Viking age.Less Commonly Known Viking Weapons ‚Äì The Atgeir Another view is that the term had no association with a specific weapon until it is used as an anachronism in saga literature to lend weight to accounts of special weapons.

The term is first used as a term in Teutonic sources before the Viking Age. It is not used in any Viking Age source and there are no remains from archaeology which can be identified with the term. The references from saga literature are not relevant to the Viking Age but come from Iceland of the thirteenth century and later. Originally it meant 'most spear-like spear' i.e. best spear, and can refer to a light or a heavy weapon.Keller 1906 Arguably the most famous atgeir was Gunnar H√°mundarson's, as described in Njal's Saga.

Towering above it is Rois-bheinn, the highest hill in the area. History Grounds of what was the Roshven House, home to the Blackburns Historically, the hamlet was named Irin. Ranald Macdonald, younger brother of Donald Macdonald 4th of Kinlochmoidart, was granted the tack of Irin from Clanranald in 1749. According to the 1841 census, the main house by the burn was occupied by a Mary Anderson, originally from Kinlochailort. In 1854, Jemima Blackburn, an artist, and her husband, Hugh Blackburn, Professor of mathematics at Glasgow University, bought the Roshven Estate, presumably from Anderson. Blackburn was noted for capturing the area's scenery, flora and fauna in her nationally famous illustrations. She was particularly adept at painting birds and flowers. Roshven Estate covered some 4500 acres. They subsequently renovated the Georgian house in the hamlet. Their homes in Glasgow and at Roshven became a focus for visits from some of the most celebrated figures of the century including John Ruskin, Sir John Everet Millais, Anthony Trollope, the Duke of Argyll, Benjamin Disraeli, Lord Lister, Professor Helmholtz, Lord Kelvin and James Clerk-Maxwell, Jemima's first cousin. On 12 January 1894, around 11.50 pm, the aftershock of an earthquake measuring 4 on the Richter scale was experienced at Roshven and the settlements of Arisaig and Glenmoidart. Geography and climate Two burns meet at Roshven Anchorage point near Roshven Farm Roshven is situated in the Highlands of Scotland, in the area of Lochaber. It lies on the southeastern bank of Loch Ailort along the A861 road, southwest of the settlement of Inverailort and east of Glenuig. Boats can be moored in shallow water on the Loch near Roshven House. At one time there were plans to build a terminal and a pier at Roshven. The area is mountainous, Rois-Bheinn being the highest and most dominant mountain, although Roshven is surrounded by other mountains such as An Stac, Sgurr Na Ba Glaise and Sgurr Dhomhuill Mor. The largest burn that comes through Roshven is the Irin Burn which originates in Lochan na Craoihhe and runs down past Roshven Farm. Its estuary is located on the shore in front of the farm. Roshven has quite a varied and unpredictable climate. Fort William which is located around 30 miles away experiences on average 3500-4500mm of rainfall every year. It experiences warm and wet summers and mild and wet winters. Snow is not very frequent because Roshven, like much of Lochaber, is subject to warm, moist air from the Gulf Stream. According to the Royal Meteorological Society, one of the descendants of Hugh and Jemima Blackburn, Vera Philippa Blackburn (widow of William) who died in 1932, was keen on meteorology and had kept a rain gauge at Roshven in which she recorded the climate and rainfall for many years. Wildlife Fauna Like many Highland areas, many forms of wildlife are found at Roshven, both aquatic and land-based. In Loch Ailort there are many varieties of fish found such as mackerel, sea trout and salmon. Brown trout are also found in the burns and streams which run down off the surrounding hills. There have been occasional sitings of dolphins and whales in the loch, and once a whale died after being washed up onto the beach. Deer, foxes, wild cats, squirrels and pine martens are regularly seen in the area. The birds however are the major attraction of Roshven and this is what inspired Blackburn in her paintings. Golden eagles are often seen either flying over the loch or, more frequently, in front of the mountains and trees. Flora Vegetation at Roshven Estate The vegetation growing at Roshven is lush, due to plentiful rainfall, but somewhat varied. One of the main plants is rhododendron, and trees such as Scots pine, oak, birch and ash are common. Despite the rainfall, however, the land is not good for growing crops because the soil is thin, lacks fertility and can often be too inundated with water. Economic and business Tourism is important to the local economy. The Roshven Farm contains five chalets which are let out to visitors. Deer stalking is carried out on the hills as well as hillwalking, fishing, sailing and rock climbing. Hill sheep farming is also practised and hay and silage are also grown on the lower, shore-bordering fields as these have thicker soils and can be used to produce food for cattle and sheep to feed on in the winter.

The population consists of rose-ringed parakeets (Psittacula krameri), a non-migratory species of bird native to Africa and the Indian Subcontinent. The origins of these birds are subject to speculation, but they are generally thought to have bred from birds that escaped from captivity. The British parakeet population is mostly concentrated in suburban areas of London and the Home Counties of South-East England, and for this reason the birds are sometimes known as \\"Kingston parakeets\\" or \\"Twickenham parakeets\\", after the London suburbs of Kingston upon Thames and Twickenham. The parakeets, which breed rapidly, have since spread beyond these areas, and flocks have been sighted in other parts of Britain, such as a flock of around 20 to 30 settled in Victoria Park, Glasgow. Other separate feral parakeet populations exist in and around other European cities. Origin of the birds A parakeet on a bird feeder in Kensington Gardens, London How exactly the parakeet population first came to exist and thrive in the wild in England is not known; however, a number of theories abound, most centred around a pair or more of breeding parakeets that escaped or were released from captivity some time in the mid-1990s, consistent with the first widespread photographs of the birds. More specific introduction theories explaining the origin of the birds have also been published: * Parakeets that escaped from the branch of Ealing Studios used for the filming of The African Queen -- Isleworth Studios -- in 1951 * Parakeets that escaped from damaged aviaries during the Great Storm of 1987 * A pair of parakeets released by Jimi Hendrix in Carnaby Street, London, in the 1960s * A number of parakeets reportedly escaped from a pet shop in Sunbury- on-Thames in 1970 Despite the number of theories associated with film studios and musicians, most ornithologists believe that the original birds likely escaped from aviaries before 1971. In terms of geographic origin, the British birds are considered a hybrid population of two Asian subspecies, P.k. borealis and P.k. manillensis. Population in Britain Rose-ringed parakeet distribution in Great Britain Despite the increase in notability and population size at the end of the 20th and beginning of the 21st centuries, escaped parakeets have been spotted in Britain since the 19th century. The earliest recorded sighting was in 1855 in Norfolk, and parakeets were also seen in Dulwich in 1893 and Brixton in 1894. Throughout the decades since, parakeets continued to variously escape captivity; however, populations repeatedly died out until 1969, when the population of parakeets began to breed and sustain itself for the first time in London. Beginning in Croydon, the parakeets spread to Wraysbury, Bromley and Esher. The numbers remained very low, however, until the mid-1990s, when the population appeared to start increasing rapidly. The population was estimated at 500 in 1983, reached 1,500 by 1996, and 5,800 in the London area in 2002 (in up to 5 roosts). British parakeets are most common in the south-east of England, including London suburbs, Surrey, Kent and Sussex. Parakeet populations have also been reported further north in Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Oxford and Edinburgh. Due to population growth and the relatively quick spread of parakeets throughout Britain, estimates of parakeet numbers within the country vary. According to the London Natural History Society in the early 2000s, the largest population was believed to exist in the South London suburbs, where, until 2007, the birds roosted principally in Esher Rugby Ground, Esher (Esher Rugby Club named its women's team \\"The Parakeets\\" in a tribute to the birds).London Bird Report 2006. London Natural History Society. 2006. p. 93. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) estimates there to be around 8,600 breeding pairs in Britain. Other scientific counts conducted in 2012 placed the number at around 32,000 birds. Ecological impact Concerns have been raised over the impact of the growing numbers of parakeets in south-east England. Scientific research programmes have analysed the behaviour of parakeets and found that they compete with native bird species and bats for food and nesting sites. Although not aggressive, parakeets have been shown to deter smaller birds due to their behaviour and noise; their large size means that they often crowd small bird feeders, further increasing competition for resources and disrupting local ecosystems. The detrimental effect of competitive exclusion has been likened to the impact of the introduction of grey squirrel on the red squirrel. However, British parakeets are not without natural predators; ornithologists have observed an increase in the population of birds of prey in London, and have reported sparrowhawks, peregrine falcons and hobbies preying on parakeets. Parakeets are considered a pest in many countries such as Israel, where large swarms of parakeets can have a devastating effect on certain crops, and there is concern that the rapidly growing parakeet population could have unforeseen environmental impact in Britain. In 2009, Governmental wildlife organisation Natural England added feral parakeets to the ‚Äúgeneral licence‚Äù, a list of wild species that can be lawfully culled without the need for specific permission.

Following Mind Games, Blackmon switched to color film, and created the body of work Domestic Vacations.Nordstr√∂m, \\"Interview with Julie Blackmon\\" Its photographs of family life appear at once disorderly and playful and at times impossible. Blackmon says that the images in her series Domestic Vacations recall the tableaux of 17th-century Dutch and Flemish painters, notably the chaotic familial scenes of Jan Steen. Tailored environments and carefully placed props are often a feature of her work. Blackmon‚Äôs most recent monograph of work, Homegrown, picks up where Domestic Vacations left off. Following the same formula developed in Domestic Vacations, Homegrown demonstrates a further refinement of technique in regards to composition and structure. Where the previous collection was set primarily within the confines of the home, Homegrown looks to those places outside the house that are common in one‚Äôs upbringing. The local market, beauty salon and fields behind the house are equally familiar to us and shape our childhood just as much as our homes do.

This idea was widely promoted during the nineteenth century, anticipating the international bodies that would be set up in the twentieth century with comparable aims. History The genesis of the idea of a meeting of representatives of different nations to obtain by peaceful arbitrament a settlement of differences has been traced back as far as 1623 in modern history, to a French monk, √âmeric Cruc√©, who wrote a work entitled \\"The New Cyneas\\", a discourse showing the opportunities and the means for establishing a general peace and liberty of conscience to all the world and addressed to the monarch and the sovereign princes of the time. He proposed that a city, preferably Venice, should be selected where all the powers had ambassadors and that there should be a universal union, including all peoples. He suggested careful arrangement as to priority, giving the first place to the pope. Two years after this publication, in 1625, appeared in Latin the work of Hugo Grotius \\"On the Right of War and Peace\\", pleading for a mitigation of some of the barbarous usages of war. William Penn had a plan for the establishment of a \\"European Dyet, Parliament or Estates\\". He was followed by other writers of different nationalities. The concept of a peaceful community of nations had also been outlined in 1795, when Immanuel Kant‚Äôs Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch outlined the idea of a league of nations that would control conflict and promote peace between states.Skirbekk and Gilje 2001, p. 288 International co-operation to promote collective security originated in the Concert of Europe that developed after the Napoleonic War in the nineteenth century in an attempt to maintain the status quo between European states and so avoid war.Reichard 2006, p. 9Rapoport 1995, pp. 498-500 This period also saw the development of international law with the first Geneva Conventions establishing laws about humanitarian relief during war and the international Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and the peaceful settlement of international disputes.Bouchet-Saulnier, Brav, and Olivier 2007, pp. 14-134Northedge 1986, p. 10 The forerunner of the League of Nations, the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), was formed by peace activists William Randal Cremer and Fr√©d√©ric Passy in 1889. The organization was international in scope with a third of the members of parliament, in the 24 countries with parliaments, serving as members of the IPU by 1914. Its aims were to encourage governments to solve international disputes by peaceful means and arbitration and annual conferences were held to help governments refine the process of international arbitration. The IPU's structure consisted of a Council headed by a President which would later be reflected in the structure of the League. Congresses Vienna After the defeat of Napoleon I of France an international peace congress took place in Vienna called the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The Americas in the nineteenth century In 1826, a congress composed of representatives of Spanish-American countries was planned by Bol√≠var for military as well as political purposes. One of its declared objects was \\"to promote the peace and union of American nations and establish amicable methods for the settlement of disputes between them\\". This congress failed, as only four Spanish-American countries were represented and only one ratified the agreement. In 1831, however, Mexico took up the subject and proposed a conference of American Republics \\"for the purpose of bringing about not only a union and close alliance for defence, but also the acceptance of friendly mediation for the settlement of disputes between them, and the framing and promulgation of a code of penal laws to regulate their mutual relations\\". It does not appear that anything came of this congress, and in 1847 another was held at Lima, attended by representatives of Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, New Granada, and Peru, for the purpose of forming an alliance of American republics. The United States was invited but as it was then at war with Mexico it sent no representative. Another congress was held by representatives from the Argentine Republic, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Peru, and Venezuela, in 1864. An effort to hold a congress was made by the governments of Chile and Colombia in 1880, \\"to the end that the settlement by arbitration of each and every international controversy should become a principle of American public law\\". This congress did not meet, however, owing to a war between Chile and Peru. In 1881, the President of the United States invited the independent countries of North and South America to meet in a general congress at Washington, D.C. on 24 November 1882, \\"for the purpose of considering and discussing methods of preventing war between the nations of America\\". This meeting did not take place owing to a variety of reasons, but subsequently, by virtue of an Act of Congress of the United States an invitation was issued by the president to Mexico, the Central and South American Republics, Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Brazil to join in a conference to be held in the city of Washington, the project being to consider: * (1) measures tending to preserve the peace and promote the prosperity of the South American States; * (2) measures looking to the formation of an American Customs Union; * (3) the establishment of regular and frequent communication between the various countries; * (4) the establishment of a uniform system of customs regulations, invoices, sanitation of ships, and quarantine; * (5) the adoption of a uniform system of weights and measures, and of laws to protect patent rights, copyrights, and trade marks, and for the extradition of criminals; * (6) the adoption of a common silver coin; * (7) the adoption of a definite plan of arbitration of all questions, disputes, and differences; and * (8) such other subjects relating to the welfare of the several States as might be presented by any of them. The First International Conference of American States assembled at Washington on 2 October 1889. Eighteen American nations, including the United States, had their representatives. The conference adopted a plan of arbitration of international differences, together with various recommendations relating to trade, law, extradition, patents, customs, and sanitary regulations. It further declared arbitration to be a principle of American International Law and obligatory \\"in all controversies concerning diplomatic and consular privileges, boundaries, territories, indemnities, the right of navigation, and the validity, construction and enforcement of treaties; and that it should be equally obligatory in all other cases, whatever might be their origin, nature or object, with the sole exception of those which in the judgment of one of the nations involved in the controversy, might imperil its independence; but that even in this case, while arbitration for that nation should be optional, it should be obligatory on the adversary power\\" (7 Moore Int. Law Dig. p. 7). One notable result of the conference was the establishment of the Bureau of the American Republics. All the republics of South America are represented in this bureau, which continues for periods of ten years subject to renewal. American Civil War The Peace Conference of 1861 was a last-ditch effort to avert the coming Civil War. Friends of Peace Following an initial congress at London in 1843, an annual series of congresses called International Congress of the Friends of Peace or more informally \\"International Peace Congress\\" were organised from 1848 until 1853. Elihu Burritt organized the Congress of 1848. The participants met at Brussels in September of that year. Among the distinguished delegates were Cobden, Thierry, Girardin, and Bastiat. The congress adopted resolutions urging limitation of armaments and the placing of a ban upon foreign loans for war purposes. Through the next decade, more congresses were convened in various cities without the development of anything new in principle or method. * 1st congress: London (1843) * 2nd congress: Brussels (1848) * 3rd congress: Paris (1849) * 4th congress: Frankfurt am Main (1850) * 5th congress: London (1851) * 6th congress: Manchester (1852) * 7th congress: Edinburgh (1853) The Hague =First Hague Conference= On 12 August 1898, in a circular letter addressed to the representatives of different nations, the Emperor of Russia proposed to all governments, which had duly accredited representatives at the imperial court, the holding of a conference to consider the problem of the preservation of peace among nations. During the summer of 1900 the conference assembled at The Hague and on 4 September the formal notification of the ratification of the convention for the pacific settlement of international disputes was given by the United States, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Persia, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Siam, Spain, Sweden, Norway, and the Netherlands, and subsequently by Japan. A Permanent Court of Arbitration was established at The Hague, composed representatives of each of the signatory powers appointed for a term of six years. Arbitrators called upon to form a competent tribunal may be chosen from a general list of the members of the court when any of the signatory powers desire to have recourse to the court for a settlement of any difference between them. The South and Central American republics were not represented at the conference, but at the second International Conference of American States which was initiated by President McKinley and held in the City of Mexico, 22 October 1901, to 31 January 1902, a plan was adopted looking to adhesion to The Hague convention, the protocol being signed by all of the delegations except Chile and Ecuador, who subsequently gave their adhesion. The conference authorized the Governments of the United States and Mexico to negotiate with the other signatory powers for the adherence of other American nations. At this conference the project of a treaty for the arbitration of pecuniary claims was adopted, and the signatories agreed for a term of five years to submit to arbitration (preferably to the permanent court at The Hague) all claims for pecuniary loss or damage presented by their respective citizens and not capable of settlement through diplomatic channels, where they were of sufficient importance to warrant the expense of a court of arbitration. =Second Hague Conference= A second international peace conference was held at The Hague from 15 June to 18 October 1907. Forty-four States were represented, including the principal nations of Europe, North and South America, and Asia. The conference drew up thirteen conventions and one declaration. They are as follows: for the pacific settlement of international disputes; respecting the limitation of the employment of force for the recovery of contract debts relative to the opening of hostilities; respecting the laws and customs of war on land; respecting the rights and duties of neutral powers and persons in case of war on land; relative to the status of enemy merchant-ships at the outbreak of hostilities; relative to the conversion of merchant-ships into war-ships; relative to the laying of automatic submarine contact mines; respecting bombardment by naval forces in time of war; for the adaptation to naval war of the principles of the Geneva Convention; relative to certain restrictions with regard to the exercise of the right of capture in naval war; relative to the creation of an International Prize Court; concerning the rights and duties of neutral powers in naval war; and a declaration prohibiting the discharge of projectiles and explosives from balloons. International League of Peace and Liberty The International League of Peace and Liberty organised a series of international peace congresses. * 1st congress: Geneva (1867) * 2nd congress: Bern (1868) * 3rd congress: ... (1873) * 4th congress: ...

On 28 June 1919,Magliveras 1999, pp. 8‚Äì12Northedge 1986, pp. 35‚Äì36 the Covenant was signed by 44 states, including 31 states which had taken part in the war on the side of the Triple Entente or joined it during the conflict. Despite American President Woodrow Wilson's efforts to establish and promote the League, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1919,Levinovitz and Ringertz 2001, p. 170 the United States did not join the League. The League held its first council meeting in Paris on 16 January 1920, six days after the Versailles Treaty came into force.Scott 1973, p. 51 In November, the headquarters of the League moved to Geneva, where the first General Assembly was held on 15 November 1920Scott 1973, p. 67 with representatives from 41 nations in attendance.

Both the flow and quality of water are commonly studied using hydrologic models. MODFLOW, a computational groundwater flow model based on methods developed by the US Geological Survey. Conceptual models Conceptual models are commonly used to represent the important components (e.g., features, events, and processes) that relate hydrologic inputs to outputs. These components describe the important functions of the system of interest, and are often constructed using entities (stores of water) and relationships between these entitites (flows or fluxes between stores). The conceptual model is coupled with scenarios to describe specific events (either input or outcome scenarios). For example, a watershed model could be represented using tributaries as boxes with arrows pointing toward a box that represents the main river. The conceptual model would then specify the important watershed features (e.g., land use, land cover, soils, subsoils, geology, wetlands, lakes), atmospheric exchanges (e.g., precipitation, evapotranspiration), human uses (e.g., agricultural, municipal, industrial, navigation, thermo- and hydro-electric power generation), flow processes (e.g., overland, interflow, baseflow, channel flow), transport processes (e.g., sediments, nutrients, pathogens), and events (e.g., low-, flood-, and mean-flow conditions). Model scope and complexity is dependent on modeling objectives, with greater detail required if human or environmental systems are subject to greater risk. Systems modeling can be used for building conceptual models that are then populated using mathematical relationships.  Analog models  Prior to the advent of computer models, hydrologic modeling used analog models to simulate flow and transport systems. Unlike mathematical models that use equations to describe, predict, and manage hydrologic systems, analog models use non-mathematical approaches to simulate hydrology. Two general categories of analog models are common; scale analogs that use miniaturized versions of the physical system and process analogs that use comparable physics (e.g., electricity, heat, diffusion) to mimic the system of interest.  Scale analogs  Detail of the Mississippi River Basin Model (US Army Corps of Engineers, 2006) Scale models offer a useful approximation of physical or chemical processes at a size that allows for greater ease of visualization. The model may be created in one (core, column), two (plan, profile), or three dimensions, and can be designed to represent a variety of specific initial and boundary conditions as needed to answer a question. Scale models commonly use physical properties that are similar to their natural counterparts (e.g., gravity, temperature). Yet, maintaining some properties at their natural values can lead to erroneous predictions. Properties such as viscosity, friction, and surface area must be adjusted to maintain appropriate flow and transport behavior. This usually involves matching dimensionless ratios (e.g., Reynolds number, Froude number). A two-dimensional scale model of an aquifer. Groundwater flow can be visualized using a scale model built of acrylic and filled with sand, silt, and clay.Humphrey, M.D., 1992. Experimental design of physical aquifer models for evaluation of groundwater remediation strategies (Doctoral dissertation). Water and tracer dye may be pumped through this system to represent the flow of the simulated groundwater. Some physical aquifer models are between two and three dimensions, with simplified boundary conditions simulated using pumps and barriers.  Process analogs  Process analogs are used in hydrology to represent fluid flow using the similarity between Darcy's Law, Ohms Law, Fourier's Law, and Fick's Law. The analogs to fluid flow are the flux of electricity, heat, and solutes, respectively.Principles of Soil and Plant Water Relations https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0124200788 The corresponding analogs to fluid potential are voltage, temperature, and solute concentration (or chemical potential). The analogs to hydraulic conductivity are electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and the solute diffusion coefficient. An early process analog model was an electrical network model of an aquifer composed of resistors in a grid.http://www.isws.illinois.edu/hilites/achieve/images/gwmodded06.jpg Voltages were assigned along the outer boundary, and then measured within the domain. Electrical conductivity paper can also be used instead of resistors.  Statistical models  Statistical models are a type of mathematical model that are commonly used in hydrology to describe data, as well as relationships between data.Beard, Leo R. Statistical methods in hydrology. HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING CENTER DAVIS CA, 1962. Using statistical methods, hydrologists develop empirical relationships between observed variables, find trends in historical data, or forecast probable storm or drought events.Yevjevich, Vujica. Probability and statistics in hydrology. Fort Collins, CO: Water resources publications, 1972.  Moments  Statistical moments (e.g., mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis) are used to describe the information content of data. These moments can then be used to determine an appropriate frequency distribution,Zaharia, L. \\"L-MOMENTS AND THEIR USE IN MAXIMUM DISCHARGES'ANALYSIS IN CURVATURE CARPATHIANS REGION.\\" Aerul si Apa. Componente ale Mediului (2013): 119. which can then be used as a probability model. Two common techniques include L-moment ratios and Moment-Ratio Diagrams. The frequency of extremal events, such as severe droughts and storms, often requires the use of distributions that focus on the tail of the distribution, rather than the data nearest the mean. These techniques, collectively known as extreme value analysis, provide a methodology for identifying the likelihood and uncertainty of extreme events. Examples of extreme value distributions include the Gumbel, Pearson, and Generalized Extreme Value. The standard method for determining peak discharge uses the log-Pearson Type III (log- gamma) distribution and observed annual flow peaks.https://water.usgs.gov/osw/bulletin17b/dl_flow.pdf  Correlation analysis  The degree and nature of correlation may be quantified, by using a method such as the Pearson correlation coefficient, autocorrelation, or the T-test.Helsel, Dennis R., and Robert M. Hirsch. Statistical methods in water resources. Vol. 49. Elsevier, 1992 The degree of randomness or uncertainty in the model may also be estimated using stochastics, or residual analysis. These techniques may be used in the identification of flood dynamics, storm characterization, and groundwater flow in karst systems. Regression analysis is used in hydrology to determine whether a relationship may exist between independent and dependent variables. Bivariate diagrams are the most commonly used statistical regression model in the physical sciences, but there are a variety of models available from simplistic to complex. In a bivariate diagram, a linear or higher-order model may be fitted to the data. Factor Analysis and Principal Component Analysis are multivariate statistical procedures used to identify relationships between hydrologic variables,. Convolution is a mathematical operation on two different functions to produce a third function. With respect to hydrologic modeling, convolution can be used to analyze stream discharge's relationship to precipitation. Convolution is used to predict discharge downstream after a precipitation event. This type of model would be considered a ‚Äúlag convolution‚Äù, because of the predicting of the ‚Äúlag time‚Äù as water moves through the watershed using this method of modeling. Time-series analysis is used to characterize temporal correlation within a data series as well as between different time series. Many hydrologic phenomena are studied within the context of historical probability. Within a temporal dataset, event frequencies, trends, and comparisons may be made by using the statistical techniques of time series analysis.Salas, Jose D. Applied modeling of hydrologic time series. Water Resources Publication, 1980. The questions that are answered through these techniques are often important for municipal planning, civil engineering, and risk assessments. Markov Chains are a mathematical technique for determine the probability of a state or event based on a previous state or event. The event must be dependent, such as rainy weather. Markov Chains were first used to model rainfall event length in days in 1976, and continues to be used for flood risk assessment and dam management.  Conceptual models  Conceptual models represent hydrologic systems using physical concepts. The conceptual model is used as the starting point for defining the important model components. The relationships between model components are then specified using algebraic equations, ordinary or partial differential equations, or integral equations. The model is then solved using analytical or numerical procedures. The Nash Model uses a cascade of linear reservoirs to predict streamflow. Example 1 The linear-reservoir model (or Nash Model) is widely used for rainfall-runoff analysis. The model uses a cascade of linear reservoirs along with a constant first-order storage coefficient, K, to predict the outflow from each reservoir (which is then used as the input to the next in the series). The model combines continuity and storage-discharge equations, which yields an ordinary differential equation that describes outflow from each reservoir. The continuity equation for tank models is: {dS(t) \\\\over dt} = i(t) - q(t) which indicates that the change in storage over time is the difference between inflows and outflows. The storage storage-discharge relationship is: q(t) = S(t)/K where K is a constant that indicates how quickly the reservoir drains; a smaller value indicates more rapid outflow. Combining these two equation yields K {dq \\\\over dt} = i - q and has the solution: A non-linear reservoir used in rainfall-runoff modelling q= i(1-e^{-t/k}) The reaction factor Alpha increases with increasing discharge.Non-linear reservoir model for rainfall-runoff relations Example 2 Instead of using a series of linear reservoirs, also the model of a non-linear reservoir can be used.Rainfall-runoff modelling using a non-linear reservoir In such a model the constant K in the above equation, that may also be called reaction factor, needs to be replaced by another symbol, say Œ± (Alpha), to indicate the dependence of this factor on storage (S) and discharge (q). In the left figure the relation is quadratic: Œ± = 0.0123 q2 \\\\+ 0.138 q - 0.112  Governing equations  Governing equations are used to mathematically define the behavior of the system. Algebraic equations are likely often used for simple systems, while ordinary and partial differential equations are often used for problems that change in space in time. Examples of governing equations include: Manning's equation is an algebraic equation that predicts stream velocity as a function of channel roughness, the hydraulic radius, and the channel slope: v = {k \\\\over n} R^{2/3} S^{1/2} Darcy's Law describes steady, one-dimensional groundwater flow using the hydraulic conductivity and the hydraulic gradient: \\\\vec q = -K abla h Groundwater flow equation describes time-varying, multidimensional groundwater flow using the aquifer transmissivity and storativity: T abla^2 h = S {\\\\partial h \\\\over \\\\partial t} Advection-Dispersion equation describes solute movement in steady, one- dimensional flow using the solute dispersion coefficient and the groundwater velocity: D {\\\\partial^2 C \\\\over\\\\partial x^2} - v {\\\\partial C \\\\over\\\\partial x} = {\\\\partial C \\\\over\\\\partial t} Poiseuille's Law describes laminar, steady, one-dimensional fluid flow using the shear stress: {\\\\partial P \\\\over \\\\partial x} = - \\\\mu {\\\\partial \\\\tau \\\\over \\\\partial y} Cauchy's integral is an integral method for solving boundary value problems: f(a) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\oint_\\\\gamma \\\\frac{f(z)}{z-a}\\\\, dz  Solution algorithms  = Analytic methods = Exact solutions for algebraic, differential, and integral equations can often be found using specified boundary conditions and simplifying assumptions. Laplace and Fourier transform methods are widely used to find analytic solutions to differential and integral equations. = Numeric methods = Many real-world mathematical models are too complex to meet the simplifying assumptions required for an analytic solution. In these cases, the modeler develops a numerical solution that approximates the exact solution. Solution techniques include the finite-difference and finite-element methods, among many others. Specialized software may also be used to solve sets of equations using a graphical user interface and complex code, such that the solutions are obtained relatively rapidly and the program may be operated by a layperson or an end user without a deep knowledge of the system. There are model software packages for hundreds of hydrologic purposes, such as surface water flow, nutrient transport and fate, and groundwater flow. Commonly used numerical models include SWAT, MODFLOW, FEFLOW, and MIKE SHE  Model calibration and evaluation  Observed and modelled runoff using the non-linear reservoir model. Physical models use parameters to characterize the unique aspects of the system being studied. These parameters can be obtained using laboratory and field studies, or estimated by finding the best correspondence between observed and modelled behavior. Between neighbouring catchments which have physical and hydrological similarities, the model parameters varies smoothly suggesting the spatial transferability of parameters. Model evaluation is used to determine the ability of the calibrated model to meet the needs of the modeler. A commonly used measure of hydrologic model fit is the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient.

The 2014 acquisition of Ranbaxy made Sun the largest pharma company in India, the largest Indian pharma company in the US, and the 5th largest speciality generic company globally. Over 72% of Sun Pharma sales are from markets outside India, primarily in the United States. The US is the single largest market, accounting for about 50% turnover; in all, formulations or finished dosage forms, account for 93% of the turnover. Manufacturing is across 26 locations, including plants in the US, Canada, Brazil, Mexico and Israel. In the United States, the company markets a large basket of generics, with a strong pipeline awaiting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Sun Pharma was listed on the stock exchange in 1994 in an issue oversubscribed 55 times. The founding family continues to hold a majority stake in the company. Today Sun Pharma is the second largest and the most profitable pharmaceutical company in India, as well as the largest pharmaceutical company by market capitalisation on the Indian exchanges. The Indian pharmaceutical industry has become the third-largest producer in the world in terms of volumes and is poised to grow into an industry of $36.7 billion from $20 billion in 2015. In terms of value India still stands at number 14 in the world. In 2009 Sun Pharma's Caraco Pharmaceutical's plant in Detroit was closed due to unsanitary conditions resulting in the seizure of $20 million of drugs by the FDA for contamination issues. In December 2016 the FDA sent Sun a warning letter about nine violations at its manufacturing plant in Halol. Sun Pharma requested USFDA to withdraw approval for 28 Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) belonging to its wholly owned subsidiary Ranbaxy Laboratories. Acquisitions and Joint Ventures Sun Pharma has complemented growth with select acquisitions over the last two decades. In 1996, Sun purchased a bulk drug manufacturing plant at Ahmednagar from Knoll Pharmaceuticals and MJ Pharma's dosage plant at Halol that are both U.S. FDA approved today. In 1997, Sun acquired Tamil Nadu Dadha Pharmaceuticals Limited (TDPL) based in Chennai, mainly for their extensive gynaecology and oncology brands. Also in 1997, Sun Pharma initiated their first foray into the lucrative US market with the acquisition of Caraco Pharmaceuticals, based in Detroit. In 1998, Sun acquired a number of respiratory brands from Natco Pharma. Other notable acquisitions include Milmet Labs and Gujarat Lyka Organics (1999), Pradeep Drug Company (2000), Phlox Pharma (2004), a formulation plant at Bryan, Ohio and ICN, Hungary from Valeant Pharma and Able Labs (2005), and Chattem Chemicals (2008). In 2010, the company acquired a large stake in Taro Pharmaceuticals, amongst the largest generic derma companies in US, with operations across Canada and Israel. The company currently owns ~ 69% stake in Taro, for about $260 million. In 2011, Sun Pharma entered into a joint venture with MSD to bring complex or differentiated generics to emerging markets (other than India). In 2012, Sun announced acquisitions of two US companies: DUSA Pharmaceuticals, a dermatology device company; and generic pharma company URL Pharma In 2013, the company announced an R&D; joint venture for ophthalmology with the research company, Intrexon. On 6 April 2014, Sun Pharma announced that it would acquire 100% of Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd, in an all-stock transaction, valued at $4 billion. Japan's Daiichi Sankyo held 63.4% stake in Ranbaxy. After this acquisition, Sun Pharma has become the largest pharmaceutical company in India, the largest Indian Pharma company in US, and the 5th largest generic company worldwide In December 2014, the Competition Commission of India approved Sun Pharma's $3.2 billion bid to buy Ranbaxy Laboratories, but ordered the firms to divest seven products to ensure the deal doesn't harm competition. In March 2015, Sun Pharma announced it had agreed to buy GlaxoSmithKline's opiates business in Australia to strengthen its pain management portfolio. SPARC In 2007, Sun Pharma demerged its innovative R&D; arm, and listed it separately on the stock market as the Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company Ltd. (, ). In 2013, SPARC declared revenue of ‚Çπ873 million. SPARC focuses on new chemical entities (NCE) research and new drug delivery systems and offers an annual update of its pipeline (NDDS). Awards  Sun Pharma stood second in the India's Most Reputed Brands (Pharmaceutical) list in a study conducted by BlueBytes, a leading Media Analytics firm in association with TRA Research, a brand insights organization (both a part of the Comniscient Group).

It ceased operations in 1993. Company history Talair had its origins as Territory Airlines, founded in 1952 as a charter company. It operated to towns throughout the country where the only means of communication was by air. Its bases of operations were Lae and Madang. The aircraft used were small Cessna and Beechcraft types. Territory Airlines was granted scheduled flight rights in 1968 from Goroka. Soon it was serving over 50 destinations in the territory. In 1971 it took over Sepik Air Charters and in 1975 took over MAC Air Charter and now the destinations grew to over 100. The need to fly to all types of destinations forced Territory Airlines to have a very varied fleet, but the mainstay of the fleet were the Britten-Norman Islander and the DHC-6 Twin Otter. In 1975 the name was changed to Talair Tourist Airlines of Niugini and soon it took over Panda Air and the network grew to over 150 destinations. In the late 70's the DeHavilland Canada Twin Otters [DHC-6]and then the Embraer EMB110 aircraft were introduced to Papua New Guinea. In 1986 the DHC-8 was placed into service. By 1990 the fleet had grown to over 50 aircraft but the operating costs of keeping such a varied fleet flying resulted in a reduction of flights. With financial difficulties mounting, on May 25, 1993 TALAIR ceased all flights and the aircraft were transferred to Flight West Airlines of Australia.Airlines Remembered by BI Hengi, Publisher Midland Publishing Fleet details TALAIR operated many different types of aircraft many of which are not listed here. *de Havilland Dragon Rapide *Piper Aztec *Cessna 185 *Cessna 206 *Cessna 336 *Cessna 402 *Beechcraft Baron *Beechcraft Queen Air *Pilatus Porter *Britten-Norman Islander *DHC-6 Twin Otter *Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante *DHC-8 *Cessna Citation External links *Data *TALAIR reunion website *Timetable Images *TALAIR accidents *TALAIR plane photo References Category:Defunct airlines of Papua New Guinea Category:Airlines established in 1952 Category:Airlines disestablished in 1993 Category:Airlines of Papua New Guinea ","title":"Talair"},{"id":"17673431","text":"The Conscience of a Liberal is a 2007 book written by economist and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman. It was 24th on the New York Times Best Seller list in November 2007. The title was used originally in Senator Paul Wellstone's book of the same name in 2001. Wellstone's title was a response to Barry Goldwater's 1960 book The Conscience of a Conservative. In the book, Krugman studies the past 80 years of American history in the context of economic inequality. A central theme is the reemergence of both economic and political inequality since the 1970s. Krugman analyzes the causes behind these events and proposes a \\"new New Deal\\" for America. Synopsis The book is a history of wealth and income gaps in the US in the 20th century. The book documents that the gap between rich and poor declined greatly in mid-century‚Äîhe refers to this as the \\"Great Compression\\"‚Äîthen widened again, starting in the 1980s, to levels higher than those in the 1920s. Most economists‚Äîincluding Krugman himself‚Äîhave regarded the late 20th century divergence as resulting largely from changes in technology and trade, but now Krugman writes‚Äîparticularly in Chapters 1, 3, and 4‚Äîthat government policies‚Äîparticularly the establishment of, and subsequent attacks on, the social safety net or \\"welfare state\\"‚Äîhas played a much greater role both in reducing the gap in the 1930s through 1970s, and in widening it in the 1980s through the present. He talks about the history of American conservatism, both, in Chapter 2, pre-New Deal conservatism‚Äîdominating the period between the American Civil War and the Great Depression (which he calls the \\"Long Gilded Age\\")‚Äîand, in Chapter 6, modern-day \\"movement conservatism\\". He argues‚Äîparticularly in Chapters 5, 6, and 9‚Äîthat the subtle exploitation by movement conservatives of racial and cultural resentments through small-government rhetoric (see \\"dog-whistle politics\\") and of national-security fears were key in the movement's ability to win national elections‚Äîeven though its policies concentrating wealth at the top should be deeply unpopular. He talks extensively, in Chapter 6, about William F. Buckley, Jr.'s, Irving Kristol's and Ronald Reagan's role in building the movement‚Äîand, in Chapters 7 and 8, about the role of \\"institutions [particularly labor unions] and norms [particularly corporate policy]\\"‚Äîvis-√†-vis government policy‚Äîin increasing or decreasing economic inequality. He rebukes the George W. Bush administration for policies that were currently widening the gap between the rich and poor. Nevertheless, Krugman expresses optimism in Chapter 10 that demographic trends‚Äîparticularly on race and culture‚Äîand what he sees as conservative overreach during the Bush years‚Äîare creating a new center-left political environment and are slowly undermining the conservative movement, referencing John Judis and Ruy Texeira's book, The Emerging Democratic Majority. Krugman proposes, in Chapters 11 and 12, that Democrats propose a \\"new New Deal\\", which includes placing more emphasis on social and medical programs‚Äîparticularly universal health care‚Äîand less on national defense.Oct 17 2007- Krugman On Healthcare, Tax Cuts, Social Security, the Mortgage Crisis and Alan Greenspan , in response to Alan Greenspan's Sept 24 appearance with Naomi Klein on Democracy Now! Finally, in Chapter 13, he talks about what it means to be a \\"liberal\\", about the rise in new progressive organizations‚Äîwhich, unlike conservative think tanks, publications and other organizations, are actually more de- centralized and independent-thinking‚Äîand how many more people appear to support \\"liberal\\" policies than are prepared to use that word to describe themselves. The book concludes with advice that, for the time being, liberals must be partisans until both major political parties accept the rationality of the New Deal.Krugman, The Conscience of a Liberal, 272-273 Reviews and critiques The book received praise mixed with criticism of partisanship from outlets such as The New York Review of Books,November 22, 2007- Tomansky, Michael The Partisan and was criticized by conservative groups and the libertarian Ludwig von Mises Institute, who argued it was overly political and weak on economic content. Related information The Conscience of a Liberal is also the title of Krugman's economics and politics blog, hosted by The New York Times since 2005.Paul Krugman:Welcome,The Conscience of a Liberal, September 17, 2005 A paperback edition of The Conscience of a Liberal was released in January 2009.

Panic at Fort Beggs  Rev. Beggs' cabin was converted to a fort on a Thursday when logs from Rev. Beggs' barn and shed were used for a makeshift breastwork around the cabin and the entire structure housed 125 individuals.Le Baron 1878, p. 480 Rev. Beggs later explained their dire situation if attacked: > We had four guns, some useless for shooting purposes. Ammunition was scarce. > All of our pewter spoons, basins, and platters were soon molded by the women > into bullets. As a next best means of defense, we got a good supply of axes, > hoes, forks, sharp sticks, and clubs...Beggs 1868, p. 99 By Sunday a group from Chicago being led by Captain Naper and composed of both settlers and Native Americans had come to rescue them. On Monday, the group had split up with some reconnoitering along the Fox River and the others (mostly Native Americans), led by Mr. Lorton (possibly David LawtonMatson 1878, p. 191.), going to meet up with General Brown, Colonel Hamilton and their men near Aurora, Illinois. This never happened because they were captured en route but the Native Americans were \\"on good terms with Black Hawk\\" and were allowed to go free.

It rises to 400 m (1312 ft) from the lower slopes of the Epynt.  Etymology and forestation  As the name suggests, the hill was covered in trees at one point but like many hills across the country, deforestation took place. Conifer plantations which border Mynydd Fforest have allowed a few European larches, and Sitka spruce to take root. Apart from large areas of moorland, small areas of Mynydd Fforest have been re-taken by native trees, such as mountain ash, sessile oak, holly, hazel, hawthorn, blackthorn, and ash. There are numerous springs and marshes which are home to newts, frogs, and toads. Many species of bird nest in the bracken also, the skylark especially. Buzzards and red kites have been spotted circling the hill on many occasions. Due to the springs and tributaries crossing the paths at different points, there are a few fords along the way. Unfortunately, due to the construction of the controversial Gas Pipeline from Milford Haven to Gloucester, the path to Brechfa Pool has been cut off and must be crossed by going through gates. Before the construction of the pipeline, one could walk over a very wide area, keeping erosion quite low, but as there is now fence surrounding the pipeline, gates have been set up to allow access to other areas beyond Mynydd Fforest, although there are few gates, so, while in the past people and vehicles were spread over a wide area, they have been funneled into few gates, increasing erosion and habitat loss. Illegal mountain biking has also caused disturbance to skylarks nesting in the bracken. There is still sheep grazing on Mynydd Fforest and there are often ponies to be seen roaming around as well, although these are not wild. The bracken is cut down during August‚ÄìNovember to be used as bedding for livestock during the winter.

Originally built in the 18th century it was remodelled by architect William Murray in 1842 for the second earl of Charlemont. Wings were added of one bay and two storeys over a basement, running the full length of the original block; these were in Murray's rather restrained Italianate style. The original block was given triangular window pediments and similar features so as to match the new wings. The entrance was moved round to the side of one of these wings, which became the new entrance front consisting of three bays with a low portico. The result was a house in the style of a French ch√¢teau. A conservatory, by Richard Turner, was added between c. 1850 and 1855.Dictionary of Irish Architects 1720 - 1940, Irish Architectural Archive In 1864 the third Earl began further remodelling, with some fitting being installed from the family's Dublin home, Charlemont House.

History \\"I Love You\\" was written by Chris White, who indicated: \\"The thing that came first was the riff. That was the root of writing that one. In actual fact I think I nicked it off Tommy Roe\\".Chris White, in Claes Johansen, The Zombies: Hung up on a Dream: A Biography 1962-1967 (SAF Publishing Ltd, 2001):137. It was recorded by the British pop band The Zombies on 8 July 1965 at Decca Studios.Claes Johansen, The Zombies: Hung up on a Dream: A Biography 1962-1967 (SAF Publishing Ltd, 2001):136. It was released in August 1965 as the B-side to \\"Whenever You're Ready\\" in the UK (Decca 45 F 12225), USA (Parrot 45-PAR 9786), Japan (London HIT-547), the Netherlands (1968: Decca AT 15106), Italy (Decca F 12225), Sweden (Decca F 12225), Turkey (London F 12225), Japan (1967: London TOP 1167), and the Philippines (London F 12225). The single failed to make the Billboard Hot 100 in the US and the UK Singles Chart and achieved only limited chart success in other countries. Daniel Williams speculates that: \\"Perhaps, as happened to sixties groups desperately looking to rediscover a magic formula, some fatal hesitancy was exhibited about which side of a single was which; ‚ÄòI Love You‚Äô's structural inversion of chorus and verse makes it both a dramatic and memorably harmonic B side, trumping ‚ÄòWhenever You‚Äôre Ready‚Äô's more traditional delights and wig-out organ\\". In 1966 \\"I Love You\\" was included in an album that is now known as the I Love You album that was only released in the Netherlands and Japan. After the popularity of \\"I Love You\\" and two other Zombies songs in the Philippines, The Zombies sold out 10 concerts at the Araneta Coliseum in Cubao, near Manila, in March 1967. Soon after their return from the Philippines, their contract with Decca lapsed and, although they recorded a further LP, Odessey and Oracle, for their new record label CBS in the summer of 1967, the band disbanded once that album was finished (and before its 1968 release in the UK and US). However, after the chart success of the cover version of \\"I Love You\\" by American band People!, in mid-June 1968 Decca reissued The Zombies' original version in the UK, backed with \\"The Way I Feel Inside\\" (Decca F12798). However, it again failed to chart. Cover versions English =People!

In 1968 Capitol released People!'s version in Mexico (Capitol 6353); Australia (Capitol 1729); Canada (Capitol 2078), where it reached No.7 in May 1968; Brazil, backed with \\"1000 Years B.C.\\" (written by Larry Norman and Robb Levin) (Capitol 7C-11072); France (Capitol CLF 2078); Germany (Capitol 23827); Japan (Capitol CR -1960); United Kingdom (Capitol 15553); and Singapore (Capitol CL-15553).

According to the liner notes of the 2006 Best of People! Volume 1 album, People!'s version of \\"I Love You\\" could have topped the US national charts if not for industry rivalries: > \\"It was No.1 in Japan. It was big everywhere.

After the release of their single \\"I Love You\\", People! toured extensively, appearing three times on Dick Clark's American Bandstand, and also on Johnny Carson's The Tonight Show. Billboard ranked People!'s version as No.53 in their top 100 songs for 1968, while it was ranked #75 in the Cashbox annual charts. The success of People!'s version of \\"I Love You\\" frustrated The Zombies. According to Zombies member Colin Blunstone: \\"That was a bit of a heartbreaker. It wasn't a favourite song of mine to be absolutely honest, but it was a little disappointing that we were struggling so hard\\".Colin Blunstone, in Claes Johansen, The Zombies: Hung up on a Dream: A Biography 1962-1967 (SAF Publishing Ltd, 2001):137.

It was established in 1856 opened at the request of the Archbishop of Agra. It was established by five nuns headed by Mother St. Gonzaga Bergonhoux. The school is located at 128 Haider Road, Sialkot Cantt 51300. House System:Blue House (Service) Red House ( Unity) Yellow House (Discipline) Green House ( Faith) HISTORY The first Catholic school in the Punjab was the Convent of Jesus and Mary, Sialkot, which was opened at the request of the Archbishop of Agra, His Lordship, Msgr. Michael Angelo Jacobi. Msgr. Jacobi seeing the need for a good educational establishment for young girls, informed the Provincial Superioress of the Convent at Agra of his desires, and invited her to open a foundation in Sialkot and extend the good works of the Congregation of Jesus and Mary already established in the United Provinces of Oudh and Agra. In December 1855 five Sisters left Sardanha for Sialkot, via Lahore, accompanied by the good Archbishop himself. Mother St. Gonzaga Bergonhoux was named superior. Accompanying her were, Mother St. Chrysostom Gubbins, Mother St. Macaire Dervieux, Mary St. Patrick O‚ÄôSullivan and Mary St. Veronica Reghilini. It was a long, wearisome and dangerous journey from Sardanha to Sialkot in those days, but the zeal of the tiny Congregation was not to be daunted by dusty roads and difficulty journeys. The bullock-cart had rough wooden wheels and no springs, and it broke down frequently on the bad roads, a route of about . They traveled at night since the midday sun was too hot. Meals were taken at small villages on the way, with rice and milk being the daily food. Eggs were a treat on occasion. What must have been most dreaded were long stretches of road at night, where forests came to the edge of some roads, and these were infested by wild beasts and even by bandits. But hardships and perils did not affect the valiant group at all. Reaching Lahore was quite an achievement, but there was still another 80 or 90 miles to go. The party of Sisters and the Archbishop finally arrived in Sialkot on February 15, 1856. The first community consisted of 5 nuns and 3 possible postulants. Thus was begun the first Convent of Jesus and Mary in the Punjab. The house had no surplus furniture. There was a total absence of anything extra, which might mean ease or comfort. They were really poor. This austerity did not dampen their zeal. We quote from an account by Archbishop Jacobi describing the beginnings of the apostolic works. ‚ÄúWith Mother St. Gonzaga at the helm, work was begun to ready the place for boarders and day scholars. One can well imagine this dynamic missionary together with her willing group preparing a fit place in which to receive needy children of the district and to serve them. Parents were informed of the importance of sending their daughters to school. Visits were made to the homes. It took time for many to grow accustomed to the idea that girls should attend school. Finally the day arrived for the opening of school and the nuns thought of the work so dear to the heart of their Foundress, ‚Äúto train souls for heaven by imparting a truly good education.‚Äù The work progressed well. The children came in slowly, but they did come, and soon the house was full. With joy all looked forward to a new year when the work would progress even further, but there were growing signs that all was not well. Shadows of an uprising were spreading all over. The first shots were fired on July 9, 1857 and the Sisters went on to suffer the terrors of the Indian Mutiny or the First War of Independence.http://www.cjm-pakistan.com/slkt.html In 2019 Sr. Mary Langan (RJM) a former principal celebrated 50 years as a religious sister.The Christian Voice, Karachi May 5, 2019  References  External links *http://www.cjm-pakistan.com/slkt.html Category:Educational institutions established in 1856 Category:Academic institutions in Pakistan Category:Schools in Punjab, Pakistan Category:Catholic Church in Pakistan Category:1856 establishments in India ","title":"Convent of Jesus and Mary, Sialkot"},{"id":"17673969","text":"Marco Krainer Marco Krainer (Marco Wolfgang Krainer) (born October 4, 1981 in Linz, Upper Austria) is an Austrian specialty chef who, among other things, works as a TV and Radio chef. Krainer grew up in Carinthia, Austria's most southern province, where he also currently resides. In Carinthia, he attended the Culinary and Tourism Technical College in Oberwollanig by Villach, the same institution his colleague, Wolfgang Puck attended, who has become one of the most famous chefs in the United States. Early on, Krainer became interested in public broadcast programs, which dealt with nutrition issues, particularly ‚ÄúHobbythek‚Äù in the German Broadcast Station WDR. After an initial interview with the moderators, Jean P√ºtz and Sabine Fricke as well as the editorial staff, they became interested in Krainer. Shortly thereafter, in February 2002, the first invitation came from the WDR Studio in Cologne, Germany. At first, Krainer was responsible for research and development of the recipes. Later, it was decided to give him time in front of the camera as ‚ÄúHobbythek-Chef‚Äù. He is busy as show-chef for meetings, presentations, food shows and cooking classes. The unusual concept of ‚ÄúCooking on the Radio‚Äù became very successful. On the Austrian regional Broadcast ORF Radio Carinthia, Krainer regularly cooks live in the studio. Listeners can get cooking tips and follow exact recipes on the internet. In 2004 he presented to the audience an erotic menu during his debut at the TV station VOX (Hamburg, Germany) in the erotic magazine ‚ÄúWa(h)re Liebe‚Äù (True love or love for sale) with Lilo Wanders whose program has achieved cult status. Krainer has devoted himself to the theme ‚ÄúCulinary Art of the USA‚Äù. During his first trip to the US he became aware of the prejudices about the eating habits of the Americans. Krainer who has connections to the United States and has traveled there extensively, very emphatically overcomes these prejudices. Krainer's primary focus is on the US-American, Austrian, Italian and Asian cuisine. Because of his partiality to pumpkins, he had his own Hobbythek pumpkin program filmed in Krainer's private pumpkin patch in Austria.

This lineup consisted of Martin Lee, Lee Sheriden, Nicky Stevens and Sandra Stevens and was to be the main lineup of the group's history and would hold for the next ten albums.  Background  This album was released in September 1974 on the Dawn label. It featured the singles \\"When Love Catches Up on You\\", \\"Lady\\", \\"Lady Lady Lady Lay\\" and \\"Spring of 1912\\". None of these found success in the UK, although the single \\"Lady\\" was a hit in the Netherlands and Belgium. During recording sessions for the album in August 1974, member Lee Sheriden came up with a song called \\"Save Your Kisses for Me\\". The others disliked the title and reworked it into \\"Oceans of Love\\". Dissatisfied with the changes, Sheriden shelved the song and it was ultimately left off the album. The song was later reused the following year.Lee Sheriden on stage, Becon Theatre, Beaconsfield, 23 March 2007 The album was produced by the group's manager, Tony Hiller. The songs on the album were of a more diverse nature to the pure pop the group would later become famous for, with themes including a song about prostitution (\\"Lady\\"), open air sex (\\"Movin' With Susan\\") and a real-life tragedy (\\"Spring of 1912\\"). Many tracks featured a soul-based sound, although pure pop was present on songs such as \\"Do-Be-Do\\" and \\"Have You Been a Good Boy\\". Other notable tracks included a cover of The Hollies' \\"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother\\", which showcased the group's harmonies and was a song they'd performed in their live shows. Member Nicky Stevens has said that this is her favourite recording with the group. They also performed this song before the Queen at a televised charity show in 1976. A reissue of Good Things Happening was released on Compact disc for the first time in May 2009.

It first aired on July 19, 2007 in the United States on AMC and was written by creator Matthew Weiner and directed by Alan Taylor. \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\" was budgeted at US$3 million. Production for the episode took place in New York City and Los Angeles. Weiner conceived of the script in 2000 while working as a writer for the television sitcom Becker. Before writing the pilot episode, he studied American literature and cinema of the 1950s and 1960s to get a perspective on American culture during that period. Weiner sent the script to The Sopranos creator David Chase, who recruited Weiner to work with him on The Sopranos. Weiner shelved the project for seven years to focus on Chase's program; interest for Mad Men did not surface until the conclusion of The Sopranos final season. According to the Nielsen Media Research, the episode attained a rating of 1.4 (1.2 million households) upon initial airing. Plot In 1960, in Manhattan, Don Draper (Jon Hamm), creative director for the advertising agency Sterling Cooper, is facing professional adversity: how to effectively advertise cigarettes in light of the growing public awareness to the dangers of smoking and new government regulations prohibiting the use of any health claims. He seeks input from customers and his girlfriend Midge Daniels (Rosemarie DeWitt), but is unable to find a solution. He rejects academic research results provided by the company's consulting psychologist that suggests some customers will be drawn to smoking despite the health risks because of a collective \\"death wish\\". Meanwhile, Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) starts work at Sterling Cooper as Don's secretary, where she experiences some sexual harassment. She seems excited to be working in Manhattan, but perhaps overwhelmed by her new surroundings. Office manager Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks) advises Peggy on how to be appealing to the men of the office so as to achieve both success in her career and possibly an advantageous marriage. Junior account executive Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) makes boorish comments about Peggy's appearance and clothing, for which Don rebukes him. On her break, Peggy attends a doctor's appointment arranged by Joan, during which she undergoes a vaginal examination and is given a prescription for the recently introduced oral contraceptive, Enovid, which at the time was only supposed to be prescribed to married women with their husband's consent. Later in the day, Peggy makes a sexually inviting gesture to Don, which he rejects. Don and Roger Sterling (John Slattery) meet with Rachel Menken (Maggie Siff), the Jewish owner of a large department store. In order to make Rachel more positively-inclined towards the agency, Roger enlists the only Jew in the company, a young man from the mailroom, to attend the meeting disguised as a member of the art department. Don initially thought the man was the owner, not Rachel. Rachel, looking to attract wealthier customers, is disappointed by the agency's suggestions of coupons to attract frugal housewives. The meeting becomes heated, with Don angry that a woman would talk to him in a commanding way, and Rachel angry that the men have not respected her plans for her business. A later meeting with executives from Lucky Strike tobacco company also appears to go badly, as Don still struggles to find a new approach to cigarette advertising. Pete raises the \\"death wish\\" idea put forth by the company's research, but the executives reject this. Just when it seems that the meeting is over, Don comes up with a new tagline‚Äî\\"It's toasted!\\"‚Äîand a strategy that highlights their method of preparation, which, although it's no different from that of other cigarettes, he proposes will make Lucky Strikes stand out in the minds of the public. The client is impressed, but after the meeting Don expresses his fury with Pete for having gone through his trash to steal the research data. Don meets Rachel for dinner to make amends for the meeting. During the dinner, Don says he is living life to extract the maximum amount of pleasure as there is no tomorrow, while Rachel recognizes in Don the element of the disconnected outsider, for whom the world is laid out like a puzzle waiting to be solved. The two of them begin to bond, and she agrees to give Sterling Cooper another shot. Meanwhile, Pete and some of his co-workers go to a gentlemen's club to celebrate Pete's impending wedding. There, a woman rejects Pete's advances. Dejected from this rejection and Don's recent criticisms, Pete arrives drunk at Peggy's apartment, and she allows him in. Don takes a train to a large house in the suburbs, where he is greeted by his loving wife Betty (January Jones), whom he has made no mention of thus far in the episode. He checks on their two sleeping children as she watches admiringly from the doorway. Production Conception Creator Matthew Weiner conceived the script for \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\" in 2000, while he was working as a writer for the sitcom Becker. The first draft of the episode was written as a spec script and was titled \\"The Division\\". Two years later, Weiner sent the script to David Chase, the creator of The Sopranos, although Weiner's agents insisted that he not proceed with his plans. Chase later recruited him upon first glance. \\"It was what you‚Äôre always hoping to see,\\" he recalled. \\"It was lively and it had something new to say. Here was someone who had written a story about advertising in the 1960s, and was looking at recent American history through that prism.\\" Weiner set the pilot script aside for the next seven years to focus on The Sopranos. Neither HBO nor Showtime expressed interest in the project until the commencement of The Sopranos final season. During that time, AMC began looking into the television market for new programming. \\"The network was looking for distinction in launching its first original series,\\" according to AMC Networks president Ed Carroll, \\"and we took a bet that quality would win out over formulaic mass appeal.\\" Prior to writing the pilot episode, Weiner studied American culture during the 1950s and 1960s, analyzing literary works such as The Feminine Mystique (1963) and Sex and the Single Girl (1962) while viewing such films as The Apartment (1960) and A Guide for the Married Man (1967). He continued his endeavors when the series' concept began to materialize, as he received a copy of Richard Yates' novel Revolutionary Road (1962) from the executives of AMC. Weiner discussed the look of Mad Men with production designer Bob Shaw and cinematographer Phil Abraham, whom Weiner had previously collaborated with in The Sopranos. Abraham wanted to establish a more genuine approach to portraying society in the 1960s, rather than \\"simply referencing the period as seen in movies of that time. We wanted to be more genuine than that. Movies were an influence.\\" In evoking historical accuracy of elements such as architecture and graphic design, Abraham sought inspiration from the buildings designed by the architecture firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. He said, \\"We noticed that in all the Skidmore, Owings & Merrill designs of contemporary buildings, the ceiling‚Äîthe overhead grid of lights‚Äîwas a strong graphic element in all the office spaces. In one design we loved, the whole ceiling was like a lightbox. It was a time of high modernism, and we embraced the notion of presenting the world in that way. These were new work spaces‚Äîsleek, not stuffy.\\" Casting Hamm (pictured) was chosen to portray Don Draper, out of 80 other candidates. Jon Hamm was cast as Don Draper, the central character of the series. Hamm, who was relatively unknown at the time, competed with 80 other actors in the auditioning process. Weiner proclaimed that Hamm accurately portrayed the character, saying that he was \\"the only person who really had this great mix of empathy and masculinity and intelligence. Both Don and Jon have an inner life. So long as you have that kind of depth in a human being, people will root for him [...] Jon walked out of the room and I said, 'That guy has lived.'\\" Hamm admitted that he felt that he had a considerable disadvantage compared to his peers and initially believed Thomas Jane would acquire the role. \\"I started, literally, on the very, very bottom,\\" he iterated. \\"I couldn't have had less heat on me. Nobody knew who I was. The casting directors didn't know who I was. I wasn't on anybody's lists. The funny thing was, I think they went to Thomas Jane for it, and they were told that Thomas Jane does not do television.\\" Hamm went through seven auditions; his last one took place at the Hotel Gansevoort in the Meatpacking District of New York City. \\"When we were riding down on the elevator, the woman in charge of whatever the decision-making process was told me, 'You got the job.'\\" John Slattery, who was later cast as Roger Sterling, originally auditioned to portray Don Draper. Slattery felt Don was the show's biggest draw and was disappointed upon hearing of his character's sparse screen time. He recalled, \\"I really did prepare the thing and went in and I worked hard on it and then read for Don and they actually gave me adjustments and I went and I did it again. And then they sort of said, 'Well, look, here‚Äôs the deal. We have a guy. The reason we asked you to come in and read for Draper is because we didn't think that you‚Äôd come in a read for Roger because there wasn‚Äôt that much Roger in the script.'\\" During production of \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,\\" Slattery admitted he was unsure of whether to continue working on Mad Men. \\"I was on the fence a little bit, even while shooting it. And I think Matt finally was like, 'Look man, we‚Äôre not jerking you around here. We‚Äôre serious about this and I‚Äôve really thought this out. I promise you this will be a great character and it will be a big part of the show.'\\" Producers of Mad Men approached January Jones to portray Betty Draper, Don's wife and the mother of their two children. Jones avouched that portraying the character would give the audience an opportunity to see a dark side of her nature. She initially auditioned for the role of Peggy Olson, which was later given to fellow cast member Elisabeth Moss. \\"It got down between Elisabeth Moss and myself, and it was obviously more suited to her, but Matthew had said, you know, there‚Äôs this other role, of the wife.\\" Jones signed a seven-year contract with the show, although her character originally had two lines in \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes.\\" Weiner eventually edited the script to accommodate her desires. \\"It‚Äôs such a testament to his ability,\\" Jones stated. \\"He just took something out of thin air, which makes me think now that he had to have had an idea that the wife was going to be part of the show, because I kind of took the job with the promise that Betty would be a part of the show. When you sign a seven-year contract, you want to make sure you‚Äôre in the show.\\" Christina Hendricks was brought in to play Joan Holloway, the office manager and head of Sterling Cooper's secretarial pool. While Hendricks had previously made recurring appearances on ER before being on Mad Men, her acting career had been largely inactive, and Hendricks' agent urged her not to participate in the project. \\"They said to me, 'AMC [...] doesn't have any other big shows‚Äîwhy would you do this instead of taking something that's a better bet?' I said, 'Look, I've gone with the one that's the better bet in the past‚Äîlet's go with the really good script this time.'\\" \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\" features guest appearances from several actors and actresses, including Rosemarie DeWitt (as Midge) and Maggie Siff (as Rachel Menken). DeWitt was given a recurring role in the season as Don's mistress, which lasted for six episodes. She initially felt out of place while playing out her character. DeWitt stated, \\"They were at the end of casting, and hadn't found the right Midge yet. Originally they had a scene where she opens the door wearing a red kimono, and I remember thinking 'I'm not that', so I wasn‚Äôt sure I was right for the part. Maybe the fact that I wasn't this 'vamp' is what made Matt Weiner give me a shot.\\" Prior to working on Mad Men, Siff mainly worked in theatre and performing arts. Filming \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\" was budgeted at US$3 million, slightly more than the US$2‚Äì2.5 million budgeted in typical Mad Men episodes. The pilot episode was mostly shot at various locations in and around New York City including the Silvercup Studios, where principal photography lasted for two days. Most of the production crew were previously part of The Sopranos. After filming concluded in New York, production moved to the Los Angeles Center Studios. Abraham collaborated with an entirely different production crew from the one in New York. According to Abraham, Los Angeles contained a continuity that was related to the show. \\"Once we moved to L.A., there was a continuity of style that came from Alan and me, and that was important to Matt [Weiner].\\" In creating a practical effect, a grid consisting of fluorescent lights was installed onto the set that housed Sterling Cooper's main office. The show's art department bought several 2-by-2 four-tube fixtures, which was determined to be accurate relative to the time period. The shipments arrived on the first day of filming the pilot. However, examination by the set-lighting crew revealed the lightbulbs used were internally modernized, having been designed to hold T-8 bulbs measuring two feet each. \\"Getting more than 800 2-foot color-corrected T-8 tubes became a major issue, and none of the regular suppliers had enough in stock,\\" recalled Mike Ambrose, the gaffer for the production team in Los Angeles. \\"Movietone stopped production of whatever bulbs it was making, retooled the plant and started manufacturing the T-8s we needed. The last shipment arrived the morning of our first day of shooting.\\" Abraham created a light-control system in an attempt to keep the overhead from being unflattering. However, after unsuccessfully attempting to implement the necessary wiring to control each light, the production team established controlling rows of light. Pat O'Mara, the key grip during production, installed several 2x1 and 2x2 blackout panels and frames that were retrofitted with small albeit strong magnets. During a scene when and actor or actresses stood under a fluorescent light, a panel or a frame was placed over the fixture, subsequently diffusing light onto their faces. \\"If somebody was walking through the office in a wide shot, I just turned the overhead lights on. But if Don was talking to someone at his desk and the office was the backdrop, I turned all the lights on and then selectively removed some; then, I brought the key around with Kino Flo Image 80s through 4-by-8 frames of 250 or 216, or sourced my key with a larger Fresnel through the window.\\" The set containing Sterling Cooper's corporate offices contained skypans fitted with 5K bulbs onto the centers, which measured 8 inches apart. Ambrose collaborated with the production team to institute twenty-five inch trusses on chain motors and to devise dollys with Arri Alexa cameras that were eventually installed on aluminum I-beams. Ambrose proclaimed that the flexibility of the trolleys and chain motors enabled production to move more efficiently in concentrating on the design of the window. He added: \\"We also had four 20Ks and a few more T-12s on stands that could be rolled around the office floor. For tungsten close-ups, we often used Barger-Baglite six- and three-light units with Chimeras, soft cloth, diaper baffles and 60- and 90-degree honeycomb grids for control.\\" In comparison, Ambrose used traditional lighting when creating the housing for the character, as he favored the color spectrum of a household lightbulb. For example, Don's home required four to five rooms to be lit simultaneously. \\"We used a lot of batten strips with 100-watt household bulbs,\\" noted Ambrose. \\"The bulbs are so close they're almost touching, so they create a single source that doesn't cast multiple shadows. Over time, we built housings for them with channels into which you can slide diffusion frames or egg crates. We call them 'Whiteys' because the guy who knocked these shells out of tin back in New York was named Whitey; I used them extensively on The Sopranos and felt they suited the homes in Mad Men as well.\\" Reception Controversy In the days leading to the \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\" premiere, the watchdog group Commercial Alert filed a complaint against producers to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. Commentators from the group criticized distillery brand Jack Daniel's for its decision to sponsor Mad Men, citing that it violates industry codes that prohibit alcohol marketing, as well as \\"depictions of irresponsible drinking, overt sexual activity or sexually lewd images\\". Robert Weissman, the director for Commercial Alert, stated that based on AMC's website, \\"it appears that the sponsorship arrangement will violate numerous provisions of the industry's self-regulatory marketing code.\\" He continued: \\"There is no reason why a company should be able to escape normal enforcement and implementation of the Code simply because it chooses to violate the code in such brazen manner that curing the violation would cause non-trivial complications for a major television series.\\" In association with the complaint, Weissman urged in his letter that the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States become more proactive in regulating the distilleries' initiatives in the entertainment industry. \\"Our complaint in this instance is not with the portrayal of heavy alcohol consumption, or even with the glorification of such heavy consumption; it is specific to industry sponsorship of and entwinement with such portrayals. Quite different issues are raised where artists choose to depict such activities in the absence of industry sponsorship.\\" Ratings and critical response \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\" was originally broadcast on July 19, 2007 in the United States on AMC. Upon airing, the episode achieved a 1.4 rating (1.2 million households) according to the Nielsen Media Research. Total viewership was 75 percent higher than all television programming airing on Thursdays on AMC. Television commentators praised the pilot episode. Heather Havrilesky of Salon declared that \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\" raised expectations for future competition at the time, and added that it emulated some of the best episodes of The Sopranos. Chicago Tribune journalist Maureen Ryan said that it was an \\"intelligently made character drama\\". In his four star review, Adam Buckman of New York Post described it as \\"stunning\\" and suggested that Mad Men \\"just happens to be the finest new TV series of the summer and possibly the entire year\\". Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle and Brian Lowry of Variety lauded the episode for its historical accuracy; \\"Just because they're on the cusp of a new decade does not mean they can see what viewers already know is around the corner,\\" stated Goodman. \\"That impending change gives an extra dimension of perspective to the series.\\" Lowry addressed that despite the subtle approach of Mad Men, it managed to provoke a profound meaning. \\"In that context, the show illustrates that period's own form of excess without wagging fingers, while reminding us that before sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, there was sexual harassment, free-flowing cocktails and bluesy ballads, invariably sung by white guys.\\" USA Today writer Robert Bianco echoed synonymous sentiment: \\"Mad Men is a joy to watch‚Äîthe clothes, the clocks, the furniture, it's like a mid-century night's dream. But this is no mere period piece. It's a smart, complex drama that attempts to get through the facades that have always hidden the truth.\\" Troy Patterson of Slate drew comparisons to the HBO comedy-drama Sex and the City, and affirmed that it introduced a lewd and cynical perspective of the so-called \\"golden age\\" of advertisement. Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker concluded that \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\" was \\"smart and tremendously attractive\\", while Seattle Post- Intelligencer journalist Melanie McFarland felt that it was a rarity compared to other television installments. Writing for the Boston Globe, Matthew Gilbert remarked that the setting and design were immediately distinguishable. Gilbert wrote, \\"This is a gorgeously fashioned period piece, from its IBM typewriters and rotary phones to the constant fog of cigarette smoke hanging over every scene. The show has a subtle color palette, to match the ivory metal Venetian blinds at the Sterling Cooper ad agency offices, but it may sit in your memory as if it had been filmed in black and white.\\" Citing its authenticity as an episode highlight, Randy Cordova from the Arizona Republic noted that \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\" was well-constructed. Some critics were less enthusiastic than the general consensus. Although The New Republic Sacha Zimmerman stated that the episode's aesthetic features were comparable to cinematic works, she affirmed that Mad Men lacked any substance, ultimately criticizing the cultural references and the character development presented in the episode. Mad Men seems to be attempting satire without a plan,\\" Zimmerman said. \\"The mood is serious, not campy, and there aren't laugh-out-loud moments, just a lot of groaners‚Äîat which point, the show simply becomes a reflection of its characters: depressing. It turns out that watching moody, cruel men and unsatisfied, put-upon women for an hour just isn't that much fun.\\" Similarly, Tim Shale of The Washington Post concluded that despite the evocative nature of the program, \\"Smokes Gets in Your Eyes\\" fell flat; \\"The people in and around them spoil the show, gum up the works and shatter veracity.\\" To New York John Leonard, the installment felt like a \\"fifties leftover\\". Commentators praised the performances of several cast members, specifically Hamm's portrayal of Don Draper. Goodman asserted that the acting from the cast members was one of the aspects that carried the show. Gilbert evaluated that Hamm played his character to \\"slick perfection\\".

Smith  Facts  The plaintiff, Henry Chadwick (Ellen Chadwick suing as administratrix of the estate of her late husband Henry Chadwick who had died in 1962) was described as a cheerful man who was very active in his local community and ran a successful window cleaning business. Though he had suffered in 1941 with psycho-neurotic symptoms, in following years he suffered no such symptoms. Chadwick and his wife lived 200 yards from the site of the Lewisham rail crash and upon hearing of the incident Chadwick went immediately to the site to assist and remained there until 6am the following day. Due to his small stature Chadwick was able to climb inside the wreckage to assist those who were trapped or injured inside. A key witness to this incident referred to only as Mrs Taylor who was trapped inside of the wreckage described the scene as a \\"sea of bodies\\", though she also described Chadwick as being \\"a most courageous man, very cheerful and encouraging, who allayed the fears of those around\\". Having assisted at a site of the Lewisham rail crash, Chadwick had become ill with anxiety disorder and required hospital treatment. He was no longer able to work and no longer took any interest or pleasure in activities which he had once been highly involved. He died in 1962 for causes unrelated to the accident. His personal representatives had sued the British Railways Board, which had negligently caused the accident.  Judgment  The Court found in favour of the plaintiff for the following reasons: #It was reasonably foreseeable in the event of such an accident as had occurred that someone other than defendants‚Äô servants might try to rescue passengers and might suffer injury in the process; accordingly defendants owed a duty of care towards Mr Chadwick. #Injury by shock to a rescuer, physically unhurt, was reasonably foreseeable, and the fact that the risk run by a rescuer was not exactly the same as that run by a passenger did not deprive the rescuer of his remedy. #Damages were recoverable for injury by shock notwithstanding that the shock was not caused by the injured person‚Äôs fear for his own safety or for the safety of his children; #As a man who had lived a normal busy life in the community with no mental illness for 16 years, there was nothing in Mr Chadwick‚Äôs personality to put him outside the ambit of defendants‚Äô contemplation so as to render the damage suffered by him too remote.

One of the most successful and popular charity events in the country, the Ride engages celebrities, sponsors, motorcycle enthusiasts, fans and local communities. The Ride was founded in 1995 by NASCAR driver Kyle Petty. About Kyle Petty leads bikers during 2016 motorcycle trek. The Kyle Petty Charity Ride Across America is a week-long motorcycle trek through various cities nationwide. Since the Ride began in 1995, more than 7,950 riders have logged 11.6 million cumulative motorcycle miles and raised $17.5 million for Victory Junction and other children‚Äôs charities.

Since its inception by Kyle in 2004 in honor of his late son Adam, Victory Junction has served as the Ride‚Äôs primary beneficiary. Located on 84 acres in Randleman, North Carolina, Victory Junction exists to enrich the lives of children with chronic or life-threatening illnesses by creating camping experiences that are memorable, fun, empowering, physically safe and medically sound. As a result of the Ride, 7,985 children have attended Victory Junction at no cost to their families. Every week of summer, up to 120 kids can go to the camp for 5 days. History The inspiration for the Ride came in 1994, when Petty and three friends rode their motorcycles from North Carolina to a NASCAR race at Phoenix International Raceway. Friends joined the ride along the way, and by the time the group reached Phoenix, it had grown to 30 riders. The turnout inspired Petty, and he decided to nurture the event into something bigger; thus the Kyle Petty Charity Ride Across America was born.Vol.12 Issue 3: Philanthropy World Philanthropy in America, Nascar's First Family Kyle Petty and Herschel Walker on 2016 Ride.

It was listed as Osleworde in the Domesday Book of 1086. Governance Ozleworth is part of the Grumbolds Ash ward of the district of Cotswold and is currently represented by Councillor Carolyn Nicolle, a member of the Conservative Party. Ozleworth is part of the constituency of Cotswold, represented at parliament by Conservative MP Geoffrey Clifton-Brown. It was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020. Geography Ozleworth is in the county of Gloucestershire, and lies within the Cotswolds, a range of hills designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is approximately south of Gloucester and approximately south west of Cirencester. Ozleworth's post town Wotton- under-Edge is approximately to the west. Nearby villages include Alderley, Wortley, Tresham, Leighterton, Lasborough, Newington Bagpath, Owlpen, and Kingscote. Newark Park Newark Park is a National Trust property which was once a Tudor hunting lodge built by the Poyntz family, anciently feudal barons of Curry Mallet in Somerset, later of Iron Acton in Gloucestershire. Church St. Nicholas church The Norman church, which is dedicated to St. Nicholas of Myra, is known to have been in existence in 1131. It has a cruciform structure, with one bell. It has an unusual hexagonal tower located in the centre of the church between the nave and the chancel. The current nave and font were added in the early 13th century. Archaeological evidence suggests that there was no nave before this time and that the tower originally formed part of the western wall of the church. The churchyard is circular. No longer active, the church is looked after by the Churches Conservation Trust. Notable people English poet, translator and academic Charles Tomlinson lived in the village with his family.

Two types of structures have been called nanotubes. The first type are less than 0.7 micrometers in diameter, contain actin and carry portions of plasma membrane between cells in both directions. The second type are larger (>0.7 Œºm), contain both actin and microtubules, and can carry components of the cytoplasm such as vesicles and organelles between cells, including whole mitochondria. The diameter of TNTs ranges from 50 to 200 nm and they can reach lengths of several cell diameters. These structures may be involved in cell-to-cell communication, transfer of nucleic acids between cells in a tissue, and the spread of pathogens or toxins such as HIV and prions. TNTs have observed lifetimes ranging from a few minutes up to several hours, and several proteins have been implicated in their formation or inhibition.  History  Membrane nanotubes were first described in a 1999 Cell article examining the development of Drosophila melanogaster wing imaginal discs. More recently, a Science article published in 2004 described structures that connected various types of immune cell together, as well as connections between cells in tissue culture. Since these publications, more TNT-like structures have been recorded, containing varying levels of F-actin, microtubules, and other components, but remaining relatively homogenous in terms of composition.  Formation  Several mechanisms may be involved in nanotube formation. These include molecular controls as well as cell-to-cell interactions. Two primary mechanisms for TNT formation have been proposed. The first involves cytoplasmic protrusions extending from one cell to another, where they fuse with the membrane of the target cell. The other is that, as two previously connected cells move away from one another, TNTs remain as bridges between the two cells.  Induction  Some dendritic cells and THP-1 monocytes have been shown to connect via tunneling nanotubes and display evidence of calcium flux when exposed to bacterial or mechanical stimuli. TNT- mediated signaling has shown to produce spreading in target cells, similar to the lamellipodia produced when dendritic cells are exposed to bacterial products. The TNTs demonstrated in this study propagated at initial speed of 35 micrometers/second and have shown to connect THP-1 monocytes with nanotubes up to 100 micrometers long. The formation of cytonemes towards a BnL-FGF gradient has been observed, suggesting that chemotactic controls may induce the formation of TNT-like structures. A supporting finding is that phosphatidylserine exposure guided TNT formation from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to a population of injured cells. The protein S100A4 and its receptor have been shown to guide the direction of TNT growth, as p53 activates caspase 3 to cleave S100A4 in the initiating cell, thereby generating a gradient in which the target cell has higher amounts of the protein. One study found that cell-to-cell contact was necessary for the formation of nanotube bridges between T cells. p53 activation has also been implicated as a necessary mechanism for the development of TNTs, as the downstream genes up-regulated by p53 (namely EGFR, Akt, PI3K, and mTOR) were found to be involved in nanotube formation following hydrogen peroxide treatment and serum starvation. Connexin-43 has shown to promote connection between bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and alveolar epithelial cells, leading to the formation of nanotubes. Cellular stress by rotenone or TNF-Œ± was also shown to induce TNT formation between epithelial cells. Inflammation by lipopolysaccharides or interferon-Œ≥ has shown to increase the expression of proteins related to TNT formation.  Inhibition  TNT-like structures called streamers did not form when cultured with cytochalasin D, an F-actin depolymerizing compound, and a separate study using cytochalasin B found impacted TNT formation without the destruction of existing TNTs. Latrunculin-B, another F-actin depolymerizing compound, was found to completely block TNT formation. Blocking CD38, which had been implicated in the release of mitochondria by astrocytes, also significantly decreased TNT formation. TNFAIP2, also called M-Sec, is known to mediate TNT formation, and knockdown of this protein by shRNA reduced TNT development in epithelial cells by about two-thirds.  Role in mitochondrial transfer  Tunneling nanotubes have been implicated as one mechanism by which whole mitochondria can be transferred from cell to cell. Mitochondrial DNA damage appears to be the main trigger for the formation of TNTs in order to traffic entire mitochondria, though the exact threshold of damage necessary to induce TNT formation is yet unknown. The maximum speed of mitochondria traveling over TNTs was found to be about 80 nm/s, lower than the measured speed of 100-1400 nm/s of axonal transport of mitochondria; this could be due to the smaller diameter of TNTs inhibiting mitochondrial migration. In one study, Ahmad et al. used four lines of mesenchymal stem cells, each expressing either a differing phenotype of the Rho-GTPase Miro1; a higher level of Miro1 was associated with more efficient mitochondrial transfer via TNTs. Several studies have shown, through the selective blockage of TNT formation, that TNTs are a primary mechanism for the trafficking of whole mitochondria between heterogeneous cells.  Similar structures  A structure called a cytoneme enables exchanges between signaling centers. Cytonemes, however, do not always connect two cells and can act solely as environmental sensors. Plasmodesmata have been identified as functional channels interconnecting plant cells, and stromules interconnect plastids. Myopodia are actin-rich cytoplasmic extensions which have been observed in embryonic Drosophila. Similar structures have been observed in Xenopus and mouse models. Actin-containing cellular protrusions dubbed \\"streamers\\" have been observed in cultured B cells. Vesicular transport in membrane nanotubes has been modeled utilizing a continuum approach. A variety of synthetic nanotubes, based on stacking of cyclic peptides and other cyclic molecules, have been investigated.

The Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies (FRIAS) is the international research college of the University of Freiburg in Freiburg, Germany. The institute was initially part of the university's proposal for funding in the Excellence Initiative in 2007, an initiative by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the German Research Foundation with the aim of promoting both cutting-edge research and enhancing the international success of German higher education institutions. After the University of Freiburg had been chosen as one of nine \\"universities of excellence\\", FRIAS officially took up operations on 1 April 2008. It aims to promote high-level research, develop interdisciplinary research fields, and assist young researchers in their development. FRIAS is loosely modeled after other similar institutions, such as the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, whose director Prof. Dr. Peter Goddard held the inaugural address at the official presentation of FRIAS in May, 2008 at the University of Freiburg. The University of Freiburg has applied for FRIAS‚Äôs funding to be continued in the second round of the Excellence Initiative. Objectives A new institution in the German higher education and research landscape, FRIAS invites renowned researchers from German and international institutions to conduct their research in Freiburg, while aiming to give its researchers extensive freedoms to pursue projects of their choice with minimal bureaucracy. As a haven and center for academic research, FRIAS wishes to promote new synergies among its fellows and give new impulses to the University of Freiburg. FRIAS pursues the following objectives: * to support top-level researchers * to promote young academics * to facilitate interdisciplinary contact and collaboration * to reinforce the university‚Äôs international networking and visibility Structure The Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies consisted 2008-2013 of four schools (School of History, School of Language and Literature, School of Life Sciences - LIFENET, School of Soft Matter Research), which mirror important research areas at the University of Freiburg. Since 2013 they are replaced with an open structure for all academic disciplines. With the beginning of the academic year 2014/2015, FRIAS will also concentrate on yearly two research foci.https://www.frias.uni-freiburg.de/en/routes-to- frias/foci Fellows‚Äô Academic Activities Three groups of fellows work at FRIAS: * Internal Senior Fellows: academics from the University of Freiburg * External Senior Fellows: academics from all over the world * Junior Fellows: outstanding young academics FRIAS organises academic colloquia, workshops and international conferences in its research areas. Research results are published in specialist journals, monographs and FRIAS‚Äôs own journal series. Soon after its conception, the Hermann Staudinger Lectures were introduced, named after the famous University of Freiburg chemist who won the Nobel Prize in 1953. Renowned scientists from all over the world, so far including Douglas Osheroff, Jean-Marie Lehn, Richard R. Ernst, and Werner Arber, are invited to hold this lecture. Since its foundation in 2008, more than 250 researchers have worked at FRIAS. The fellows are released from their teaching and administrative duties, and substitutes are engaged to fulfil their teaching commitments. The substitute professorships financed by FRIAS are, in many cases, used to promote young academics that have recently qualified as professors. Promotion of Early-Stage Researchers As Junior Fellows, promising young academics have the opportunity to organise their own conferences at FRIAS and invite celebrated international guests to attend, as well as the chance to teach and obtain their professorial qualification (Habilitation) at the university. Doctoral candidates and postdoctoral researchers at the University of Freiburg are able to take part in Young Researchers‚Äô Contests and apply for research prizes with their doctoral and habilitation theses. Interdisciplinary Activities The major FRIAS interdisciplinary symposia each focus on a topic from the different perspectives of the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences (2009: Evolution, 2011: Catastrophes). Smaller, inter-school event formats such as monthly Dinner Speeches and After Hours Conversations provide opportunities for interdisciplinary exchange. International Collaboration A multitude of permanent research networks and projects have developed from collaborations between internal and external fellows. In the upper Rhine area, close relationships exist with the Institut d‚Äô√âtudes Avanc√©es de Strasbourg and the University of Basel. In October 2010, FRIAS organised a conference on the topic of ‚ÄúUniversity-Based Institutes for Advanced Study (UBIAS) in a Global Perspective: Promises, Challenges, New Frontiers‚Äù, in which a total of 32 Institutes for Advanced Study from 19 countries participated. An independent UBIAS network, with member institutes from around the globe, was established as a result of this.
