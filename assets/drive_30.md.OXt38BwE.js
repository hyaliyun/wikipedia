They are usually considered to be part of the new wave of British heavy metal, following their inclusion on EMI's album Metal For Muthas II, although they were established on the Birmingham circuit as a hard rock band several years before this. Career The band can originally be dated back to 1973, when bassist John Ace and guitarist Ian Smith, played together in Spectat√© II at the school they attended in Sutton Coldfield. The band members went their separate ways to go to university ‚Äì aside from Smith who went to sea ‚Äì at which point Ace formed a covers outfit. When this split, Ace, together with rhythm guitarist Stewart Harrod, persuaded Smith to return and added the drummer Phil Kimberley. Their first gig took place on 26 August 1975, under the generally disliked name Notre Dame. The name Jameson Raid comes from an incident in the Transvaal at the turn of 1895/96. Their roadie Nick Freeman was credited with recalling the event from his school history books and proposing it to the band. With Hoi Polloi singer Terry Dark joining in December 1976, and Stewart leaving a few days later, Jameson Raid's most well-known line-up was complete. Jameson Raid released their first single, the \\"Seven Days of Splendour\\" EP in February 1979. \\"The combination of influences which had given birth to the band‚Äôs overall sound was quite difficult to pin down, as there were elements of 70's rock/pop (particularly David Bowie and Mott The Hoople), heavier acts such as Thin Lizzy and the occasional nod towards punk snottiness‚Ä¶\\" noted author Malc Macmillan,The N.W.O.B.H.M. Encyclopedia by Malc Macmillan, Iron Pages, 2001 and the three tracks on the EP (\\"Seven Days of Splendour\\", \\"It‚Äôs a Crime\\" and \\"Catcher in the Rye\\") illustrated Macmillan‚Äôs conundrum in terms of an inability to categorise the band‚Äôs sound. Described in The International Encyclopedia of Hard Rock & Heavy Metal as \\"cult heroes for the Midland rock circuit‚Ä¶ Their music is a poppy form of heavy metal‚Ä¶\\".The International Encyclopedia of Hard Rock And Heavy Metal by Tony Jasper and Derek Oliver, Sidgwick & Jackson,, 1983 The EP was well received and, as Martin Popoff pointed out, showcased \\"a masterful bit of songwriting throughout these three tracks\\".The New Wave Of British Heavy Metal Singles by Martin Popoff, Scrap Metal Records, 2005 The first 1,000 copies came in a white sleeve, with a further pressing of 2,000 in a black sleeve; both featured what Popoff called \\"a spoofed band history\\" together with the lyrics to all three songs. In March 1980 the band, along with Magnum, played support to Def Leppard at West Midland venues on the latter's On Through the Night World Tour. In May 1980, EMI released the second of its Metal for Muthas NWOBHM compilation albums. Metal For Muthas II Cut Loud, featured the Jameson Raid track \\"Hard Lines\\", although the band were unhappy that EMI had, unbeknownst to them, completely remixed the song (which the band had already mixed to their satisfaction) and in doing so pretty much destroyed it. The band were credited as The Raid on this release.'Suzie Smiled: The New Wave Of British Heavy Metal' by John Tucker, 2006 Fighting against a tide of apathy, Smith and Ace handed in their notice and played their final gig with the band in Birmingham in July 1980. A second 7\\" EP, widely referred to as The Hypnotist but actually entitled End of Part One, was released at this time. Featuring four tracks (\\"The Hypnotist\\", \\"The Raid\\", \\"Getting Hotter\\" and \\"Straight from the Butchers\\"), the EP proved to be the band‚Äôs vinyl swansong. Kimberley and Dark soldiered on, recruiting guitarist Mike Darby and bassist Peter Green. In 1981 Darby left and was replaced by The Handsome Beasts founder member James Barrett, who in turn gave way to Steve Makin in 1982. The four-track Electric Sun demo cassette (featuring \\"Electric Sun\\", \\"Run for Cover\\", \\"Poor Little Rich Girl\\" and \\"Getting Hotter\\") was made available, but later that year Kimberley and Dark quit and the band was effectively over. During an interview for Classic Rock magazine in 2010, Terry Dark said: \\"We just seemed to be either a year too early, or a year too late... But whatever the reason things never quite happened for us.\\" A green vinyl LP titled Jameson Raid, comprising the End Of Part One EP, the Electric Sun demo tracks, the Metal for Muthas take of \\"Hard Lines\\" and the unreleased track \\"Running Blind\\" from the final 1983 line-up was released as a bootleg and not an official release, although it has become an expensive collector's item. Both of the EPs featured in the 2010 edition of Record Collector.'Record Collector 2010. Page 264. In 1983, Green and Makin drafted in drummer Roger Simms, and with Makin handling both guitar and vocal duties, they tried to resurrect the band as The Raid, but with no great success nor longevity. Makin went on to front several other bands before being invited to appear on the solo album by Cozy Powell, The Drums Are Back (1992). He joined Slade in 1993. Malcolm Dome wrote: \\"Jameson Raid are one of the many bands who were definitely contenders for glory during the halcyon days of the new wave of British heavy metal. Sadly, they never quite lived up to their obvious potential\\". The classic line-up of Terry Dark, Ian Smith, John Ace and Phil Kimberley re-united in 2008, and their back catalogue album, Just as the Dust Had Settled, was released by Shadow Kingdom Records in March 2010. The band played gigs both in Germany and the UK in July 2010. In February 2011 John Ace left the band. They played the Download festival in June 2011 with a stand in bass player before Peter Green, the bass player from 1980 to 1983, rejoined in June 2011. By 2012 first Ian Smith and then Phil Kimberley had followed John Ace and returned to their day jobs. They were replaced by Kalli Kaldschmidt and Andreas 'Neudi' Neuderth from the band Roxxcaliber. In August 2013 drummer Lars Wickett was recruited due to Neudi's live gig commitments with Manilla Road. Jameson Raid have remained active particularly in Europe with occasional gigs in the UK.

She was the first Bulgarian woman to direct a feature film and one of the few women worldwide to direct feature films in the 1950s.  Career  Zhelyazkova graduated from the Sofia Theatre Institute in 1956 and briefly worked as an assistant director at Sofia Film Studios \\"Boyana\\" before directing her first feature, Life Flows Quietly By... (1957). This film established the collaboration with her husband, screenwriter Hristo Ganev, with whom she worked on many of her films. The film explored the lives of the former partisan fighters now in positions of power and was critical of the communist r√©gime in Bulgaria. The leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party reacted with fury and for 30 years banned the film by Party decree. This marked the beginning of Binka Zhelyazkova's complex relationship with the r√©gime. During her career Zhelyakzova directed seven feature and two documentary films. An active member of the anti-fascist youth movement during World War II, she soon became disillusioned with the post-war realities, which had little to do with her ideals. Her work often reflected her struggles, and four of her nine films were banned from distribution and reached audiences only after the end of the regime. Particularly damaging for her career was the fate of The Tied Up Balloon, an innovative and highly stylized film, which showed the power of Binka's imagination and her potential as a film director. After its success at the 1967 Expo in Montreal the film was seen as an insult to the party leader, when in one of the scenes a group of villagers lift a donkey in the air. Again the communist party issued a decree and stopped the film. The same fate met the two documentary films Lullaby (1981) and The Bright and Dark Side of Things\\" (1981), about women in prison, a rear and uncompromising look at women's treatment in the socialist society, which were never released to the public. Despite her difficulties at home her films won numerous awards outside of Bulgaria. We Were Young (1961) was awarded the Golden Prize at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival in 1962. The Attached Balloon (1967) had a successful run at the 1967 Expo in Montreal. The Last Word (1974) for which she also wrote the screenplay was in competition at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival along with films by Pier Paolo Pasolini, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Karlos Saura, Ken Russell and Liliana Cavani. Her 1977 film The Swimming Pool was entered into the 10th Moscow International Film Festival where it won the Silver Prize. In the 1980s Binka Zhelyazkova became the director of the Bulgarian section of Women in Film, an organization created in 1989 after the international women in film conference, KIWI, in Tbilisi, Georgia. She stopped making films after 1989, which coincided with the fall of the communist regime in Bulgaria. For some time after that she remained active in the Women in Film organization, but soon completely withdrew from public life. Since 2007 renewed interest has arisen in Zhelyazkova's work mainly due to the documentary Binka: To Tell a Story About Silence by the New York based Bulgarian film maker Elka Nikolova. http://translate.google.ca/translate?hl=en&sl;=bg&u;=http://www.binkadoc.com/bg/The%2520Film.htm&ei;=V7WtScqiApGksQPLgoXHBA&sa;=X&oi;=translate&resnum;=1&ct;=result&prev;=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://www.binkadoc.com/bg/The%252520Film.htm%26num%3D30%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26sa%3DG  Style  Binka Zhelyazkova's style was influenced by Italian Neo-Realism and the French New Wave, as well as by Russian cinema. The poetic and metaphoric imagery of her films often prompted critics to compare her to Federico Fellini and Andrey Tarkovski. Her distinctive directorial style along with her perfectionism and nonconformism won her the label \\"the bad girl of Bulgarian cinema\\". Despite the many interruptions, her work always reflected what was going on in the world at the time: the personality cult and the Hungarian uprising of 1956, the war in Vietnam and the waves of protests that swept many countries in the 1960s, the feminist movement in the 1970s and the 1980, and the stagnation of the last years of socialism.

Levinson, 485 U.S. 224 (1988), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States articulated the \\"fraud-on-the-market theory\\" as giving rise to a rebuttable presumption of reliance in securities fraud cases..  Background  Combustion Engineering, Inc. sought to acquire Basic, Inc., and had engaged in discussions with Basic's officers and directors. Three months after these discussions began, Basic asked the New York Stock Exchange to suspend trading in its shares and issued a release stating that it had been \\"approached\\" by another company concerning a merger. Basic president Max Muller publicly denied Basic's involvement in any merger discussions. The next day, Basic's board approved Combustion's tender offer for all outstanding shares. Plaintiff Max L. Levinson was a Basic shareholder who brought a class action suit against Basic and its directors, alleging that he and other shareholders were injured by selling Basic shares at artificially depressed prices in a market affected by‚Äîand relying on‚ÄîBasic's misleading statements. Plaintiffs alleged that Basic's misrepresentations violated ¬ß 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio certified the class, finding that plaintiffs were entitled to a presumption of reliance on Basic's public statements, and therefore that common questions of fact or law predominated over particular questions pertaining to individual plaintiffs. However, on the merits the court granted Basic's motion for summary judgment, finding the statements to be immaterial. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed class certification, joining a number of other circuits in accepting the fraud-on-the-market theory. The Court of Appeals also reversed and remanded the decision on summary judgment, holding that although Basic did not have an affirmative duty to disclose the merger discussions, it could not release misleading statements. The U.S. Supreme Court then granted certiorari to resolve a circuit split on the materiality issue and determine the propriety of the fraud-on-the-market theory.  Opinion of the Court  Justice Blackmun, writing for the majority, first examined the underlying policy behind the Securities Exchange Act: to protect investors against manipulation of stock prices. The Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated Rule 10b-5 to prevent fraud and enforce the Act's requirements. =Materiality of preliminary merger discussions= Blackmun reviewed the standards of materiality, including the holding in TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., that \\"an omitted fact is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote.\\". This standard was then expressly adopted for ¬ß 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. The Court re-iterated that where there is a duty to disclose, management must disclose or abstain from trading. Where there is no duty to disclose, the Court will not question the timing of disclosure. But if management is under no duty to disclose and misrepresents a material fact, management may be held accountable. In other words, the Court was not concerned about the timing of disclosure, only its accuracy and completeness. The Court then went on to establish a standard for determining the materiality of merger discussions. Blackmun reviewed and rejected the Third Circuit test that merger discussions become material only when an agreement in principle has been reached, finding that standard too \\"rigid\\" and \\"artificial.\\" Blackmun also rejected the Sixth Circuit test, which held that publicly denying the existence of merger discussions makes those discussions material by virtue of denying their existence. He reasoned that it is not enough for a statement to be untrue if it is insignificant. Blackmun declined to adopt a test that hinged on a single event, holding instead that the materiality of merger discussions is always a function of the probability of the completion of the merger and the magnitude of the transaction. =Reliance and the fraud-on-the- market theory= The fraud-on-the-market theory is the idea that stock prices are a function of all material information about the company and its business. It applies in open and developed securities markets, where it can be assumed that all material information is available to investors. The theory states that under these conditions, there is a causal link between any misstatement and any stock purchaser, because the misstatements defraud the entire market and thus affect the price of the stock. Therefore, a material misstatement's effect on an individual purchaser is no less significant than the effect on the entire market. The question before the court was whether this entitles an individual stock purchaser a presumption of reliance, even if the purchaser did not directly rely on the misstatements. Observing that the reality of modern securities markets is such that face-to-face transactions are rare, Justice Blackmun noted that requiring a showing of actual reliance would effectively prevent plaintiffs from ever proceeding as a class action. Also finding that investors often rely on market price, he found the rebuttable presumption of reliance (through the fraud-on-the-market theory) to be a reasonable compromise between the requirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23 and the securities fraud element of reliance. Blackmun further noted that both Congress's intent and recent empirical studies reflect the idea that open markets incorporate all material information into share price. The Court thereby adopted a rebuttable presumption of reliance, based on the fraud-on-the-market theory. Blackmun noted that defendants could rebut the presumption by showing that there was no link between the misstatements and plaintiff's price paid or received. The Court further noted that, should a corporation wish to maintain the confidentiality of its merger talks without denying the chance of a merger, its directors need only state that they had \\"no comment\\" regarding any potential merger.William A. Klein, Business Associations, 8th ed., Foundation Press (2012). Blackmun vacated the decision of the Court of Appeals and remanded the case.

NOTE: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1970 until ARIA created their own charts in mid-1988. It was released in October 1983 on Mushroom Records with Nick Launay producing. The album provided three singles, \\"I Hear Motion\\" released in September, which peaked at No. 16. Neither \\"No Shoulders, No Head\\" released in December, nor \\"God Bless America\\" released in April 1984, peaked into the Australian Top 50 singles chart. The video for \\"God Bless America\\", from March 1984, featured backing singers Kate Ceberano and Zan Abeyratne (both members of I'm Talking). Background Models had formed in Melbourne in 1978 by members from Teenage Radio Stars and JAM, after some line-up changes they were Andrew Duffield on keyboards, Mark Ferrie on bass guitar, Janis Friedenfelds (aka Johnny Crash) on drums and percussion, and Sean Kelly on vocals and lead guitar. In November 1980, Models released their first album, Alphabravocharliedeltaechofoxtrotgolf, on Mushroom Records. It peaked at No. 43 on the Australian albums chart. The album was well received by audiences on the live pub circuit. Early in 1981, Friedenfelds was replaced on drums by Mark Hough (aka Buster Stiggs) from New Zealand band The Swingers. In June, Models released a 10\\" album, Cut Lunch, which consisted of demo tracks produced by Tony Cohen and Models except \\"Atlantic Romantic\\" produced by Split Enz keyboard player Eddie Rayner and Models. After recording Cut Lunch, Models travelled to United Kingdom to record, Local &/or General, with Steve Tayler producing. During 1982, further line-up changes occurred with Ferrie and Hough leaving early in the year. James Freud (ex-Teenage Radio Stars, James Freud & Berlin) joined the band on bass/vocals, with John Rowell (ex-Curse) on guitar, and Graham Scott (ex-Curse) on drums. Kelly and Freud had been in high school bands which developed into Teenage Radio Stars, Rowell and Scott left in May 1982, with Duffield following. New Zealand drummer, Barton Price (ex-Crocodiles, Sardine v) joined. They recorded a single, \\"On\\", produced by veteran rocker Lobby Loyde and released in August. It had no mainstream National singles chart success, but peaked at No. 1 on the independent charts. Gus Till (ex-Beargarden) briefly joined on keyboards until Duffield rejoined the band in December. The Duffield, Freud, Kelly and Price version of the group released the highly regarded 1983 LP The Pleasure of Your Company, produced by Nick Launay. Its big drum sound and danceability, in particular, reflected Launay's influence, and Freud's more radio-friendly voice made the album more accessible. The album was critically acclaimed and peaked at No. 12 on the Australian albums chart, with the single \\"I Hear Motion\\" becoming a national No. 16 hit. Duffield later explained that the song's distinctive keyboard part had been inspired by the riff from the Stevie Wonder classic \\"Superstition\\". The band also released two other singles, \\"God Bless America\\" and \\"No Shoulders, No Head\\", neither charted into the Top 50. The band scored the support slot for David Bowie's 'Serious Moonlight' tour of Australia. Kelly and Duffield were invited to sing backing vocals on the INXS album, The Swing. The video for \\"God Bless America\\", from March 1984, featured backing singers Kate Ceberano and Zan Abeyratne (both members of I'm Talking). The music video was shot in 3D. Kelly appeared ready to disband Models and was even rehearsing with a new band. Mushroom Records convinced him to continue with Models and their next single, \\"Big on Love\\" produced by Reggie Lucas, peaked at No. 24. By late 1984, Models relocated to Sydney and Duffield ‚Äì with his crucial influence on the band's sound ‚Äì was forced out under acrimonious circumstances to be replaced by Roger Mason (ex- James Freud's Berlin) on keyboards and James Valentine on saxophone. In early 1985, Models started recording material for their next album, Out of Mind, Out of Sight, produced by Mark Opitz, Reggie Lucas and Nick Launay. In October 2010, The Pleasure of Your Company was listed in the top 50 in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums.

John Coursen House History In the mid-18th century, two descendants of New Amsterdam Dutch families, Johannes Coursen, and his wife, Gertrude Van Tuyle, arrived in the Fredon area. In 1763, Johannes Coursen purchased over 800 acres in the township. A log cabin was most likely the first building on the property. The Coursen mansion was built in 1805. It contained four rooms on the first floor with a chimney across the corner of two rooms. There were three bedrooms on the second floor. The kitchen, located on the southern end of the house, had a large bake oven to the right of the chimney. When Johannes Coursen died, his property was divided between his two sons. The Paulinskill Mill Farm went to Jacob Coursen and the four-corners land to John Coursen. In 1811, Colonel John's sons built and operated a blacksmith's shop, a tannery, a store, and later a tailor shop. His son, Isaac Coursen, established a post office and was the first postmaster. He added a first floor parlor and two more bedrooms upstairs as the family grew. After Isaac's death, the postmaster position was taken over by his son, William P. Coursen until 1881.  Preservation  The Coursen House was purchased by Fredon Township as part of developing the next door Lodestar Park. Keepers of Coursens Corners, was formed in 2001 to begin the restoration. The objective of the restoration was to create a museum in the house.  Sources  * Woodruff, Francis Eben. A Branch of the Woodruff Stock. Published by Printed at \\"The Jerseyman\\" office, 1902.

He worked as an independent photojournalist in Germany between 1967 and 1974. Soulas was born in 1938 in Thessaloniki from a family originated from Souli. For the years 1960 to 1965, he studied Economics at the Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt and Sociology at the Institute for Social Research. After his studies, he began working in the marketing department of the fruit import company \\"Atlanta Handelsgesellschaft Harder & Co.\\", in Munich. On April 1967, Soulas co-founded with other Greek people living in Munich, the \\"Panhellenic Anti-junta Association\\" against the 1967-1974 military regime of Greece. Because of his participation in the anti-junta movement, he had his Greek passport withdrawn and was denied entry to the country. Also, the Greek Junta authorities exerted pressure to the company Soulas was working, which asked Soulas to quit the Anti-junta Association. After his denial to quit he was fired from his position in the company. After his dismissal, he began working as a freelance photojournalist selling his photos to newspapers. Soon, he became an associate of the Associated Press, while newspapers of Munich assigned projects to him. During his career as a photojournalist, he worked for notable magazines of Germany, such as Stern, Quick, Neue Revue, and worked with Magnum agency. In 1974, after the Greek Junta collapse, he returned in Greece. Estimating that photojournalism had still not matured in Greece, he decided to quit working as a professional photographer and he turned toward business and trade.

In a naval career spanning over 50 years Hastings saw service across the British Empire, and rose to the rank of vice-admiral. His service as commander in chief on the Pacific Station of the Royal Navy at Esquimalt on the British Columbia Coast of what is now Canada is today commemorated in the names of several locations and geographic features. Family and early life Hastings was born on 28 November 1814, the second son of Hans Hastings, 12th Earl of Huntingdon, and his first wife Frances. His father had a naval career, and George followed him into the navy in either August or September 1824. After several years service as a midshipman Hastings was rated as mate on 5 September 1832, and promoted to lieutenant on 7 January 1833, followed by an appointment to the navy's gunnery training ship at Portsmouth, . This was followed in May 1834 with a posting to the Mediterranean, initially aboard the 74-gun third rate , followed by his transfer in September 1837 to the wooden paddle sloop . Cricket Hastings played a single first-class match for Hampshire in 1843 against Nottinghamshire.Hampshire v Nottinghamshire (1843) In the match, Hastings scored 5 runs in Hampshire's first innings before being bowled by William Clarke. In Hampshire's second innings he was dismissed for a duck, once again by Clarke. Command Hastings was promoted to commander on 30 June 1838, and was appointed to the Coastguard in January 1839. He was appointed to the 16-gun brig-sloop in August 1841 and sent to the China Station in time to take part in the last actions of the First Opium War then being fought. He remained in eastern waters after the end of the war, countering pirate operations on the coast of Sumatra. He was involved in the attack by the boats from Harlequin on the pirate enclaves of Quallah Batto and 'Murdoo', and his good service in these operations led to his promotion to captain, which came when he paid off the Harlequin on 31 January 1845. Hastings was appointed to his next command, the steam paddle frigate , in September 1848. He commanded her on the west coast of Africa until February 1851. The crew of Cyclops are recorded as receiving bounties for the capture of the vessels Bom Successo on 25 December 1848, Esperanca on 10 May 1849, Sophia on 11 August 1849 and Apollo on 29 October 1949 (the last two in consort with ) Pilot on 10 January 1850, Ventura on 27 January 1850 (both with ), Sociedade on 17 June 1850, and an unnamed \\"slave brigantine\\" on 20 November 1850; as the chief duty of the West Africa Squadron was the suppression of the slave trade, presumably those ship were all slave ships.

An appointment to the steam frigate followed, and Hastings served aboard her for operations in the Mediterranean and Black Sea during the Crimean War. While serving in the Crimea Hastings distinguished himself at the Battle of Eupatoria in February 1855, and was Mentioned in Despatches in the London Gazette of 8 March 1855, and honourably mentioned by Omar Pasha. He was duly appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) on 2 January 1857, and was also awarded the third class of the Medjidie, an award he was authorised to accept on 3 April 1858. He remained aboard Curacoa until May 1857. He briefly commanded at Weymouth (a guardship for the coast guard service) before being appointed (November 1857) commander of the Portsmouth guardship. He became superintendent of Haslar Hospital and the Royal Clarence victualling yard in January 1858, holding the post until his promotion to rear-admiral on 27 April 1863. His next assignment was in November 1866, when he became commander-in-chief in the Pacific, with the broadside ironclad as his flagship. He received another promotion on 10 September 1869 when he was raised to vice-admiral, and returned to Britain in November that year. His final position came with his appointment to be Commander-in-Chief, The Nore in February 1873. He retained the post for the usual three years, stepping down on 14 February 1876. He died shortly afterwards, on 21 March 1876 at his home at 41 Stanhope Gardens, South Kensington, London. Family and legacy Hastings married Mathilde Alice at the British consulate at Calais on 14 September 1864. A second ceremony was held the following day at the bride's home town of Saint-Omer. The marriage produced three sons and a daughter, with Mathilde outliving George and dying in 1916. Hastings's period as commander of the Pacific station during a period of extensive mapping and exploration around the region led to his name being commemorated, particularly in numerous geographic features. Hastings Street, a main east-west corridor in Vancouver is named for him, and other placenames in the city are derived from it, such as Hastings Park and the adjacent neighbourhood of Hastings-Sunrise. The fjord Hastings Arm on the North Coast of British Columbia was named after him, as was the nearby Mount Fowler. Their daughter, Frances Alice Hastings (26 July 1870 ‚Äì 3 February 1945), married Gordon George William Henry (1868‚Äì1947), on 4 November 1895. They were the parents of Dorothea Mabel Macnee (30 October 1896 ‚Äì 1984), who was Patrick Macnee's mother. Notes a. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography describes him as entering the navy in September 1824, while parliamentary papers from 1863 give an entry date of 14 August 1824. The parts of his service record preserved by The National Archives do not show a date for his entry. b. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography claims that Hastings was in command from August 1852. J. J. Colledge's Ships of the Royal Navy and Lyon and Winfield's The Sail and Steam Navy List record that Curacoa was not launched until 13 April 1854. His service record notes his appointment to the ship on 11 August 1854.

Government The Bokeya residential unit was headed by kin-group chief, and the position was passed via lineage. Ceremonial chiefs had more authority than the kin-group chiefs. In the aftermath of Bokeya congregation during the Rancheria period (1900-1935), there weren't fixed leaders. However, toward the end of this period, a system of voting was introduced for the selection of leaders. The Bokeya voted to accept the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act (IRA). The Bokeya framed a Constitution and By-Laws and a Coroprate Charter, which was approved in 1936. They formed a Community Council to assume the official roles, and also formed a Business Committee to operate the ranch as a chartered corporation. The officers are elected once a year via democratic process. ;Structure of Current Community Council * Chairman: Jamie Cobarrubiahttp://www.abc.ca.gov/datport/LQSdata.asp?ID=56226249 * Vice Chairman: Leonard Anthony Bechtol * Secretary: Sal Martinez * Treasurer: Lydia Shirleyhttps://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/xraca/documents/text/idc1-028718.pdf Constitution Constitution and By-laws They are one of the few Native American bands who have a written Constitution that is available for the public.

Language The Central Pomo are culturally identified as a Pomo dialect group. The language is under Hokan family. In pre-contact times, the Pomoan languages together probably had around 8000 speakers (Kroeber 1925). Today, there are several speakers of Central Pomo (Golla 2011).http://www.californiaprehistory.com/tribmap.html Branching Economy, Culture & Religion Since they are part of larger PomoPomo band, their cultures and traditions are similar to that of the larger band they are part of. Each kin-group of the aboriginal Bokeya had a men's assembly house where ghost ceremonies were performed. These ceremonies were associated with their secret society and the intent was social integration. Professions such as hunting, fishing, and healing were considered prestigious. Shamans were responsible for driving away individual sickness, and sickness of the community as a whole. They were self-sufficient from the resources from the ocean, rivers, and the forests. They strongly followed a protocol of utilizing the resources, and were sensitive to external people using their resources. They did not completely oppose the idea of sharing resources, but they were strict about following a proper protocol. They had a proper system of exchange and trade. When they had superabundance, feasts were organized among the trade allies. They heavily believed in the dreamers and their dreams that decided religion and ceremonies. The ceremonies were conducted in the dance house. The dream songs were used to suck illness out of the individuals and the society. Post-contact, Bokeya earned living by partially following traditional methods, and partially by participation in the settlers' way of living. They cultivated lands, grew crops to sell, charged fees on people going to rancheria to fish, and also by working in the logging industries and road work. Post IRA, they obtained a loan of $5000 to start ranch. Due to internal and external conflicts, the ranch failed and was unable to pay the workers. After the failure of the ranch, they returned to their rancheria status. However, they still practiced certain \\"ceremonial festivities and curing practices\\". In the contemporary world, they participate in Pow Wow Singing and Pow Wow Dances. As a part of keeping the Native American culture and traditions alive, various tribes gather in the Pow Wows. They sing songs and perform dances. Since they have different languages, they do not use words, but use \\"vocables\\" so that everyone can understand the song and its special meaning. Dances are a significant part of their tradition. The collection of songs and dances that they perform today might not be as vast as in the past, and they might have been modified, but the intent remains the same.http://www.powwows.com/main/native-american-pow-wow/#ixzz4ZsC2YdXx Pow Wow Court Cases Manchester Band of Pomo Indians vs united States. JUSTIA US Law The Manchester Band of Pomo Indians filed a class action lawsuit against the \\"United States of America and certain officers of the Interior and Treasury Departments\\" on November 18, 1968 for improper handling of tribal funds. After unsuccessful efforts to convene a three-judge court, the case was reassigned in early 1972. Finally, after the defendants' failure to comply with the Court's order, the Court established the charges against the defendants to be true.

Founded in 1989 by David Kriege, the company is based in Lake Mills, Wisconsin.http://www.manta.com/coms2/dnbcompany_739pnt It sells large aperture telescopes throughout the world. An example of a telescope they have produced is a Dobsonian with a 12.5 inch mirror. They have also produced telescopes with computerized positioning. The company is noted as a pioneer in amateur astronomy and is an important and the most major producer of Dobsonian telescopes. Around 1987 the founder, Kriege, went to a star party and experienced a Dobsonian telescope, and then built Obsession 1 at this time astronomy was a hobby (this is before founding OT). The style of telescope was unique early on but over time became more popular. One style of Dobsonian the company developed is an ultra-compact style. The Dobsonians are a big deal to amateur astronomers because they offer a big aperture compared to the cost of the telescope and its mobility. This allows the telescopes to be taken to star parties, where amateur astronomers gather at night to use their scopes together. Telescopes from OT have also been used for astrophotography. Products The company specializes in large aperture truss-pole Dobsonian telescopes. The OT telescopes have a set standard for telescopes among amateur astronomer telescopes. One of the advantages is the ultra-compact style, which allows higher mobility, with a compact size, relative to the diameter of the main mirror. The compactness is achieved by making the traditional Dobsonian design collapsible. In this way, the truss shrinks down to a smaller size making it more easy to transport a bigger telescope. This mobility advantage makes it easier to take a larger diameter aperture mirror to a star party, which are popular in the amateur astronomy community. (the traditional way is that a big telescope is fixed in an observatory) Having a bigger aperture can improve many aspects of telescope performance, provided that the overall quality is maintained. For example, an 18-inch diameter telescope has five times the light-gather power of an 8-inch telescope, all else being equal. In addition, the bigger telescope has finer resolution and better contrast. By gathering more light fainter astronomical objects can be seen. Obsession uses primary mirrors supplied by Optical Mechanics, Inc. (OMI) and Ostahowski Optics, and secondary mirrors supplied by United Lens. In 2007 Obsession released a new line of highly portable telescopes they designate as UC (Ultra Compact). Since that time, they have then referred to their original line of telescopes as \\"Classic\\" models. Obsession offers the StellarCAT ServoCAT drive system, JMI focusers and Wildcard Innovations Argo Navis Digital Telescope Computer (DTC) on their range of telescopes. =Models= Obsession telescopes available circa 2012. The telescopes ranged in price from over US$3000 for the 12.5 inch to $12‚Äì15,000 for the 25 inch. Obsession manufactured a limited number of 30\\" and 36\\" telescopes. In 2009, Obsession Telescopes assisted OMI in the design of the OMI Evolution-30./http://www.opticalmechanics.com/evolution_dobs/Evo-30_intro/index.html Obsession telescopes are used by a range of users, including amateur astronomers, academic institutions, and some professional observatories.

He was known as Esmailyn Gonzalez until February 2009, when Sports Illustrated published an investigation that proved he had used fraudulent documents to convince the Nationals that he was several years younger than his true age.  Signing  On July 2, 2006, the Nationals signed Alvarez, then known as Esmailyn Gonzalez, as an international free agent. He was given a $1.4 million signing bonus. The Nationals were given information that Alvarez was born on September 21, 1989, a date which the MLB office confirmed for at least three interested teams, including Washington. He made his debut for the Gulf Coast League Nationals in 2007.  Name/birth date controversy  Soon after Alvarez/Gonzalez was signed by the Nationals, team officials asked MLB to do some further checking in response to concerns about irregularities in his signing. MLB initially determined there was nothing out of the ordinary.Harlan, Chico. Kasten: \\"I am angry. We've been defrauded.\\" The Washington Post, 2009-02-18. However, on February 17, 2009, Sports Illustrated uncovered evidence that Gonzalez's real name was Carlos Alvarez Lugo, and he was born in 1985 rather than 1989. Even before then, a number of baseball insiders suspected that Gonzalez/Lugo was significantly less than advertised. One of them told SI that despite the Nationals billing him as a five-tool player, \\"he doesn't run all that well, and has an average arm.\\" In a press conference later that day, Nationals president Stan Kasten confirmed that Gonzalez's real name was indeed Carlos Alvarez Lugo. A visibly angry Kasten said the Nationals had been victimized by \\"a deliberate, premeditated fraud\\" involving several people and a raft of falsified records. He added that he'd asked for a further inquiry in response to revelations that Chicago White Sox officials were skimming off the signing bonuses of Latino prospects. He vowed the Nationals would seek legal and financial recourse. The Federal Bureau of Investigation soon began investigating Nationals general manager Jim Bowden, suspecting that he has skimmed bonus money from international signees since 1994, when he was with the Cincinnati Reds. Bowden was subsequently forced to resign as a result of the affair. Nothing ever came of that investigation. With the news of Lugo's real name and age, he was far less valuable as a player. Although he won the Gulf Coast League batting title in 2008 and compiled fairly good numbers in runs, RBIs and hits, one scout said that these numbers were to be expected considering that he was somewhat older than his competition. Despite the fraud, Lugo continued to play in the Nationals minor league system through 2013. However, he never rose higher than Class A. He played for Tigres del Licey in the Dominican Professional Baseball League in 2014-15, and has not returned to baseball at any level since then.

It is based on the tarot sequence and on the writings of Charles Williams. It was released in 1976 by EMI. A new version was released on the band's own label in 1984 following its deletion from the EMI catalogue. In 2010, to forestall an alleged bootleg version, EMI licensed the original version to the band's own label. Story In The Region Of The Summer Stars was originally composed as a largely vocal album, but recording plans had to be reviewed when Peter Roberts, the band's singer, killed himself on New Year's Day 1975. It was decided by the remaining band members that Roberts was irreplaceable to the lineup at that time, and subsequently the band reconstructed the music to be purely instrumental.CD inlay information The original name decided for the album was The Voyage of the Acolyte, However, then-Genesis guitarist Steve Hackett's debut album featured the same name and a similar concept.Tears Of The Sun, Inlay information Release In The Region Of The Summer Stars was recorded at Sarm Studio during late 1974 and the winter-spring of 1975 and released in 1976 on BUK Records, a label owned by EMI. EMI deleted it from their catalogue soon after and lost the multi- track tapes for side two.Tears Of The Sun, inlay information In 1984, frustrated by the unavailability of the album, The Enid reconstructed it so that they could re-release it by themselves with substantial alterations made to the arrangements. The multi-track tapes for the music on side one came into their possession and so they were able to use most of them. Side one was essentially the same except that \\"Fool\\" was extended and some completely fresh music was added. Side two had to be completely re-recorded. It was re-recorded and mixed by Stephen Stewart and Robert John Godfrey at The Lodge Recording Studio near Clare, Suffolk. John Southard of TRAD Electronics provided them with the means to achieve the technical quality of the recording. It was digitally mastered and released on vinyl LP with slightly altered track names and \\"The Father and the Mother\\" by William Arkle as the new album cover.Information from the 1984 LP In June 2010, following what The Enid believe to be poor quality illegal bootlegs released by Inner Sanctum, EMI agreed to grant an exclusive worldwide licence for the original EMI release of the album to Operation Seraphim. The album was subsequently transferred from the original 30IPS 1/4 inch Dolby A tapes to 96 kHz 24 bit digital by Christian Curtis at Abbey Road. The tracks were mastered for CD by Max Read at The Lodge recording studio. The CD artwork was taken from the original releases and incorporated into an eight-page booklet.

The Toys \\"R\\" Us store relocated to Pinole Vista Shopping Center in the 1990s while the Montgomery Ward store went bankrupt company-wide and closed its location. The site fell into disuse and only supported a Mechanics Bank and some small ma 'n pa local businesses. In 2004, as part of redevelopment efforts to revitalize the city's \\"Main Street\\" - Macdonald Avenue - Richmond began to contemplate the revival of the city center. Richmond projects bright future ahead, new housing, eateries and retailers may help with city's $35 million budget shortfall, Contra Costa Times, April 26, 2004, access date 04-03-2009 This was envisioned as a way to ameliorate the budget deficit by acquiring additional sales tax revenue. The city controversially used eminent domain to demolish the entire mall, except the former Toys \\"R\\" Us store and Mechanics Bank sites. A new shopping center was built with modern central parking surrounded by shopping, as opposed to the classical retail architectural model of a centrally located retail structure building. The site is located between Macdonald Avenue, Interstate 80, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) tracks and the Richmond-Contra Costa County Health Center. The city plans to expand the center by demolishing the health center and former toy store building and constructing a Lowe's home improvement store and garden center. The county health center would be relocated to Doctor's Hospital in San Pablo. A Target Greatlands was originally envisioned; however, it was scaled down to a regular Target due to the state of the economy.

For instance, a national census might collect age, home address, educational level, employment status, and many other variables, recorded separately for every person who responds; this is microdata. Advantages Survey/census results are most commonly published as aggregates (e.g. a regional-level employment rate), both for privacy reasons and because of the large quantities of data involved; microdata for one census can easily contain millions of records, each with several dozen data items. However, summarizing results to an aggregate level results in information loss. For instance, if statistics for education and employment are aggregated separately, they cannot be used to explore a relationship between these two variables. Access to microdata allows researchers much more freedom to investigate such interactions and perform detailed analysis. Availability For this reason, some statistical organizations allow access to microdata for research purposes. Controls are generally imposed to limit the risk that this data may be abused or lead to loss of privacy. For example, the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series requires researchers to implement security measures, avoid redistribution of microdata, use microdata only for noncommercial research/education purposes, and not make any attempt to identify the individuals recorded. Names and fine-level geographical data are removed, some data items are altered as necessary to make it impossible to identify individuals, and small ethnic categories are merged. The International Household Survey Network has developed tools and guidelines to help interested statistical agencies improve their microdata management practices. The Microdata Management Toolkit is a DDI metadata editor which is now used in about 80 countries, with the support of the Accelerated Data Program, implemented by the PARIS21 Secretariat, the World Bank, and other partners, in the context of the Marrakech Action Plan for Statistics.

Through GIS implementation, several University-Doppler Radars, such as Missouri states X-Band Radar can be viewed. GRLevel3 is a Windows viewer for live NEXRAD Level III data from the NWS Radar Product Central Collection Dissemination Service (already produced 2D images). In addition to Level III WSR-88D data, GR3 supports TDWR, which is high resolution shorter range radar located at some major airports. Gibson also wrote GREarth, which overlays satellite and other data and, like the GRLevelX radar viewers, is customizable with GIS layers.GREarth User Guide = Algorithms = GR2Analyst contains algorithms flagging certain features in the reflectivity data. In reflectivities, GR2 extract the height above ground of the highest elevation where they are greater than 18 dBZ (echo tops), the vertically integrated liquid water content of clouds (VIL) and the VIL divided by the Echo tops which is an indicator of possible large hail. Further algorithm use environmental information about of and heights, inputted by the user, to output a hail algorithm size. The algorithm uses any temp/height data within 48 hours of the volume scan time. If no recent data is found, it defaults to and for the heights. The results are displayed with a high resolution of x 1 ¬∞ x grid with 256 data levels. There is an automatic extraction of the storm motion which is integrated in the algorithms for corrections.

Tidens F√∂rlag) Illustrated by Malvin Neset The Magic Chalk () is a nonsensical children's novel written by Norwegian author Zinken Hopp in 1949. The novel has a slightly satirical tone and includes puzzles and poems. Plot summary A boy named Jon finds a piece of chalk, dropped by a witch, and uses it to draw a stick man on a fence, not knowing that it is magic. The stick man becomes alive and claims his name is Sofus. Jon draws a door and together they enter a garden full of talking animals, some of whom they help out using the magic chalk. After being bothered by a pedagogic owl and doing some absurd mathematical problems, they leave and soon descend into a cave, wherein they meet a crocodile and a tiger, but the boys clear up alive. When they had come out from the other end of the cave, they found the house of a little old lady who serves them cookies shaped like animals, one for each letter of the alphabet. After talking to the animals - which can only say words that begin with their letter, they leave the grandmother. After walking for a while, they encounter Kumle, a friendly troll. He offers to trade three wishes per person for the chalk, so Sofus asks for a violin, a wallet that always has money, and candy that makes one grow grass instead of hair; Jon wishes for Sofus to be waterproof and for candy that works as an antidote to Sofus's, saving the third wish for later. Their wishes are granted and they agree to meet again. They enter a kingdom and Sofus decides to go to the castle. He charms the king, queen, and princess with his violin playing and claims to be rich, showing them his wallet as proof. The princess steals the wallet and the violin, and as a revenge, Sofus gives her and her parents his candy. Once the grass starts growing, the king attempts to imprison them, but they escape successfully. The public assumes that the royal family's grass is a type of hat and it becomes a fad, but as Autumn comes, the grass begins to wilt. Jon and Sofus go to the castle, and Jon gives the royal family his candy. The grass starts turning back into hair, but before it's done, Jon takes Sofus by the hand and asks for his third wish: to go back home. They immediately appear in his kitchen, where his mother is making dinner, and they tell her about everything that's happened to them. Reception BETTY MILES, of the Bank Street College of Education found the illustrations \\"appropriately dashing yet tenuous\\" and that \\"the hither-thither situations are set with typographical abandon\\". Kirkus Reviews describes it as \\"A delightful patchwork of fancy, puzzles, poetry, and nonsense...\\" that \\"At every step the reader's visual sense is challenged\\" and saw it as \\"an inventive world peopled with characters ... designed to consistently amuse and surprise.\\" Sequel A sequel for The Magic Chalk was published, named Jon and Sofus, which tells more of their adventures in the castle. In it, Kumle becomes a newspaper editor and publishes nonsensical articles and photographs, which parody the newspapers of the time.

Released direct-to-video, the film is based on the crimes of Chicago serial killer John Wayne Gacy, and stars Mark Holton as Gacy. Plot In 1953, the teenage John Wayne Gacy argues with his father who says he will \\"never be brave enough\\" and kicks him. In 1976, the adult Gacy's lunch with his family is interrupted by a neighbor demanding something be done about the stench coming from his crawl space. Gacy responds angrily that he will. Lunch is interrupted again when Steve, an employee of Gacy's, complains he has not been paid for two weeks. Gacy says he will be paid and orders him off his property. Gacy consults a friend who advises lime for the smell. While driving at night Gacy abducts a man and brings him back to his garage and tells him about his problems, then releases him. At work Gacy angrily berates his workers for smoking on the job. He asks his latest employee how he's enjoying working for him and if he enjoys wrestling. They wrestle in Gacy's back yard where Gacy pins him down and Steve, watching with another man, calls him a faggot. Gacy is furious. The next day, Steve and two other men attack Gacy as he comes out of a shop. Steve takes the money from Gacy's wallet, gives some to the other men and tells Gacy that he quits. Late that night, Gacy's wife, Kara, is awake in bed when she hears a car pull up. Gacy gets out and brings out someone handcuffed and bundles him into the garage. Investigating, Kara finds clothes strewn about in the garage. She runs to the crawl space entrance where Gacy bursts out, saying that he had been laying down lime. Gacy hosts his 4th of July fancy dress party during which he offers Tom Kovacs a job and a speech is made honoring Gacy as an asset to the community. He hires an exterminator to take care of the maggots and cockroaches gathering in the crawl space. Questioned by two police officers about Steve's disappearance, he says Steve told him he was going to Costa Rica or Puerto Rico. One day, Gacy hits one of his employees over the head with a hammer. After cleaning him up, he pays him for his silence and lets him go. Kara discovers a pair of handcuffs and some homosexual magazines in the garage. Gacy blames some employees, saying \\"you know how I feel about homos\\". A few days later, Kara takes the two girls and leaves Gacy alone with his mother. Tom is having problems at home so Gacy suggests he rent Gacy's spare room. Another late evening, Gacy picks up a male prostitute and stuffs a chloroformed rag into his face. The prostitute awakens suspended by chains in Gacy's garage. The next morning, Gacy leaves the prostitute in the park where he stumbles away. Gacy lays concrete in the crawl space to try and cover the stench. He meets with Jim Burle and agrees to buy his car. Inviting Burle in for a drink, he instead drowns him in the bath tub. Gacy is running out of room in the crawl space. As Gacy and Tom are watching a video reel of how Gacy started his business, the video cuts to pornography. Tom freaks out and spends the night awake and terrified. Tom decides to leave, but Gacy tricks him into being handcuffed and starts strangling him. Tom manages to escape and runs to the police. While Gacy is out of the house the police enter and find dozens of watches and drivers licenses. Gacy is arrested as the police exhume the bodies from the crawl space. The film ends with Gacy's last words in prison.

Chuck Wilson of LA Weekly found Gacy to be an \\"unenlightening\\" and \\"unconvincing\\" film that suffered from \\"dime-store psychology\\" and a failure to \\"convey the subtleties of Gacy‚Äôs scheming intellect.\\" Mike Long of DVD Talk gave the film a half star out of a possible five, opined that it \\"offers no suspense, no gore, and no thrills\\" and concluded, \\"If nothing else, a film about a serial-killer should offer a glimpse inside the criminal mind. If it can't do that, it could at least be an entertaining exploitation film. Gacy is neither of those things and there is absolutely no reason to see this movie.\\" Reel Film Review's David Nusair commended Mark Holton's performance as Gacy, but lambasted the film itself, which he derided as being an ineptly written and directed \\"bore\\" that \\"completely fails to make any kind of impact.\\" Conversely, Gacy was praised for its \\"dark, disturbing insight into Gacy\\" by Steve Barton of Dread Central, who went on to write that the \\"horrifying and informative\\" film was \\"well- worth seeking out to learn more about America's most notorious serial killer.\\"  References  External links   Category:2003 films Category:2003 direct-to-video films Category:2003 horror films Category:2000s crime drama films Category:2003 independent films Category:2000s serial killer films Category:2000s thriller films Category:American films Category:American crime drama films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American horror thriller films Category:American independent films Category:American serial killer films Category:Biographical films about serial killers Category:Direct- to-video horror films Category:English-language films Category:Films about John Wayne Gacy Category:Films set in 1953 Category:Films set in 1976 Category:Films set in 1977 Category:Films set in 1978 Category:Films set in Chicago Category:Films set in Wisconsin Category:Films shot in California Category:Horror films about clowns Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:LGBT-related horror films Category:LGBT-related films based on actual events Category:American police detective films Category:2003 drama films ","title":"Gacy (film)"},{"id":"21725616","text":"Hlebowicz family or Hlebowiczowie were a powerful noble (szlachta) and magnate family from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Background Alex Rose, the son of a wealthy leather tanner, was born in Warsaw, Poland. After secondary school, Rose immigrated to the United States, having been denied a Polish university education because he was Jewish. Career However, the outbreak of the First World War forced Rose to abandon professional aspirations and take a job as a millinery worker; in 1914 he joined the Cloth Hat, Cap, and Millinery Workers' International Union (CHCMW) and became interested in organized labor. In 1918, Rose joined the British Army, and upon returning to America in 1920 resumed union organizing activities. He worked his way through union leadership and was elected president of the United Hatters, Cap and Millinery Workers International Union (UHCMW) in 1950, where Rose sought to root out Communist and gangster influence from unions. In 1934, the CHCMW merged with the United Hatters of North America to form the United Hatters, Cap and Millinery Workers International Union. In 1936, Rose assisted in founding of the American Labor Party. Because the communists acquired influence in the ALP, in 1944 Rose, along with David Dubinsky, Ben Davidson, and others founded the Liberal Party of New York. Rose became its vice-chairperson. Under Rose's leadership, the Liberal Party was quite influential in New York politics and somewhat influential in national politics, exercising power by endorsing Democratic and occasionally, liberal Republican candidates. In 1966 Rose successfully lobbied Senator Robert F. Kennedy to campaign on behalf of judge Samuel Silverman to clean up corruption from the surrogate court. Rose was one of the most brilliant political strategists of the 20th century. Perhaps his greatest triumph was in the New York City mayoral election of 1969. John V. Lindsay was elected mayor as a fusion candidate (Republican-Liberal) in 1965, but was denied the Republican nomination in 1969. Alex Rose directed Lindsay's reelection campaign in 1969 as the Liberal candidate against both Democratic and Republican opponents so successfully that he not only was reelected, but he brought on his coat-tails enough Liberal councilmen to displace the Republicans as minority party in the City Council. Legacy One block of W. 186th Street in Manhattan (between Chittenden Avenue & Cabrini Boulevard) is named \\"Alex Rose Place.\\" After Rose's death in 1976, leadership of the Liberal Party passed to Raymond B. Harding, who also exerted a considerable amount of influence in New York State politics until the party lost its ballot line in 2002.

The school's campus is located near the town of Flint Hill, about 90 minutes from Washington, DC. Founded and in continuous operation since 1972, the school is accredited with the Virginia Independent School Association. The fifth largest employer in Rappahannock, the school as of May 2020 had an enrollment of 150 students from that county and eight others ‚Äî Culpeper, Fauquier, Frederick, Madison, Page, Prince William, Shenandoah and Warren. The school's stated mission \\"is to develop each student's character and intellect through active involvement in a highly-structured curriculum founded on classical principles\\" that \\"inculcates a love and understanding of the achievements and moral underpinnings of Western Judeo-Christian culture.\\" The theory behind this is that \\"[o]nce students have gained this appreciation of their civilization and their nation, their personal development can proceed on a firm foundation and with confidence.\\" According to Wakefield's outreach materials, the school offers \\"a college prep education designed to produce students who can write well, who possess strong critical thinking skills, and who are motivated by a high sense of ethical responsibility to themselves and to the community at large.\\" The school's strategy for achieving this is based on the classical tradition of teaching the trivium of logic, grammar, and rhetoric, with a strong emphasis on communication in English and other languages. The average class size is about 12 students, allowing for a great deal of individualized attention. The small number of students also means that they all have the opportunity to be on a sports team, as opposed to having to compete for the opportunity. History In 1972, Wakefield founder William E. Lynn Jr. established the school because he wished to create a British-style private school that was affordable for the middle class. He wrote the first Word of the Day and Great 100 books, established traditions such as the annual competition between \\"Spartan\\" and \\"Athenian\\" athletic teams, and also taught English and grammar full-time at the school. Philippe Cugnon, a Frenchman and college professor, led the school for a year, and then Lynn took over. After Lynn's death, his wife took over as principal. In 1991, while the school was under Allen Sounders's leadership, Wakefield School split off to form a separate school in Marshall, Virginia. Mrs. Lynn then rebuilt W.C.D.S. with 50 students attending. Wakefield School has tended to have more students, while the enrollment of W.C.D.S. has hovered around or below 200 students. The school has experienced numerous funding crises that threatened to force its closure, but it has always been rescued by donations and long-term loans from the community. In 2012, Jessica Lindstrom, recipient of a 1991 Outstanding Teacher Award from the Virginia Association of Independent Schools, was appointed by the Wakefield board to serve as Head of School, replacing Kathleen Grove, who had served in the position for eight years. Enrollment peaked in 2014 with more than 200 students. As of 2017‚Äì2018, the school had enrollment of 180 students, including 90 high school students and 17 international students, 11 of whom were staying with host families and 6 of whom were living on campus. The student/teacher ratio was 11:1. Enrollment subsequently dropped due to 25 seniors' graduating and the loss of some Chinese international students to Canadian, Australian, and Chinese schools. In April 2019, the school's board surprised the WCDS community with a two-page letter warning that the school would have to close its doors unless a tremendous amount of money were raised in a few weeks' time, and that in the long run, it would need to enroll at least 200 students in order to survive. A small number of patrons agreed in a matter of hours to lend the school hundreds of thousands of dollars, interest-free. Tandem Friends School alumnus and former Charles E. Smith Co. CFO Paul F. Larner, whose son had recently graduated from Wakefield, stepped up to become board chairman, replacing alumnus Brett Hayes following a public relations debacle. Larner opined that the school should stop its \\"overfixation on 110, 120, 150, 180\\" or other enrollment numbers, and avoid relying exclusively on international students as \\"our only salvation\\". Rather, in his opinion, the school should seek \\"to be judged by the education we deliver and the environment we create and sustain for our families\\" and reach out to the people of Rappahannock County \\"of great means, with prominent positions of sometimes national stature, who probably don't know Wakefield.\\" With regard to the school buildings, he remarked: :Wakefield is not going to sell itself on its facilities. It's when people walk through the door and feel the devotion and kindness and commitment to education that they come here. In a way our facilities in their current condition are somewhat of a marketing positive for us because it sends the message that where we spend the money is on the quality of the education ‚Äî teachers, faculty, and the like ‚Äî and not on building new monumental buildings. In February 2020, the board of directors announced that after an extensive search process, Patrick M. Finn had been chosen by unanimous vote to be the next Head of School, beginning 1 July. Previously, Finn worked at The Canterbury School, St. Timothy's School, and Foxcroft School. Outgoing Head of School Jessica Lindstrom, who had served in that position for eight years and made a decision in fall 2019 to step down, praised Finn's experience as an administrator in independent schools and said, \\"I see a bright future for WCDS and leave the school knowing it is in good hands\\". At the beginning of the 2020 COVID-19 Crisis, the school briefly appeared in local news after a student trip to Northern Italy and Provence which coincided with the first explosion of the virus in Italy raised fears that the returning students could become spreaders. The school was closed as a precaution but since there were no cases, it reopened. A few weeks after, it closed again during the statewide shutdown ordered by Virginia Governor Ralph Northam and transitioned to distance learning, along with the rest of the country. Although the school is currently organized as a nonprofit corporation, the Lynn family has always been involved in its governance. Welby Lynn Griffin, daughter of the founders and Latin, History, and English teacher at the school, serves on the board of directors as the Lynn family representative. The board also includes parent, faculty, and alumni representatives. AcademicsCore prep school curriculum= The Upper School, or core prep school, is a program of 28 credits molded in the classical tradition. The curriculum includes an emphasis on English, mathematics, history, and classical and modern foreign languages. An advanced classical diploma is available with 32 credits, including four additional credits in mathematics, science, and foreign languages. Latin and the research, writing, presentation and defense of a senior thesis are required for graduation. Students also complete an internship with local professionals as part of their graduation requirements. Every day, students at every grade level spend two class periods on English literature, composition, vocabulary, and grammar. Another two class periods are devoted to foreign language and/or linguistics. Historically, French has been taught from pre- kindergarten, although in 2019, Director of Admissions and Development Suzanne Zylonis spoke of Spanish being taught from elementary school and the older students being taught French, Spanish, Latin, and Greek. In addition, the school offers an optional program of instruction in the Roman Catholic faith for students in grades one through twelve. =College counseling= Students begin their college counseling process in their freshman year. Over the next four years, they meet with their advisor to discuss college choices, take the PSAT and ACT Aspire and any advanced placement tests that are appropriate, complete questionnaires, resumes, and self-assessments, write mock college essays, participate in mock interviews, and meet with college admission representatives who visit the campus. They are also encouraged to take part in extracurricular activities. All students apply to at least two colleges or universities. 90 percent of them are accepted into the colleges and universities of their first choice. WCDS graduates as a group receive between one and two million dollars annually in merit scholarships. = Adjunct faculty = In the fall of 2019, Wakefield Country Day School announced the first adjunct faculty in the history of the school. This group includes several prominent local residents, including: World Bank managing director Caroline Anstey; investor, financier and businessman Charles T. Akre; former conductor of the United States Marine Band John R. Bourgeois; U.S. Tax Court judge Joseph H. Gale; actress Louise Caire Clark; and former Clerk of the United States House of Representatives Jeff Trandahl. According to chairman Larner, the 35 adjunct faculty members are all \\"high profile and esteemed people\\" in their careers. These adjunct faculty members share their knowledge with the students through talks and seminars, as members of senior thesis panels, and through internships. They also speak at the Wakefield Forum, which is an opportunity for the public to hear adjunct faculty discuss topics and engage one another in expert dialog. Funding and tuition From May to November 2019, benefactors donated more than $2 million to the school for tuition assistance and to support ongoing operations. This included $1.2 million in scholarships to fund 25 students for three years. According to the school, every family with demonstrated financial need is offered assistance via scholarships or financial aid, with most of them ultimately accepting it and enrolling their children, deeming the help sufficient to meet their needs. As of 2020, 65 percent of Wakefield students were receiving some form of financial assistance. However, the school notes, \\"no family at WCDS receives full tuition assistance. All families are expected to pay something toward their children's education\\". Traditions A-Frames, chosen by the founders to give the school an architecture distinctly different from the public schools of the time. W.C.D.S. traditions include the weekly assembly in which the headmistress makes announcements to the school body, the annual Spartans vs. Athenians competition, Certamen, the Latin convention, and the Classical Recital, the Lord of the Rings Feast, and the Medieval Banquet. All 7th and 8th graders travel to England as an extension of their study of British history. High schoolers take a trip to Italy (for upper school classics), France, Spain, or Argentina (for upper school language immersion), and/or Budapest (for Model United Nations). Academic traditions include the Word of the Day in which students memorize vocabulary, and the Great 100, in which students memorize the biographies of 100 important historical figures. The school's colors are red and white; in the Spartans vs. Athenians competition, which is inspired by the Ancient Olympic Games and serves essentially as a field day, the students are divided into two teams, with the Spartans wearing red and the Athenians wearing white. First, each team assembles into a formation of parallel rows for inspection by the faculty for proper discipline and deportment. Then, they participate in a series of competitions, such as Capture the Flag. British traditions such as the use of demerits and elected prefects to enforce discipline are practiced. Prefects may be put in charge of overseeing their classes in the absence of the teacher, and together the prefects form a court to question students suspected of violating the academic honor code. Older students also mentor younger students through the Language Ambassador, Reading Buddy and Bus Buddy programs. Students wear a uniform, including a dress uniform on Wednesdays, the day of the weekly assembly. Among the stated goals of the uniform are \\"discouraging the superficial expression of 'individuality' in lieu of positive and substantive development of each student's unique personality\\", allowing students to \\"focus on learning and achievement without the distractions of variations in clothing\\", causing students to \\"see themselves as neat, well-dressed, and attractive\\" and reinforcing \\"school identity, a sense of community, school pride, and school security\\" by making students who attend the school readily recognizable. Other traditions have included the Christmas and spring plays, and the Christmas concert. A former courtesy that used to be practiced was that all male students would rise whenever a lady entered the room; this has since been revised to state that all students stand when an adult of either sex enters the room. Notable students Notable students have included, for example, Leonard M. Cowherd III, who graduated from West Point, graduated third in his United States Army Armor School class at Fort Knox, and was commissioned as a U.S. Army second lieutenant. While stationed overseas in the Iraq War, he wrote a series of guest columns to the Culpeper Star-Exponent about his experiences and observations as a tank platoon leader. After exiting his tank to secure a building near Karbala's Mukhayam mosque, which had been the scene of intense fighting during a recent raid to oust the Mehdi Army insurgents who had been using the mosque as a base of operations, he received enemy sniper and rocket-propelled grenade fire and was killed. Subsequently, his story and correspondence were featured in the Bill Couturi√© documentary Last Letters Home. A scholarship was established in Cowherd's memory. Another notable student was Jacob G. Foster, who placed number one in the world on advanced placement tests in French literature, calculus, modern European history, biology, Latin, physics, and other subjects; scored a perfect 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test; and became a Rhodes scholar and later a mathematical physicist and sociologist.

Laves polyhedron Laves phases are intermetallic phases that have composition AB2 and are named for Fritz Laves who first described them. The phases are classified on the basis of geometry alone. While the problem of packing spheres of equal size has been well-studied since Gauss, Laves phases are the result of his investigations into packing spheres of two sizes. Laves phases fall into three Strukturbericht types: cubic MgCu2 (C15), hexagonal MgZn2 (C14), and hexagonal MgNi2 (C36). The latter two classes are unique forms of the hexagonal arrangement, but share the same basic structure. In general, the A atoms are ordered as in diamond, hexagonal diamond, or a related structure, and the B atoms form tetrahedra around the A atoms for the AB2 structure.The Laves Phase Structures . nrl.navy.mil.

Many hypothetical or primitive applications have been developed. However, little practical knowledge has been elucidated from Laves phase study so far. A characteristic feature is the almost perfect electrical conductivity, but they are not plastically deformable at room temperature. In each of the three classes of Laves phase, if the two types of atoms were perfect spheres with a size ratio of \\\\sqrt{3/2} \\\\approx 1.225, the structure would be topologically tetrahedrally close-packed. At this size ratio, the structure has an overall packing volume density of 0.710. Compounds found in Laves phases typically have an atomic size ratio between 1.05 and 1.67. Analogues of Laves phases can be formed by the self-assembly of a colloidal dispersion of two sizes of sphere.

It is part of the Australian 7th Brigade, attached to Forces Command (Australia). 2 CER's lineage is formally traced to 4th Field Company (4 Fd Coy) Royal Australian Engineers, which was raised in the early stages of World War I. Renamed 7th Field Company (7 Fd Coy) in 1915, the unit was renowned for its service in France and Belgium at the Battle of the Somme, Menin Road and on the Hindenburg Line. During World War II, 7 Fd Coy fought the Japanese at Kokoda and on Bougainville. HistoryWorld War I= The Defence Act (1903) precluded the deployment of Militia units outside Australian territory. To support British forces during World War I, the Australian government was required to raise an all-volunteer force for overseas service, known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF; known later as the First AIF). The 4th Field Company was raised in New South Wales and renamed the 7th Field Company (7 Fd Coy) on 20 September 1915.McNicol 1979, p. 60.Bean 1941, p. 806. The first parties from the company departed Sydney November or December 1915 on HMAT Suffolk, followed by several groups of reinforcements over the next few years. Officers from the 7th Field Company in Belgium, December 1917 Assigned to the 2nd Division, the company served in Egypt and France during World War I, where it saw action in the Battle of the Somme, Menin Road and the Hindenburg Line.McNicol 1979, pp. 71, 93 and 129. Key roles undertaken by engineers during the war included field construction, signalling, obstacle breaching, tunnelling and mining, and river crossing and bridging tasks. The company's final war diary entry was made in April 1919 just prior to their repatriation to Australia. It returned to Australia and disbanded on 23 May 1919. There are 77 entries for members of the company on the Australian War Memorial's Roll of Honour listing personnel who lost their lives while serving with the company. At least 480 personnel are believed to have served with the company during the war. =1921‚Äì1939= In 1921, the Australian government decided to restructure the part-time Citizens Forces units to replicate the numerical designations and perpetuate the honours of the AIF.Grey 2008, p. 125. As a result, on 1 May 1921, 7 Fd Coy was re-raised as part of the 1st Division, based in Ipswich.McNicol 1982, pp. 4 and 21. =World War II= During World War II, the Defence Act continued to bar the Militia from overseas service and the government raised a second Australian Imperial Force (Second AIF).Grey 2008, p. 146. Militia units also undertook brief periods of continuous service, for training and home defence duties. If AIF volunteers constituted more than 65% of a unit's personnel, the entire unit could be gazetted as an AIF unit and deployed overseas. Sappers from the 11th Field Company bridging the Jaba River, Bougainville, May 1945 With Japan's entry into the war in December 1941, the Malayan Campaign and Fall of Singapore, the strategic situation worsened significantly. 7 Fld Coy was called out for full-time service within Australia in May 1942. Later, 7 Fld Coy was re-gazetted as an AIF unit. The unit served in Papua New Guinea and fought against the Japanese along the Kokoda Track and on Bougainville until the end of the war.McNicol 1982, pp. 149, 153 and 216. Another Militia sapper unit from Queensland, the 11th Field Company (which had been based at Kelvin Grove and Toowong before the war), also saw active service in New Guinea and Bougainville.McNicol 1982, pp. 5, 186, 216. =1946‚Äì1951= 7 Fd Coy returned to Australia on 3 January 1946 and disbanded on 4 February 1946. On 19 June 1947, a Special Survey Troop was activated for employment on the proposed Rocket Range at Woomera and then later expanded.Greville 2002, p. 29. The unit was involved in the construction of facilities for the nuclear tests conducted at Emu Claypan during the 1950s. On 11 March 1949, this unit became the Special Construction Squadron, RAE and was renamed 7 Field Squadron (7 Fd Sqn).Greville 2002, p. 30.

(The Approved Defence Projects Protection Act of 1947 overturned provisions of the 1903 Act barring the use of defence personnel for such purposes.) =1951‚Äì1989= The unit was reassigned to 1 Field Engineer Regiment in June 1951, before being re-designated as 7 Independent Field Squadron and grouped with the 1st Infantry Brigade at Casula and Holsworthy.Greville 2002, p. 33. During this time, the unit provided the nucleus of personnel used to form the 1 RAR Assault Pioneer Platoon, which subsequently took part in operations along the Pusan Perimeter during the Korean War.Greville 2002, p. 443. In 1955, elements of the squadron ‚Äì 4 Troop ‚Äì deployed to South-East Asia and participated in the Malayan Emergency.Greville 2002, p. 34. On 28 December 1958, the unit deployed to Vanuatu to provide humanitarian support after a tropical cyclone. In June 1960, the Australian Military Forces were reorganised along a divisional basis with the adoption of the Pentropic organisation, and 7 Independent Field Squadron (redesignated 7 Fd Sqn) moved to Wacol, Queensland.Greville 2002, pp. 35‚Äì36. Between June and December 1964, eight officers and 132 other ranks from 7 Fd Sqn deployed to Borneo during the Indonesia Confrontation to conduct tasks such as road and airstrip construction.Greville 2002, pp. 617, 620 & 636. On 1 December 1971, Divisional Engineers re-organised into regiments and 7 Fd Sqn became part of the 2nd Field Engineer Regiment (2 FER) which was allocated under command Headquarters 6th Task Force at Enoggera, Queensland. 2 FER consisted of 7 Fd Sqn, 2 Field Squadron (2 Fd Sqn), 24 Support Squadron (24 Spt Sqn) and a Workshops. 17 Construction Squadron, on its return from Vietnam in late 1971, was renamed 17 Field Squadron (17 Fd Sqn) and in mid-1973 was merged with 7 Fd Sqn, 2 FER.Greville 2002, pp. 43‚Äì44. In August 1981, 2 FER became 2/3 FER following the disbandment of 1 FER and the merging of 3 FER. 2/3 FER was based at Enoggera, Queensland and now consisted of 1 Field Squadron (Holsworthy), 7 Fd Sqn (Enoggera), 18 Field Squadron (Townsville) and a Workshops. In July 1987, 35 Field Squadron and 11 Field Squadron (11 Fd Sqn‚Äîformerly 11th Field Company and ex-5 FER located at Kelvin Grove), was brought onto the 2/3 FER unit status. At the time, it was the single largest regiment on the Army Order of Battle. =1989‚Äì1999= In 1989, 7 Fd Sqn consisted of a Headquarters, 13th and 14th Field Troops and 24th Support Troop. In March that year, the United Nations acting under UN Resolution 435, formed a military force‚ÄîUnited Nations Transitional Assistance Group (UNTAG)‚Äîfor deployment to the war torn country of Namibia (formerly South West Africa) a protectorate of South Africa. The mission was to supervise the withdrawal of the South African Defence Force (SADF), assist those displaced by the war to return home, and to pave the way for the first 'free and fair' elections ever held in that country. The 17th Construction Squadron was mobilised for deployment and augmented by the 14th Field Troop. This contingent was sent to the northernmost part of Namibia, to an ex-SADF base at Ondangwa, in close proximity to the Angolan border for the majority of the deployment. 14th Field Troop was responsible for unexploded ordnance and landmine clearance tasks. They were deployed between March and September 1989 and handed over to elements of the 15th Field Troop, 18 Fd Sqn. Following the Force Structure Review in 1991, 2/3 FER was broken into 1, 2 and 3 Combat Engineer Regiments (CERs) with 2 CER being raised first on 24 November 1991 and remaining at Enoggera. 2 CER is also the oldest of the CERs. 2 CER now became part of 7th Brigade and comprised 7 Combat Engineer Squadron (7 CE Sqn), 20 Engineer Support Squadron (previously 20 Divisional Engineer Support Squadron) and 11 Operational Support Squadron (logistic support and workshops). During the Ready Reserve experiment of the 1990s, 2 CER increased its establishment of Reserve members. In July 1997, when the 6th and 7th Brigades were amalgamated, 2 CER amalgamated 11 Field Squadron, and a platoon of combat engineers was detached to 6 RAR to take part in a motorisation trial.Belham and Denham 2009, pp. 168‚Äì169. = Since 1999=Sydney Olympics 2 CER next underwent a change during 1999, when it was assigned the task of forming and commanding the new Joint Incident Response Unit (JIRU), in support of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games as part of Operation GOLD. The unit was split, with the majority of personnel moving to Holsworthy to form the JIRU (and subsequently the new Incident Response Regiment [IRR]), leaving a small Headquarters element and 7 CE Sqn in Enoggera. In July 2001, the Regiment underwent a force structure review which saw the unit grow in strength once again. 2 CER became a fully integrated unit consisting of a Regimental Headquarters, an Operational Support Troop (Catering Section, Q Store and Workshops), 7 CE Sqn (Reserve), 11 CE Sqn (Regular) and 20 Support Troop (Integrated). East Timor From April‚ÄìOctober 2001, a composite engineer troop was deployed to support the 4 RAR Battalion Group in East Timor and undertook a wide variety of construction and combat engineering tasks along the border between East and West Timor. During November 2003 ‚Äì June 2004, 2 CER supported the 6 RAR Battalion Group (AUSBATT IX) in East Timor.Belham and Denham 2009, p. 179. 2 CER subsequently led an independent Company Group in support of a multi-national United Nations Security Force as part of Operation SPIRE during the period December 2004 ‚Äì June 2005. This force conducted a wide variety of support engineering and combat service support tasks in support of other United Nations forces deployed to the country. 2 CER elements returned to Timor Leste in the 8/9 RAR Timor-Leste Battle Group from January‚Äì October 2010, as part of Operation ASTUTE. Banda Aceh In December 2004, elements of 2 CER were deployed to provide humanitarian assistance in Banda Aceh (Operation SUMATRA ASSIST) after a tsunami was experienced within the Indonesian region and South West Pacific rim. 2 CER engineers provided civil military liaison support, cleared debris, recovered human remains, provided clean water and assisted with the humanitarian effort.Regimental Journal 2005, pp. 42‚Äì52. Afghanistan 2 CER deployed Squadron or larger size groups to Afghanistan's Or≈´zgƒÅn Province on four occasions as part of Operation SLIPPER. 2 CER(-) deployed as Reconstruction Task Force-2 over March ‚Äì October 2007.Belham and Denham 2009, p. 188. 2 CER deployed a Combat Engineer Squadron Group as part of the 750 strong 6 RAR Task Group (also known as Mentoring Task Force-1) over February‚ÄìOctober 2010, and subsequent Squadron Groups to the 8/9 RAR Task Group (MTF-4) and the 3 RAR Task Group (MTF-5) in 2012. 2 CER personnel were deployed in a wide variety of roles including training and mentoring members of the Afghan National Army, and undertaking route clearance, high-threat search, construction tasks and infantry missions. The regiment lost three soldiers killed in action and over 20 soldiers wounded in action. Queensland floods In January 2011, in the aftermath of the 2010‚Äì11 Queensland floods, 2 CER deployed throughout Brisbane and the surrounding region to assist with recovery and cleanup as part of Operation Queensland Flood Assist. 2 CER deployed elements to Bundaberg during Cyclone Oswald, notably building a military bridge over a flood-damaged highway bridge to re- open the Isis Highway over the Burnett River. Operation Parapet 2014 In 2014, 2 CER provided the foundation of the ADF's technical and high risk domestic search capability for the Group of Twenty (G20) meeting in Brisbane. Combined with elements from 1& 3 CER, 2 CER supported the Queensland Police Service through the provision of specialist explosive detection capabilities. Operation Fiji Assist 2016 Cyclone Winston had a devastating effect on the people of Fiji in February 2016. As the online Engineer Squadron, 7 CE Squadron initially deployed at short notice with plant operators and tradesman from 24 Spt Squadron and logistics support staff from the Operational Support Squadron, to provide Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief as part of the Amphibious Task Force assigned to support the people of Fiji. They were subsequently reinforced with members of 2 CE Squadron after the return to Australia of the Amphibious Task Force. The Engineers worked with the Republic of Fiji Military Forces, initially on Koro Island and subsequently in Rakiraki on the main island, to alleviate suffering and assist in a return to normalcy. The works included repairs to roads, infrastructure, schools, medical facilities, hazard reduction, structural assessments and debris clearance. Other missions and future role Throughout its history, individual members of the unit have also been involved in operations in Cambodia, Somalia, Pakistan, Rwanda, the Solomon Islands and Bougainville, and support to police during the several Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings (CHOGM). In addition to its military role, 2 CER also works closely with the local Queensland community in times of emergency. This was demonstrated in November 2008 following the worst storms in Brisbane since 1985 when 2 CER co- ordinated the large scale Defence-assisted relief efforts.Australian Sapper 2009, p. 41. In 2008, it was announced that the regiment would receive new barracks in 2014 as part of the Australian Army's Enhanced Land Force (ELF) initiative.Australian Sapper 2008, p. 17. The regiment raised another regular squadron, designated 2 Combat Engineer Squadron, in 2011. In 2012, 2 CER became the largest combat engineer unit in the Australian Army. With the establishment of the 11th Engineer Regiment, 11 Combat Engineer Squadron was scheduled for transfer to the new Reserve unit on 1 January 2015. 2 CER has an official Bond of Friendship with 2 Combat Engineer Regiment in Petawawa, Canada.

The series was produced by Warner Bros. Television, Silver Pictures Television and Rob Thomas Productions, and Joel Silver and Thomas served as the executive producers. The season revolves around Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell), a high school student and private investigator in the fictional Southern California seaside town of Neptune. When Veronica's best friend, Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried), is murdered, her life falls apart. Her father, County Sheriff Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni), accuses Lilly's father of being involved in the murder. This provokes Neptune's wrath and Keith's ousting as sheriff in a recall election. Veronica's mother, Lianne (Corinne Bohrer), develops a drinking problem and leaves town. Veronica's \\"09er\\" friends‚Äîwealthy students from the fictional 90909 ZIP code‚Äîforce her to choose between them and her father; she chooses her father. Keith opens a private investigation agency, Mars Investigations, where Veronica works part-time. The series was critically acclaimed, and appeared on several fall television best lists. The first season garnered an average of 2.5 million viewers per all 22 episodes in the US. Out of all regular primetime programming that aired during the 2004‚Äì2005 American television season, Veronica Mars ranked #148 out of 156, according to the Nielsen ratings system. The pilot was watched by 2.49 million viewers, while the finale was watched by 2.99 million viewers. Cast The main characters of the first season include (from left to right): Mallory Dent, Wallace Fennel, Eli \\"Weevil\\" Navarro, Duncan Kane, Veronica Mars, Logan Echolls, and Keith Mars. The first season features a cast of seven actors who receive star billing. Kristen Bell portrays the titular Veronica Mars, a high school junior and skilled private detective. Teddy Dunn plays Duncan Kane, Veronica's ex-boyfriend and Lilly's brother. Jason Dohring plays Logan Echolls, the \\"bad-boy\\" 09er son of an A-list actor. Percy Daggs III portrays Wallace Fennel, Veronica's best friend and frequent partner in solving mysteries. Francis Capra portrays Eli \\"Weevil\\" Navarro, the leader of the PCH Biker gang and Veronica's friend. Enrico Colantoni plays Veronica's father Keith Mars, a private investigator and former Balboa County Sheriff. Sydney Tamiia Poitier plays Mallory Dent, Veronica's journalism teacher at Neptune High. Although she was given series regular billing, Poitier appeared in only four episodes, but was given credit for seven. Kristen Bell was chosen to play Veronica Mars from more than 500 women who auditioned for the role. Bell felt that it was \\"just luck\\" that Rob Thomas saw that \\"I have some sass to me, and that's exactly what he wanted\\". Bell thought that it was her cheerleader looks and an outsider's attitude that set her apart from the other women who auditioned. Jason Dohring, who played Logan Echolls, originally auditioned for the role of Duncan Kane. Teddy Dunn originally auditioned for Logan, but ended up portraying Duncan Kane. Dohring felt that his audition for Duncan \\"was a little dark\\", and he was told by the producers that it was \\"not really right\\". The producers asked Dohring to read for the role of Logan, which involved reading Duncan's lines. Dohring acted one scene from the pilot, in which he shattered the headlights of a car with a crowbar. During the final auditions, Dohring read two times with Bell and met with the studio and the network. When reading with Bell, Dohring acted the whole scene as if he had raped her, and tried to give the character an evil and fun feel. At the time of Dohring's audition for Logan, the character was only going to be a guest star in the pilot. Thomas described Amanda Seyfried, who portrayed the murdered Lilly Kane, as \\"the biggest surprise of the year\\". When casting a series regular, he was able to see all the best actors in town, mainly because they all wanted to be a series regular. When casting Lilly Kane, who would only appear from time- to-time as \\"the dead girl\\", Thomas did not receive the same standard of actors. Thomas said that he had \\"never had a more cut and dry audition\\" than he did with Seyfried. He said that she was \\"about 100 times better than anyone else that we saw, she was just spectacular\\". He continued by saying that she ended up being so good in the series that he used her three or four more times than he initially planned. ReleaseCritical reception= Kristen Bell's performance as the protagonist generated critical acclaim. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 97% with an average score of 7.97/10, based on 30 reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"Veronica Mars is geared towards teens, but its sharp writing, excellent acting and thoughtful subject matter make for an entertaining and attractive drama for TV fans of all ages\\". Metacritic gave the season a Metascore‚Äîa weighted average based on the impressions of a select fifteen critical reviews‚Äîof 81, signifying \\"universal acclaim\\". James Poniewozik of Time labeled the series as one of the six best dramas on television. He praised Bell as \\"a captivating star,\\" and said that the series \\"uses its pulp premise to dramatize a universal teen experience: that growing up means sleuthing out the mystery of who you really are.\\" Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times called Veronica Mars an update to the \\"classic California film noir\\". She felt that Veronica Mars was the best new series on UPN, and that the title character was potentially \\"this season's most interesting character creation\\". McFadden described the series as \\"Alias in its attitude, Raymond Chandler in its writing and The O.C. in its class-consciousness.\\" James South of Paste praised the \\"crisp, clever writing\\", and noted the supporting characters were more than just plot devices. He commended Bell's portrayal of Veronica as \\"simultaneously smart, vulnerable, tough and injured\\", and found the guest stars were well-utilized. South wrote the remaining cast was \\"uniformly good\\", but gave Dohring a special mention for his acting. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com praised the first-season finale for being \\"just the sort of satisfying capper you look for in a series that, week after week, keeps you asking questions\\". Robert Abele of LA Weekly said that \\"in this smart, engaging series about a former popular girl turned crime-solving high school outcast, the hard-boiled dialogue comes from its teen protagonist's mouth in a way that stabs any potential cutesiness in the heart with an ice pick.\\" Joy Press of The Village Voice saw the series as \\"a sharp teen noir in the making\\", \\"[pulsing] with promise\\". However, Press felt that the series paled somewhat compared to the television series Wonderfalls. Filip Vukcevic of IGN gave the season a positive review, particularly praising the amount of audience participation. However, the reviewer felt that several of the main characters were undeveloped, and that Daggs III and Dunn, as well as their respective characters, were \\"boring\\". Vukcevic wrote that while the ultimate resolution to the murder was satisfying, it was not \\"world-shattering\\". =Awards= The first season was nominated for seven awards, winning one. In 2005, Veronica Mars received the American Film Institute Award for Television Programs of the Year, and was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Breakout Show, and the Television Critics Association Awards for Outstanding New Program of the Year. Kristen Bell was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Television Actress, the Satellite Award for Outstanding Actress in a Series, Drama, the Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Breakout Performance, Female, and the Television Critics Association Awards for Individual Achievement in Drama. =Distribution= The ratings for the first season of Veronica Mars in its original United States airing. The CTV Television Network began airing Veronica Mars in Canada as a mid-season replacement on May 30, 2005. Living began showing the series in the United Kingdom in October 2005, averaging 50,000 viewers per episode for its first season. Veronica Mars premiered in Australia by Network Ten on November 28, 2005, where the series saw erratic airings. TV2 began showing the series in New Zealand on July 15, 2005. The first season of Veronica Mars was released in the US under the title Veronica Mars: The Complete First Season as a widescreen six-disc Region 1 DVD box set on October 11, 2005. In addition to all the episodes that had been aired, DVD extras included an extended \\"Pilot\\" episode, over 20 minutes of unaired scenes and an unaired opening sequence. The same set was released on May 16, 2008 in Region 2, and on June 4, 2008 in Region 4. Ben Fritz of Variety criticized the DVD for a lack of special features, but noted that the producers were forced to release the set early to attract more viewers. Fritz believed that Warner Bros. owed fans a better DVD set \\"chock full of commentaries, interviews and deleted scenes in context\\". Likewise, Anita Srikamswaren of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was surprised by the minimal number of extras. Srikamswaren pointed out that despite the early release, it was still two weeks after the second-season premiere.  Episodes  When Veronica discovers new evidence that suggests that Lilly's convicted killer is innocent, she decides to investigate the case. As Veronica delves deeper into the murder, she also works on other investigations, seeks her mother's whereabouts and deals with the aftermath of being drugged and raped during an 09er party. Veronica, no longer part of the school's wealthy in-crowd, makes some new friends: Wallace, Neptune High basketball star; Weevil, leader of the PCHers, a biker gang; and Mac, Neptune High's resident computer genius. Using her friends' resources, as well as those provided by her father and his contacts, Veronica gains a reputation for sleuthing and finds her skills in increasingly high demand at her school. Things get more complicated when Veronica falls into a relationship with Lilly's ex-boyfriend Logan, who for a time held Veronica partly responsible for Lilly's death and went out of his way to harass her.

Life and career  Constantine was born ca. 1230, to Andronikos Palaiologos, Grand Domestic of the Empire of Nicaea and his unknown second wife. The life of Constantine is unknown until 1259, when he was appointed Caesar by his elder half-brother, Michael VIII. The following year, he was also created a sebastokrator. He commanded the Byzantine forces on an unsuccessful campaign against the Latin Principality of Achaea, where his army was routed at the Battle of Prinitza. However, Constantine had already left the region by the time of the major Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Makryplagi in 1263/1264.Hooper, N. & Bennett, M., The Cambridge Illustrated Atlas of Warfare (1996), p. 104 Books.Google.com Sometime after returning from the campaign against the Principality of Achaea, Constantine became a monk under the name Kallinikos.'Byzantine 1261-1453' from Medieval Lands by FMG and Cawley, C.

It grows in a tight rosette approximately 5 to 7 cm in diameter with 20 to 30 green to red leaves that are arranged in concentric layers. The leaves are typically 1 cm wide and are usually described as being \\"kidney-shaped\\" with crimson leaf margins. It grows in deep silica sands in open woodland or coastal heathland and only flowers after a bush fire, which is speculated to be caused by the release of ethylene. Its white, sweetly perfumed flowers, which are very similar to those of D. erythrorhiza, emerge on 4 to 5 cm tall scapes.Gibson, R. 1994.

It was first collected near the Swan River Colony by James Drummond.Diels, L. 1906. Droseraceae. In A. Engler [ed.], Das Pflanzenreich, vol. 4, 112. (Heft 26), 1‚Äì128. W. Engelman, Weinheim, Germany. Those specimens collected by Drummond were just two barren rosettes; later authors would try ascertain the proper species for these specimens. George Bentham in 1864 questioned the species status of D. zonaria and suggested that the Drummond specimens might actually be examples of D. rosulata. In the 1930s, both Ludwig Diels and Charles Austin Gardner omitted this species name in their discussions of the genus. The type specimen was even recorded under the name D. erythrorhiza at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The species was finally rediscovered near Guildford in 1952 by M. C. Russell, who then also saw it in flower for the first time in May 1954. By the time Rica Erickson wrote her 1968 book Plants of Prey in Australia, no other flowering specimen of D. zonaria had been found.Erickson, R. 1968. Plants of Prey in Australia. Lamb Paterson Pty.

Early life and education Abess' father, Leonard Abess Sr., was the son of Romanian Jewish parents who moved from Providence, Rhode Island, to Miami to work as an independent auditor at the First National Bank of Florida. His mother, Bertha (n√©e Ungar), was the daughter of Arthur Ungar, a Miami automobile dealer and a founder of Temple Israel of Greater Miami. In 1946, his father co-founded (with Baron de Hirsch Meyer) the City National Bank of Florida, one of the first postwar banks in the region. In 1949, after local hospitals refused to hire Jewish doctors, Leonard Sr. and other Jewish residents of South Florida, pooled their resources and founded the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. Abess Jr. graduated from The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He started his career at the bank in its print shop. Career Abess became majority owner and chairman of the City National Bank in 1984. The bank had $400 million in assets when he purchased it, which had grown to $2.75 billion at the time of its sale in 2008. In November 2008, Abess sold his 83 percent share of the bank to the Caja Madrid banking group for $927 million and shared $60 million of the proceeds with 399 current staff members and 72 former employees. On February 24, 2009, President Barack Obama praised Abess in his State of the Union Address and invited Abess and another bank employee to be his guest at the speech. Abess was later recognized as one of Time Magazine's Time 100 in 2009. Leonard Abess is a former Director of the Miami Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank. Philanthropy Abess serves as a Trustee of the University of Miami and in 2006 donated $5 million to establish the Abess Center for Ecosystem Science and Policy.

Pletz in 1935.Pletz, V. J. Gen. Chem. (U.S.S.R.) 5, 173 (1935) and originally mistranslated in some articles as \\"plosophore\\". Also of note is an auxoexplose concept (similar to chromophore and auxochrome concept), which is a group that modifies the explosive capability of the molecule. The term explosophore has been used more frequently after its use in books such as Organic Chemistry of Explosives by J. Agrawal and R. Hodgson (2007)'.  Properties  Nitrogen-containing explosophores (groups I, II and II below) are particularly strong because in addition to providing oxygen they react to form molecular nitrogen, which is a very stable molecule, and thus the overall reaction is strongly exothermic. The gas formed also expands, causing the shock wave which is observed.  Classification  Pletz grouped the explosophores into eight distinct categories. Handrick, G.R., Lothrop, W.C. Chem.

He was the first chairman of the South Australian Football Association (SAFA) (later named South Australian National Football League (SANFL)), and a South Australian first-class cricketer, but he is best known for coming up with the idea of the Magarey Medal. Magarey was born in North Adelaide, and educated at St Peter's College and the University of Adelaide, from which he graduated in 1884 to become a practising lawyer. From about 1890 he was a partner with George Murray in the law firm Murray & Magarey, a firm which continues today, after several mergers and name changes, as Finlaysons Lawyers. He became interested in football administration, and in 1897 was appointed the South Australian Football Association's inaugural chairman. Magarey, nicknamed 'Beautiful Bill', attempted to wipe out much of the rough play from the league by instituting an award which would be given to the fairest and most brilliant player each season. From the first Magarey Medal in 1898, he personally presented the award to the winners, until his death in 1929. Despite his contribution to Australian rules football, Magarey excelled most at cricket during his younger years. He appeared in a first- class cricket match for South Australia vs New South Wales at the Adelaide Oval in December 1890, and he was bowled by Australian Test player Percie Charlton for a duck in his debut innings. He was demoted to number ten in the batting order for the second innings, where he was dismissed by another Test cricketer, Sydney Callaway, for seven. New South Wales went on to win the match by six wickets. Personal On 5 March 1910 William Magarey married Gulielma Hack (17 October 1867 ‚Äì 2 August 1951). They had no children. Gulielma, best known as Guli Hack, was a noted soprano, pianist and singing teacher associated with the Elder Conservatorium, and granddaughter of John Barton Hack. In 1901, William Magarey was enrolled in singing classes at the Elder Conservatorium; Guli Hack was his teacher.University of Adelaide Archives, Series 6, Elder Conservatorium Student Progress Reports, Folder 2. https://archives.adelaide.edu.au/#details=ecatalogue.859 ReferencesExternal links *Cricinfo: William Magarey Category:1868 births Category:1929 deaths Category:Cricketers from Adelaide Category:Australian cricketers Category:South Australian National Football League administrators Category:South Australia cricketers Category:People educated at St Peter's College, Adelaide ","title":"William Ashley Magarey"},{"id":"21727120","text":"Koreans in the Netherlands form one of the smaller Korean diaspora groups in Europe. As of 2017, 8,147 people of Korean origin (expatriates and immigrants from North or South Korea and 2nd-generation Koreans) lived in the Netherlands. Demographic characteristics , statistics of the Dutch Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek showed: *15 North Korean-born and 3,733 South Korean-born persons *12 persons of North Korean origin and 577 persons of South Korean origin born locally to two parents from outside the Netherlands *3 persons of North Korean origins and 3,156 persons born locally to one South Korean-born parent and one parent born in the Netherlands For a total of 8,142 persons, not including ethnic Koreans from other countries. This represented more than five and a half times the 1996 total of 1,492 persons, and growth of between 4% and 8% over the previous five years; the overwhelming proportion of the growth is attributable to increase in the foreign-born population rather than births in the Netherlands. However, Koreans still formed little more than a minute proportion (0.1%) of the total number of persons of foreign background. 2011 statistics of South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade show a much smaller total of 1,771 persons, little changed from the 2009 total. Among those recorded, 108 were Dutch citizens, 614 were permanent residents, 253 were international students, and the remaining 796 had other types of visas. 629 lived in Amsterdam or its surroundings, 521 in Rotterdam, and the remaining 621 in other parts of the country, but mainly in other larger urban areas such as The Hague, Utrecht, Eindhoven, etc. Adoptees About 4,000 of the people of Korean origin in the Netherlands consist of Korean adoptees. Dutch interest in adoption of babies from Asia began to pick up in the late 1960s; Dutch writer Jan de Hartog, who himself had earlier adopted two Korean War orphans, was promoting charitable activities for children in Vietnam who had been orphaned due to the Vietnam War bombings of Hanoi and Haiphong in 1966. In 1968, he appeared on the television show hosted by Mies Bouwman with his two adopted Korean daughters; after this broadcast, nearly a thousand people called the studio and expressed interest in adopting Korean babies. Between 1970 and 2000, Dutch parents adopted 3,993 South Korean babies. The number of adoptions has fallen off; from 1995 to 2006, the total number of adoptions from South Korea was 349, with just two in 2005 and only one in 2006. This made South Korean adoptees about 10.9% of the 3,194 international adoptions and 2.25% of the 15,467 total adoptions during that period. A small number of adoptees have relocated to South Korea; however, due to cultural differences and the high expectations placed on their behaviour due to their external appearance of being Korean, they find it difficult to fit in there, and also find themselves the objects of unwanted pity for their status as adoptees. Education During the 2008-09 academic year, 283 South Korean international students were enrolled in Dutch higher educational institutions, only a small proportion of the 216,780 total South Koreans studying overseas that year. The number showed a slow but steady increase from just 56 students in 2000-01, before plateauing around 2005-06. The Netherlands Organization for International Cooperation in Higher Education also reported receiving many enquiries from South Korean parents interested in enrolling their children in primary and secondary education in the Netherlands. South Korean universities such as Yonsei University and Sungkyunkwan University have signed memoranda of understanding with Dutch universities; however, these have not led to active student exchange programmes. Though Europe in general is becoming an increasingly popular destination for South Korean students, growth in their numbers in the Netherlands is inhibited by the perception that knowledge of the Dutch language is a prerequisite to studying in the country, along with the attractiveness of competitor destinations such as the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. In 2012, Nuffic (the Netherlands Organisation for International Cooperation in Higher Education) estimated that 650 South Korean students were enrolled at Dutch Universities. Nuffic, various Dutch universities, and Heineken cooperated to offer scholarships totalling ‚Ç¨255,000 to 21 South Korean students that year. There are two Korean weekend schools in the Netherlands registered with South Korea's National Institute for International Education Development. The first of the two, the Amsterdam Korean School, was established in May 1979; , it employed 14 teachers and enrolled 90 students, including eight adult students. The other, the Korean School of Rotterdam, was established in April 1996; it employed 14 teachers and enrolled 89 students, including 20 mature students. Religion The South Korean embassy lists five Korean churches in the Netherlands (three in Amsterdam and one each in Rotterdam, Eindhoven and Leidschendam). The World Buddhist Directory also lists one Korean Buddhist temple, of the Jogye Order, located in Amsterdam.

Pierce Street in Sioux City, Iowa. Built in 1927 as a vaudeville and movie palace, the theatre was restored in 1999 and today is the home of the Sioux City Symphony Orchestra.http://www.siouxcitytourism.com/orpheum.htm Early history The Sioux City Orpheum was designed by the nationally known Chicago firm of Rapp & Rapp and constructed in 1927 as part of the Orpheum Circuit. The major builder for the theatre was local Sioux City businessman, Arthur Sanford. It was one of the largest theatres in Iowa at its time and was certainly somewhat of a risk financially for Mr. Sanford, with a total construction cost of 1.75 million. This once opulent vaudeville and moving picture house boasted a large 2,650 seat, three story auditorium complete with Wurlitzer pipe organ, half circle boxes, hand carved detailing, gilded ornamentation, several crystal chandeliers and a hand painted ceiling. Throughout the years, the Orpheum was used for symphony performances, ballet and special attractions and hosted entertainers such as Fred Astaire, Tallulah Bankhead, and Katharine Hepburn.http://www.orpheumlive.com/history/index.php Restoration According to Ray Shepardson, a nationally known theatre restoration specialist, because of the work of filmmaker George Lindblade, the project may be the most extensively documented major theatre restoration in the United States. Lindblade's documentary \\"Puttin' on the Glitz\\" is the latest in a long list of award-winning projects. Over the decades, the theater suffered numerous insensitive remodels but has recently returned spectacularly to life thanks to a dedicated team of restoration expert and craftspeople.http://www.architectureweek.com/2003/1203/culture_1-1.html In 1982, the theater was \\"twinned\\" or cut into two small movie houses, and a wall of sheet rock was placed down the center aisle. These movie theaters operated until 1992 when for the first time in 65 years, the Orpheum went dark.http://www.architectureweek.com/2003/1203/culture_1-2.html The reconstruction, overseen by Ray Shepardson, was started in 1999 with the expertise of architect Ed Storm, AIA from FEH DESIGN in Sioux City at a cost of nearly $12 million. During the renovation 3 of the original crystal chandeliers were found intact above the drop-ceiling. Their single toughest problem was reconstructing the balcony and loge boxes. It took four months and 40,000 pounds of steel to complete the reconstruction. When the theater reopened in the fall of 2001, reporter Robert Morast wrote in the Sioux Falls Argus Leader: \\"Basically, the Orpheum feels like an upper-class theater ripped out of an old black-and-white movie and given a Technicolor treatment. The ambiance alone is worth the price of admission.\\"http://www.architectureweek.com/2003/1203/culture_1-3.html The Orpheum Theater was publicly reopened on 15 September 2001. Recent performances have been given by Bill Cosby, Sheryl Crow, B.B. King, Bob Dylan, Olivia Newton-John, Wynton Marsalis and David Copperfield. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

The Saxon Steed (; ; Low Saxon: Witte Peerd) is a heraldic motif associated with Lower Saxony, Kent and Westphalia. Origin and past uses The horse as a heraldic charge associated with Saxony first appears in the late 14th century, at which time it was described as an \\"old Saxon\\" motif. For this reason, there has been a long history of antiquarian speculation identifying the motif as a tribal symbol of the ancient Saxons. A tradition first recorded in 1492 reports that the 8th- century Saxon ruler Widukind displayed a black horse as his field sign.Cronecken der sassen. Mainz 1492. The horse motif was adopted by the House of Welf, whose original symbol was a golden lion on red ground. It has also been used in several provinces in Westphalia (therefore, it is also called Westfalenross, meaning \\"Westphalian steed\\", or Welfenross, meaning \\"Welf steed\\"). After this, it became the heraldic animal of the Kingdom of Hanover (since 1866 the Prussian Province of Hanover), of the Prussian Province of Westphalia and since 1922 of the Free State of Brunswick. This tradition continues in two modern federal States of Germany: Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia. File:Flag of Hanover 1837-1866.svgFlag of the Kingdom of Hanover (1837‚Äì1866). File:Coat of Arms of Hannover.svgCoat of arms of the Prussian Province of Hanover (1868‚Äì1946). File:Coat of Arms of Westphalia.svgCoat of arms of the Prussian Province of Westphalia (1815‚Äì1946).

Modern uses The white horse is similar to the one used in the coat of arms for the county of Kent in England, which is likely to have originated in the Rhineland area. The coat of arms of the German state of Lower Saxony shows a white Saxon steed (Sachsenross) on a red background. The steed became the coat of arms of the Province of Hanover as a province of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1866 after it had been in use for the Duchy of Brunswick and the Kingdom of Hanover since 1814. It appears on some of their 19th Century coins and postage stamps. It was even in use after the abolition of German monarchy after World War I until 1935, when state flags were prohibited by the Nazis and only the flag of Nazi Germany was to be used. =Coat of arms of Lower Saxony= Coat of arms of Lower Saxony After World War II, the Province of Hanover became an independent state on 23 August 1946, and used the steed as its coat of arms again. Brunswick, which was also an independent state, had made the same decision some weeks before, on 8 July 1946. When these two states, along with Oldenburg and Schaumburg-Lippe, were merged into the new state of Lower Saxony, the Saxon steed became the unofficial coat of arms of the new state, and later the official one. =Coat of arms of North Rhine-Westphalia= Coat of arms of North Rhine-Westphalia. The Saxon steed is also shown in one of the three sections of the coat of arms of North Rhine-Westphalia, particularly associated with the area of Westphalia. British royal arms Royal banner of arms (Hanoverian) In 1714 the House of Hanover became united in personal union with the United Kingdom. As a result, the Saxon Steed is found in the British royal arms during the Hanoverian period. Official sign of Dutch Twente region Flag of Twente Football club FC Twente's banner and logo To express the Saxon heritage of the Twente region, local language and culture enthusiast J.J. van Deinse designed a common flag in the 1920s. The region borders on both the German states of Lower Saxony and North-Rhine-Westphalia. The local language, Tweants, is commonly classified as an extension of the Westphalian branche of the Low Saxon language. Within the Netherlands, it is known to be one of the more traditional (or conservative) varieties of the language. Due to growing interests and pride in local culture, the Saxon steed has become a popular image. It can be found in varying formats and appearances, as well as to various degrees of stylisation in the likes of local football club FC Twente's logo, the local branch (Twents) of a Dutch public transport provider, and a growing range of other instances. United States The King George County, Virginia adopted the shield of 1714 British royal arms,Public Board Meetings thus the Saxon Steed is found in the seal of King George County.

Early life  Betty Charbonnet was born in 1921 in Detroit to Dorson Louis Charbonnet and Lottie Breaux Allen, both natives of Louisiana. Her father came from a Creole background, and her mother from a Cajun background. Her great-grandmother had been born into slavery in 1846. She spent her early childhood living in New Orleans, until a hurricane and flood destroyed her family's home and business in 1927, when her family then relocated to Oakland, California.\\"Oldest National Park Ranger Shares 'What Gets Remembered',\\" NPR Wisdom Watch, May 15, 2014. During World War II she worked as a file clerk for Boilermakers Union A-36, a Jim Crow all-black union auxiliary. Her main job was filing change of address cards for the workers, who moved frequently. In June 1945, she and her then husband, Mel Reid, founded Reid's Records in Berkeley, California, a small black-owned business specializing in Gospel music. They moved to Walnut Creek, California in the 1950s, where their children attended better public schools and an alternative private elementary and middle school called Pinel. The family encountered considerable racism, and she and her husband were subject to death threats after they built a home in the white suburb. Career She became active in the Mount Diablo Unitarian Universalist Church and the Black Caucus of the Unitarian Universalist Association, and in the 1960s became a well-known songwriter in the Civil Rights Movement. Reid's Records in Berkeley, California, 2014 She was divorced from Mel Reid in 1972, and subsequently married William Soskin, a psychology professor at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1978, after Mel Reid's health and finances had declined, she took over management of the music store, which led to her becoming active in area civic matters and a prominent community activist. Reid's Records is still in business . She later served as a field representative for California State Assemblywomen Dion Aroner and Loni Hancock, and in those positions became actively involved in the early planning stages and development of a park to memorialize the role of women on the Home Front during World War II. Those efforts came to fruition when Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park was established in 2000, to provide a site where future generations could remember the contributions women made to the war effort.

She has been celebrated as \\"a tireless voice for making sure the African-American wartime experienceboth the positive steps toward integration and the presence of discriminationhas a prominent place in the Park's history.\\" Park Ranger Soskin has said, commenting on her life in 2015 at the age of 93: \\"Wish I'd had [the] confidence when the young Betty needed it to navigate through the hazards of everyday life on the planet.

Located about north-east of Gueudecourt village, the memorial marks the spot where in October 1916, the Royal Newfoundland Regiment played a decisive role in the capture and holding of a German strong-point. The site also marks the furthest point of advance from the July 1st starting line of all British units during the Battle of the Somme. Background Following the huge losses of the First day on the Somme, the Newfoundland Regiment continued to see service, although the regiment remained significantly understrength. After taking on reinforcements, the regiment was back in the front line on 14 July near Auchonvillers. The Newfoundland Regiment along with entirety of the 88th Brigade was transferred to the Ypres Salient on 16 July 1916, which at that time was a quieter portion of the Western Front. A period of recovery coupled with additional reinforcements would eventually help the regiment return to full strength. After spending ten weeks in the Ypres Salient, the 88th Brigade was temporarily attached to the British 12th Division, which was holding Gueudecourt. By nightfall on 10 October, the regiment manned a section of the trench on the northern outskirts of the village. The battle The attack began at 2:05 pm on 12 October. The regiment advanced in line with the 1st Essex Battalion on their left. The men kept so close to the supporting artillery barrage, that several became casualties from the shrapnel of their own supporting guns. The Germans were compelled by the shelling to remain under cover and as a result were quickly engaged in hand-to-hand fighting. By 2:30 p.m. both assaulting battalions of the 88th Brigade had secured their initial objective, Hilt Trench in the German front line. As the Newfoundlanders advanced to their final objective, Grease Trench some from their starting line, heavy machine-gun fire coming from the front and the right flank forced the regiment back to Hilt Trench. On their left flank, a German counter-attack drove the 1st Essex Battalion back to the outskirts of Gueudecourt, leaving the Newfoundlanders with an open flank. Newfoundland bombing parties cleared and secured the vacated portion of Hilt Trench and as a result doubled the length of the regiment's front line. All ranks began digging in the hard chalk to construct a new firing step and parapet and reverse the former German position. In the late afternoon the expected German counter-attack developed but Newfoundland small arms fire managed to drive off the German attack. The position was held against further assaults and during the night of 12 October, the arrival of a relieving battalion of the 8th Brigade enabled the Royal Newfoundland Regiment to hand over their responsibilities and go into reserve. During the 55 hours that had elapsed since they had entered the trenches on 10 October, the Newfoundland Regiment had suffered 239 casualties, of whom 120 had been killed or died of wounds. The Regiment was one of the few units on the whole of the British Fourth Army front to capture and retain its objective. Memorial The Gueudecourt Memorial is one of five erected in Europe by the Newfoundland government following the First World War. Four were erected in France at Beaumont-Hamel, Gueudecourt, Masni√®res and Monchy-le-Preux, another is in Courtrai/Kortrijk in Belgium. A sixth memorial is situated in Bowring Park in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada and was a gift from Major William Howe Greene, OBE, who served with the Newfoundlanders during the war. The memorials are all centrally identical, featuring the emblem of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, a caribou, cast in bronze, as designed by British sculptor Basil Gotto. The caribou, standing atop a cairn of Newfoundland granite, calls out in the direction the Newfoundlanders faced toward the enemy during the battle. The cairn is also surrounded by native Newfoundland plants. The Gueudecourt Memorial is situated on the D574 road, about north-east of the village, on a site that was the British front line of 17 November 1916, the final day of the British offensive at the Somme. Clearly visible behind the caribou as seen from the memorial entrance, is a preserved trench line. The area of the memorial was seized by Newfoundland troops from the Germans on 12 October 1916 and marks the farthest point of advance of British units during the Battle of the Somme..

He owned one of the most successful radio stations on the island (WKBM AM) and in 1954 founded Puerto Rico's television Channel 11, which now is known as Tele Once and owned and operated by Univision, the largest Hispanic television network in the United States. Early years Rafael P√©rez Perry was born in Guayama, Puerto Rico to a father of Spanish descent and a mother of French descent. When he was a child his family moved to New York City, where he received his primary and secondary education. He went to college after he graduated from high school and earned a degree in engineering in the field of electronics.Rafael P√©rez Perry profile, oslpr.org; accessed April 14, 2017. Radio broadcasting pioneer P√©rez Perry returned to Puerto Rico in 1934 with the intention of going into business as an electronic engineer. At first he failed in his attempts because of the lack of experience and capital. However, it wasn't long before he was able to establish several radio workshops in San Juan, Rio Piedras and Santurce. P√©rez Perry was hired by the Government of Puerto Rico as a communications consultant. He founded the \\"Escuela del Aire\\" (Airwaves School) which in 1945 became the radio station known as \\"WIPR\\". His radio station was located in the Condado area of San Juan. During this time he also worked as a consulting engineer for Angel Ramos's \\"El Mundo Enterprises\\". Telecadena P√©rez Perry His radio station had its transmitters in the City of Arecibo and operated from his facilities in San Juan. P√©rez Perry moved the operations of his radio broadcasting station to the City of Mayag√ºez and in 1954 founded \\"WKBM\\", Channel 11, his first television station. It wasn't until 1960, that the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) finally granted P√©rez Perry the license to operate WKBM. On August 1960, P√©rez Perry inaugurated his television station which he named \\"Telecadena P√©rez-Perry\\". Among the shows which Telecadena P√©rez Perry aired throughout the years were: Se Alquilan Habitaciones, Una Hora Contigo, Tira y Tapate, Yo Soy el Gallo (with Jos√© Miguel Class), El Show de Carmita, Cita Con Las Estrellas, El Show de Lissette, El Show de Iris Chac√≥n, El Hit del Momento, El Super Show Goya, Una Chica llamada Ivonne Coll, Cambia Cambia (with Alfred Herger), Angela Luisa Dice (with Angela Luisa and Jos√© Luis Torregrosa), Almorzando/Del Brazo (both with Ruth Fern√°ndez), La Criada Malcriada (with Norma Candal), and Mediodia Circular (with Vilma Carbia), among others.Television Boricua , freewebs.com; accessed April 14, 2017. From 1965-74, Telecadena P√©rez Perry aired soap operas imported from Peru's Panamericana Television. Under P√©rez Perry's leadership Channel 11 became the first television channel in Puerto Rico to present its \\"News\\" broadcast, \\"El 11 en Las Noticias\\" (11 in the News), with a journalist \\"panel\\" and a news anchor. Among the television news journalists who began their careers in Channel 11 were Silvia Gomez, Pedro Zervigon and Carmen Jovet. Later years On May 10, 1978, Rafael P√©rez Perry died from a heart attack while working on a Channel 11 transmitter at Cerro la Marquesa located in the town of Aguas Buenas. P√©rez Perry had had three children, Papo, Icha and Ingrid. From his marriage to Zayda Ramirez de Arellano. After his death his children continued to run the operations of P√©rez Perry Enterprises until 1981, when WKBM declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. In 1986, Lorimar- Telepictures acquired the station from bankruptcy Court and changed its call sign to the current WLII. The channel was branded as \\"Tele Once\\" with a new slogan: \\"Tele Once‚Ä¶ V√≠velo!\\" (Tele Once‚Ä¶ Live it!). It was subsequently sold to Malrite Communications Group in 1991. In 2002, Univision entered into a local marketing agreement with Raycom Media to operate WLII and WSUR-TV. At the time, WLII had a longtime local marketing agreement with another Puerto Rican station, WSTE, which Univision honored. Both WLII and WSUR-TV were sold to Univision in 2005.

Through them, the film explores several longstanding issues among the Navajo and their relations with the United States government and corporations: environmental racism, white supremacy, media and political representation, off-reservation adoption, and denial of reparations for environmental illnesses due to uranium mining in Monument Valley, Utah, which was unregulated for decades. Bill Kennedy served as the film's executive producer; his late father had produced and directed the earlier silent film The Navajo Boy (1950s), which featured the Cly family. In 2000, the film was an official selection of the Sundance Film Festival. It has won numerous awards.  The Cly family  The producers wanted to tell the full story of the Cly family, who were residents of the Navajo Nation in Monument Valley, Utah. They had earlier been the subjects in the silent film The Navajo Boy. Through their story, the director and family intended to explore many of the issues with which the Navajo Nation has had to struggle since the early 20th century: land use and environmental contamination, off-reservation adoptions, health education, enforcement of treaty rights, relations with the United States government. Much of the story in the 2000 film is told by the chief subject, Elsie Mae Cly Begay, the eldest of the children shown in The Navajo Boy. She is the oldest living Cly featured in the 2000 film. Her mother Happy Cly died of lung cancer, which the family believed was caused by environmental contamination from unregulated uranium mining on the reservation. Elise Mae Begay has lost two sons, one to lung cancer and the other to a tumor, whose deaths she attributes to uranium contamination near the house where they lived when her sons were children. (Constructed in part of contaminated rock, the structure was torn down in 2001.)) As uranium was mined for four decades in six regions on the reservation, the result has been numerous sites of abandoned mine residues and tailings, including near Begay's former home. In some areas, families used contaminated rock to build their homes. The air and water have also been contaminated. \\"By the late 1970s when the mines began closing, some miners were dying of lung cancer, emphysema or other radiation- related ailments.\\" At the time of Happy Cly's death, her youngest son John Wayne Cly was an infant. Christian missionaries adopted the boy. Elsie Mae Begay insists that the family agreed only to have her brother John cared for, but that he was to be returned to the family when he was six years old. They lost track of him, but through the making of the film, the Cly family was reunited with their long-estranged brother John Wayne Cly. Elsie Mae's late grandparents, Happy and Willie Cly, were the main subjects of the earlier film. The \\"Navajo Boy\\" for whom the original film was named was Jimmy Cly, Elsie Mae's cousin.  Film's reception  The Return of Navajo Boy was aired on PBS November 13, 2000 List of Independent Lens films#Season 2 (2000). It has won awards at film festivals and is regularly screened at activist events, in public libraries and colleges, where it used for education related to the issues covered in the film.\\"Screenings\\", Return of Navajo Boy Website Elsie Mae Begay has become a public activist, telling her family and the Navajo Nation's story on college campuses and to Congress, to try to have practices changed and such health hazards controlled. Her daughter-in-law, Mary Helen Begay, has been filming webisodes of the EPA clean-up effort, with a camera supplied by Groundswell Educational Films, which produced the documentary. With an updated epilogue in 2008, the film was shown on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC to Congressional and EPA staff.\\"Washington, DC Premiere of Return of Navajo Boy, with updated Epilogue\\", Groundswell Films In 2008 Congress authorized a five-year, five-agency clean-up plan to mitigate environmental contamination on the Navajo reservation. Since the film was made, Bernie Cly, one of the Navajo family featured, has been awarded $100,000 in compensation from the US government under the 1990 Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. The legislation was passed to compensate mine workers and residents for environmental damages due to uranium mining, especially from the 1950s through the 1970s, as the US government was the sole purchaser of the product.Jennifer Amdur Spitz, \\"Navajo Film & Media Campaign Win Clean Up of Uranium\\", Press Release, 22 August 2011, accessed 5 October 2011 Changes in law and practice The Navajo Nation had long been concerned about the effects of uranium mining on their members at the reservation, due to longterm effects from direct and indirect exposure to contaminants. Their EPA has identified numerous sites that need hazardous waste remediation. In 2005, the Nation was the first indigenous nation to prohibit such mining on its reservation. Following identification of contaminated water and structures, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Navajo Nation have developed a five-year, multi-agency plan to clean up contamination from the sites. In 2011, it was completing the first major project, to remove 20,000 cubic yards of materials from the abandoned Skyline Mine, near Begay's former home.

They established Fort Ross in 1812 and hunted sea otter. The gold rush of the mid-19th century brought an onslaught of European- Americans to the region, who disrupted tribal life and destroyed tribal lands.History. Cloverdale Rancheria of Pomo Indians. 2008 (retrieved 26 Feb 2009) In the early 20th century, the US government created a system of rancherias, or small reservations, for displaced Californian Indians. In 1921 the US recognized the Cloverdale Rancheria and deeded to the tribe; however, in 1953 the California Rancheria Act divided the reservation lands into individual allotments. The act also terminated relations between the US federal government and the Cloverdale Rancheria, as well as 43 other Californian tribes. Tillie Hardwick (1924‚Äì1999), a Pomo woman, sued the United States in the 1979 over the California Rancheria Act and termination policy. In 1983 she won the lawsuit, paving the way for 17 California tribes to regain federal recognition, including the Cloverdale Rancheria. In 1994, tribal landowners were forced by California Department of Transportation to sell their land for a U.S. Route 101 bypass. The freeway ran directly through the middle of the reservation, rendering much of it uninhabitable. Today Despite challenges, the Cloverdale Rancheria remain committed to preserving and sustaining their traditional culture. In 2006 a traditional dance group formed to teach Pomo dances and to the youth.

Unfortunately the soviet industry could not provide an electric heating feature, therefore the engines were restricted to freight trains for which their gearing was too high. Subsequently, the 'DR Class 131 with a reduced top speed of (and thus a higher tractive force) was delivered for freight services. When in 1972 an electric heating system was available, two prototypes were constructed. Due to poor track conditions in GDR the top speed was limited to , and so the DR Class 132s top speed was reduced to that. This class became the backbone of GDR diesel traction. Later six DR Class 142 units were produced in 1977, but due to the planned electrification of many major lines such powerful engines were not necessary any more. After reunification Classes were renumbered according to West German practice, thus as mainline diesels the prefix \\"2\\" was necessary: the Class 130 was renumbered to DBAG Class 230 and Class 131 to DBAG Class 231; both were soon pulled out of service. The renumbered DBAG Class 232 are still in service and have taken over many freight services in Western Germany. Some Class 132s underwent reconstruction under DBAG ownership, forming the classes 234 (top speed , class 233 (new 12-cylinder engine) and 241 (new engines with .  Design  Driving cab of a DBAG Class 232 The locomotives are constructed on a steel frame with attached carbody; units with electric heating are longer due to the extra space requirements. The two 3-axle bogies pivot on a central pin, with primary suspension being of the coil spring type with additional dampers. The power transmission is electric. In the original Class 130 a 16-cylinder turbo-charged diesel engine created electric energy for the nose-suspended DC traction motors. (Some rebuilt locomotives have 12-cylinder engines). Due to construction and the electric power transmission the class 232 locomotives are very heavy. The axle load of 20.3 t allows usage only on main lines. Side view of 5D49 engine The power for the unmodified classes is powered by a direct- injection, 16-cylinder, four-stroke, Diesel engine (of type 5D49) delivering when turbocharged The fuel capacity is 6000 litres, additionally 1100 litres of engine oil is used. The diesel engine of the V 300 had significant initial problems; the original crankshaft was made from ductile cast iron but was prone to cracking, particularly after the winter. The cast cranks were replaced with forged versions providing running for 20,000 hours, but initially they suffered from low surface hardness; this problem was solved by nitriding the surface, and by locally heating the surface with a CO2 laser (see annealing). The engine drives an AC generator whose current is rectified by six-way rectification using 240 diodes. Traction motor power control is achieved via the engine (i. e. using the throttle) and by thyristor 'choppers'. ClassesDR Class 130 / DBAG Class 230= DR 130, DB Museum, Koblenz The class was unveiled at the Leipzig Spring Fair in 1970 as 300 001 V, the locomotives were trialled by the VES-M in Halle as the Class 130, and this designation was carried into service. The first locomotive was given to the Leipzig Hbf-South railway, and it was here that the nickname Ludmilla was given to these machines. The 80 machines in the Class 130 series had bogies and gearing suitable for movement at , but without train heating, so were used mainly for heavy freight service (a task for which they were not optimally suited, being geared for with a corresponding lower tractive effort.) All but a few locomotives had their top speed reduced to - these locomotives ran as the subclass DR 131.1. The two test machines for electric heating were given the operating numbers 130 101 and 102, being structurally most similar to the main tranche of Class 130s. After reunification the machines became members of Class 230, previously this designation had applied to the single DB Class V 200 variant also known as V 300.001 =DR Class 131 / DBAG Class 231= When it became evident that the locomotives would be used mainly for freight due to the lack of electric heating, 76 vehicles were re-geared for maximum speed of only (without electric brake). These 76 machines were classified as Series 131. =DR Class 132 / DBAG Class 232 and variants= 232 614-8 of DB Schenker in Piatra Neamt, Romania. This version is the most widespread in the class, and this exact example was made in 1979 The development of the DR Class 132 was spurred by Voroshilovgrad Locomotive Works' new capability to provide locomotives with electric heating. The first two test machines (built in 1972) had a maximum allowable speed of and were therefore considered to be of Class 130 numbers 101 and 102. They were always stationed at the test centre VES-M Halle, and when incorporation into the new Deutsche Bahn came they were classed as the 754 series.The 7xx class designations are used for infrastructure, testing and maintenance vehicles The Class 132s entered service in 1974, 709 locomotives of this class were built. Under the Deutsche Reichsbahn the maximum allowable line speed was limited and so in operation these locomotives had a top speed of . Under the Deutsche Bahn numerous locomotives of this class were rebuilt: Bulgarian Railways class 07. 90 of these were made between 1972 and 1977 DBAG Class 232.9 Some of Class 234 which had been upgraded to operations were subsequently returned to top speed operation.  DBAG Class 233  These locomotives were renovated and remotorised with Kolomna 12 D 49 M engines, and other more minor improvements:Bauart√§nderungen der Baureihe 233 gegen√ºber der Baureihe 232 (Design changes from the Class 232 to Class 233) br232.de A replacement engine for the 232 series was sought because the engine was reaching its wear limit. Different new engines were tested: a Caterpillar engine, a MaK engine and the Russian 5D49. For cost reasons and because the Russian engine could be used with the fewest modifications the 5D49 was selected. However, the Russian producer proved no longer capable of supplying this engine, as a result an engine largely similar to the 5D49 but with only twelve cylinders was supplied. This engine can have sets of cylinders turned off to save fuel at low workloads. By 2003, 65 locomotives had been rebuilt. DBAG Class 234 Converted for operation at using higher speed bogies found in the scrapped Class 130s. 64 examples were made. DBAG Class 241 Ten examples of the Class 232 were converted in 1997 for freight only operation with a new diesel engine of increased power output of , as well as new electrical transmission components (including anti-wheel-slip provision) and enhanced brakes. The top speed was reduced to only . =DR Class 142 / DBAG Class 242= Between 1977 and 1978 six locomotives with a power of were built, and designated Class 142 in operation. However, it had been decided at the political level that the main lines would be electrified, thus there would be no need in future for such a powerful locomotive, and further machines were not built. The Class 142 was the most powerful single-engined diesel in Europe (along with the DSB MZ III/IV class, the rebuilt DBAG 241 and the SNCF Class CC 72000) until 2006 when the Voith Maxima 40 CC was built with an even greater power of (this power had been already reached in 1975 by the French prototype CC 72075). 232 439 at Szczecin G≈Ç√≥wny, Poland with a local train  Usage  During GDR times the class 132 pulled everything that was fast or heavy such as express trains on non-electrified lines or coal or lime trains of 1800 to 2200 tonnes in weight. Due to the higher axle load and weight their use was not as flexible as the DR Class 118 and DR Class 119 After the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, these locomotives would take their trains outside the former GDR, with Hamburg, Kassel, Nuremberg and Kiel being destinations. With the merger of the two German train companies in 1994 the Ludmillas were seen even further afield ‚Äì taking over many of the workings of the DB Class V 160 family ‚Äì due to their higher power. After restructuring of DBAG the Class 232 locomotives were assigned to DB Cargo (now Railion) for freight services. Class 232 locomotives could be seen all through Germany and also operating in the Netherlands, the higher-power Class 241 are mainly used on heavy coal trains into the Netherlands.Einsatzgebiet der Baureihe 241 (Uses of Class 241) br232.de These were replaced in the Netherlands in 2006 by Baureihe 189 locomotives. The higher-powered Class 242 also worked extremely heavy freight trains, though are now in private ownership. Some intercity services (such as the Berlin-Warsaw express)As of November 2008 are still provided by DB Fernverkehr using the higher speed Class 234s. These were later replaced by Polish EuroSprinter locomotives. The locomotives are still (2016) used in Germany, Poland, Romania and Hungary. =Retirement= The Class 230s were the first of the family to be withdrawn, next went locomotives of the type 231, since without train heating they had no use. A few of these classes were acquired by private companies including EBW, others are in museums. The 242 series were also withdrawn from DBAG usage, but have since entered private use. As of February 2009 locomotives of Class 232 with its variants 233, 234 and 241 are still in main line work.  Variants  Similar engines were produced for other Soviet bloc countries: * Bulgaria: 07, similar to class 131. * Czech Republic, Slovakia: T679.2 similar to class 132. * USSR: T–≠109, double engines 2T–≠109, T–≠125, T–≠129.

It is one of two subspecies of the western corella.Anon. (2007). Butler‚Äôs Corella. (Fauna Note No.19). Department of Environment and Conservation, Western Australia. Description Butler's corella has mainly white plumage with a distinct white crest. The undersides of the wings and tail are pale yellow. The feathers between the eye and beak are deep salmon-pink, as are the bases of the feathers on the head and underparts. The eye is surrounded by a broad grey-blue eye-ring. The white plumage is often stained with soil because of the birds‚Äô foraging activities. The corellas range from 40‚Äì48 cm in length and 600‚Äì750 g in weight. They are very similar in appearance to Muir's corella, the nominate subspecies of the western corella. Distribution and habitat Butler's corella is found in the northern and central wheatbelt of south-west Western Australia. Its habitat is open woodland and farmland where there are nearby trees for roosting in. It has benefited from agricultural development with access to food from cereal crops and permanent water. Behaviour Butler's corella is gregarious and may be seen in large flocks of up to several thousand birds. =Feeding= The corellas feed extensively on the seeds of cereal crops, the seeds of weeds such as Cape weed (Arctotheca calendula) and double gee (Emex australis), as well as the corms of onion grass (Romulea rosea) and insect larvae. =Breeding= The corellas nest in tree hollows of large, mature eucalypts, including wandoo (Eucalyptus wandoo) and salmon gum (Eucalyptus salmonophloia). Eggs are laid from August to October with a clutch size of 1-4 (averaging 2.7). The incubation period lasts 24‚Äì29 days, following which the chicks remain in the hollow for about 60 days until fledging. After fledging, the young birds begin to forage for themselves in 2‚Äì3 weeks but continue to be dependent on their parents for another 6 months, moving with them in family groups to feeding areas and roosts. They do not start breeding until they are 3‚Äì5 years old. Status and conservation Butler's corella is not considered to be threatened. The population comprises some 20‚Äì30,000 birds and is gradually spreading in the south-east of its range. Average life expectancy of adults has been estimated at 17 years for males and 14 years for females. However, most young birds die before they reach breeding age. Because flocks sometimes cause damage by defoliating trees, by digging up lawns, sports grounds and race tracks, by chewing wiring and house fittings, and by being very noisy, the subspecies is a declared pest of agriculture. Birds may be destroyed where they are considered a nuisance.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Neelamegha Perumal and his consort Lakshmi as Tirukannapura Nayagi. As per Hindu legend, the presiding deity is believed to have appeared as a female Mohini to lure the asuras to support Devas, the celestial deities. The temple is also known as Mohanapuram and Mohanakshetram. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines and three of its four bodies of water. The temple has a five-tiered rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower and a huge temple tank in front of it. The temple is believed to have been built by the Pandyas, with later additions from the Madurai Nayaks. Six daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Brahmotsavam, celebrated during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (April‚ÄìMay), being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend Temple tank As per Hindu legend, once a demon by name Bhasmasura did penance. Shiva granted him a boon that when he touches anyone's head, the person would turn to ashes. Bhasmasura wanted to test the boon and wanted to touch the head of Shiva. A bewildered Shiva ran to seek the favour of Vishnu, who took the form of damsel Mohini. She lured Bhasmasura with her dance and made Bhasmasura touch his head with his hand. The demon Bhasmasura was thus defeated. The place where Mohini lured (meaning Moham) came to be known as Thirumohur. According to another legend, there was a fight between the Devas (gods) and Asuras (demons) during the churning of the Ocean of Milk for Amrita (ambrosia). Asuras were able to overpower Devas and the Devas sought Vishnu's help. Vishnu appeared as Mohini to lure the asuras and gave them empty pot. It is believed that Thirumohur is the place of the event. History Sri Andal shrine Sangam literature details about this place being prosperous during the time. The documentation from Ptolemy (c. AD 100 ‚Äì c. 170) also makes reference to this place. Inscription from the temple - South Outer wall's inside - Archaeological report on Epigraphy - 330 of 1918 - and Tamil Nadu State Archaeology's Madurai District Inscriptions - Vol. I - page no. 229 - Sl. no. 141 of 2003 - identifies the builder of the temple as sri Kaala Maegam alias Kaangaeyan during the reign of Sadaiya Varman Sundhara Pandiyan (Later Pandiya king) in his regnal year 7 + 1 (i.e. after the 7th year was over and the eighth year was in progress) which is identified as AD 1259. This inscription besides identifying the above speaks of an endowment of ponds and adjoining areas duly specifying the boundaries of the land. The current structure is believed to have been built by the Madurai Nayaks. During the later part, there were additions made by the Marudu brothers, whose images are also housed in the temple. Thirumohur was an impregnable fort during the period of British. During the Carnatic Wars, there was an attempt made by a Muslim general, but it was repulsed by the local devotees. The inscriptions from the period of Nayaks have been recorded by the Archaeological survey. During Carnatic Wars in 1755, British general colonel heron looted the idols and treasures from this temple. When he was moving away with all treasures with camels, british force was attacked by Kallars, who took back the idols and temple treasures. In memory of this event, even today god in this temple used to come like a Kallar man. Also the rights for pulling temple car given to Kallars of Tirumokur, Poolampatti, Kodikkulam, Chittampatti, Vovaal Thottam and Aalinangarai. Architecture Shrines The temple is situated on a land area, and has a 5 tier rajagopuram. The temple is more than 2000 years old and has been referred to in akana·πâ≈´·πüu, Padhitrupathu, maduraikanchi and also in one of the five great epics of Tamil literature, silappatikaram. There are four prakarams(closed precincts of a temple) inside the temple. The main deity (Moolavar) is Kalamegaperumal in panchayudha kolam and in a standing posture, Thayar - Mogavalli, Utsavar - Thirumogur Aabthan, Theertham - Kshirabtha Pushkarini, Thala Viruksham - Vilvam and Vimanam - Kethaki Vimanam. The Prathanasayana appearance of the main deity is not found anywhere in 108 divya desam temples. The temple has a five-tiered rajagopuram (gateway tower). There are columned pillars in the hall leading to the Garuda hall, which also has a small gopuram. The sanctum houses the shrine of Kalamegha and also has the images of Bhoodevi and Sridevi. The major feature is that the unlike other temples, the Devis do not touch the feet of the presiding deity. A separate shrine accommodates the image of Anantasayi Vishnu. The consort of the presiding deity, Tirumohurvalli (also called Mohanavalli) is housed in a separate shrine. The front of the Sudarshana Chakra is Chakrathazhvar and the back side is Narasingha Perumal, situated amidst 48 fairies and inside the six circles there are 16 aayuthams with 154 letters. The letters are believed to be text from Bhijakshara Mantra. Perumal is depicted with 16 hands and three eyes glowing like fire. The image of Chakrathazwhar in the temple is depicted with sixteen hands each holding different weapons. On the reverse side of the image, Narsimha is depicted. Festivals and religious practices Marudu brothers The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis based on pancharatra Agama. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub- caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day: Ushathkalam at 7 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 10:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Kalamega Perumal and Mohanavalli. During the last step of worship, nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The major festival is the ten-day Vaikasi Brammotsavam celebrated during May‚ÄìJune. The other festivals are Vaikunta Ekadasi (December‚ÄìJanuary), Gajendra Moksham during the Masi Poornima day in February ‚Äì March, two day Panguni Thirukalyanam (March‚ÄìApril) and Krishna Jayanthi. Literary mention The temple is glorified in the verses of Nalayira Divya Prabandham by Tirumangai Azhwar and Nammazhwar. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. Manavala Mamunigal, Kalamegha Pulavar, Tiruninravur Tirumalai and Pillai Perumal Iyengar have composed verses on the deity. Out of the eighteen Puranas, Brahmanda Purana and Matsya Purana make specific mention about Thirumohur.

He was Duke of Macs√≥ (1262‚Äì1272) and of Bosnia (1266/1271-1272); and thus he governed the southern provinces of the Kingdom of Hungary. B√©la was the son of Duke Rostislav of Macs√≥ and his wife, Anna, a daughter of King B√©la IV of Hungary. When Duke Rostislav died in 1262, his lands were divided between his sons: B√©la inherited the Banate of Macs√≥ (including Belgrade and the Braniƒçevo province), and his brother, Michael inherited their father‚Äôs part of Bosnia. King B√©la IV, having made these assignments to his grandsons, decided also to make some further changes in his peripheral territories, and assigned Slavonia, Dalmatia, and Croatia, which until then had all been under his elder son and heir, Stephen V, to a younger son named B√©la. Stephen V was infuriated and immediately revolted against his father; during the ensuing war, B√©la and his mother assisted B√©la IV. His grandfather and uncle (B√©la IV and Stephen V) concluded a peace on 5 December 1262, and according to the peace the kingdom was divided, the latter acquiring the territories east of the river Danube as ‚Äújunior king‚Äù. After the peace, Stephen V occupied the possessions which B√©la and his brother had inherited from their father in the eastern parts of the kingdom (the former royal possessions in Bereg County and the Castle of F√ºz√©r). Their mother submitted a formal complaint against her brother to Pope Urban IV, but the \\"junior king\\" did not hand back their possessions. In December 1264, the troops of B√©la IV invaded the parts of the kingdom which had been ruled by the ‚Äújunior king‚Äù. The ‚Äúsenior king‚Äù appointed the young B√©la (his grandson) to lead one of his troops, but the actual leader of the royal army was Henry K≈ëszegi. In the Battle of Isaszeg, Stephen V defeated his father‚Äôs troops, and B√©la fled from the battle-field. The two kings (B√©la‚Äôs grandfather and uncle) concluded a new peace on March 23, 1266 on the Margaret Island and affirmed the former division of the Kingdom of Hungary between them. By that time B√©la‚Äôs brother, Michael had died, and thus B√©la inherited the parts of Bosnia his brother had been ruling before his death. In 1268, King Stefan Uro≈° I of Serbia led his troops to plunder Macs√≥, and the Serbs did considerable damage before Hungarian help came. The Hungarian troops sent by B√©la‚Äôs grandfather then managed to capture Stefan Uro≈° himself, and the Serbian king was forced to purchase his release. The Castle of Moson When his grandfather died on May 3, 1270, B√©la did not follow the example of his mother and his grandfather‚Äôs other partisans (among them Henry K≈ëszegi), who escaped to the court of her son-in-law, King Otakar II of Bohemia. And indeed, B√©la assisted his uncle, King Stephen V against the Czech king and his followers. After King Stephen V had died on August 6, 1272, and his son, the young Ladislaus IV ascended the throne, King B√©la IV‚Äôs former partisans (among them B√©la‚Äôs mother and Henry K≈ëszegi) returned to Hungary. Thenceforward, several fractions of the leading nobles were competing with each other, and all of them were endeavoring to acquire the control over the government of the kingdom. In November, the members of Henry K≈ëszegi‚Äôs retinue killed B√©la (who was the young king‚Äôs closest adult male relative at that time) following a sharp dispute. After his murder, B√©la‚Äôs domains were divided among the members of the leading noble families.

The series found immense popularity upon its 1970s debut and during the mid-late 1980s under Alan Moore, Stephen Bissette, and John Totleben. These eras were met with high critical praise and numerous awards. However, over the years, the Swamp Thing comics have suffered from low sales, which have resulted in numerous series cancellations and revivals. First seriesLen Wein= The first Swamp Thing series ran for 24 issues, from 1972 to 1976. Len Wein was the writer for the first 13 issues before David Michelinie and Gerry Conway finished up the series. Horror artist Berni Wrightson drew the first 10 issues of the series, while Nestor Redondo drew a further 13 issues, the last issue being drawn by Fred Carrillo. The Swamp Thing fought against evil as he sought the men who murdered his wife and caused his monstrous transformation, as well as searching for a means to transform himself back to his human form. The Swamp Thing has since fought many villains, most notably the mad scientist Anton Arcane. Though they only met twice during the first series, Arcane and his obsession with gaining immortality, aided by his nightmarish army of Un-Men and the Patchwork Man (Arcane's brother Gregori Arcane who, after a land mine explosion, was rebuilt as a Frankenstein Monster-type creature by his brother), became the Swamp Thing's nemesis, even as the Swamp Thing developed a close bond with Arcane's niece Abigail Arcane. Also involved in the conflict was the Swamp Thing's close friend-turned-enemy Matthew Cable, a federal agent who originally mistakenly believed the Swamp Thing responsible for the deaths of Alec and Linda Holland. Despite Wein's writing the first 13 issues, only the first 10 issues of the original Swamp Thing series had been collected in trade paperbacks or reprint comics, primarily due to the popularity of Wrightson's artwork, stopping rather than concluding the story arc. Wein ended his run as writer by having the Swamp Thing reveal his identity to Matt Cable and ultimately avenging the death of his wife by killing Nathan Ellery. The full Wein 13-issue run was released in hardcover by DC in June 2009 as Roots of the Swamp Thing, volume 4 of the 9-volume book series the DC Comics Classics Library. =David Michelinie/Gerry Conway/David Anthony Kraft= As sales figures plummeted towards the end of the series, the writers attempted to revive interest by introducing fantasy creatures, sci-fi aliens, and even Alec Holland's brother, Edward (a plot point that was never referred to or even mentioned again by later writers), into the picture. The appearance of Holland's brother toward the end of the series marked a series of plot developments, designed to provide the series with a happy ending, which generated much controversy. In Swamp Thing #23, Alec finally regains his humanity and while the creature was on the cover of the 24th and final issue of the series (albeit transforming into human), Holland appeared as human throughout the interior story. The cover illustration showed a yellow muscular creature, Thrudvang, beating up the Swamp Thing; the interior showed Holland imagining the Swamp Thing beating up Thrudvang, in similar positions but with roles reversed‚Äîthe issue itself depicting Holland and his new love interest (and his brother's research assistant) running away from Thrudvang. A battle between the Swamp Thing and Hawkman was promised for the next issue, but no such battle occurred until Swamp Thing (vol. 2) #58. During the short-lived revival of Challengers of the Unknown in issues #81-87, also by Gerry Conway, the Swamp Thing returned as Alec Holland who, without continually producing and self-medicating with the bio-restorative formula, reverted into the form of the Swamp Thing. Holland, along with the Challengers of the Unknown, encountered the supernatural being known as Deadman (though they were unaware of Deadman's presence), a fact that would confirm the post-Wein Swamp Thing stories existence in DC Universe continuity years later when Deadman and the Swamp Thing met again during Alan Moore's run as writer. The Swamp Thing also appeared with the Batman twice in The Brave and the Bold #122 and 176 and with Superman in DC Comics Presents #8. In the latter, by Steve Englehart, he tried in vain to stop Superman from committing what he perceived as genocide (using a compound developed by S.T.A.R. Labs) on 60 Solomon Grundys living in the sewers of Metropolis. Second seriesMartin Pasko/Dan Mishkin= In an issue dated May 1982, DC Comics revived the Swamp Thing series to try to capitalize on the summer 1982 release of the Wes Craven film of the same name. The title, called The Saga of the Swamp Thing, featured in its first Annual the comic book adaptation of the Craven movie. Now written by Martin Pasko, the book loosely picked up after the Swamp Thing's appearances in Challengers of the Unknown #81-87, DC Comics Presents #8, and The Brave and the Bold #176, with the character wandering around the swamps of Louisiana as something of an urban legend that was feared by locals. Martin Pasko's main arc depicted the Swamp Thing roaming the globe, trying to stop a young girl (and possible Anti- Christ) named Karen Clancy from destroying the world. The series also featured back-up stories involving the Phantom Stranger by Mike W. Barr, which led to a collaboration between the Swamp Thing and the Stranger in a guest run by Dan Mishkin that featured a scientist who transformed himself into a silicon creature. The primary artist for the bulk of Pasko's run was Tom Yeates; towards the end of the run he was replaced with Stephen R. Bissette and John Totleben (who began by inking Yeates' pencils). Bissette and Totleben, who had known Yeates at the Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art, had been ghosting various pages for Yeates, and were given the assignment on Pasko's recommendation. In issue #6, editor Len Wein declared, in response to a published letter, that Alec never had a brother and that every Swamp Thing series story after issue #21 of the original series never happened. The letter, however, questioned why the Swamp Thing had reverted, which had already been explained in the Challengers of the Unknown run. A later column pointed this out, so they said they would not deliberately contradict it, even though they would still go from the assumption that it never happened. The arrival of Bissette and Totleben came as Pasko, who wrote the second Brave and the Bold team-up shortly before he began the series, resurrected plotlines from the original series. Abigail Arcane and Matt Cable were brought back and shown to be married, though this development had a darker side: Cable had been tortured via repeated electroshock treatments by his black-ops superiors over his decision to stop working for the government in order to marry Abigail. The electroshock treatments caused permanent brain damage for Matt, resulting in him being unable to work and, ironically, granting him psychic ability in the form of being able to create lifelike mental illusions. Pasko also resurrected Anton Arcane, now a grotesque half-human/half-insect cyborg with an army of insectoid Un-Men who ultimately cannibalized their creator after the Swamp Thing was forced to kill Arcane. Pasko left the book with issue #19, which featured the (third) death of Arcane, the second of which, from Swamp Thing #10, was reprinted in The Saga of the Swamp Thing (vol. 2) #18. He would be replaced by British writer Alan Moore. =Alan Moore= As Swamp Thing was heading for cancellation due to low sales, DC editorial agreed to give Alan Moore (at the time a relatively unknown writer whose previous work included several stories for 2000 AD, Warrior and Marvel UK) free rein to revamp the title and the character as he saw fit. Moore reconfigured the Swamp Thing's origin to make him a true monster as opposed to a human transformed into a monster. In his first issue, he swept aside the supporting cast Pasko had introduced in his year-and-a-half run as writer, and brought the Sunderland Corporation (a villainous group out to gain the secrets of Alec Holland's research) to the forefront, as they hunted down the Swamp Thing and \\"killed\\" him in a hail of bullets. The Saga of the Swamp Thing (vol. 2) #21 (Feb. 1984), \\"The Anatomy Lesson\\", signaled a change in the character's mythos by having an obscure supervillain, the Floronic Man (Jason Woodrue), perform an autopsy on the Swamp Thing's body and discover it was only superficially human, its organs little more than crude, nonfunctional, vegetable-based imitations of their human counterparts, indicating that the Swamp Thing could never have been human. The Swamp Thing was not Alec Holland, but only believed it to be so: Holland had indeed died in the fire, and the swamp vegetation had absorbed his consciousness and memories and created a new sentient being that believed itself to be Alec Holland. The Swamp Thing would never be human again because he never was human to start with. Woodrue also concluded that, despite the autopsy, the Swamp Thing was still alive and in a deep coma due to the bullet wounds and imprisonment in cold-storage.\\"You can't kill a vegetable by shooting it through the head./You see, throughout his miserable existence, the only thing that could have kept him sane was the hope that he might one day regain his humanity...the knowledge that under all that slime he was still Alec Holland. But if he's read my notes he'll know that just isn't true. He isn't Alec Holland. He never will be Alec Holland. He never was Alec Holland. He's just a ghost. A ghost dressed in weeds. Yeah, I wonder how he'll take it?\\" Moore would later reveal, in an attempt to connect the original one-off Swamp Thing story from House of Secrets to the main Swamp Thing canon, that there had been dozens, perhaps hundreds, of Swamp Things since the dawn of humanity, and that all versions of the creature were designated defenders of the Parliament of Trees, an elemental community also known as \\"the Green\\" that connects all plant life on Earth. The Swamp Thing went catatonic due to the shock of discovering what he really was, after having killed Sunderland in a fit of rage and escaped deep into the Green. Woodrue went insane after attempting to connect to the Green through the Swamp Thing, and Abby had to revive the Swamp Thing in order to stop Woodrue after Woodrue killed an entire Louisiana town. Swamp Thing returned to the swamps of Louisiana, and encountered Jason Blood (Etrigan the Demon), then gave a final burial for Holland's bones. Matthew Cable, gravely hurt in the previous storyline, was revealed to have been possessed by Anton Arcane, and Abby unwittingly had an incestuous relationship with him. After a fight, Cable was thrown into a coma, and Abby's soul was sent to Hell. In Swamp Thing Annual #2, modeled on Dante's Inferno, the Swamp Thing followed Abigail, encountering classic DC characters such as Deadman, the Phantom Stranger, the Spectre, and Etrigan en route, and eventually rescued her. The relationship between the Swamp Thing and Abby deepened, and in Swamp Thing (vol. 2) #34 (\\"Rites of Spring\\") the two confessed that they loved each other since they met, and \\"made love\\" though a hallucinogenic experience brought on when Abby ate a tuber produced by the Swamp Thing's body (this served as a segment in the film The Return of Swamp Thing, where the Swamp Thing produces a fruit and the ingestion of the fruit makes Abby to see the Swamp Thing as a handsome man, and then they make love). The controversial relationship between a plant and a human would culminate in Abby being arrested later for breaking the laws of nature and conducting a sexual relationship with a nonhuman. Abby ultimately fled to Gotham City, leading to a story arc featuring the fourth encounter between the Swamp Thing and the Batman. Before that, the \\"American Gothic\\" storyline introduced the character John Constantine (later to star in his own comic John Constantine, Hellblazer) in issues #37‚Äì50, where the Swamp Thing had to travel to several parts of America, encountering several archetypal horror monsters, including vampires (the same clan he fought in The Saga of the Swamp Thing (vol. 2) #3), a werewolf, and zombies, but modernized with relevance to current issues. Around this time, Moore had the Swamp Thing encounter Superman a second time, in DC Comics Presents #85. The storyline began with the Swamp Thing's old body being completely destroyed, and growing a new one. Constantine encourages the Swamp Thing to use the power for transportation, and the Swamp Thing learns to do so with increasing speed. The \\"American Gothic\\" storyline ended with a crossover with Crisis on Infinite Earths, where the Swamp Thing had to solve the battle between Good (Light) and Evil (Darkness). He also met the Parliament of Trees in issue #47, which was where Earth elementals like him lay to rest after they have walked the Earth, and it was here Moore solved the continuity problem of the first and second Swamp Thing: the first Swamp Thing, Alex Olsen, was now a part of the Parliament. Although Abby was eventually released (the Batman having pointed out that there were probably several non- humans, such as Superman, Metamorpho, Starfire (Dick Grayson's girlfriend), and the Martian Manhunter, partaking in relationships with human beings), the Swamp Thing was ambushed by soldiers using a weapon designed by Lex Luthor. Luthor's weapon destroyed the Swamp Thing's psychic connection with the Earth, whilst the Swamp Thing's body was destroyed by napalm. Unable to regrow a new Earthly body, the Swamp Thing was presumed dead. However, the Swamp Thing's consciousness had instead fled to outer space, in search of a planet that was amenable to his new psychic wavelength. In the first tale of the Swamp Thing's extraterrestrial activities (\\"My Blue Heaven\\", #56), the Swamp Thing came upon a planet colored entirely in shades of blue, and on which there was no intelligent life. In this particularly popular issue, the Swamp Thing populated this lonely blue planet with mindless plant replicas of Abby and other reminders of his lost Earth. In issue #60, entitled \\"Loving the Alien\\", the Swamp Thing actually becomes the father of the numerous offspring of an alien cosmic entity after she \\"mates\\" with him against his will. Moore's run included several references to obscure or forgotten comic characters (the Phantom Stranger, Cain and Abel, the Floronic Man), but none so prominent as in issue #32, when he broke with the serious and moody storyline for a single issue. In the story \\"Pog\\", Walt Kelly's funny animal comic character Pogo (created in 1943) and all of his woodland friends show up as costumed visitors from another planet, looking for an unspoiled world after their own utopia was overrun and destroyed by brutal monkeys. Moore began a trend (continued by Neil Gaiman, among others) of mining the DC Universe's vast collection of minor supernatural characters to create a mythic atmosphere. Characters spun off from Moore's series gave rise to DC's Vertigo comic book line, notably The Sandman, John Constantine, Hellblazer, and The Books of Magic; Vertigo titles were written with adults in mind and often contained material unsuitable for children. The Saga of the Swamp Thing was the first mainstream comic book series to completely abandon the Comics Code Authority (CCA); after the CCA denied issue #29 the seal of approval, DC created an imprint to publish the series under and no longer submitted issues of The Saga of the Swamp Thing to the CCA for approval. =Rick Veitch= Moore's final issue, #64, was dated September 1987. At that point, regular penciller Rick Veitch began scripting the series, continuing the story in a roughly similar vein for 24 more issues. Shortly after issue #65, Swamp Thing Annual #3 was produced, this time focusing on DC's super-apes, such as Congorilla, Sam Simeon, and Gorilla Grodd. The Batman guest-starred in issue #66. Hellblazer also began soon after Swamp Thing (vol. 2) #67, and the two series had storylines which crossover to each other during Hellblazer's first year under writer Jamie Delano. In Veitch's Swamp Thing stories, the Parliament of Trees, having believed the Swamp Thing dead, grew a Sprout to replace him. Unwilling to sacrifice an innocent life, he convinced them that he would take the Sprout as his own child, and eventually impregnated Abby (now his wife) with it by possessing John Constantine's body. After the completion of this storyline, the Swamp Thing sought to resolve his need for vengeance against those who had \\"killed\\" him during his showdown in Gotham City, culminating in a showdown with Lex Luthor (and Superman) in Swamp Thing (vol. 2) #79 and a confrontation with the Batman in Swamp Thing Annual #4. It was during this time that the Swamp Thing first encountered the Black Orchid in Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean's three-part graphic novel. Later, during the Invasion! crossover event, the Swamp Thing was thrown into the past, and traveled through time trying to return to the present. The story was published in Swamp Thing (vol. 2) #80‚Äì87. One issue of this storyline [#84] focused upon the Swamp Thing's regular supporting cast. In this issue, Matthew Cable died during his coma and arrived in the land of the Dreaming, where he encountered Morpheus and Eve. Cable would later be written into The Sandman by Neil Gaiman as Matthew the Raven. Veitch's term ended in a widely publicized creative dispute, when DC refused to publish issue #88 because of the use of Jesus as a character despite having previously approved the script, in which the Swamp Thing is revealed to be the cupbearer who offers Jesus water when he calls for it from the cross. The move was said to be made due to controversies then arising from the Martin Scorsese film The Last Temptation of Christ. Artist Michael Zulli had already partially completed the art. The move disgusted Veitch and he immediately resigned from writing. Neil Gaiman and Jamie Delano, who were originally slated to be the next writers, sympathetically declined to take up the helm. Gaiman, however, was cooperative enough with the editorial staff to write Swamp Thing Annual #5, featuring Brother Power the Geek, to fill the series hiatus, which led into the run of the new Swamp Thing writer, Doug Wheeler. The Annual was reprinted in Neil Gaiman's Midnight Days. =Doug Wheeler= From September 1989 to July 1991, Doug Wheeler wrote issues #88‚Äì109. Wheeler quickly wrapped up Veitch's time travel arc and oversaw the birth of Abby and the Swamp Thing's daughter Tef√© Holland. The remaining tenure of Wheeler's run focused upon a longstanding war between the Parliament of Trees and the Gray, a fungus-themed elemental realm in opposition to the Parliament of Trees. Wheeler's run was drawn by Pat Broderick and Mike Hoffman. Broderick's work had a more traditional, adventure-comics look than previous artists on the series. John Totleben continued to contribute painted covers up to issue #100. =Nancy A. Collins= Seeking to revive interest in the series, DC brought horror writer Nancy A. Collins on board to write the series, first with Swamp Thing Annual #6 before moving on to write Swamp Thing #110‚Äì138. Collins dramatically overhauled the series, restoring the pre-Alan Moore tone of the series as well as incorporating a new set of supporting cast members into the book. Collins resurrected Anton Arcane, along with the Sunderland Corporation, as foils for the Swamp Thing. Collins also moved the series, which had focused on the Swamp Thing's time travel adventures and explorations into other- dimensional realms, back to normal society by having the Swamp Thing and Abby set up shop in southern Louisiana and attempt to live a normal life with friends and family, culminating in the introduction of the elemental babysitter Lady Jane into the supporting cast. It was during her run that DC officially launched the Vertigo imprint and Swamp Thing #129 was the first issue to carry the Vertigo logo on the cover. Collins wrapped up her run by having the Swamp Thing promise Abby that he will never leave her side. He then breaks his promise and creates a secret double to stay and protect Abby as he goes into the Green during an environmental crisis. Abby feels betrayed and leaves a despondent Swamp Thing behind. He retreats into the Green, and when Lady Jane reaches out to him, it sparks into a love affair. Arcane returns and arranges an abduction of Abby to force Tefe to use her powers to grow him a healthy body. The ongoing stress from constant attacks and dealing with Tefe's powers leads to Abby rejecting Tefe and eventually leaving town with her new boyfriend. Fearing for Tefe's safety, Lady Jane betrays the Swamp Thing and kidnaps Tefe into the Green, so that she can be trained by the Parliament of Trees. Swamp Thing Annual #7, published around this time, was the final annual issue as part of the Vertigo crossover event \\"The Children's Crusade\\". Collins also wrote a Swamp Thing story for the anthology one-shot Vertigo Jam. Shortly after Collins' departure, Black Orchid series writer Dick Foreman wrote a two- part crossover between the two titles, Black Orchid #5 and Swamp Thing #139. =Grant Morrison= With issue #140 (March 1994), the title was handed over to Grant Morrison for a four-issue arc, co-written by the then-unknown Mark Millar. As Collins had destroyed the status quo of the series, Morrison sought to shake the book up with a four-part storyline which had the Swamp Thing plunged into a nightmarish dream world scenario, where he was split into two separate beings: Alec Holland and the Swamp Thing, which was now a mindless being of pure destruction. =Mark Millar= Millar then took over from Morrison with issue #144, and launched what was initially conceived as an ambitious 25-part storyline where the Swamp Thing would be forced to go upon a series of \\"trials\\" against rival elemental forces. This led to a series of lengthy storylines by Millar as the Swamp Thing fought rival elemental beings and in the process, became champions of the five main Elemental Parliaments: Trees, Stone, Waves, Vapor and Flames. It was during this time that the Swamp Thing also encountered the Batman's enemy Killer Croc, in a failed attempt to resolve the character's ongoing storyline in 1995's Batman #521‚Äì522, Swamp Thing (vol. 2) #159-160, and The Batman Chronicles #3. However, the end was near for the series. Explanations for the cancellation vary, from low sales to Millar himself having become bored with the series. No matter what the cause, Millar decided to leave the title which, in turn, caused DC to cancel the series. Millar was given the job to wrap up the series, which would end with Swamp Thing (vol. 2) #171. John Totleben would return to illustrate the covers for issues #160‚Äì171. Millar's final arc for the series had the Swamp Thing, due to his success in beating the other Elemental Parliament Champions, become godlike and unapproachable by mortals, even as his estranged wife Abby returned to try to reconcile with him. With help from John Constantine, Abby sought to keep the Swamp Thing from destroying humanity so that the Parliament Elementals could claim control over Earth. In the end, the Swamp Thing unites all of the Elemental Parliaments into one collective hive mind with him in control of it. Achieving a global sense of consciousness, the Swamp Thing sees through the worldview of every living thing upon the planet and find the good and the potential in even his worst enemy. This is shown most notably with the final resurrection of Anton Arcane who, during his most recent stay in Hell, befriended a priest that was unfairly condemned to Hell and in the process renounced evil and became a born-again Christian. The Swamp Thing thus spares humanity and becomes a Planetary Elemental, representing Earth itself, and joins the Parliament of Worlds, which is made up of all the other \\"enlightened worlds\\" (the only others actually named were Mars, who greeted the Swamp Thing into their number, and Oa; due to its destruction some time before [in Green Lantern #0], Mars lamented Oa could not witness Earth's induction). This was the most significant change made to the character since Moore's reinterpretation, though in the Michael Zulli story \\"Look Away\\" (found within the 2000 special issue Swamp Thing Vertigo Secret Files and Origins #1) the Swamp Thing ultimately returns to normal and renounces his status as a Planetary Elemental, due to his belief that he was more effective a figure as a normal elemental being living in the swamp. After being overlooked for inclusion in countless DC Universe crossovers since Invasion!, the Swamp Thing reappeared in the coda for the DC Universe crossover event The Final Night, appearing at Hal Jordan's funeral alongside John Constantine. In 1997, the Swamp Thing was written into Aquaman (vol. 5) #32‚Äì33 by Peter David and attended the funeral for the ghost of Jim Corrigan in The Spectre (vol. 3) #62 by John Ostrander, which was the final issue of that series. Early 1998 saw the production of Jon J. Muth's Vertigo graphic novel Swamp Thing: Roots. The Sandman spin-off The Dreaming #22‚Äì24 written by Caitlin R. Kiernan saw Matthew Cable's return to human form, his uneasy reunion and final departure from his ex-wife Abby (now married to the Swamp Thing) and Cable's restoration to his dream raven form. Matthew the Raven died in The Dreaming story \\"Foxes and Hounds\\" in issues #42‚Äì43, a fact that was later touched upon by the 2000 special issue Swamp Thing Vertigo Secret Files and Origins #1. The final week of 1999 saw the Swamp Thing teaming up with other Vertigo heroes from the DC Universe in the one-shot special Totems. Third seriesBrian K. Vaughan= Written by Brian K. Vaughan and drawn by Roger Petersen (issues #1 ‚Äì 11) and Giuseppe Camuncoli (issues #12 ‚Äì 20) in 2001, the third series focused on the daughter of the Swamp Thing, Tef√© Holland. Even though she was chronologically 11‚Äì12, the series had Tefe aged into the body of an 18-year- old with a mindwipe to try to control her darker impulses, brought about by her exposure to the Parliament of Trees. Due to the circumstances under which she was conceived (the Swamp Thing, possessing John Constantine, was not aware he was given a blood transfusion by a demon), she held power over both plants and flesh. The idea of using a teenage female protagonist was a fresh one, but many longtime fans rejected the series, which cast the Swamp Thing as a guest star in his own book. Also, many fans were wondering what happened to the Swamp Thing's status as a Planetary Elemental, which culminated in the story being told in the pages of the 2000 special issue Swamp Thing Vertigo Secret Files and Origins #1. Tef√©'s story was discontinued at issue #20, whereupon after eating from the Tree of Knowledge she saw visions of two possible futures and chose neither. The Swamp Thing would not appear again until Mike Carey's run on Hellblazer in issues #184‚Äì185 and #192‚Äì193, leading into the fourth Swamp Thing series. Fourth seriesAndy Diggle / Will Pfeifer= The fourth series began in 2004, with rotating writers of Andy Diggle (#1‚Äì6), Will Pfeifer (#7‚Äì8) and Joshua Dysart (#9‚Äì29). In this latest series, the Swamp Thing is reverted to his plant-based Earth elemental status after the first storyline, and he attempts to live an \\"eventless\\" life in the Louisiana swamps. Tef√©, likewise, is rendered powerless and mortal. =Joshua Dysart= Meanwhile, a rogue consciousness, calling itself the Holland Mind, was living in the Green. As of issue #15, botany professor Jordan Schiller, an influential man from Alec Holland's past, has been summoned to the swamp by strange visions and memories, apparently manipulated by this rogue consciousness. The full purpose for this manipulation was revealed in issues #21‚Äì24. In sacrificing his power, the Swamp Thing lost much of his Alec Holland personality. Now he is restored to his proper station and power and has resumed his romantic relationship with Abby, as of issue #25. Beginning with issue #21 onward, Eric Powell (The Goon) provided covers for the series. The Floronic Man returned in #27‚Äì29, his mind splintered in the aftermath of Infinite Crisis. Issue #29 was the final issue of the fourth volume, which had been cancelled due to low sales numbers, despite fan-supported efforts to save the series. The Dysart series deals with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in the last 12 issues of the series. Most notable is the fact that real estate tycoons had been wanting to develop the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans. Fifth seriesScott Snyder= The Swamp Thing was relaunched as an ongoing series in 2011 as part of The New 52, a company wide relaunch by DC comics. It was written by Scott Snyder and drawn by Yanick Paquette. Taking off from the end of Brightest Day, the series follows a resurrected Alec Holland who wants to put the memories of the Swamp Thing behind him. He is approached first by an earlier incarnation of the Swamp Thing, representing the Parliament of Trees. This Swamp Thing informs Holland that he is a unique individual who would have become a legendary warrior for the Parliament and the Green, the essence of all plant life. When Holland died, the Parliament created a creature which thought it was him as a substitute. Holland rebuffs the creature's entreaties that he assume the mantle of the Swamp Thing. Next, he is approached by Abigail Arcane, the former lover of the Swamp Thing. She enlists him to help save her half-brother William Arcane, before he becomes the champion of the Rot, the force of decay, once known as the Swamp Thing's archenemy, Anton Arcane. While traveling cross-country, Holland and Arcane find themselves increasingly attracted to each other. After confronting William, who has already become a servant of the Rot, Abigail is captured and taken away. At the same time, the Parliament of Trees comes under attack and is about to be destroyed. Realizing his mistake, Holland accepts the mantle of the Swamp Thing as the only way to save Abigail and prevent the Rot from triumphing. Issues #8 and 9 were drawn by Yanick Paquette and Marco Rudy. Issue #10 was drawn by Francesco Francavilla, and #11 by Marco Rudy. Issue #12, which featured Animal Man, was a collaborative effort between Scott Snyder, Jeff Lemire, Marco Rudy, Dan Green, and Andy Owens. Issue #13 subsequently returned to Yanick Paquette drawing. =Charles Soule= After the conclusion of Scott Snyder's tenure on the series, Charles Soule took over with issue #19. His run on the series has the Swamp Thing fighting with Jason Woodrue, now known as the Seeder in the new continuity, who gained power over the Green after saving Alec Holland in the past. The Seeder eventually becomes the new Avatar of the Green after the Swamp Thing chooses not to kill him. However, Holland manages to escape from the Green by becoming one of the Parliament of Trees and grabbing Woodrue to tap into the power of the Avatar. He manages to convince the Parliament that he is better by making all plant life, including the algae in the oceans and seas, to become hyperactive and produce massive amounts of oxygen, which makes all other beings feel lazier. The Parliament agrees and makes him the Avatar once more.  Miniseries  Len Wein = From March 2016 to August 2016, a six-issue miniseries was published, written by Swamp Thing co-creator Len Wein and pencilled by Kelley Jones.

Because DC had been reluctant to reprint the complete Moore run, these trades became highly popular amongst fans of the series, a popularity which was further fueled by them not being distributed in the U.S. Release of hardcover reprints began in 2009, with the first volume including Swamp Thing #20 for the first time.

The company, whose name combines ‚ÄúCohn‚Äù and ‚ÄúMadoff,‚Äù was founded in 1985 by Bernard Madoff and Maurice Cohn, Madoff‚Äôs friend and former neighbor. Its office was located at the same address as Madoff's firm, and it employed between 10 and 20 employees with annual sales between $1M and $5M. Business relations Maurice \\"Sonny\\" Cohn owned 48% of Cohmad, and his daughter Marcia, who served as president and chief compliance officer, owned 25%. Madoff owned 15%. Mr. Madoff's brother, Peter owned 9%, Mr. Cohn's brother owned 1%, and another unnamed Cohmad employee owned 1%. Cohmad received $67 million in generated fees from Madoff investments, from 2000‚Äì2008. The brokerage firm lists its address as Madoff's firm's address in New York City. Cohmad employs Robert Jaffe, as vice- president. Jaffe is married to Ellen Shapiro, daughter of Boston philanthropist Carl J. Shapiro, the founder and former chairman of apparel company Kay Windsor Inc. and an early investor and close friend of Madoff. Jaffe reportedly convinced the elder Shapiro to invest $250 million with Madoff just 10 days before Madoff's arrest. Cohmad had fewer than 650 client accounts, and made 99.7% of its sales from brokerage services to Madoff's larger broker-dealer. In its audited financial statements for the 12 months ending June 30, 2008, Cohmad said revenue from Madoff Securities totaled $3,736,829. Its total sales for the same period were $3,748,397.  Bernard Madoff agents  Jaffe, a philanthropist, \\"worked the Palm Beach, Florida circuit\\" and \\"attracted many Palm Beach Country Club members as investors.\\" Jaffe brought in 150 accounts and more than $1 billion to Madoff. Madoff paid Jaffe directly through accounts he kept with Madoff at much higher returns than those earned by other investors. Between 1996 and 2008, Jaffe withdrew at least $150 million, and the SEC claims he was aware Madoff was engaged in fictitious trading. Jaffe has said he received a commission of 1% to 2% from an investor's first profit, and he paid commissions to financial advisers who steered cash to Madoff's fund.  Civil lawsuits, investigations and revocation On January 14, 2009, William Galvin, Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth, who is in charge of the state's securities issues, filed suit against Jaffe, a Cohmad broker for Madoff, who promoted Madoff's funds to wealthy investors in Massachusetts and Florida. On February 4, compelled to testify, Jaffe invoked his Fifth Amendment right. Marcia Cohn, Maurice Cohn and Alvin Delaire, Jr. failed to appear. On February 11, 2009, Galvin filed a complainthttp://www.sec.state.ma.us/sct/sctcohmad/cohmad_complaint.pdf seeking to revoke the Massachusetts license of Cohmad Securities Corp., an accounting of all Massachusetts investors Cohmad referred to Madoff‚Äôs company, all the fees it earned doing so (more than $67 million), and a fine. It named Ruth Madoff as having withdrawn $10 million on December 10, 2008 and $5.5 million on November 25, 2008 from her brokerage account. It also cited $526,000 in referral fees paid from Madoff Investments, to Cohmad, to Vienna Bank Medici majority owner, Sonja Kohn, which she subsequently denied. On May 28, 2009, Bank Medici lost its Austrian banking license. Kohn and the Bank are under investigation. On May 8, 2009, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts found the firm to be in ‚Äúdefault‚Äù for not assisting regulators. Cohmad‚Äôs securities registration has been revoked, and they must provide an accounting of all fees the company or its agents earned for referring Massachusetts investors to Mr. Madoff's firm as well as, pay a $100,000 fine for failing to cooperate with the state securities investigation. On March 15, 2009, Federal prosecutors filed a notice in federal court declaring its intent to seek the forfeiture of the Madoffs' interests in Cohmad Securities. On June 22, 2009, Madoff Trustee, Irving Picard filed a claim against Cohmad, founder Maurice ‚ÄúSonny‚Äù Cohn, daughter Marcia Cohn, Robert Jaffe, Richard Spring, Alvin J. Delaire, Jr., Stanley Mervin Berman, Jonathan Greenberg, Cyril Jalon, Morton Kurzrok, and Rosalie Buccellato, among more than two dozen individuals and trusts in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.http://www.nylj.com/nylawyer/adgifs/decisions/062309cohmad.pdf The lawsuit claims that up to 90 percent of Cohmad‚Äôs income came from referring clients and that the firm had a ‚Äúsymbiotic‚Äù relationship with Madoff, having earned hundreds of millions of dollars from the fraud. The lawsuit seeks more than $100 million paid to Cohmad six years prior to Madoff‚Äôs firm declaring bankruptcy, and more than $105 million in profits Cohmad employees and their families withdrew from the investment accounts they held with Madoff. On June 22, 2009, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also filed civil fraud charges against co-founder Maurice \\"Sonny\\" Cohn, president Marcia Cohn, and Robert Jaffe. The lawsuit alleges the company was Madoff's \\"in-house marketing arm\\" and critical to Madoff's scam. Cohmad representatives were paid for funds they brought into the firm but not for any putative increase in the investments' value. Withdrawals were treated as a loss, which \\"suggested that profits generated by Madoff were fictitious\\", although Madoff changed the arrangement in 2002 for Maurice Cohn, and began paying him $2 million a year. Jaffe has filed requests with the Courts to dismiss the SEC and the Picard cases. The cases are Picard v. Cohmad Securities Corp., 09-AP- 1305, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan), and SEC v. Cohmad, 09-cv-5680, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York.).

First released on August 7, 1916, the series consists of 15 weekly episodes and features the character of \\"Beatrice Fairfax\\" (Grace Darling). The character was inspired by the popular newspaper advice column Ask Beatrice Fairfax, which had been the world's first column of its kind when launched in 1898. The weekly film serial was a popular genre of the time, and the films' producers, the Wharton brothers, also made serials such as The Exploits of Elaine. However, Beatrice Fairfax is more accurately a series, since the episodes consist of self-contained stories rather than a linked serial narrative. Overview The two protagonists were played by Grace Darling and Harry Fox, the comedian and vaudeville dancer. In the films, the Beatrice character was portrayed as a resourceful agony aunt-cum- crimefighter, working with her reporter colleague Jimmy Barton to investigate and solve the problems sent in by her troubled readers.

Status The Dear Beatrice Fairfax advice column was started by journalist Marie Manning on July 20, 1898, and ran in newspapers owned by William Randolph Hearst. Nitrate copies of all the episodes, except the first, survived because they were preserved in the collection of Hearst's mistress Marion Davies, which was eventually transferred to the Library of Congress. According to one source, Hearst disliked the films and planned to cast Davies as Beatrice Fairfax in a remake; he gave them to her as an example of how the new films should not be made. The films were restored and recolored according to instructions written on the nitrate copies themselves. DVD release In 2004, Serial Squadron released the series on DVD. On September 30, 2008, Hermitage Hill Media also released the series on Region 1 DVD in the United States. Radio adaptation Beatrice Fairfax was a program on NBC radio March 10-June 30, 1934, on CBS in May 1936 and on Mutual August 31, 1937 ‚Äì February 25, 1938.

Varnas 90th anniversary, Lituanus, vol. 15, no. 1, 1969 Author of the world first album of ethnographical photography Lithuanian Crosses (Lietuvos kry≈æiai, 2 volumes, 1926, Kaunas) about the Lithuanian cross crafting.\\"An Enigma of One Portrait and One Friendship\\",  Biography  He studied art at St. Petersburg, Russia and Cracow, Poland, where he was mostly impressed by the landscape artist ‚Äî professor Stanislavski. In 1905 he went to study art at Geneva's Ecole des Beaux-Arts. At the same time, Varnas took two different art classes: portrait painting and decorative art. In 1908, after graduating from academy of art, with highest degrees, he left for Sicily. The artist immersed himself into the Sicilian mountainous landscape with its scenic seashores and its fishermen, producing many landscape artworks. In 1913 Varnas returned to his native Lithuania making its home in its capital Vilnius, where he worked not only as an artist but also as a civic and cultural leader. With the advancing of the war, in 1915 he went to Odessa, Russia and after the war returned to Kaunas where he opened his own studio. After Lithuania won its independence in 1918, the artist Varnas worked in theatre and opera, making his contribution by painting the sceneries. He won many prizes by designing playing cards, postage stamps, went to Prague to supervise the first printing of Lithuanian money. As a teacher, he taught art at Voronezh, Russia and in Lithuania's Vytautas the Great school, Kaunas Art school, State Art Institute. He spent five years collecting objects of Lithuanian folklore and making photographs of wooden crosses which were found alongside the roads. During World War II, the artist Varnas fled Lithuania to Germany, and in 1949 he came to the United States where he lived until his death. Varnas' artworks can be divided into 4 periods. First period (1908-1913) includes his postgraduate study works of portraits and landscapes. Second period (1914‚Äì18) includes portraits and political caricatures. The post-war period was not very rich in numbers, but much richer in quality. Now the artist frees himself from romantic inclinations, concentrating more on the development of color problems. The third period (1918‚Äì1940) which coincides with independent Lithuania, shows the artist's intensified colorific aspirations in his portraits and his favorite subject ‚Äì landscape. To this period also belongs his graphic works, postage stamps, money projects, political caricatures, theatrical sceneries. In the fourth period from 1944 until the present, the artist continues to paint mostly portraits and landscape. In this present period, he painted monumental historical composition \\"The Coronation of King Mindaugas,\\" in which the artist demonstrated a four-year painstaking work of art. Artist's portraits represent the human face with all its simplicity, weaknesses and greatness. He tends to include a symbolic background in order to represent a person's social position in life. He not only paints outward facial features, but he also reveals the personality of the sitter. In his oil paintings, he represents realistic objects with a somewhat slight touch of impressionism. His most characteristic elements are simplicity and sincerity. It is amazing, that during Varnas' long artistic life, spanning over 60 years, he never was influenced by developing new trends in art, such as expressionism, surrealism, or even abstract. Artist's objects never lost its true realistic form, he always remained faithful to nature. In his open-air outdoor landscape scene paintings, we see a patient detailed study of nature as seen only through the artist's eyes. Therefore, besides historical and portrait paintings, Varnas is probably best known as a truly exclusive landscape artist.

According to Yang's own accounts, he studied at Fudan University. After graduating, Yang worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing. China's Foreign Ministry denied Yang had ever been employed by the ministry, according to a Reuters report in 2019. From 1992 to 1997, Yang worked in Hong Kong as the manager of a mainland Chinese company. Afterwards, he went to the U.S. as a senior fellow of the Atlantic Council. Yang is believed to become an Australian citizen in the early 2000s, while still holding a PRC passport.. Yang is regarded as a divisive figure among overseas Chinese dissidents and activists. Yang is currently under arrest by the Chinese Government, facing one charge of espionage, but the basis of the charge was unknown. Personal life Yang has been a visiting scholar at Columbia University in New York for two years before being detained in China in January 2019. Yang is married to a prominent nationalist blogger, Yuan Ruijuan (alternate: Yuan Xiaoliang). Career According to The New York Times, Yang was a diplomat for the People's Republic of China, working in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Foreign Ministry denied Yang had ever been employed by the ministry, according to a Reuters report in 2019. Based on his abundant personal experience \\"within the Chinese system\\", Yang wrote spy novels in English and Chinese, under the pen name Wei Shi. His first novel, Fatal Weakness, is the first in his spy trilogy using himself as a role model. It is the story of a U.S.-China double agent who ultimately works for neither side but instead serves his own personal agenda. It is only available on his blog and is written only in Chinese. There are no other translations available. In U.S., Yang spent most of his time running a ‚Äúdaigou‚Äù store on China's popular mobile platform WeChat, selling luxury bags, vitamins, baby formula and watches procured overseas for buyers inside China. Some critics said Yang stopped criticising the ruling Chinese Communist Party in favour of protecting his personal and business interests. Detentions2011= On 20 March 2011, it was alleged Yang disappeared from Guangzhou airport after phoning a friend to report that three men were following him. Commentators believe that he was detained as a result of government crackdown on activists, lawyers and bloggers following calls for a 'Jasmine' revolution in China since February 2011. He later contacted his family in Australia saying his disappearance was all a \\"misunderstanding\\" and \\"I've been sick, nothing else, and my phone battery was dead for two days so I could not contact my family. I'm very sorry about stirring up so much trouble in both countries.\\" =2019= On 18 January 2019, he was again detained by Chinese authorities. He had arrived in Guangzhou from the U.S. due to the imminent expiry of his family's visas, with his wife and daughter. He was awaiting Australian visas for his wife and daughter. During a connection, he was arrested while on his way to the connecting flight to Shanghai. Yang's detention was believed to relate to his international connections, according to Feng Chongyi, an academic at the University of Technology in Sydney. Yang was charged with espionage in August 2019.

It was named after its capital and largest city, Damascus (\\"Dimashq\\"), which in the Umayyad period was also the capital of the Caliphate.  Geography and administrative division  Unlike any other province of the Caliphate, Syria was divided by the early Umayyads into several (originally four, later five) sub-provinces or ajnad (singular jund, \\"army division\\"), which in their original inception were the areas from which a particular army division drew its pay, provisions and recruits. The province of Damascus, jund Dimashq, was the largest of the ajnad, comprising most of central Syria. Its borders encompassed roughly the former Byzantine provinces of Phoenice Prima, Phoenice Libanensis, and Arabia. Later Arab geographers divide the jund of Damascus into the following districts: the Ghuta plain around Damascus, known as the \\"Garden Land\\" for its fertility; the Hawran and Bathaniyya, with Adra'a as capital; Jawlan; Jaydur (mentioned only by Yaqut al-Hamawi); Hula; Balqa; al- Sharah, with capital at Adhruh, sometimes recorded as belonging to Jund Filastin; and al-Jibal. Other principal towns and cities were Beirut, Sidon, Tyre (the tax proceeds of which went to Jund al-Urdunn), Tripoli and Jubail along the coast. The coastal cities and their immediate surroundings formed their own small districts. In its tribal make-up, the jund of Damascus was chiefly Yamani, but with a sizeable minority of Qaysi tribes. The annual tax proceeds of the province totalled 450,000 gold dinars according to Ya'qubi, 400,000 according to al-Baladhuri, and 420,000 according to al-Jahshiyari; Qudama ibn Ja'far gives the low number of 110,000 dinars, but this probably reflects the effects of the civil war of the Fourth Fitna. In terms of troops, under the Caliph al-Walid I (r. 705‚Äì715), 45,000 men were in the rolls for the jund of Damascus, although presumably not all of them were effectives.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 29, 2009. The episode was directed by Greg Colton and written by Danny Smith. In the episode, Quahog hosts its annual Star Trek convention and the cast members of Star Trek: The Next Generation are guests. After he was unable to ask the actors any questions at a Q&A; session, Stewie builds a transporter in his bedroom to beam the cast over and spend the day with them. Meanwhile, Meg becomes a born-again Christian and tries to convert the atheist Brian to Christianity. The episode garnered mixed reviews from critics and received a 4.8/7 Nielsen rating. Star Trek: The Next Generations Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Gates McFadden, Michael Dorn, Wil Wheaton, Denise Crosby, and Marina Sirtis all guest starred as themselves, and Adam West and Rob Lowe appear at the end of the episode in a live-action scene. Plot Meg catches the mumps when the Griffins attend Quahog's annual Star Trek convention, because Peter forced her to stand next to an irresponsible attendee with the mumps to take a picture, believing him to be in costume as an alien. While recovering in bed, Meg becomes a born-again Christian after watching Kirk Cameron on television and begins irritating everyone with her beliefs. Meg is horrified to learn that Brian is an atheist and attempts to convince him to repent and convert to Christianity, but he repeatedly refuses. Finally taking drastic measures, Meg spreads the word of Brian's atheism around Quahog, which generally hates atheists, turning him into a pariah. Upon being made an outcast, Brian is banned from every bar and convenience store in Quahog, making it impossible for him to drown his sorrows. Desperate, and suffering from delirium tremens (he hallucinates seeing several alcoholic beverages begging him to drink them), Brian fakes his repentance and convinces Meg to cease all hostilities against him so he can get back to drinking, but she takes him to burn books that are \\"harmful to God\\" (including On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, and a book titled Logic for First Graders). A disgusted Brian admits his bluff and attempts to convince Meg that what she is doing is wrong. When Meg refuses to listen, Brian points out to her that if there were truly a loving God, then he would not have created Meg to have an attractive mother like Lois but have her to more physically resemble Peter, and that she would not be brought into a world where everyone holds her in contempt. Feeling ashamed, Meg concedes to Brian's argument and apologizes for her behavior, confessing that she does not know how she can feel loved. Brian then assures her that the answers are inside herself, and the real meaning of their existence is out there somewhere. Afterward, it is revealed that the entire Family Guy universe takes place within the molecules of a lampshade in the shared bedroom of Adam West and Rob Lowe. Meanwhile, furious that he did not get a chance to ask the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation any questions at the convention, and the fact that the cast instead answered questions completely unrelated to Star Trek, Stewie builds an authentic Star Trek transporter and beams the cast over to interview them (in a nod to the TNG episode \\"Skin of Evil\\", Denise Crosby is killed in a show of force). Stewie decides to spend the whole day with the cast, which includes stealing Cleveland's van, having lunch at McDonald's, going bowling, and going to a carnival. However, they complain about minor things and greatly annoy Stewie, who beams everyone back after stating that they have ruined Star Trek: The Next Generation for him. Production Patrick Stewart voices himself in this episode \\"Not All Dogs Go to Heaven\\" was directed by series regular Greg Colton, in his second episode of the season (his first one being \\"Road to Germany\\"). It was written by regular writer and recurring voice actor Danny Smith, in his first episode of the season. Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising directors. Seth MacFarlane, Family Guys creator and executive producer, is a fan of Star Trek and made two guest appearances as engineer Ensign Rivers on Star Trek: Enterprise, in \\"The Forgotten\\" (season 3, episode 20) and \\"Affliction\\" (season 4, episode 15). Former Star Trek: The Next Generation cast members have also made other appearances in Family Guy: Patrick Stewart, for example, briefly voiced Peter Griffin (normally played by MacFarlane) in \\"No Meals on Wheels\\" (season 5, episode 14), his American Dad! character, Avery Bullock in \\"Lois Kills Stewie\\" (season 6, episode 5), and his Star Trek: The Next Generation character Captain Jean-Luc Picard in \\"Peter's Got Woods\\" (season 4, episode 11); Jonathan Frakes, Michael Dorn and Marina Sirtis also appeared in \\"Peter's Got Woods\\" as their respective Star Trek: The Next Generation characters William Riker, Worf, and Counsellor Deanna Troi. \\"Not All Dogs Go to Heaven\\" features the entire original cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation: Stewart as Captain Picard; Frakes as Riker; Gates McFadden as Doctor Beverly Crusher; Brent Spiner as Lieutenant Commander Data; Dorn as Worf; Sirtis as Troi; LeVar Burton as Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge; Wil Wheaton as Wesley Crusher; and Denise Crosby, whose character Tasha Yar died during Star Trek: The Next Generations first season. It is also the first time the cast, minus Crosby, has worked together since the 2002 feature film Star Trek Nemesis, although the actors did not meet when they recorded their speaking parts. Including Crosby, the last time that the entire cast worked together was the 1990 episode \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\". Wil Wheaton, who played Wesley Crusher on Star Trek: The Next Generation, recorded his parts for the episode on September 20, 2007.

He also found \\"Meg's journey of seeking acceptance through religion\\" well handled. Steve Heisler of The A.V.

This nonuniform strain breaks centrosymmetry, meaning that unlike in piezoelectiricty, flexoelectric effects can occur in centrosymmetric crystal structures.

Haruna thinks that school life is just like a monkey mountain‚Äîall the monkeys form cliques, get into fights, and get back together again. The school she just transferred to is no exception. There's even a boy called Macharu who reminds her of a baby monkey. It's hard enough fitting in at a new school while dealing with family problems. Will Haruna remain jaded and distance herself from everyone around her? Or will Macharu win her over with his monkey magic? Characters *Haruna Aizawa is the new transfer student. She transferred out of her old school because her father was involved in a political scandal. At first, she is very reserved and condescending to her fellow peers, comparing them to monkeys. She quickly ends up falling for Masaru, and even when they begin dating, she likes to deny her feelings for him due to embarrassment. *Masaru \\"Macharu\\" Yamashita is a goofy boy that attends Haruna's new school. He is often referred to as the \\"Baby Monkey\\" because of his personality and appearance. He is very close with Atsu. Macharu's family runs a produce store, which keeps both of his parents busy. His little sister, Misato, resembles him closely. He quickly falls for Haruna. The two eventually begin dating. Masaru thinks that he will marry Haruna one day; he is so sure about this that he told her father. *Atsuyuki Kidao is a classmate and friend of both Haruna and Masaru. He is the student council president and is popular with the girls. Though he seems like a player, Atsu is very kind and caring, often helping Masaru and Haruna make up when they fight. Later on, however, he seems to develop feelings for Haruna, though he doesn't act on it until later in the story. He often teases Masaru. His family runs a beauty salon. *Chika is a classmate. She attended middle school with Haruna where she was the captain of the girls' basketball team. Chika greatly admires Haruna, resulting in her thinking Masaru isn't good enough for Haruna. Chika joins the student council with Atsu. *Kobuhei is a classmate. He is seen as comical as others often tease him because he is really fat. Though he doesn't have good looks, Kobuhei is talented in singing, even joining a band and getting gigs.

Football careerPortsmouth= Bevis was born in Warsash, Hampshire and played football as a youth with Gosport Borough before joining Portsmouth as a trainee in February 1934. He signed a professional contract with Portsmouth in July 1936, but failed to break through into the first team at Fratton Park. =Southampton= In July 1937, he was one of several players recruited by Southampton's newly appointed manager Tom Parker, who was trying to build a side to push for promotion from Division Two. Bevis was immediately drafted into the first team as an 18-year- old, replacing the injured John Summers, for his debut in a 0‚Äì0 draw with Aston Villa on 4 September 1937. Bevis soon gained a reputation as a speedy right-winger and made 31 appearances in the 1937‚Äì38 season, scoring five goals. In the following season he only missed five matches, making 37 appearances and scoring six goals, including a \\"spectacular\\" hat-trick in a 3‚Äì1 victory at Swansea Town on 1 April 1939. His crosses also laid on scoring opportunities for the central forwards Reg Tomlinson and Fred Briggs who scored 12 and 14 league goals respectively, as the \\"Saints\\" finished 18th in the table, four points above the relegation zone. At the end of the season, Newcastle United made an enquiry about Bevis's availability. Bevis's football career was then interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War, although he continued to appear for the Saints in the wartime leagues in the early months of the war. He then joined the Merchant Navy as a petty officer gunner and during the war the ships on which he was serving were torpedoed three times and mined once. After one of these attacks, he spent seven days adrift in the Atlantic before being rescued. One of the crew who rescued him was a former colleague from Southampton, reserve team goalkeeper Alec Warnock. Bevis was later presented with the Distinguished Service Medal by King George VI at Buckingham Palace. After being demobbed in November 1945, Bevis returned to The Dell. He made 14 appearances, scoring five goals, in the 1946‚Äì47 season before losing his place on the right wing to Wilf Grant. At the end of the season, despite receiving an offer from Plymouth Argyle, he decided to retire. Later career On retiring from football, he returned to the sea while turning out occasionally for various non-league clubs, including Winchester City, Cowes Sports and Warsash. He settled in Park Gate, near his place of birth, where he died in August 1994.

The water tower on Plaza Lorea. The plaza today at eye level. Congressional Plaza (Spanish: Plaza del Congreso) is a public park facing the Argentine Congress in Buenos Aires. The plaza is part of a 3 hectare (7.5 acre) open space comprising three adjoining plazas to the east of the Congress building. The Kilometre Zero for all Argentine National Highways is marked on a milestone at the Plaza. History Colonial-era businessman Pedro Lorea purchased a 2 hectare (5 acre) lot in the Piety Market Hollow west of the growing hamlet of Buenos Aires in 1782. Lorea later donated around a third of this property for a carriage and cart stop. The Lorea matrimony lost their lives during the failed 1807 British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata and, in 1808, Viceroy Rafael de Sobremonte renamed the carriage lot in their honor. Plaza Lorea retained this function until 1871, when the swamps west of it were drained for development. A flour mill and wholesale market opened in the surroundings and a water tower was installed in the center of the plaza, which became a landscaped public park. The rapid economic growth of late nineteenth century Buenos Aires and the construction of the new Argentine Congress, begun in 1897, helped touch off improvements on Plaza Lorea before work on Congressional Plaza began. Local sculptor Juan Eugenio Boverie graced the plaza's new promenade in 1896 with El Perd√≥n (a sculpture relocated to the westside Avellaneda Park in 1991). Perhaps the most memorable early contribution was the 1907 purchase of one of the few casts of the iconic The Thinker French sculptor Auguste Rodin made before he destroyed the mold.argentinaviajera.com.ar rivadavia.com.ar The motivation for the plaza, the Argentine Congress, shortly after its 1906 inaugural. The inaugural of the Argentine Congress in 1906 (two blocks west of Plaza Lorea) created an aesthetic and urbanistic need for a namesake plaza, and on September 30, 1908, President Jos√© Figueroa Alcorta signed National Law 6286, a Congressional bill providing for the project. The Municipal Parks Director, French Argentine urbanist Charles Thays, envisioned a 3 hectare (7.5 acre) space divided crosswise by Montevideo Street and parallel to the Avenida de Mayo (May Avenue). His design was also approved because it required a minimal demolition of existing real estate, as it did not envisage lateral and rear plazas, as urbanist Joseph Bouvard had proposed.buenosairesteinvita.com.ar Congressional Plaza was inaugurated in January 1910 by Mayor Manuel G√ºiraldes and President Figueroa Alcorta. Its inaugural coincided with the completion of numerous other parks, avenues and redevelopments (several of the most important designed by Thays) ahead of the May 25, 1910 centennial of the May Revolution, the Buenos Aires assembly whose declaration led to Independence from the Spanish Empire in 1816. Following a 1967 city ordinance, May Avenue and most other city avenues and streets were made one way thoroughfares. Plaza Lorea, which in 1910 had been divided in two to facilitate traffic from May Avenue, in 1968 had its southern half resigned and added to Mariano Moreno Plaza to facilitate growing traffic further. May Avenue merges into Rivadavia Avenue at this junction. The layout of the three plazas (Congress is at left). Overview The Monument to the Two Congresses and behind it, Congress. Mariano Moreno Plaza Facing Congress, Congressional Plaza itself is dominated by the Monument to the Two Congresses, the work of Belgian sculptor Jules Lagae set on a Neoclassical esplanade designed by his fellow countryman, architect Henri d'Huicque, and completed in 1914. It was named in honor of the Constitutional Assembly of 1813, the first local attempt to create national law, and the Congress of Tucum√°n of 1816, which declared Independence from the Spanish Empire, and many locals refer to the plaza by that name. The monument's centerpiece, the Allegory of the Republic, and the remaining bronze allegories are set entirely in stone from Nancy, France. The monument is also known for its adjoining terraced fountain and its bronze Neptunes, the scene of light shows and the accompanying music by George Gershwin and Jacques Offenbach, early in the 20th century.aquimontserrat.com Suffering from repeated vandalism in the years since 1983, particularly, a decorative gated fence was erected around the monument in 1999. The opening of the gates by popular demand in 2002 resulted in renewed vandalism, and a new fence was installed in 2006, during renovations on the monument and fountain.Clar√≠n The three plazas and the Monument to the Two Congresses were designated a National Historic Monument by President Carlos Menem in 1997.National Decree 437/97 =Monument of the Two Congresses= Monument of the Two Congresses The Monumento de los dos Congresos in the Plaza des los Dos Congresos, was created in stone from Nancy. The monument was designed by the Belgian architect Eug√®ne D'Huicque (1877‚Äì1955) and the bronze statues are the work of the Belgian artist Jules Lagae(1862‚Äì1931). It was created in Brussels, finished in 1909, and inaugurated in Buenos Aires on July 9, 1914. The monument celebrates the centenary of the 1816 declaration of independence. The central figure represents the Republic on the march, with snake faces and an allegory of abundance at its feet. The two lateral figures represent the assembly of 1813 and the congress of 1816. There are also other representations of national fauna, notably of horses and condors. Plaza Mariano Moreno The Thinker, only the third of eight original casts made by Auguste Rodin. Mariano Moreno Plaza, to the east, is separated from Congressional Plaza (proper) by Montevideo Avenue, and was named in honor of Mariano Moreno, the intellectual leader of the 1810 May Revolution that led to Independence. A monument in his honor was unveiled in 1910. Moreno Plaza is also known for the symbolic \\"Kilometer Zero\\" marker put up by the Ministry of Public Works in 1935. Buenos Aires Mayor and Presidential candidate Fernando de la R√∫a was on hand to unveil a nearby monument to his political mentor, the late centrist UCR leader Ricardo Balb√≠n, in 1999. Moreno Plaza is best known to many as the site of one of the few surviving original casts of Auguste Rodin's The Thinker. Commissioned by Museums Director Eduardo Schiaffino for the city in 1907, he and Rodin had envisaged its placement on a pedestal on the grand steps in front of Congress ‚Äì a plan which never materialized. Currently, its transfer to its intended site is under consideration. =Kilometre Zero Monument= Kilometre Zero, Buenos Aires Argentina marks Kilometre Zero with a monolith in this park. The work of the brothers M√°ximo and Jos√© Fioravanti, the structure was placed on the north side of Plaza Lorea on October 2, 1935; it was moved to its present location on May 18, 1944. An image of Our Lady of Luj√°n (honored on the monolith as \\"the patron saint of the national road network\\") appears on the monolith's north face, a relief map of Argentina is on the south face, plaques in honor of Jos√© de San Mart√≠n are west, and on its eastern side, the date of the decree and the name of the relevant authorities. =Monument to Mariano Moreno= Monument to Mariano Moreno The monument to Mariano Moreno is in Plaza Mariano Moreno. It opened on 1 October 1910. The statue was created by Miguel Blay y F√°bregas (1866 ‚Äì 1936). Mariano Moreno (1778 ‚Äì 1811) was a lawyer, journalist and politician who played a decisive role in the May Revolution that led to the declaration of independence of Argentina from Spain. Moreno was a secretary in the First Junta that replaced the viceroy of Spain. He suppressed the uprising of Santiago de Liniers in C√≥rdoba (whom he had executed later), and organized the liberating expedition to Alto Per√∫. He was then removed from office by Cornelio Saavedra. =The Thinker= The Thinker only the third of eight original casts made by Auguste Rodin, commissioned by Museums Director Eduardo Schiaffino for the city in 1907, he and Rodin had envisaged its placement on a pedestal on the grand steps in front of Congress ‚Äì a plan which never materialized. Currently, its transfer to its intended site is under consideration. Plaza Lorea Less than half its original size, Plaza Lorea is commonly referred to as a plazoleta among locals. The plaza itself is dominated by the monument to Jos√© Manuel Estrada, a public official known for his opposition to secular education during the late 19th century. The conservative government in power at the time commissioned the monument in 1937, and it was unveiled a decade later. The grounds of this square were owned by the Spanish merchant Isidro Lorea, who with his wife died in this place in 1807 fending off the British troops during the British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata. =Monument to Jos√© Manuel Estrada= Monument to Jos√© Manuel Estrada. The sculpture of Estrada was ordered in 1937 by the municipality of Buenos Aires and inaugurated on 11 November 1947. It was created by the sculptor H√©ctor Rocha (1893-?), who also created a statue of General Manuel Belgrano in the plaza Manuel Belgrano, inaugurated in 1961, and the Monumento a Guillermo Rawson. This monument is to the late 19th century historian, journalist and publicist Jos√© Manuel Estrada (1842‚Äì1894), a leading Catholic intellectual and politician in Buenos Aires in the second half of the 19th century.

This technology is used for analysis of nucleic acid hybridization, specific binding of DNA, and low-molecular weight compounds with proteins, and protein-protein interactions. The gel pads increase the surface for hybridization to 50 times, compared to typical microarrays which are printed on flat surface of a glass slide that is usually treated by chemical compounds on which the probes adhere. A probe density of more than 1012 molecules per gel pad can be achieved due to 3D nature of the gel pads. The array is based on a glass surface that has small polyacrylamide gel units affixed to it. Each gel unit functions as an individual reaction cell as it is surrounded by a hydrophobic glass surface that prevents mixing of the solution in the gel units. This lays a foundation for performing ligation, single base extension, PCR amplification of DNA, on-chip MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and other reactions. Figure 1. MAGIChip slide showing 3D nature of the probes in gel pads Historical background MAGIChip technology was developed as a result of collaboration between Dr. David Stahl at University of Washington and Dr Andrei Mirzabekov, formerly of Argonne National laboratory. Andrei Mirzabekov initiated the development of the DNA sequencing by hybridization with oligonucleotides: a novel method in 1988. This method was a foundation for the biotechnology that uses biological microchips to identify DNA structures rapidly, which is of great importance in the fight against a variety of diseases. A joint research project was announced in 1998 among Motorola Inc, Packard Instrument Company and the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory. In 1999, the researchers at Argonne National Lab pushed the development of microarray-type biochip technology they co-designed with the Engelhardt Institute to ward off a worldwide outbreak of tuberculosis. Motorola developed manufacturing processes to mass-produce biochips, and Packard developed and manufactured the analytical instruments to process and analyze the biochips. Argonne's contribution, in conjunction with Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology (EIMB), was intellectual property in the form of 19 inventions related to biological microchips. But this collaboration between EIMB in Moscow and Argonne National Laboratory at Illinois and two other US-based commercial partners collapsed as result of argument on contractual arrangement between the parties in 2001. As a result of this dispute, Dr Andrei Mirzabekov resigned as a director of Argonne's Biochip Technology Centre. Method Arrays of gel elements (pads) are created on the glass surface (micromatrix) which is followed by application and chemical immobilization of different compounds (probes) onto these gel pads. Test sample is then added to this micromatrix containing immobilized probes in gel pads and molecular recognition reactions are allowed to take place under specified conditions. The test sample is fluorescent labelled to monitor the molecular interactions. The analysis of molecular interaction patterns is done by using specialized software. Figure 2: Photopolymerization Chamber Figure 3: Schematic of MAGIChip Technology The array of gel elements on a glass slide is prepared by ‚Äò‚Äô‚Äôphotopolymerization‚Äò‚Äô‚Äô. The acrylamide solution to be polymerized is applied to the polymerization chamber. Polymerization chamber consists of a quartz mask, two Teflon spacers, and a microscopic glass slide, clamped together by two metal clamps. The inner side of quartz mask has ultraviolet (UV)-transparent windows arranged in a specified spatial manner in a non- transparent chromium film. Assembled chamber containing the acrylamide gel is exposed to UV light to allow polymerization in only those positions of the chamber that are situated directly under the transparent windows. Oligonucleotides or DNA fragments need to be activated to contain chemically reactive groups to facilitate coupling with the activated gel elements. Probe activation depends on the chemistry of activation of the polyacrylamide gels. Thus to immobilize in the aldehyde-containing gel the probe should have reactive amino group and if the gels are activated by introduction of amino groups, the probes should contain free aldehyde group. Probes are usually prepared by introduction of chemically active groups in terminal position of the oligonucleotides during their synthesis. Probes for immobilization are transferred into gel elements of micromatrix by using dispensing robots. The fibre-optic pin of the robots has a hydrophobic side surface and a hydrophilic tip, and operates at a dew temperature to prevent evaporation of the sample during transfer. The activated probes are chemically immobilized by coupling oligonucleotides bearing amino or aldehyde groups with gel supports containing aldehyde or amino groups respectively. The target molecules are labelled with fluorescent dyes. The fluorescent detection enables monitoring the process in real time with high spatial resolution. The criteria for labelling procedure includes ‚Äì # It should be simple, fast and inexpensive # It should be applicable to both RNA and DNA targets # It should be compatible with fragmentation required to decrease secondary structure formation # It should allow incorporation of one label into one fragment to ensure proper quantification of the hybridization intensity # It should allow coupling of multiple dyes =On-chip amplification reactions= On-chip amplification of the hybridization reaction serves as a very useful tool when the DNA or protein under study are present in relatively small proportion in the molecular population applied to the chip, e.g., when one is dealing with a single copy gene or mRNA of low abundance. In a single base extension method,(1998)The runners-up. Science 282, 2156‚Äì2157. a primer is hybridized to DNA and extended by a dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphate that matches the nucleotide at a polymorphic site. By performing this reaction at a temperature above the melting temperature of the duplex between the DNA and immobilized probe allows rapid association/dissociation of the target DNA. Thus the same DNA molecule reacts with many individual primers, leading to amplification of the primers in each individual gel pads. This procedure was applied to the identification of beta-globin gene mutation in the patients of beta thalassemia patients and to detection of anthrax toxin gene. Figure 4. Single nucleotide extension reaction The chips also provides a good platform for performing PCR directly on the chip (in individual gel pads) as it is easy to isolate each gel pad from its neighbour unlike typical microarray chips which face serious problems in doing the same task For the analysis of hybridization results obtained with fluorescently labelled target molecules fluorescence microscopes are employed. The instrument is equipped with controlled- temperature sample table to vary the temperature in the chip-containing reaction chamber during the course of the experiment. A cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera is used to record the light signals from the chip, which are then sent to the computer program for quantitative evaluation of the hybridization signals over the entire chip. Data generated by these experiments is stored in a database and analyzed by software that help provide evaluation, in silico experimentation, and hardware and software quality control. Typesoligonucleotide chips= Customized oligonucleotide biochips are designed to interrogate test samples of known nucleotide sequences. For example, known genes in cases when one is interested in their expression levels under certain conditions, genes that are known to contain point mutations, or to be polymorphic in a given population. The success of the microarray depends on the proper choice of probes in these cases. A set of potential hybridization probes are created for each DNA sequence that form perfect duplexes with that sequence. The potential probes that may create ambiguities in the interpretation of the hybridization pattern are excluded on the basis of AT vs GC content, and the propensity to form hairpins and other types of stable secondary structures that may drastically affect the intensity of hybridization. One of the cases of successful applications of customized oligonucleotide chips include detection of beta-thalassemia mutation in patients. For the diagnostics of beta-thalassemia mutations, a simple chip was designed that contained six probes corresponding to different beta-thalassemia genotypes and hybridized with PCR-amplified DNA from healthy humans and patients.Yershov, G., Barsky, V., Belgovskiy, A., Kirillov, E., Kreindlin, E., Ivanov, I., Parinov, S., Guschin, D., Drobyshev, A., Dubiley, S., and Mirzabekov, A. (1996) DNA analysis and diagnostics on oligonucleotide microchips. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93, 4913‚Äì4918. The hybridization results showed the expected significant differences in signal intensity between matched and mismatched duplexes, thus allowing reliable identification of both homozygous and heterozygous mutations. =rRNA chips= These chips haves been developed for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) targets, commonly used for detecting bacteria. rRNA are very abundant in the cell comprising about 80% of the RNA content of the typical eukaryotic cell.Zlatanova, J., and Mirzabekov, A., ‚ÄúGel-Immobilized Microarrays of Nucleic Acids and Proteins. Production and Application for Macromolecular Research,‚Äù Methods Mol. Biol. 170, 17‚àí38 (2001). The rRNA is pre-amplified by bacteria and there are present in several thyousand copies per cell, making a good target for microassays. Single nucleotide polymorphisms present in the bacterial rRNA sequence are used to differentiate bacteria at the genus, species and strain level. This is a unique feature of this microchip that does not require PCR based amplification. The process for detecting bacterial is relatively simple. The bacteria are cultured, washed and pelleted. Lysosome is used to lyse the pellets - to destroy the cell walls and release the nucleic acid. Lysed bacteria are passed through a colourmn preparation where nucleic acid from the cell is immobilized and other debris is washed out. All the processes after lysis - isolation, purification, fragmentation and labelling of target rRNA's - are stable chemical reactions Fragments <500 bp easily hybridize to the gel matrix. The total number of eluted off the chip is determined by UV spectrophotometer. The process from sample preparation to identification of organisms based on automated algorithms take place in 2 hours. =cDNA= cDNAs obtained from reverse transcription of mRNA population extracted from the cells in varying physiological and experimental conditions are used as immobilized probes. These arrays are widely used to study gene expression. The potential obstacle in using cDNAs is due to the difficulty of injecting and evenly distributing long molecules into the gel pads. This problem is resolved by developing polyacrylamide gels that contain larger average pore size. Another way to approach this problem is to randomly fragment the cDNA into relatively small pieces before immobilization =Proteins= Protein chips can be prepared that contain different proteins immobilized as probes in a way that preserves their biological activity.Guschin, D., Yershov, G., Zaslavsky, A., Gemmell, A., Shick, V., Proudnikov, D., Arenkov, P., and Mirzabekov, A. (1997) Manual manufacturing of oligonucleotide, DNA and protein microchips. Anal. Biochem. 250, 203‚Äì211. A large pore gel is used to prevent the diffusion of protein into the gel. There are two ways to immobilize proteins to the gel pads. The first is based on activation of the gel with glutyraldehyde. In the second procedure the gel is activated by partial substitution of amino groups with hydrazide groups. The reaction between hydrazide and aldehyde groups efficiently cross-links the protein to the cell. Protein microchips show the high specificity in molecular recognition reactions as seen in solution. Interaction between antigen and their specific antibodies can be studied on- chip in variety of experimental conditions. Either the antigen or antibody can be immobilized and monitored by both direct and indirect methods. In direct method, one uses target molecules labelled with fluorescent dye and in the indirect method the reaction is detected using the labelled molecule that specifically recognizes the target. These chips can be used to study enzymatic activity of immobilized enzymes by coating the chip with solution containing specific substrates. The reaction is monitored by detecting the formation of coloured or fluorescent precipitates Other applications * They can be used to study singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in its method. Because bacterial DNA is highly conserved over time, SNPs are useful to identify bacterial on the chip, and since SNPs are the most abundant variations in the human genome, they have become the primary markers for genetic studies for mapping and identifying susceptible genes for complex diseases.Weiner, M. P., and Hudson, T. J., ‚ÄúIntroduction to SNPs: Discovery of Markers for Disease,‚Äù Biotechniques 32(S), 4‚àí13 (2002). * They can be used to detect virulence factors which are toxins and proteins that invade the organism. These toxins tend to have small number of copy transcripts and produced under very specific conditions found in the host. Here identification strategy focus on the single copy DNA sequence where MAGIChips are very effective. * The protein biochips makes it very exciting as proteins are contained within a single cell and they can all be analyzed in one array platform. Protein biochips can be used to identify protein biomarkers for diagnosing diseases or a particular stage of the disease. They can also help to delineate relationship between protein structure and function of the protein and identify the function of a protein or different proteins throughout the same or different cell types. Although the MAGIChips need some modifications, the applications and techniques are quite standard.Biotechnology Industry Organization (Bio), The Technologies and Their Applications, available at http://www.bio.org/er/applications.asp. * The chips can be used as a diagnostic tool in clinics by virtue of its rapid detection time, high-throughput, result confidence, hierarchical identification and quantification. With them it is possible to achieve time required for sample collection to reporting of results in clinical settings within 2 hours. The rapid turnaround time is an attractive attribute of point- of-care testing while patient awaits the results. * High-throughput nature of these devices allow thousands of microbial probes for species specific and even strain-specific identification at the same time on a single chip, reducing the amount of sample needed to conduct multiple tests. Potential threats posed by use of bacteria, viruses and fungi as biological weapons against humans, agriculture and environment warrants development of technology for accurate and sensitive detection within a very short time. MAGIChip prospective technology which has been used for discrimination of important viruses. Fungal probes have been introduced into rRNA chips for agricultural research in genetics, reproduction, diseases and even crop protection. Thousands of gene can be targeted simultaneously to look for genetic diversity or microbial infestation by nature or by intentional release.

It was invented in 1850 by Heinrich Kirchweger. A similar system was developed by Rohrbeck. Overview Exhaust steam was extracted from the steam chest and fed through a 100 mm diameter pipe under the locomotive to the tender. There the steam was fed directly into the feedwater, which thus heated up to boiling point. The remaining steam was allowed to escape to atmosphere through a second chimney on the tender. The quantity of steam could be regulated using a cock on the tender. The Rohrbeck system differed in detail from the Kirchweger condenser, in which steam was removed at the blast pipe and led away along the top of the boiler. The system was regulated by a throttle valve on the blast pipe. Fuel savings Using such a system, fuel savings of between 10 and 20% were possible, depending on the operating conditions. In some circumstances even as much as 30% could be saved. The Lower Silesian-M√§rkisch Railway (Niederschlesisch-M√§rkische Eisenbahn) put this saving at 7.5% on its locomotives. Contamination However the contamination of boiler feedwater with foreign bodies was a problem. Old sources report erosion of the boiler plates which was caused by fatty acids contained in the lubricant accompanying the exhaust steam. On the other hand, the formation of scale in the boiler was delayed because a proportion of the boiler scale constituents had already been left behind in the tender. Withdrawal With the introduction of injectors for feeding water into the boiler, exhaust steam condensers were taken out of use from the 1860s, because injectors could only handle cold water. By about 1880, around 900 German locomotives had been fitted with condensing apparatus.  See also  * Condensing steam locomotive * Feedwater heater  References  ;General * R. von Helmholtz, W.

Elders told stories of their journeys and their accomplishments. As the children grew into adults they took on the responsibility of passing on the stories. These stories are as much a cultural necessity as they are entertainment and are still passed on orally though many are now recorded in print, audio and video Aboriginal Australian storytelling The Songlines, also called Dreaming tracks, were a form of Indigenous storytelling that brought about understanding of the landscape. They told stories about the path of a creator-spirit during the Dreaming. There is a large collection of stories from the Aboriginal Dreamtime that form a large part of Australian storytelling history. These include stories about the Bunyip. New stories These Europeans who came to the continent in the form of convicts, soldiers and settlers brought their own stories which were passed around Britain's new penal colony orally. For the 150 000 convicts who were transported to Australia in the late 18th and early 19th centuries stories were essential. They had been harshly, and often unjustly, treated and exiled with no hope of returning to the land of their birth. It is through stories that we create culture. The convicts, most of whom were from the labouring classes of England, Wales and Ireland, needed to recreate their culture in an alien environment. While the stories they brought with them offered comfort during the desperate loneliness of isolation they also needed to forget the country that had forsaken them. So by the 1820s the songs and stories the convicts brought from the British Isles had begun to merge with the stories of their new land as they went about recreating their lives and their culture. An anti-authoritarian attitude emerged in their new culture which was often reflected in their stories. Some of the pain of abandonment was eased through the sharing of stories about bushrangers who dared to rob the rich and flout authority. One such bushranger was Ned Kelly who became a hero of the people and a legend in life and death. His is still one of the best known Australian stories. Later, the prospectors who flooded Australian goldfields during the 1800s brought with them the stories they heard on the American goldfields. These stories soon took on an Australian flavour and became part of the country's folklore. Other stories, uniquely Australian, also sprang from the goldfields. One such story is the story of the Eureka Stockade‚Äîa miners' uprising on the Ballarat goldfields in 1854‚Äîsaid to be the start of democracy in Australia. New developments brought new stories; stories of pioneers who survived harsh conditions, stories of explorers such as Burke and Wills and stories of tragic shipwrecks. Events reported in newspapers were shared orally, and no doubt embellished. 20th- century stories The Depression years of the 1930s brought the itinerant storyteller;the swagmen who carried the stories across the vast continent as they walked from town to town looking for work. Many of the swaggies became practised oral storytellers as, night after night, they camped on riverbanks and yarned by the fire. Well-known Australian storyteller Nell Bell remembers \\"my grandfather telling me about his mates, fencing contractors in northwest NSW, and my grandmother as she churned, telling me tales of leprechauns and willy willies. There were the Chinese market gardens at the top of the street with tales of emperors and peacocks; the tramp who lived under the bridge and told me tale after tale and the metho [methylated spirits] drinker with tales of America and the Outback. These were real folks, a purely Australian tradition.\\" One of the itinerant storytellers from the depression years was Henry Lawson, who was born on the goldfields‚Äîthe son of a Norwegian seaman. He roamed the bush with the swagmen. Fame, though not fortune, came to him through his poems and short stories and when he died in 1922 he was honoured with a state funeral. Many Australian stories, such as Lawson's \\"The Drover's Wife\\", developed in the distant and harsh conditions of the Australian bush where men and women would \\"wonder and fear\\". Sharing stories helped ease loneliness and homesickness, brought back memories of comfortable times and places and generated a feeling of togetherness against the wild unknown. The stories were told around the fire while the billy boiled; the fire and the stories combining to offer a feeling of security. The war years (1914‚Äì18 and 1939‚Äì45) added another dimension to Australian folktales. New heroes began to emerge. From the First World War emerged the Anzacs and the story of Simpson and his donkey, and Sister Vivian Bullwinkel to name just a few. After World War II the Jewish refugees from Eastern Europe and many other different ethnic groups have each added rich dimensions to Australian storytelling. Post-war affluence brought new mediums of entertainment and new ways of telling stories and the oral tradition was overlooked for many years. Storytelling Guilds However, in the 1970s oral storytelling was given new life with the formation of storytelling guilds in Victoria and Western Australia and later in New South Wales and other states. In Australia today there are active guilds in Queensland, Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. These guilds have close ties with storytelling guilds in New Zealand. The biennial 'Weaving Stories Together' ‚Äì Sydney International Storytelling Conference draws participants and presenters from the Americas, Europe, Asia, the Pacific and Australasia. Storytellers With the importance of oral literacy now being acknowledged by many Australian educators, oral storytellers have become a valuable resource for teachers. Many Australian storytellers, such as JB Rowley, Gael Cresp, Jackie Kerin and others, are also successful authors. Another Australian storyteller, Louisa John-Krol, uses stories as a basis for her music. Larry Brandy is an Aboriginal storyteller who specialises in involving his audience, using artefacts.

The device is activated by an electric signal, to fire a small explosive charge which in turn shears away a small flange that initially blocked the flow path of the attached tubing. Another version of a pyrotechnic valve remains in an open position until activated. The pressure from the pyrotechnic charge then forces the flange into a weakened part of the attached tube to block the flow path of the tubing. Some pyrotechnic compositions could be made up of plants that produce enough energy to initiate the trigger of a spacecraft.Tooley, Craig R., et al. \\"Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Mission and Spacecraft Design.\\" Space Science Reviews, vol. 150, no. 1-4, Jan. 2010, pp. 23-62. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1007/s11214-009-9624-4. These two versions of pyrotechnic valves are referred to as normally-closed (NC) or normally-open (NO) valves, depending on their initial state before initiation of the pyrotechnic charge When the opening of the valve is under enough pressure, it will expand and enter the pressurized liquid tank which is at about 10 bars, which is sufficient to force the liquid into the circuit of the power tank. The estimating chamber, which relates to the downstream piece of the valve, is set under a vacuum before dispatch. The upstream part loads with gas, when the specialty touches base in the air to be considered and the opening of the valve realizes the filling of the estimating chamber. At present, pyrotechnic valves are broadly used for opening a pipe through which passes a liquid, particularly on-air ship or rocket. The working guideline consists of using gases under a high weight delivered by a pyrotechnic gadget, with a specific end goal to dislodge an unbending part. The last can be a sliding valve center having at least one protuberances. All together that its dislodgement has the impact of raising a valve, with the goal that the section of the liquid is conceivable. In different sorts of valve, the mobile unbending part punctures a pipe or cuts off a precut end fitting. This second kind of valve is used more especially in rocket, e.g. for the push of a propulsive liquid mass, a gas being put away under high weight (a hardly any hundred bars), the opening of the valve empowering it to grow and enter the pressurized fluid tank which is at around 10 bars, which is adequate to constrain the fluid into the circuit of the power plant. Another spatial application is the investigation of the environment encompassing a planet. The estimating chamber, which relates to the downstream piece of the valve, is set under a vacuum before dispatch. The upstream part loads with gas, when the specialty lands in the air to be considered and the opening of the valve achieves the filling of the estimating chamber by suction. The valve must have an impeccable snugness, especially in the second case, all together not to adulterate the estimations, or when the liquid coursing in the valve speaks to a threat to the earth. In any case, most of the current frameworks experience the ill effects of the impediment of not having a satisfactory seal or snugness between the zone in which are found the gases delivered by the pyrotechnic gadgets and the liquid section zone. As a result, such valves don't follow certain serious prerequisites, and can't be used as a part of pneumatic frameworks conveyed by rocket, where it is required that the environment isn't contaminated by their activity or by suction.

It consists of isolating methylated DNA fragments via an antibody raised against 5-methylcytosine (5mC). This technique was first described by Weber M. et al. in 2005 and has helped pave the way for viable methylome-level assessment efforts, as the purified fraction of methylated DNA can be input to high-throughput DNA detection methods such as high-resolution DNA microarrays (MeDIP-chip) or next-generation sequencing (MeDIP-seq). Nonetheless, understanding of the methylome remains rudimentary; its study is complicated by the fact that, like other epigenetic properties, patterns vary from cell-type to cell-type.  Background  DNA methylation, referring to the reversible methylation of the 5 position of cytosine by methyltransferases, is a major epigenetic modification in multicellular organisms. In mammals, this modification primarily occurs at CpG sites, which in turn tend to cluster in regions called CpG islands. There is a small fraction of CpG islands that can overlap or be in close proximity to promoter regions of transcription start sites. The modification may also occur at other sites, but methylation at either of these sites can repress gene expression by either interfering with the binding of transcription factors or modifying chromatin structure to a repressive state. Disease condition studies have largely fueled the effort in understanding the role of DNA methylation. Currently, the major research interest lies in investigating disease conditions such as cancer to identify regions of the DNA that has undergone extensive methylation changes. The genes contained in these regions are of functional interest as they may offer a mechanistic explanation to the underlying genetic causes of a disease. For instance, the abnormal methylation pattern of cancer cells was initially shown to be a mechanism through which tumor suppressor-like genes are silenced, although it was later observed that a much broader range of gene types are affected. = Other technologies = There are two approaches to methylation analysis: typing and profiling technologies. Typing technologies are targeted towards a small number of loci across many samples, and involve the use of techniques such as PCR, restriction enzymes, and mass spectrometry. Profiling technologies such as MeDIP are targeted towards a genome- or methylome-wide level assessment of methylation; this includes restriction landmark genomic scanning (RLGS), and bisulfite conversion-based methods, which rely on the treatment of DNA with bisulfite to convert unmethylated cytosine residues to uracil. = Limitations of other technologies = Other methods mapping and profiling the methylome have been effective but are not without their limitations that can affect resolution, level of throughput, or experimental variations. For instance, RLGS is limited by the number of restriction sites in genome that can be targets for the restriction enzyme; typically, a maximum of ~4100 landmarks can be assessed. Bisulfite sequencing-based methods, despite possible single- nucleotide resolution, have a drawback: the conversion of unmethylated cytosine to uracil can be unstable. In addition, when bisulfite conversion is coupled with DNA microarrays to detect bisulfite converted sites, the reduced sequence complexity of DNA is a problem. Microarrays capable of comprehensively profiling the whole-genome become difficult to design as fewer unique probes are available.  Methods  The following sections outline the method of MeDIP coupled with either high-resolution array hybridization or high-throughput sequencing. Each DNA detection method will also briefly describe post-laboratory processing and analysis. Different post-processing of the raw data is required depending on the technology used to identify the methylated sequences. This is analogous to data generated using ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq. Workflow overview of the MeDIP procedure. MeDIP procedure is followed by array-hybridization (A) or high-throughput/next generation sequencing (B) = Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) = Genomic DNA is extracted (DNA extraction) from the cells and purified. The purified DNA is then subjected to sonication to shear it into random fragments. This sonication process is quick, simple, and avoids restriction enzyme biases. The resulting fragments range from 300 to 1000 base pairs (bp) in length, although they are typically between 400 and 600 bp. The short length of these fragments is important in obtaining adequate resolution, improving the efficiency of the downstream step in immunoprecipitation, and reducing fragment-length effects or biases. Also, the size of the fragment affects the binding of 5-methyl- cytidine (5mC) antibody because the antibody needs more than just a single 5mC for efficient binding. To further improve binding affinity of the antibodies, the DNA fragments are denatured to produce single-stranded DNA. Following denaturation, the DNA is incubated with monoclonal 5mC antibodies. The classical immunoprecipitation technique is then applied: magnetic beads conjugated to anti-mouse-IgG are used to bind the anti-5mC antibodies, and unbound DNA is removed in the supernatant. To purify the DNA, proteinase K is added to digest the antibodies and release the DNA, which can be collected and prepared for DNA detection. For more details regarding the experimental steps see. = MeDIP and array-based hybridization (MeDIP-chip) = A fraction of the input DNA obtained after the sonication step above is labeled with cyanine-5 (Cy5; red) deoxy-cytosine-triphosphate while the methylated DNA, enriched after the immunoprecipitation step, is labeled with cyanine-3 (Cy3; green). The labeled DNA samples are cohybridized on a 2-channel, high-density genomic microarray to probe for presence and relative quantities. The purpose of this comparison is to identify sequences that show significant differences in hybridization levels, thereby confirming the sequence of interest is enriched. Array-based identification of MeDIP sequences are limited to the array design. As a result, the resolution is restricted to the probes in the array design. There are additional standard steps required in signal processing to correct for hybridization issues such as noise, as is the case with most array technologies. See DNA methylation microarray for more details. = MeDIP and high-throughput sequencing (MeDIP-seq) = The MeDIP-seq approach, i.e. the coupling of MeDIP with next generation, short-read sequencing technologies such as 454 pyrosequencing or Illumina (Solexa), was first described by Down et al. in 2008. The high-throughput sequencing of the methylated DNA fragments produces a large number of short reads (36-50bp or 400 bp, depending on the technology). The short reads are aligned to a reference genome using alignment software such as Mapping and Assembly with Quality (Maq), which uses a Bayesian approach, along with base and mapping qualities to model error probabilities for the alignments. The reads can then be extended to represent the ~400 to 700 bp fragments from the sonication step. The coverage of these extended reads can be used to estimate the methylation level of the region. A genome browser such as Ensembl can also be used to visualize the data. Validation of the approach to assess quality and accuracy of the data can be done with quantitative PCR. This is done by comparing a sequence from the MeDIP sample against an unmethylated control sequence. The samples are then run on a gel and the band intensities are compared. The relative intensity serves as the guide for finding enrichment. The results can also be compared with MeDIP-chip results to help determine coverage needed.  Downstream bioinformatics analysis  Simple workflow demonstrating a typical experiment using MeDIP-seq. The DNA methylation level estimations can be confounded by varying densities of methylated CpG sites across the genome when observing data generated by MeDIP. This can be problematic for analyzing CpG-poor (lower density) regions. One reason for this density issue is its effect on the efficiency of immunoprecipitation. In their study, Down et al. developed a tool to estimate absolute methylation levels from data generated by MeDIP by modeling the density of methylated CpG sites. This tool is called Bayesian tool for methylation analysis (Batman). The study reports the coverage of ~90% of all CpG sites in promoters, gene- coding regions, islands, and regulatory elements where methylation levels can be estimated; this is almost 20 times better coverage than any previous methods. Studies using MeDIP-seq or MeDIP-chip are both genome-wide approaches that have the common aim of obtaining the functional mapping of the methylome. Once regions of DNA methylation are identified, a number of bioinformatics analyses can be applied to answer certain biological questions. One obvious step is to investigate genes contained in these regions and investigate the functional significance of their repression. For example, silencing of tumour- suppressor genes in cancer can be attributed to DNA methylation. By identifying mutational events leading to hypermethylation and subsequent repression of known tumour-suppressor genes, one can more specifically characterize the contributing factors to the cause of the disease. Alternatively, one can identify genes that are known to be normally methylated but, as a result of some mutation event, is no longer silenced. Also, one can try and investigate and identify whether some epigenetic regulator has been affected such as DNA methyltransferase (DNMT); in these cases, enrichment may be more limited. Gene-set analysis (for example using tools like DAVID and GoSeq) has been shown to be severely biased when applied to high-throughput methylation data (e.g. MeDIP-seq and MeDIP-ChIP); it has been suggested that this can be corrected using sample label permutations or using a statistical model to control for differences in the numberes of CpG probes / CpG sites that target each gene.  Limitations of MeDIP  Limitations to take note when using MeDIP are typical experimental factors. This includes the quality and cross-reactivity of 5mC antibodies used in the procedure. Furthermore, DNA detection methods (i.e. array hybridization and high-throughput sequencing) typically involve well established limitations. Particularly for array-based procedures, as mentioned above, sequences being analyzed are limited to the specific array design used. Most typical limitations to high-throughput, next generation sequencing apply. The problem of alignment accuracy to repetitive regions in the genome will result in less accurate analysis of methylation in those regions. Also, as was mentioned above, short reads (e.g. 36-50bp from an Illumina Genome Analyzer) represent a part of a sheared fragment when aligned to the genome; therefore, the exact methylation site can fall anywhere within a window that is a function of the fragment size. In this respect, bisulfite sequencing has much higher resolution (down to a single CpG site; single nucleotide level). However, this level of resolution may not be required for most applications, as the methylation status of CpG sites within < 1000 bp has been shown to be significantly correlated.  Applications of MeDIP  * Weber et al. 2005 determined that the inactive X-chromosome in females is hypermethylated on a chromosome wide level using MeDIP coupled with microarray. * Keshet et al. 2006 performed a study on colon and prostate cancer cells using MeDIP-chip. The result is a genome-wide analysis of genes lying in hypermethylated regions as well as conclude that there is an instructive mechanism of de novo methylation in cancer cells. * Zhang et al. 2006 obtained a high resolution methylome mapping in Arabidopsis using MeDIP- chip. * Novak et al. 2006 used the MeDIP-chip approach to investigate human breast cancer for methylation associated silencing and observed the inactivation of the HOXA gene cluster  See also  * Epigenetics * Immunoprecipitation * Methylome * Restriction landmark genomic scanning * Bisulfite sequencing  References  Category:Molecular biology Category:Epigenetics Category:Genomics Category:Protein methods ","title":"Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation"},{"id":"21728823","text":"Award named in honoring Vladas Jurgutis Vladas Jurgutis Award is a prestigious economic award, once a year granted by the Bank of Lithuania and Lithuanian Academy of Sciences.

Bis ins 13. Jahrhundert: Beitr√§ge einer internationalen Konferenz, Leipzig, 4.-6. Dezember 1997, Franz Steiner Verlag, 2001, p.13, the area was inhabited by the Veleti. The area became part of the Billung march of the Holy Roman Empire's Duchy of Saxony in 936. In the course of a successful uprising in 983, the Veleti made a transition to the Lutician federation, an alliance of several tribes based in Radgosc (Rethra).Joachim Herrmann, Die Slawen in Deutschland, Akademie-Verlag Berlin, 1985, p.261 The Kessinians emerged as the northernmost of four tribes constituting the core of the federation, with the other three being Circipanes, Redarians, and Tollensians. In 1056/57, the alliance broke apart due to internal struggles between these four tribes. The western neighbors of the Kessinians, the Obodrites, took advantage of the resulting civil war and subdued the Kessinians along with the Circipanes.Joachim Herrmann, Die Slawen in Deutschland, Akademie-Verlag Berlin, 1985, pp.365-367 Integrated in the Obodrite state during the following decades, the Kessinians lost their self- determination. However, overlordship of the Obodrite nobility backed by Saxons and Danes was not always accepted, as shown by two expeditions of Saxon duke Lothar von Supplinburg, who subdued the Kessinan prince Dumar and his son in 1114, and another Kessinian prince, Sventipolk, in 1121.Joachim Herrmann, Die Slawen in Deutschland, Akademie-Verlag Berlin, 1985, pp.380 The Circipanes, former Lutician allies of the Kessinians, are reported to have actively participated in the 1114 expedition with 300 light cavalry. Finally, the Kessinian remains were assimilated by German settlers during the medieval Ostsiedlung, who turned the successor of the Obodrites' state, the Duchy of Mecklenburg, into a German region during the 12th century.

It is believed that Rama used grass ('pul' in Tamil as a pillow (thalai annai in Tamil) to sleep and hence the village attained the name Thiruppullani. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries CE. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Adi Jagannatha and his consort Lakshmi as Padmasini. The temple is believed to have been built during the late 8th century CE, with later contributions from Medieval Cholas, later Pandyas, Sethupathi Kings of Ramnad. As per Hindu legend, Rama is believed to have done penance to worship the god of ocean to seek way to Lanka in grass, giving the name Dharbasayanam to the place. The temple is maintained and administered by the Ramanathapuram Samasthan Devasthanam a Trust under the control of the Ramnad King Sethupathi successor and at present Her Highness the Queen Raja Rajeswari Natchiyar as Hereditary Trustee and the accounts were audited by Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend Nagars200pxleftalt=Images of Snake deity, Nagarthumb As per Hindu legend, Rama in the epic Ramayana prayed to the Samudraraja (God of Ocean) to seek way to reach Lanka. He did a penance lying in Kusa grass (Dharba grass), the act of which is described in Sanskrit as Dharbasayanam. As per another legend, Dasharatha, the father of Rama, performed different sacrifices and did a lot of penance to obtain the sacred payasam (sweet pudding). He offered it equally to his three wives, resulting in the birth of Rama, Lakshmana, Bharatha and Shatrughna. Following the legend, childless couple perform a worship called nagapradishta (installing a statue of snake god) in the temple. Sweet pudding is offered to childless couple praying for a child. It is believed that Adi Jaganatha bestows a child like Rama when such a worship is performed. History thumb The temple is believed to have been initiated during the Medieval Chola period along with many temples dedicated to Rama. The Chola king Parantaka I named himself \\"Sangrama Raghava\\" after his conquest of Sri Lanka, while his son Aditya I was called Kothandarama. Some later Pandya kings also made contributions to the temple. A mutilated inscription in the temple made during the 37th year of Maravarman Sundara Pandyan in 1305 records order of a minister by name Arya Chakravarthi. Historians believe some portions of the temple tower might also have been built by Jaffna kings, who were friends of Pandya Empire and also rulers of Rameswaram. There is one damaged record from 1518 from the period of Mahabali Vanadaraya Naykkar and one another made in 1528 during the reign of Sundarattoludaiyar Mahabali Vanadarayar. There are inscriptions in the temple indicating Arab traders visiting the Pandyan Empire. The traders traded pearl and pepper and in return were allowed to build mosques in the region for their worship. The mosques followed Dravidian architecture with stone pillars and were called Kallupalli. The temple received lot of contributions from the Vijayanagara period, along with other Vishnu temples in the region. Architecture The temple is located in Thirupullani, a village located from Ramanathapuram. The temple has a five- tiered rajagopuram (gateway tower) facing east. The shrine of Adi Jagannatha houses the image of Adi Jagannatha, Bhudevi and Sri Devi in sitting posture. The consort of Adi Jagannathar is Padmasini, housed in a separate shrine. There is a shrine for Dharbasayana Ramar in a reclining posture. There is a metal image of Krishna from the 13th-century Pandya period. The image depicts Krishna dancing in a snake, a rare historical depiction of Krishna in a metal image. Festivals, religious practices and significance temple tank200pxrightalt=Temple tankthumb The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. Like other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub- caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day: Ushathkalam at 7 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 10:00 p.m. The Vaikhanasa Agama Shastrams and Thengalai Vaishnava traditions are followed in all the temple rituals. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Adi Jagannatha and Padmasini. During the last step of worship, nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The two major festivals celebrated in the temple are the Panguni Brahmotsavam for Adi Jagannathar and Rama Navami Utsavam during the Tamil month of Chittirai. Other major festivals celebrated in Vishnu temples in South India like Vaikunta Ekadashi, Krishna Jayanthi, Pongal and Diwali, are also celebrated. The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th‚Äì9th century Vaishnava canon, by Thirumangai Alvar in one hymn. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. The temple is revered in 20 verses of Thirumangai Azhwar in his Periya Thirumozhi in Nalayira Divya Prabandham. The epic is also described by Kambar in his work Kamba Ramayanam.

Hutcheon, who was from Toowoomba, represented Australasia at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, as an 18-year-old. He competed in the Men's Standing High Jump, where he was the youngest out of all 23 athletes in the event and the only from the Australasian team. The gold medal was won by American olympic great Ray Ewry. In the Great War, Hutcheon fought in Europe and became a Lieutenant Colonel before the war's end. He was badly hurt in a gas attack during the war, which he never fully recovered from. His Queensland representative cricket career began in 1920 when he made his first-class debut in a match against New South Wales. All but two of his first-class appearances were made against New South Wales, his other opponents were South Australia and the touring New Zealand national team. He made his highest score and only half century, an innings of 71, when Queensland took on New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground in the 1925/26 season. The innings helped Queensland to draw the match, after following on. Outside of sport he worked as a barrister and as well as practising in the Queensland Crown Law Office also had a private practice in his home town. He wrote a book, called 'A History of Queensland Cricket', which was released posthumously in 1946. Hutcheon's brother John was a more successful cricketer for Queensland and briefly served as the chairman of the Australian Cricket Board in the 1920s.

The active component is a zinc amalgam. It can be used to prepare solutions of ions, such as chromium(II), Cr2+, and uranium(III), U3+, which are immediately oxidized on contact with air. Preparation and use Amalgamated zinc is first prepared by treating zinc metal with a 2% solution of mercury(II) chloride, in a beaker. The metal may be in the granulated form or as shavings, wool, or 20-30 mesh powder. The mercury ions are able to penetrate the passive layer and are reduced to elemental mercury, forming the amalgam, which is a kind of alloy of both metals, on the metal surface. The amalgam is thoroughly washed by decantation and placed in a long glass tube, similar to a chromatography column, equipped with a stopcock and a means to support the amalgam, such as a sintered-glass disk. The outlet of the tube is connected to a collection flask by an air- tight seal and the collection flask is connected with a vacuum source. To use the reductor, the solution to be reduced is placed at the top of the tube, and then is drawn through it. If the column is loosely packed, the solution may pass through without assistance, but if the tube is tightly packed, the pressure in the collecting flask may need to be reduced. In effect this configuration is similar to that used for column chromatography as the extent of reduction increases to 100% as the solution passes down the tube and the product is completely separated from the starting material.  Applications  Amalgamated zinc is a powerful reducing agent, with a standard redox potential of ‚àí0.76 V. The amalgam does not have a passive layer so it is a more effective reducing agent than zinc metal. The Jones reductor is useful for preparing solutions of titanium(III), vanadium(II), chromium(II), molybdenum(III), niobium(III) and uranium(III). All these ions are extremely susceptible to oxidation. For example, the reductor can be used in the preparation of crystalline chromous acetate. This solid is moderately stable in air and is a good starting material for the preparation of other chromium(II) compounds.

Life and career Jerome Remick was born in Detroit, Michigan. He was the son of James Albert Remick and Mary Amelia Hosmer.Clarence Monroe Burton. Compendium of History and Biography of the City of Detroit and Wayne County, Michigan (Chicago: Henry Taylor & Co., 1909) pp.514-516 He graduated from the Detroit Business University in 1887, before joining the Whitney-Remick lumber firm, a family business started by his grandfather, Royal C. Remick. Jerome married Adelaide McCreery in Flint, Michigan on June 26, 1895. Remick's interests, however, did not lie in lumber, but in the developing popular sheet music industry, and in 1898 he bought out the small, struggling firm of Whitney-Warner Publishing Company in Detroit, whose small catalog included Smoky Topaz (comp. Grace M. Bolen) and waltzes by Henriette B. Blanke. He turned the company into an extraordinarily successful sheet music publishing house. Sheet music cover for \\"Oh, You Beautiful Doll\\" In 1902, Remick and Maurice Shapiro founded Shapiro-Remick & Company, selling several million copies in 1905 of the enormously successful \\"In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree\\", written by Harry Williams and Egbert van Alstyne. The partnership was dissolved in 1906, and Remick started his own firm Jerome H. Remick & Co. Van Alstyne continued with Remick and a string of hits followed including \\"Pretty Baby\\" and \\"Your Eyes have Told Me So.\\" Remick's published songs influenced popular music trends, and included hundreds of hits such as \\"Baby Face\\", \\"I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover,\\" \\"Oh, You Beautiful Doll\\" and \\"Bye Bye Blackbird,\\" all of which contributed greatly to American heritage and culture. In 1909, the company published three ballads that sold more than a million copies - \\"Put on Your Old Grey Bonnet\\", \\"Moonlight Bay\\" in 1912 and \\"When You Wore a Tulip\\" in 1914. The firm also published ragtime music such as \\"Dill Pickles Rag\\" and \\"Black and White Rag\\". George Gershwin joined Remick in 1914 and composed many songs, but left the firm shortly after they published \\"Rialto Ripples\\" in 1917. To stay competitive Remick began to sign up unknown writers such as Harry Warren, Al Dubin, Gus Kahn and Richard A. Whiting, ushering in the golden era of the Roaring Twenties music. Changes were in the air, though. The arrival of talking pictures obliged Warner Brothers to invest in publishing houses, leading to their acquisition of Remick's company in 1929, gaining Remick's catalogue and staff writers, including Harry Warren and Al Dubin who created hits such as \\"42nd Street\\" and \\"I Only Have Eyes For You.\\" While competing publishing houses were located in Michigan, New York City and Chicago, Jerome H. Remick & Co. held sway in Detroit, also running a successful printing plant from there. The firm maintained branch offices in New York City and Chicago, with agencies all over the world, and started hundreds of music outlets under the name \\"Remick Song Shops\\" throughout the United States. Oddly, Remick could not read music at all, but had a natural understanding of public tastes. Remick was an enthusiastic gentleman farmer, and owned a estate on Gratiot Avenue, growing fruit and vegetables, and raising chickens. His livestock included a herd of prize Holsteins, leading to a controlling interest in the Detroit Creamery Co. Sheet music cover for \\"Cleopatra Finnegan : an Afro-Celtic intermezzo\\" Remick was one of the influential patrons of the Detroit Symphony, repeatedly serving as the organization's president. His fundraising helped to create Orchestra Hall in 1919. His contributions also enabled the expansion of Detroit's orchestra to 90 players so as to persuade Ossip Gabrilowitsch, Mark Twain's son-in-law, to become the Detroit Symphony's conductor. Remick also served as director on the boards of the pharmaceutical firm, Parke-Davis & Co, the Paige Motor Co, the Detroit Savings Bank, and the Union Trust Co. He also acted as secretary of the Whitney Land Co., which operated in Oregon and he had an interest in the Detroit Free Press. He was president of the Big Four Gold and Copper Mining Co. in Colorado, owning claims covering north of the Little Jonnie Mine in the Leadville district. In 1928, because of ill health, Remick sold the company to his Vice-President, Jerome Keit. The new firm was called The Remick Corporation, and was finally taken over by Warner Bros. Music. Remick was survived by his wife, his children, and several grandchildren. Remkick died on July 15, 1931, at the age of 63, and is buried along with his wife in Elmwood Cemetery in Detroit, Michigan.

Life He was born at Dudley, Worcestershire, on 26 February 1791. In 1808 he came under the influence of James Hews Bransby, who prepared him for entrance (September 1810) at Manchester College, then at York, under Charles Wellbeloved and John Kenrick. One of his fellow students was Jacob Brettell. Leaving York in 1815, he became minister at Elder Yard, Chesterfield. While here he conducted a private school for sixteen years. He wrote in the Monthly Repository and the Christian Reformer on biblical and patristic topics. His review (1834) of John Henry Newman's Arians of the Fourth Century brought him into correspondence with Thomas Turton. In 1840 Manchester College was moved from York to Manchester, and Wallace was appointed to succeed Wellbeloved. He delivered in October his inaugural lecture as professor of critical and exegetical theology. In 1842 he was made principal of the theological department. His theological position was conservative, but he was the first in his denomination to bring to his classroom the processes and results of German critical research. Among his pupils was Philip Pearsall Carpenter. After six years he resigned, and in June 1846 became minister of Trim Street Chapel, Bath. He was made visitor of his college, and became a fellow of the Geological Society. He preached for the last time on 10 March 1850, and died at Bath on 13 May. He was buried in the graveyard at Lyncomb, near Bath. The Antitrinitarian Biography His Antitrinitarian Biography, (1850, 3 vols.) was the result of nearly 24 years' research. In breadth of treatment and in depth of original research Wallace's work is inferior to that of Thomas Rees (1777‚Äì1864), but he deploys a careful array of authorities. He covers more ground than previous writers giving lives and biographies, continental and English, extending from the Protestant Reformation to the early eighteenth century. His introduction deals mainly with the development of opinion in England over that period. A major source was the Bibliotheca antitrinitariorum of Christopher Sandius. Family He was the son of Robert Wallace (d. 17 June 1830) by his wife Phoebe (d.11 March 1837), His father was a pawnbroker; his grandfather was a Dumfriesshire farmer. Two younger brothers joined the Unitarian ministry, viz.: James Cowden Wallace (1793?-1841), Unitarian minister at Totnes (1824-6), York Street, London (1827-8), Brighton (1828-9), Preston (1829‚Äì31), Wareham (1831‚Äì41), who wrote numerous hymns, sixty-four of which are in J. R. Beard's Collection of Hymns, 1837, 12mo; and Charles Wallace (1796‚Äì1859), who was educated at Glasgow (M.A. 1817) and Manchester College, York (1817‚Äì19), and was minister at Altrincham and Hale, Cheshire (1829‚Äì56). He married (1825) Sophia (d. 31 May 1835), daughter of Michael Lakin of Birmingham, by whom he had a daughter, who survived him.

He reached Calcutta on 30 October 1821 and worked in a number of positions including a District Collector and Officiating Judge in Meerut, Bareilly and other parts of northern India. During his stay in India he collected specimens of numerous land snails some of which he sent to Hugh Cuming in England. On the return from a trip to Mauritius he brought a couple of living Achatina fulica which he gave to a friend in Calcutta in April 1847 who subsequently released them in a garden at Chowringhee. The species is today a pest in many parts of India. His son-in-law Major Richard Sankey was executor of his estate and the collections that he bequeathed went to Sylvanus Hanley, who removed the locality labels of all the specimens thus decreasing their value.

His family moved frequently while he was a child and he spent periods living in New York, Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin before settling near Olivia, Minnesota. In 1880, Dowling suffered extreme frostbite when he was stranded outside during a blizzard. He lost parts of both legs, his left arm, and fingers on his right hand. For several years after he was a ward of the state. In 1883, he made a deal with the county where he agreed to live independently if they paid for artificial limbs for his missing legs and arm. He attended Carleton College for a year and later worked as a school principal in Granite Falls, Minnesota and Renville, Minnesota. He was later involved in the newspaper business, insurance, and real estate in Olivia. He also became active in local Republican politics, serving as village recorder and mayor of Olivia as well as justice of the peace for Renville County, Minnesota. Dowling served as an assistant clerk in the Minnesota State House of Representatives from 1892 to 1894 and as chief clerk from 1895 to 1898. He was elected to one term as a representative, serving from 1901 to 1903. He also served as speaker of the house during that term.

From that year on, the stories were written by Languereau. In 1991, the company was acquired by Hachette.

It is geographically within the Syrmia and Podunavlje region. The village is located immediately southeast of Vinkovci separated from the rest of the town by Vinkovci-Gunja railway. At the time of 2011 Census, the local population was 3,283. Mirkovci is a multiethnic settlement with Croat majority and Serb minority. Up until the end of the Croatian War of Independence Serbs were the majority population. Name The name of the village in Croatian or Serbian is in the plural, and therefore it is grammatically correct to refer to it as \\"Mirkovci are\\" instead of \\"Mirkovci is\\". A hypothetical singular version of the name would be Mirkovac. History The area in which the village is located has been continually inhabited since the Neolithic period. During the Roman Empire Colonia Aurelia Cibalae was established in the region during the reign of Hadrian and gained the status of urban settlement during the reign of Caracalla. Emperors Valentinian I and Valens were born in Cibalae. Fragment of Italian fresco showing soldiers of Austria-Hungary From 1526 to 1687 Syrmia was part of the Ottoman Empire within the Budin Eyalet. At the end of this period the Great Migrations of the Serbs occurred resulting in Serb settlement in the region which was at the time part of Habsburg Monarchy. Mirkovci was established in 18th century within the Slavonian Military Frontier, which acted as the cordon sanitaire against incursions from the Ottoman Empire in which Serb colonists were defending the Monarchy in return for land-grants and internal self-administration granted in Statuta Valachorum. Soldiers from Mirkovci fought in Austro-Turkish War (1788‚Äì1791), Napoleonic Wars, various battlefields during the Revolutions of 1848 under the command of Josip Jelaƒçiƒá and Joseph Radetzky von Radetz, the Second Italian War of Independence and the Third Italian War of Independence. Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Nicholas was constructed in period between 1804 and 1813. The village remained a part of the Slavonian Military Frontier until 1881 when the former was disestablished. Between 1881 and the end of Austro- Hungarian rule the village was part of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia and its Syrmia County. =World War II= During the Second World War, 107 ethnic Serbs were transferred and killed in the Jasenovac concentration camp operated by the Croatian fascist Ustashe regime. At that time Serbs living under the rule of Independent State of Croatia were exposed to persecution of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia. There are today 5 memorial plaques in Serbian Cyrillic alphabet commemorating Yugoslav Partisans and victims of Fascism which were set on the local community hall in 1958 during the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia time. =Croatian War of Independence= During the Croatian War of Independence, Mirkovci was under the control of Serb rebel forces. It was a part of the self-proclaimed SAO Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia (1991‚Äì1992), Republic of Serbian Krajina (1992-1995) and United Nations protectorate of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia (1995-1998). In his book Warrior's Honour: Ethnic War and the Modern Conscience, Canadian author Michael Ignatieff writes; * Theorists like Samuel Huntington, would lead me to believe that there is a fault line running through the back gardens of Mirkovci [a village in eastern Croatia], with the Croats in the bunker representing the civilization of the Catholic Roman West and the Serbs nearby representing Byzantium, Orthodoxy, and the Cyrillic East. ... here in Mirkovci, I don't see civilizational fault lines, geological templates that have split apart. These metaphors take for granted what needs to be explained: how neighbors once ignorant of very idea that they belong to opposed civilizations begin to think-and hate-in these terms, how they vilify and demonize people they once called friends... Michael Ignatieff, Warrior's Honour: Ethnic War and the Modern Conscience (New York: Henry Holt, 1997), p. 36 During the war, Mirkovci was the seat of the Municipality of Mirkovci which covered areas of pre-war Vinkovci Municipality within the Republic of Serbian Krajina. The village was one of the main centers of Serb rebellion in Eastern Croatia. =UNTAES peacekeeping mission= Between 1996 and 1998 Mirkovci was under the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium administration. =Transitional Municipality of Mirkovci= The UNTAES mission made an executive decision to create the so-called Transitional Municipality of Mirkovci at the time of transition of the region to the control of the Croatian Government. In January 1997 Transitional Administrator Jacques Paul Klein established new municipalities of Trpinja, Negoslavci, Marku≈°ica, ≈†odolovci and Jagodnjak with Serb majority which are today part of the Joint Council of Municipalities. In Mirkovci and Tenja a suburb of Osijek, the economic and cultural centre of Slavonia, were declared so called transitional municipalities with Serb ethnic majority which were to become part of Vinkovci and Osijek respectively after an additional transitional period of one year. The new Transitional Municipality of Mirkovci covered the village of Mirkovci exclusively and not as in Krajina the entire area of pre-war Municipality of Vinkovci which were under the Serb rebel control. =Contemporary period= The period after the reintegration is marked by population increase, uncommon for the rest of the region, and the changing demographic composition of the village. A number of ethnic Croat refugees from Bosnia were settled in the village, while a significant number of Serbs decided to emigrate to Serbia or third countries in Europe and elsewhere. Today Croats constitute an absolute majority in the village with significant Serb minority. In 2010 the construction of the Roman Catholic church of Aloysius Stepinac was completed after 10 years of works making it the first Roman Catholic church in Mirkovci. Main Street in Mirkovci ‚Äì up to 2010 Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá Street, subsequently Vukovar Street One of the political issues of local significance was the naming of streets in the village. Elected leaders of new Croat ethnic majority community wanted to change street names in the village which were named during the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and remained unchanged until the end of UNTAES mandate. At that time streets in Mirkovci were named after Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá, Bo≈°ko Buha, Veljko Vlahoviƒá, Edvard Kardelj, People's Liberation Army of Macedonia, 4 July-Fighter's Day and 29 November-Republic Day. Majority needed for the change was achieved in August 2010 when the new names after Vukovar and other cities and rivers in Croatia were proposed to the City Council of Vinkovci. Special 4 members commission was formed with 2 ethnic Croats and 2 Serbs tasked with creation of proposal for 42 new street names acceptable to both communities. Geography Mirkovci are bordering village between regions of Slavonia and Syrmia. Its elevation is 95 meters above the sea level. The village lies in a flatland north to the Bosut river. EducationElementary School \\"Nikola Tesla\\"= Elementary School in Mirkovci was established in 1759 making it one of the oldest elementary schools in the region. In 1877 it moved to its current location with expansions and renovations taking place in 1900, 1959, 1969, 1992 and 2006. In 2006 the school took the name of Nikola Tesla marking 150th anniversary of scientist's birth. In period between 1967 and 1997 school was known under the name Elementary School Simo Lonƒçar. After the end of reintegration process relevant Croatian authorities decided to register school under the name Elementary School Mirkovci which it kept until 2006. Education is conducted in two groups, either in Croatian or Serbian language. In school year 2009‚Äì10 233 pupils attended the school.

Due to their common availability at five and dime stores, collectors often refer to Barclay's toy soldiers as \\"Dimestore soldiers\\". History Barclay Manufacturing was formed by Leon Donze and Michael Levy in about 1922 (O'Brien 1997, 62). The name of the company came from Barclay Street in Hoboken, New Jersey. During the 1930s, the company was later based in North Bergen, New Jersey. In its heyday Barclay produced 500,000 toys a week, making them the largest toy soldier manufacturer at that time in the United States (Young and Young 2007, 550). In 1939 Barclay acquired another toy soldier company, Tommy Toy and its art deco sculptor Olive Kooken (Fendelman and Rosson 2009; O'Brien 2011). Soldier's uniforms followed military fashion of the times, replacing closed standing collars with open ones with shirt and tie. Wrap around puttees were replaced by canvas leggings. Prior to the company's temporary closing in 1942 the foot soldiers were purchased individually for a nickel. Barclay lead toy soldiers and figures, including motorcycle, canons and mortars. Some of Barclay's first vehicles were slush cast white metal made in the 1930s. Some of the most interesting models were in art deco style. One intriguing selection was a \\"Coast to Coast\\" art deco style bus ‚Äì another a two tone oil tanker with pontoon fenders ‚Äì on both models, fenders were different colors from the bodies. One available set had a cartoon-like strip on the box lid that stated it was a \\"Build and Paint Your Own Auto Set\\" which was \\"Loads of fun\\". The set included a four-door sedan, a two-door, and a tanker truck. It included paint and the cars had white rubber wheels. Also about this time, and into the 1940s, the company made a variety of military vehicles ‚Äì tanks, trucks with cannon and other cars painted brown. Post World War IISoldiers= After World War II, Barclay's headquarters were relocated to Union City, New Jersey. Despite the inroads of plastic toy soldiers, Barclay kept manufacturing theirs in metal. Following the war, Barclay changed the helmets on their soldiers to the M1 Helmet. In about 1951 Barclay conserved metal by eliminating bases on their soldiers, which collectors nicknamed podfoot soldiers because each foot appeared as a flattened rounded blob (Johnson 1982, 104‚Äì106). These were painted similar to figures in American comic books of the time ‚Äì olive drab uniforms with green helmets with \\"enemy\\" soldiers in red uniforms with white helmets. With the rising cost of metal, the soldiers had risen in price to 15 cents. Though cruder than European offerings, such as Britains, Barclays soldiers had a verve and energy that was popular with American youth. Cast figures on motorcycles with generalized, but non-moving rings for wheels, exuded speed and were simple but very effective toys (Johnson 1982, 103). In 1960, the lead soldiers were generally removed from Woolworths and other dimestores and more commonly found for sale in hobby shops. From 1964 the soldiers' uniforms were painted in green to reflect the modern US Army. =The ones with pinched axles= In the 1950s and 1960s, Barclay's diecast metal vehicles continued in popularity. Common sizes were vehicles just over 1 inch long, but others were 3 to 4 inches. A variety of cars were produced like a tiny VW Beetle and some sports and racing cars, often with tiny metal drivers. Some generic trucks appeared as well. One clever compact set was a car carrier with folding ramp and four cars. Another was a tall-nosed GM Motorama-style pickup carrying nine wooden 'beer' barrels. This same truck also appeared in a white 'milk and ice cream' version. Barclay 'Bottle Series' VW Bug from the early to mid-1960s. The entire package was not more than four inches tall. Barclay cars are recognizable for their simple single cast bodies, somewhat like miniature Tootsietoys, though distinct from that company, some Barclay models had drivers separately cast in metal and painted then put in proper position in the vehicles. The vehicles were adorned with neither windows nor interiors. Notable were the vehicles' pinched flat axles that protruded rather boldly from the wheels (something that safety standards would likely not allow today). Cars were painted a variety of colors ‚Äì especially bright blues, reds, and oranges. One line produced around 1960 was the 'Bottle Series' Metal Miniatures. Barclay's tiny vehicles were placed in a small blister card covered with clear plastic in the form of a bottle. On one side of the package, a skyscraper was illustrated ‚Äì on the other side, a country lane. The entire package was only slightly smaller than 4 x 2.75 inches. There was no decoration or writing on the cardboard back of the package. At the bottom of the package was boldly written 'All American', each letter in a square each alternating red and blue (and somewhat reminiscent of wooden letter blocks lined up). Perhaps this slogan emphasized that these toys were not made in England (like Matchbox or Budgie) or any other country. The bottle series were priced at 19 cents. Turbulent times The 1960s would prove to be a turbulent time for the \\"old line\\" toy manufacturers. Before the decade was out, the A.C. Gilbert Company and Lionel, both legends in the toy world, would be gone. Marx was severely crippled. Barclay ceased trading in 1971 due to an inability to compete with plastics and the rapidly changing market (e.g. Mattel Hot Wheels), not because of issues regarding lead, which has been a popular misconception (Fendelman and Rosson 2009). Legacy The old firm's trademark rights were re-acquired in the 1990s, and now The Barclay Company once again manufactures solid metal reproductions of Barclay and Manoil Manufacturing Co. figures.

Life He was the son of Friedrich Zwicker, Lutheran minister of the Church of St. Bartholomew at Danzig. He was educated for the medical profession at the University of K√∂nigsberg which he entered in 1629, and where he graduated with a Doctor's degree. Florian Crusius first influenced him in the direction of Unitarian theology.Robert Wallace, Antitrinitarian Biography (1850), article 311. He met with considerable opposition, beginning with his brother Friedrich who had succeeded his father as minister. He left Danzig for Poland. Meeting some Hutterite missionaries from Slovakia, around 1650, he spent time at Bruderhofs in the community of Andreas Ehrenpreis; but returned to Danzig. He returned to Strassin, where he lived for a while. From 1657 he moved to the Netherlands, and died in Amsterdam.The New Schaff-Herzog Works His main theological interest lay in patristics. His Irenicum Irenicorum (1658) attempted to reconstruct Christian theology before the Nicene Creed.Arthur Middleton, Fathers and Anglicans: The Limits of Orthodoxy (2001), p. 245. Zwicker proposed that Christ's divinity, the pre-existence of Christ, and the incarnation were inventions of early heretics. It was attacked in detail by George Bull. Bull's biographer Robert Nelson considered him an influential Unitarian, writing: He was criticized by Samuel Przypkowski, and fell into controversy with Jan Amos Komensk√Ω (Comenius).

Early life and career He was born in Manado, Sulawesi (then known as Celebes), Dutch East Indies, on 9 March 1911 to Lie Kae Tae and Oei Tjeng Nie Nio. He started his navy career as a ship-navigator on a Dutch merchant vessel, He joined the Kesatuan Rakyat Indonesia Sulawesi (KRIS), a local militia group in Celebes during the Indonesian War of Independence The marine division of this group became later a part of the Indonesian Navy. Initially, he was stationed in the naval harbour of Cilacap, Java. Within a few months, he managed to clear this harbour from mines, placed by the Imperial Japanese Navy against an eventual Allied naval invasion. For his services, he was promoted to \\"mayor laut\\" (lieutenant commander). Life as a smuggler In 1947, he was assigned the duty of escorting boats smuggling products to Singapore to be sold for financing the Indonesian independence war. One of his first duties was to escort a convoy of small boats that was carrying 800 tons of rubber to the Chief Representative of the Republic of Indonesia in Singapore, Utoyo Ramelan. During these revolutionary years the Dutch government imposed a naval blockade around Singapore to stop illegal activities by Indonesians. Commander John Lie's duties were to penetrate this blockade and smuggle rubber and other products in exchange for weapons. The weapons were then handed over to the Indonesian revolutionary troops in Sumatra and among others also to the Regent of Riau, an Indonesian ruler during the Dutch colonial time. Their efforts were not always easy. The boats used for the smuggling were small coastal transport boats (sampan) and not designed for the high seas. Their group had to avoid the better equipped Dutch patrol boats and also the ocean waves. John Lie used for his operations a speedboat named the Outlaw. Once while he was smuggling 18 drums of palm oil, he was captured by British customs. In the Singapore court, however, he was found not guilty and released as he had not violated any British laws. During another incident, while transporting semi- automatic weapons from Johor to Sumatra, he was stopped by a Dutch patrol boat. John Lie informed them that his ship was stranded and couldn't move. Two gunners, probably from the Moluccas, were already aiming their weapons at the Outlaw, but the patrol boat commander didn't issue the shoot command. They just left the Outlaw in the middle of the sea without helping or investigating. After this incident and after handing over the weapons to the Regent Usman Effendi and battalion commander Abusamah, the crew received an official letter from the revolutionary government of Indonesia stating that Outlaw was now part of the Indonesian naval fleet and was designated the official navy-name PPB 58 LB. A week later, John Lie returns to Port Swettenham in Malaya to establish a naval base. This base was used to supply the struggling revolutionary government troops with fuel, gasoline, food, weapons, and other needs to maintain the independence of Indonesia. Later life, death, and legacy In early 1950, while in Bangkok, he was called for duty to Surabaya by the Indonesian Navy Chief of Staff Admiral Subiyakto and assigned the command of a corvette, R.I. Rajawali. In the following period he commanded his crew in the fight against the Republic of the South Moluccas (RMS) Maluku and Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PRRI) rebellions. He retired from the navy on December 1966 with the rank of rear admiral. In 1967 he changed his name from John Lie to Jahja Daniel Dharma. He died after a stroke on 27 August 1988 and was buried in the national heroes cemetery, Kalibata Jakarta. For his services and contributions to the country, he was posthumously awarded with the Bintang Mahaputera Utama by President Suharto on 10 November 1995. Corvette KRI John Lie (358) of the Indonesian Navy On 10 November 2009 (Indonesia Heroes' Day), for his services to the country before and after independence, Jahja Daniel Dharma was posthumously awarded the Bintang Mahaputra Adipradana and named an Indonesia National Hero by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on behalf of the nation. A corvette of the Indonesian Navy has been named after him by the Indonesian Government as part of TNI AL in 2014 along with KRI Bung Tomo and KRI Usman Harun.

The Poisoning at Hanoi Citadel (Vietnamese:H√† Th√†nh ƒë·∫ßu ƒë·ªôc) was a poisoning plot which occurred in 1908 when a group of Vietnamese indigenous tirailleurs attempted to poison the entire French colonial army's garrison in the Citadel of Hanoi. The aim of the plot was to neutralize the French garrison and make way for Hoang Hoa Tham's rebel army to capture Hanoi. The plot was disclosed, and then was suppressed by the French. Background and poisoning Captured plotters. In early 1908, Hoang Hoa Tham collaborated with Vietnamese nationalists, including Phan Boi Chau, in organizing a plot to seize Hanoi from the French. Vietnamese cooks were to neutralize the French garrison in Hanoi by poisoning their dinner foods; at the same time, Vietnamese soldiers (Grade Indochinois) would attack and prevent French troops at Don Thuy, Son Tay, and Bac Ninh from coming to the aid of the Citadel of Hanoi; and Hoang Hoa Tham would wait outside the citadel and launch an attack on Gia Lam when the signal arrived from the inside. The plan was executed on the evening of 27 June 1908, when the group of Vietnamese cooks managed to mix datura poison with food they had prepared for a party. The poison immediately knocked out nearly 200 French troops but did not kill them.Chapuis, p. 90 Moreover, one of the cooks had felt guilty and had gone to a church for confession, the French priest then reporting this to government officials;Marr, p. 193 the French general-in-charge in Hanoi immediately proclaimed martial law and ordered the arrest of plot leaders and plotters. Outside the citadel, Hoang Hoa Tham did not receive the signal he was expecting, realized the plot had failed and withdrew all his troops. Aftermath Heads of executed plotters displayed in public In quick response to the plot, the French executed by guillotine 13 plotters. On 8 July 1908, another 24 death sentences were announced and the remaining rebels were sentenced to life or exiled. Severely repressive actions were launched against the Vietnamese activists, and hundreds of them, including Phan Ch√¢u Trinh, were sent to Con Dao prison.Largo, p. 111 The French also accused Phan Boi Chau of the plot, forcing him to flee to Japan;Schulzinger, p. 7 this abortive plot later became one of many incidents that eventually landed Chau in French prison in 1914.Bradley & Gaddis, p. 15 On the other hand, the French began hunting Hoang Hoa Tham.

Downstream of the Chulabhorn Dam, along the Choen River, lie three districts: Kaset Sombun District, Ban Thaen District, and Phu Khieo District.

The species, which is endemic to the south-west of Western Australia, grows to between 15 and 60 cm (6 in‚Äì2 ft) high, with its blue to purple flowers appearing between July and December. It adapts readily to cultivation, particularly containers such as hanging baskets. Taxonomy The prolific botanist Robert Brown described Dampiera linearis in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. Its species name is the Latin adjective linearis \\"linear\\". He described a D cuneata at the same time, which has been synonymised with D. linearis. Plants sold commercially were mislabeled as D. cuneata for many years. Dutch botanist Willem Hendrik de Vriese described two further plants‚ÄîD. azurea and D. eriophora‚Äîfrom the Swan River and Perth environs in the 1845 work Plantae Preissianae, which are also now considered D. linearis. Description An erect shrub, Dampiera linearis grows to between 15 and 60 cm (6 in‚Äì2 ft) in height, with a suckering habit. New growth is hairy and becomes smooth with maturity. The leaves are obovate to elliptical and can be entire or lobed, measuring 1‚Äì4 cm long by 1‚Äì10 mm wide. It produces flowers between July and December in its native range. These are 1.5‚Äì2 cm wide, and light blue to purple with a yellow or white centre. The outer- or undersurface of the flowers is covered with fine hair. The flowers arise in groups of 1 to 3 from a peduncle that is also covered in hair. Distribution and habitat Dampiera linearis is found across the southwest corner of Western Australia from Geraldton in the north to Esperance in the south east. It grows on sand- or clay-based soils over laterite, on ridges, or flat areas. Ecology Plants of Dampiera linearis can survive bushfire and resprout and put on new growth quickly. Fieldwork on the Swan Coastal Plain indicated it was probably resistant to Phytophthora cinnamomi. Cultivation Some forms of Dampiera linearis are cultivated and sold for their colourful flowers, while others have attractive grey foliage. In cultivation, the species prefers a well- drained situation in full sun or light shade. It tolerates some dryness and moderate frost. It does not tolerate waterlogged soils. It makes an attractive plant for hanging baskets. Dampiera linearis is readily propagated by cuttings; trials at Kings Park indicate that semi-hardened material is best and the average time to strike is 48 days.

The town is located in Kyanzavi Division, Machakos County. The peak, height , \\"the Living Africa: National Parks ‚Äì Kenya ‚Äì Ol Donyo Sabuk\\", ThinkQuest.org, 1998, webpage: [http://library.thinkquest.org/16645/national_parks/ke_dsnp.shtml Tquest-645]: 2145m & National Park. was named by Maasai pastoralists, meaning big mountain. The Kamba name, Kyanzavi means the mountain of nzavi or Lablab beans (Lablab purpureus). Kilimambogo, (another name of the mountain) has two parts, Kilima - meaning a hill or mountain in Swahili, and mbogo meaning a buffalo in many Bantu languages. Incidentally, the forested part of the mountain has a large population of buffaloes. Buffalo is called Nyati in Swahili.Rough Guide to Kenya, by Richard Trillo, Okigbo Ojukwu, Daniel Jacobs, Doug Paterson. 7th Edition, 2002. Rough Guides. The town stands at the edge of Machakos County. Lord William Northrup McMillan was the first white man to settle here, and everything else that has happened since is largely attributed to him (see below: Lord William Northrop McMillan). The town is quite dusty, due to deforestation and loose ground cover, compounded by occasional rainfall. However, the area is adorned with much untamed beauty. The town is located about east-southeast of Thika, along the Thika-Garissa road (A3 road). Driving on Garissa Road from Thika town, there are pineapple plantations on both sides, accentuated by little pockets of blooming eucalyptus. About east of Thika, there is a junction going south, with Kenya Wildlife Service markings. It will be a drive from here to the famous Fourteen Falls, described as one of Kenya's most spectacular landmarks. By the river is St. Johns Kilimambogo Teachers College, and Immaculate Heart of Mary Mission hospital. Donyo Sabuk town is a kilometre (half-mile) away from Fourteen Falls, just across the Athi River, with a junction leading to the game park, and the other to the great house of Donyo Sabuk. Down past the mountain base sits Donyo Sabuk town, a town that has retained many things that Lord Macmillan bequeathed the area. Here, partying goes on well into the night, and there are a number of \\"boys‚Äô bands\\", where the box guitar is still in vogue. This musical town is the hometown of the late Kamba musician Kakai Kilonzo, late legendary Sila of Kilunda fame, and the still-active G√§'thika boys band. Near the peak is the grave of Lord Macmillan, his wife and their dog. Also, there is an extra grave of one Louise, who started working for the Macmillan's when she was age 13 until her death. In what was once one of the biggest ranches in Kenya, there are five towns inside the former Juja Ranch. The rural area is a multi-ethnic community in farms owned by people who were former squatters and his farm labourers. The mountain peak is inside a game park, and the rest is partially owned by the Kenyatta family. Sir William Northrup McMillan William Northrup McMillan was an American multimillionaire and philanthropist who owned substantial farms in British East Africa. In 1905 he acquired a 99 year lease on north of the city which eventually became Juja Farm. In 1905 he constructed the five bedroom Juja House on the property. The main house was followed by a three bedroom manager's bungalow, a two bedroom bungalow called \\"Lucie's bolthole,\\" and three other bungalows housing the post and telegraph office, and rooms for chauffeurs and gardeners. The homes were fitted with electricity and running water, and a sewage system. In later years, Juja Farm would become a popular location for film crews. Ol Donyo Sabuk National Park The name of this park established in 1967, Ol Donyo Sabuk, means large mountain in Maasai. It is situated north of Nairobi and has an excellent and clear view of Nairobi and other lowland areas. Wildlife species that can be spotted here include buffalo, colobus monkeys, baboons, bushbuck, impala, duiker, and abundant birdlife. Ol Donyo Sabuk National Park is a common one- day trip out of Nairobi, only away. The mountain is the highest peak in the park, covering . It is particularly attractive for hikers or families wanting some freedom and exercise, outside their vehicles. One approach to the park is via the Fourteen Falls on the Athi River. The park's attraction is its beauty and views of both Mount Kenya and Mount Kilimanjaro. It teems with game including baboon, colobus, bushbuck, impala, duiker and many birds. While the name \\"Ol Donyo Sabuk\\" is Maasai for 'large mountain', the word Sabuk was mistakenly thought by many writers to mean \\"buffalo\\" whereas in fact Maasai call buffalo Olosowan. Today, some 250 buffalos roam the slopes. Kikuyu traditionalists also call the mountain by Kea-Njahe, known as the 'Mountain of the Big Rain', one of Ngai's lesser homes. The solitary mountain rises to from an otherwise flat area. The steep ascent requires a 4WD (4√ó4) vehicle. Near the summit lie the graves of Sir William Northrup McMillan (1872‚Äì1925) and his wife Lady Lucie. Tom Mboya It was here in 1930, that one of Kenya's most colourful politicians, Tom Mboya, was born and brought up, when his father worked in then sisal farm as a labourer. Though the setting is not in a valley, this circuit comprised a prime chip of the famed Happy Valley set. Tom Mboya attended Kilimambogo Primary School, a Catholic Missionary Sponsored institution, within the larger St. Johns Kilimambogo Teachers College. Kilimambogo Region This is a Nairobi metropolitan region, ranging from Kwa Mwaura and Munyu Mweu area, in Matungulu North Ward Machakos County to Gatuanyaga near Thika Town Kiambu County and back through Juja Farm to Koma. Areas within the region have local names, Kyanzavi being the popular name for the Ukamba region. The area is full of culture, with almost all Kenyan tribes and cultures represented. Wanjiku kahore (Maendeleo) It was in 1960, when she arrived in the ranch, from Kinyui. She had bundled up her few possessions, which included a then-coveted linen business, making a hallmark grand entry, and influencing what would turn Ol-Donyo into a famous trading centre. Given its existing large labour population, she saw enormous business opportunity that had characterised the town until the end of the 70s. Locals honoured her by naming the adjacent trading centre after her. But after the fall of Muka Mukuu farmer's cooperative, the area was dismayed. The Ol-Donyo Sabuk status is a direct portrayal of the locals' state of financial affairs.wanjiku was the owner of Masaku trust land including Tala, Kangundo, Kawethei, Kakuyuni and many others. It was confirmed in succession cause No: 332 of 2008 in the high court of kenya,in the same kenya Gazette notice No: 1705 of 2007.She was also a prominent businesswoman in the world. The McMillan Castle Front view of the Macmillan Castle Further east of Ol-Donyo, the building that was McMillan's home, a fort by any definition, sits in splendour. More than three- quarters of the house is under key and lock. A part of it houses the Muka Mukuu Farmer's Co-operative Society, Ltd. a farmer's cooperative. The land around the home is currently used for the production of pineapples. Covering a ground enough for three basketball pitches, the villagers have spent more than a century wondering why a couple that had no children put up such a huge dwelling place. So large is the building that Lord Macmillan and his wife would spend one year in one wing of the house, then migrate to the other in the second half of the year. The locals are yet to figure out how they can benefit from such an obvious tourist attraction site. Club House (Kilavu)Club House The early notorieties of the ranch captured the imagination of many people during the First World War, when the castle served as a military hospital for British officers. The wild parties held in the castle, where the notorious colonial maverick Colonel Ewart Grogan reputedly led the wine- tossing and supervised wife-sharing orgies, only spiced the sideshows that attracted international media. Hence the castle was baptised \\"Kilavu\\" by the locals, meaning Club house in Kamba. Fourteen Falls The Fourteen Falls The Fourteen Falls area is protected and equipped with a picnic site. It has historical and religious importance both to the residents and Asian immigrants. The Asians use the site for recreation and spiritual rites, disposing of cremated ash in the river in the belief that it will go all the way to India through the Indian Ocean, hence acting as a shrine. Others come for recreation, retaining the Happy Valley theme that was first introduced by Lord McMillan. Like Lord McMillan, the adjacent community, some of whom are descendants of the people the adventurer brought here, still farm the land. Fourteen Falls is located just a little bit away from Thika town.The Standard Online: Great house near 14 falls, by Peter Thatiah. Accessed 27 February 2009.

In addition to commanding SAAF squadrons and wings, he also commanded RAF bomber groups. At the age of 32, he was the youngest Major-General in the Allied forces. He resigned from the SAAF as a result of the de-anglicisation policy instituted by the National Party after they took power after the 1948 general election. Early life James Thom Durrant was born in Johannesburg and educated at St John's College. Military career He joined the South African Air Force Reserve at the age of 19. In 193334, he successfully completed a Permanent Force Cadet Course whereafter he served in the South African Air Force and qualified as a pilot. He passed a special course at the RAF Photographic School at RAF Farnborough, the school which TE Lawrence had attended in 1922. He returned to the Union where he did aerial survey work. He was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in November 1934. He held several posts between this period and the outbreak of war and proved himself to be a most capable Flying Instructor. In 1936, he was promoted Lieutenant and in 1937 Flight Commander. In 1938, he was promoted Captain and posted to Waterkloof Air Station. With the outbreak of World War II he was appointed Officer Commanding, Photo Flight with the rank of Major and later Officer Commanding of No. 40 Squadron SAAF which he commanded in East Africa from May 1940September 1941 when he was promoted Lieutenant- Colonel and appointed Officer Commanding 24 Squadron SAAF.

Warsaw uprising At 17h00 in Warsaw on 1 August 1944, General Bor-Komorowski ordered the Home Army to rise against the Germans. The element of surprise aided the AK who after 5 days had captured 70% of Warsaw. Because the promised Russian intervention never materialised, the well armed Germans received reinforcements and gradually stemmed and turned the tide. Food and ammunition ran low but not so much as a reply to the Poles' call for help was received by the AK. Furthermore, Stalin flatly refused landing permission to UK based planes behind Russian lines. Warsaw is about from the UK on the great circle course, but in order to avoid the defences of the Reich a detour would be near to 1100, and a return journey of was out of the question. Churchill then ordered that relief be flown to Warsaw from Italy which is a little closer, some on the great circle thus requiring a return journey of almost . This would have led right over heavily defended points but was the most realistic compromise. Major-General Durrant went to see Air Vice Marshal John Slessor and was surprised to be admitted to the presence of Churchill himself in an adjoining office. He pointed out to Churchill that an airlift of , most of it over enemy territory, could hold no hope of military success, and that the loss of airmen and aircraft would be tremendous. Churchill's reply was brief and to the point: And so Durrant and his volunteer aircrews, accepting all the known risks, made 196 trips to Warsaw, which included 11 hours over the Carparthian Mountains, and then flying at rooftop height to drop canisters packed with guns, ammunition and food. Of the 80 aircraft that participated, 31 were shot down, 17 of which over the weekend of 13‚Äì16 August. Resignation He resigned from the South African Air Force on 29 February 1952 citing \\"irreconcilable differences with the Minister of Defence\\". He stated that, despite Ministerial assurances that there were no politics in the UDF, a senior officer on his own staff had said to the Chief of the General Staff (at that time Lt-Genl Christiaan du Toit) in his presence: \\"I want you to understand that I am 100 percent Nationalist, and that anything I am reputed to have said or done has been in the interests of my Minister.\\" When Brigadier Durrant had objected to this statement, the Chief of the General Staff ruled that such a declaration of politics could be made if so desired. Honours and awards It was for his participation in the Abyssinian campaign that he gained the DFC.RAF and RNAS newspaper Flight Service Aviation dated 7 August 1941 He was created a Companion of the Order of the Bath, CB.

The most commonly used regions are those created by the state government for the purposes of economic development. Others regions include those made for land management, such as agriculture or conservation, and for the gathering of information, such as statistical or meteorological. Although most regional systems were defined for specific purposes and given specific boundaries, many regions have similar names and extents according to the different regionalisations. As a result, the names and boundaries of regions can vary and overlap even in popular usage.

History An Old Prussian castle named Beselede, property of the Natangian nobleman Posdraupote, was first mentioned in a chronicle of the Teutonic Order in 1274, when the castle had been besieged by Sudovians. The village was mentioned as an Old Prussian settlement in 1338 and in 1400 as the property of Philipp von Beisleiden with a size of 20 \\"Hufen\\", a square measure of the Teutonic Knights. Throughout the Polish-Teutonic Hunger War of 1414 the settlement was destroyed by Polish troops, who killed 3 men and caused a damage of 300 Mark. Philipp von Beisleiden was a supporter of the Prussian Confederation, who opposed the rule of the Teutonic Knights. In 1484 the von Pr√∂mock family, a noble family of Old Prussian origin, was mentioned as owner of the village, which lasted until 1671. After a time of constantly changing landlords Beisleiden was bought by Ludwig von Oldenburg in 1801, whose family owned the manor until 1945. The manor house was completely destroyed in 1945.Horst Schulz, Der Kreis Preu√üisch Eylau, Verden 1983 (German) Until 1945 the area was part of the German Province of East Prussia, Beisleiden was occupied by the Soviet Red Army in February 1945 throughout the East Prussian Offensive. After World War II the area was placed under Polish administration according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement. Germans fled or were expelled and replaced with Poles expelled from the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union or forced to settle in the area through Operation Vistula in 1947. The village has a population of 470 and is the main border crossing point between Russia and Poland (Bezledy/Bagrationovsk).

The village is located in the north of the Warmia and Mazury voivodeship, 9 km from Bisztynek. In 2010, it had a population of 40. In 1975-1998, when a different administrative division was in place, it was located in Olsztyn Voivodeship. Each August 26, Nowa Wie≈õ Reszelska becomes a destination for pilgrims who come from nearby villages to participate in a mass and church fair that take place at the Shrine of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Czƒôstochowa.  The shrine's history  Pilgrims entering Nowa Wie≈õ Reszelska The shrine was built at the turn of the 20th century. Such shrines are quite common in the Warmia region. The shrine was considered to be a historical monument as early as in the 1920s and 1930s, and it was registered in the Historic Preservation Office in K√∂nigsberg. Typically for Warmia's shrines, it was built on private land. The shrine is a mix of folk and sacral architecture. Originally covered only in white plaster, later it was painted in a variety of colours - white, celadon and blue, and there used to be standing crosses around it, since it probably was a burial site after the First World War. There are several shrines like this in the area (St. Anthony's Shrine in Warmiany, St. Peter and Paul's Shrine in ≈Åƒôd≈Çawki, the historic filial shrine in Ksiƒô≈ºno). Unlike a typical roadside shrine, the ones from the Warmia region are small, one-room buildings. Local people used them in place of churches. They were also built on private land as an expression of gratitude for recovering from an illness, or avoiding a natural disaster like flood or fire. After the Second World War the villagers from Nowa Wie≈õ Reszelska would organize May Devotions in the shrine. They were held without a priest and Marian litanies and songs were sung by the faithful. Usually the service was led by a woman from the village. The June services were also held there, as well as the October rosary meetings. After the war, paintings and sculptures had been found at the shrine ‚Äì such as a Piet√† and an Ascension scene. However, some of them had been stolen and others, due to their condition, were given to the Museum of Warmia & Mazury in Olsztyn. Today, only the altar and sculptures of saints are original, pre-war works of art. [10] When in 1978 Karol Wojty≈Ça became the pope, Stanis≈Çaw Szymanko, a villager, funded the shrine's renovation. Other villagers helped in the work, and when it was complete, women from Nowa Wie≈õ Reszelska decided to buy a new painting in Olsztyn, which still hangs in the shrine. The painting depicts the Blessed Virgin Mary of Czƒôstochowa and was consecrated by the Reverend Eugeniusz Bukowski.  The shrine today  During the fair traditional pea soup is offered to the visitors free of charge. Each Easter the traditional food blessing takes place at the shrine. In May the faithful gather there for May Devotions and on 26 August (the Virgin Mary of Czƒôstochowa Day) a Plenary Indulgence Mass is celebrated. According to a Warmia tradition, once a year a plenary indulgence mass has to be celebrated on the day of a shrine's patron saint. It was this ceremony that drew the attention of the people living in the nearby village of SƒÖtopy, who eventually began to travel to Nowa Wie≈õ Reszelska to attend the plenary indulgence mass. Jadwiga Ku≈∫lik, the village leader, had the shrine renovated and painted blue - the colour of Virgin Mary.  The pilgrimage  The tradition of pilgrimages to the Shrine of Virgin Mary of Czƒôstochowa began with the Reverend J√≥zef Leonowicz, who first consecrated the shrine and then organized a church fair and pilgrimage. Although no more than 7 families lived in Nowa Wie≈õ Reszelska, the news about the pilgrimage spread across the whole area. With each coming year, more and more people from neighbouring villages participated in the mass and the fair. At one time over 100 people participated in the event. Pilgrimages to nearby sites (in the Warmia dialect called ≈Çosiera) usually take place near large religious centres like the marine sanctuary in ≈öwiƒôta Lipka. Pilgrimages to such a small shrine like the one in Nowa Wie≈õ Reszelska are very rare. Ethnographers interviewing participants of the yearly pilgrimage The annual pilgrimage from SƒÖtopy to Nowa Wie≈õ Reszelska has been taking place for at least 20 years. Initially the pilgrimage, mass and fair were held on 26 August, on the Day of Blessed Virgin Mary of Czƒôstochowa. However, since the mass started to be accompanied by a fair and a beach volleyball match, the event has been moved to the last or third Saturday of August.  The contemporary pilgrimage  In August 2015 the person leading the procession held a flower-adorned cross. Three young boys, who symbolized the Holy Trinity, walked behind it and they were followed by a priest and then the rest of the faithful - about 50 people. During the procession religious songs were sung and mid-way flowers were laid at a small, roadside shrine. The pilgrimage travelled to the Shrine of Virgin Mary of Czƒôstochowa in Nowa Wie≈õ Reszelska. In 2015 over 50 people, mostly elderly, participated in the event.  The plenary indulgence mass  As the chapel is small, the mass is held outdoors. On the day of the mass the pilgrims sit on benches in front of the shrine. Then the holy mass takes place. Receiving indulgence is the reason for the pilgrimage and confession is the most important element of the mass. Since there are no confessionals in the shrine, the confession usually takes place in the open air. Some people still remember that in 1994 the Reverend Leonowicz due to heavy rains heard confessions in his car: \\"He heard confessions in a Polonez car. Each of us would enter, he was sitting behind the wheel, and we confessed our sins\\".  Harvest festival  The Mass on the Virgin Mary of Czƒôstochowa Day coincides with the local harvest festival and a variety of flower and plant adornments decorate the shrine and the altar. During the Mass a harvest festival bread is placed on the altar, where it remains until the mass' end. Afterwards the village leader shares it with the pilgrims. Pots with flowers and ears of wheat and rye as well as wicker baskets filled with vegetables stand next to the altar. They symbolize the year's harvest. The shrine's entrance is festooned with garlands as well.  The fair  After the mass, a fair takes place near the shrine, during which a beach volleyball tournament is held, local specialities are available and women from Nowa Wie≈õ Reszelska offer home-made food. The harvest festival bread is divided among the pilgrims.

G4 aired the show in the United States, but later pulled it from the schedule after only four episodes.The appearance of Viper's Creed on G4 follows the North American television debut of Marvel Anime. Plot With most of the Earth's cities underwater due to the onset of global warming followed by a third world war which brought calamity and turmoil to the people, various PMCs are one of the few remaining organizations able to provide law enforcement and self-defense protection for cities that are trying to rebuild again from the war and the floods. One of the PMCs providing law enforcement is the Arqon Global Security corporation, responsible for protecting Fort Daiva City from terrorism, armed crimes, and renegade unmanned machines called Bug Mechs, by deploying its elite military unit called Viper led by its operatives called Blademen. MechaManeuver Blades= Maneuver Blades are humanoid mecha used by Blademen that are capable of transforming into motorcycles. These mecha are primarily armed with an assault rifle, a rocket launcher in each shoulder, and a 6-tube missile pod on the left shoulder. While in motorcycle form they can easily reach speeds over 80 kilometers an hour. Most maneuver blades are equipped with a secondary weapon depending on the combat tactics of the pilot including a grenade launcher attachment to the assault rifle, heat chainsaw, a gatling gun, or a sniper rifle. The head of the mecha also serves as cameras with highly detailed targeting scanners. =Bug Mechs= Bug Mechs are unmanned mecha based after insects that were used as autonomous war machines during the great war. However, due to their AI they became unable to differentiate between friend and foe and became very difficult to be reprogrammed. The bug mechs are usually armed with gatling guns and homing mines called Spider Mines or \\"Ticker Bombs\\" in which they use their spider-like legs to attach to enemies before exploding. As demonstrated in episodes 2 and 11, bug mechs are very versatile and can easily move around in dark and underground environments. Five types of bug mechs were used during the events of the series and with the exception of the sputnik every bug mech returns in the final episode by the military. *Mega Soma: Armed with twin gatling guns, ticker bombs, spider mines, and spear legs. *Gelus: Armed with twin gatling guns. *Sputnik: Armed with twin gatling guns and spear legs. *Acromantis: Armed with scythe arms, gatling gun, and spider mines. *Mobilius: Armed with spider mines, back missile pod, a left arm machine gun, and a right arm claw.

She was professor of general history at the University of Haifa. Biography Marika Jakobovits (later Myriam Yardeni) was born in Timi»ôoara, in the Romanian multiethnic region of Banat, to a middle-class Jewish family. In 1950, she immigrated to Israel. She studied Hebrew at Ulpan Etzion in Jerusalem and attended a pedagogical seminary founded by Martin Buber. At the Hebrew University of Jerusalem she completed a BA in world history and French culture, and an MA in history. Her master's thesis, written in 1961 under the guidance of Jacob Talmon, explored the life and work of Bernard Lazare, a French Jewish anarchist and journalist. In 1963, she wrote her doctorate at the Sorbonne under Roland Mousnier. During her sojourn in Paris, she studied at the Ecole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales (EHESS). Academic career At the urging of Haifa's mayor Abba Hushi, Yardeni returned to Haifa and joined the faculty of the University of Haifa. In 1975, she was appointed head of the world history department. She founded the university's institute for research of French history. Yardeni's work focused on several research themes - national conscience in France in the early modern period and religious minorities in French context, in particular Huguenots and Jews. She was interested in religious persecution and early modern anti-Semitism. Her extensive and innovative publications positioned her as one of the leading scholars in these fields. Yardeni was a guest professor at CNRS, Bordeaux University, Michel de Montaigne Bordeaux3 University and the Institute for Science of Religion at the Haute Ecole de Hautes Etudes. She retired in 2001, but continued to actively work on her research projects until her death. During these years Yardeni published several books and numerous articles, as well as participated in various conferences in Israel and abroad. Awards and recognition * In 1998, Yardeni was awarded the Israel Prize in 1998 for general history. * In 2007, she was awarded the EMET Prize.Myriam Yardeni Emet Prize Published work *La conscience nationale en France pendant les guerres de religion (1559‚Äì1598).

Immune complexes can be visualized by staining with fluorescent antibodies directed against immunoglobulins or complement, resulting in a granular fluorescent staining pattern.

Description Thomasia grandiflora is a small shrub that grows to about high and wide. The dark, bright green leaves vary in shape, usually heart-shaped or occasionally narrowly elliptic, slightly flexible, leathery and long. The flowers have wide, conspicuous, pinkish-purple calyx lobes that are more prominent than the petals. The calyx is thicker near the mid-vein. The small petals are densely covered with star- shaped hairs, occasionally with only a few scattered hairs. The flowers have a papery texture and about across on short pendant stalks. The flowers are followed by capsules containing black seeds that are shed from the plant when ripe. Flowering occurs from winter to spring. Taxonomy and naming Thomasia grandiflora was first formally described by botanist John Lindley in 1839 who published the description in A sketch of the vegetation of the Swan River Colony in 1839. The specific epithet (grandiflora) is from the Latin grandis meaning \\"large\\" or \\"great\\" and flos meaning \\"flower\\" referring to the large flowers of the species.

History  In 1285 the ownership of an area named \\"Catithen\\" in the Old Prussian area of Natangia was awarded to the Sudovian nobleman Skomand by the Teutonic Order. The name probably derives back to the Old Prussian term for a small ford. About 1350, throughout the German Settlement in the East, a village \\"Canditten\\", sized 80 \\"Hufen\\", a square measure of the Teutonic Knights, and a church was founded by the Order. Throughout the Polish-teutonic Hunger War of 1414 the village and the Church was destroyed by Polish troops, the Priest and 7 farmers were killed. An estimated damage of 3,500 Mark in the village and 1,000 Mark at the Church was calculated by the Teutonic Knights. The village suffered again throughout the Polish-Teutonic Thirteen Years' War of 1454/66 and was given as a pawn to the nobleman Paul Pregel in 1491. The Church was completely destroyed in the horsemen's War of 1521, only 4 farmers lived here in 1540. In 1575 the landlord Truchse√ü von Waldburg re-established the Church. In 1664 the von Schwerin family of Wildenhoff became the landlords, which lasted until the abolition of serfdom in Prussia.Horst Schulz, Der Kreis Preu√üisch Eylau, Verden 1983 (German) In 1820 2 manors, 21 farms, 4 cottages and 6 craftsmen existed. Until 1945 the area was part of the German Province of East Prussia, Kanditten was occupied by the Soviet Red Army on 18 February 1945 throughout the East Prussian Offensive. After World War II the area was placed under Polish administration according to the post-war Potsdam Agreement. Germans fled or were expelled and replaced with Poles, many of them expelled from the Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union or forced to settle in the area throughout the Operation Vistula in 1947.

Cellulose is a good insulator and is also polar, having a dielectric constant significantly greater than one. Electrical paper products are classified by their thickness, with tissue considered papers less than 1.5 mils (0.0381 mm) thickness, and board considered more than 20 mils (0.508 mm) thickness.ASTM Paper and paperboard: characteristics, nomenclature, and significance of tests, ASTM, 1951 page 26 History The use of paper board as electrical insulation paper started in the early-mid 20th century. Since the need for high voltage electrical transformers, there has been a need for an insulating material that could withstand the high electrical and physical stresses experienced around a core and windings. Pressboard, a board made by compressing layers of paper together and drying them, has been used for installation purposes in many of the first electrical machines. However, as electrical technology increased, the need for a higher density material that was capable of insulating larger and higher voltage transformers grew. In the late 1920s, Hans Tschudi-Faude became the director of H. Weidmann Limited and began developing a type of pressboard that would meet the higher standards needed for the newer, more powerful transformers. Unlike older methods of pressboard production, Transformerboard was not based on used paper or cotton waste but was made with high-grade sulfate cellulose. The new product was made purely out of cellulose without a resin or binder, improving electrical insulation capabilities and could be completely dried, degassed, and oil impregnated. The new product became famous under the name Transformerboard. Throughout the 1930s, new methods of production and advances in understanding replaced almost all insulating parts of transformers with parts made from transformer board. In 1970, a branch of Weidmann Electrical Industries centered in St. Johnsbury, Vermont produced the largest Transformerboard ever measuring 12'5\\" by 21'8\\". At the time, the Vermont-based company was named EHV Industries. Production The more demanding application the cleaner the paper needs to be. Paper machines are run with deionised or even distilled process water when producing higher grades of electrical insulation paper. Electrical insulation papers are made from well delignified unbleached kraft pulp. ApplicationsCable paper= Electrical cables are categorized by the voltage and current used. Telephone cables have moderate voltage and current associated with cables leading moderate electric current or transmitting electrical signals. The telephone cables have a large number of conductors that are individually insulated. In order to not become excessively thick the paper needs to be thin (30-40 g/m2). A normal power cable needs more insulation and therefore paper with higher paper density is used, normally 60-190 g/m2. The paper needs to be strong, elastic, uniform and free of holes or debris. These applications are being replaced by plastic insulation. =High voltage power cable paper= Submarine power cables at very high voltages (> 400 kV) are a very demanding application. The paper is normally 65-155 g/m2 and mostly produced on two ply paper machines. An advantage of using paper in sea cables is that in case of leakage, the paper will swell and prevent water from flowing along the cable. =Capacitor tissue= This paper is used in capacitors and is an extremely clean and thin tissue paper (normally 6-12 g/m2) that is super calendered. The pulp is clean unbleached kraft pulp that is extremely refined. The paper is made on small paper machines with slow speeds because the stock has to be drained very slowly. =Transformer board= Transformer board is used mainly in oil-filled transformers where a solid insulating structure is needed. This is a pressboard up to 8 mm in thickness. The board is built up wet on forming cylinders and cut off when at the desired thickness. This makes a sheet with the size of the width and circumference of the drum. The wet sheets are hot- or cold-press dried and finished on separate machines.
