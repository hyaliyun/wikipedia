It was released by Sub Pop Records on January 23, 2007. It is the band's third album, and the last under their contract with Sub Pop. The album was recorded in James Mercer's basement studio, Phil Ek‚Äôs home in Seattle and in Oregon City with the veteran producer Joe Chiccarelli. It was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. Writing and recording Chiccareli had become acquainted with Mercer while in Portland, Oregon, working with Pink Martini. At the time Mercer was recording the new Shins album on his own and finding that it was not going the way he wanted and at the speed he wanted. Frustrated and in need of fresh objective feedback he sought Chiccarelli's advice and suggestions, before the producer eventually became involved in a professional capacity. The duo did not start the record from scratch; while they started some songs completely anew, they also retained some of the material that Mercer had been recording on his own. According to Chiccarelli in an interview with HitQuarters, they spent around two months working together on the album. Title The title is a play on the title of a Sam Cooke song \\"Twistin' the Night Away\\". As reported in Rolling Stone magazine, it is a reference to band member James Mercer's \\"crippling insomnia\\". \\"Sleeping Lessons\\", the title of the first track, also refers to insomnia and was considered as a possible album title. Before the album's release, Mercer announced Wincing the Night Away as the album title in an August 2006 interview with Billboard. Prerelease The full track listing was announced by Pitchfork Media on October 16, 2006. The first single, \\"Phantom Limb\\", was released on iTunes on November 14, 2006, and reached physical retailers on November 21. The new album was previewed in its entirety on the band's MySpace. The album was leaked from a promotional copy on October 20, 2006. Sub Pop hired a UK company to track down the source of the leak.\\"The Shins Hit The Fans, Sub Pop Calls In The Sheriff\\", Idolator On January 9, 2007, iTunes accidentally put the album on sale two weeks before its official release, then removed the option to purchase a day later. It is not known how many people purchased the album within these two days. Sub Pop Records also released the album as a vinyl LP, which includes a free coupon to download the album in mp3 format. Release Wincing the Night Away debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling in excess of 118,000 copies. This is the highest chart position reached by not only The Shins, but the whole Sub Pop label. During the same week, it also appeared as the top album in four other category charts: Top Digital Albums, Top Rock Albums, Tastemakers and Top Independent Albums. In the album's second week on the Billboard 200, it fell to number eight and sold about 53,000 copies.Jonathan Cohen, \\"Better 'Late' Than Never: Jones Debuts At No. 1\\", Billboard.com, February 7, 2007. Like Oh, Inverted World, the album went Gold. As of January 2012 Wincing the Night Away has sold 622,000 copies in United States. Description Mercer said that the band was \\"stretching out\\" on the new album, and that the extended recording period had given them more time to develop their ideas. He hoped to address more of the \\"human condition\\" on the third album, even though it is subdermally present in the previous two albums as well. Wincing the Night Away is The Shins' most musically diverse and experimental album yet, ranging from hip hop loops to psychedelic to Hawaiian folk to new wave and post-punk elements. Reception According to the review aggregator Metacritic, Wincing the Night Away is rated slightly lower on average than its predecessor, Chutes Too Narrow. While fewer in number, the positive reviews provided higher praise than for the band's prior work. For example, the Austin Chronicle said that it \\"makes both [previous] albums sound like fragmented potential\\". The New Musical Express stated that the album was \\"their best yet\\". More negative reviews came from Dusted magazine, which said \\"this is music that not only is mature enough to know that it can't change the world, but is content to not try\\", while Village Voice said, \\"filler tunes like \\"Pam Berry\\" and \\"Black Wave\\" are a far cry from the tenacious stuff that made Chutes the subject of lavish hyperbole.\\" Track listing The Japanese edition of the album contains two additional tracks, \\"Nothing at All\\" and \\"Spilt Needles\\" (alternate version), both taken from the \\"Phantom Limb\\" single. \\"Nothing at All\\" was also included on the album when pre-ordered on iTunes.

Diekwisch, D.M.D., Ph.D. (sc.), Ph.D. (phil.), is Professor and Head, Department of Oral Biology, University of Illinois at Chicago College of Dentistry; Allan G. Brodie Endowed Chair for Orthodontic Research; Director, Brodie Laboratory for Craniofacial Genetics; Professor of Anatomy, Cell Biology, Bioengineering, and Periodontics; Member, Center for Molecular Biology of Oral Diseases; and Member, Graduate Faculty, at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Birth and genealogy Thomas Gustav Heinrich Diekwisch was born on February 27, 1961, in Bielefeld, West Germany. The two middle names correspond to his two grandfathers‚Äô first names. Diekwisch is a common name in Northern Germany and translates into ‚Äúmeadow by the lake‚Äù. In the 1840s and again in the 1920s, members of the Diekwisch family moved from Germany to the United States, mostly to Illinois. Thomas Diekwisch‚Äôs parents are Annelore Spruch and Gerd Diekwisch, also from Bielefeld and born in 1930 (father) and 1933 (mother). His mother‚Äôs parents were Heinrich and Else Spruch from Bielefeld-Quelle, and his father‚Äôs parents were Gustav and Frieda Diekwisch from Bielefeld-Kammeratsheide/Heepen. Family background The Spruch and Diekwisch families in Bielefeld belonged to a staunchly social democratic community in Westphalia and risked their lives by retaining SPD party membership, opposing the Nazis, and supporting the Allies during World War II. Other members of the Spruch family emigrated to Israel after 1933. Thomas Diekwisch grew up in Quelle, a suburb of Bielefeld, together with his parents and the Spruch family. Grandfather Heinrich Spruch owned a small factory and instilled in Thomas the love for biology and science in general. All three generations did not serve in the military: Heinrich Spruch was exempted from military service during the war, Gerd Diekwisch belonged to the white generation being 15 years old when the war ended, and Thomas Diekwisch was exempted from military service in the Federal Republic of West Germany (BRD). Only grandfather Gustav was drafted, immediately transported to the Russian front, captured upon arrival, and detained in Siberia for the remainder of the war.http://dentistry.uic.edu/craniofacialgenetics/Brodie- Chair.html Academic credentials and career After attending the Gymnasium in Brackwede-Bielefeld, Diekwisch immatriculated at the Philipps-University of Marburg in Hesse, where he graduated in dentistry. In 1988, he got a Dr. med. dent. degree (in Anatomy, \\"summa cum laude\\"), and a Ph.D. in philosophy (2005, ‚Äúmagna cum laude‚Äù). From 1986 to 1990, Diekwisch worked as a lecturer, clinical instructor, and research associate in the Departments of Anatomy and Periodontics at the Philipps-University. In 1990, he became a postdoctoral fellow in craniofacial biology at the University of Southern California. In 1994, he joined the faculty of Baylor College of Dentistry in Dallas, TX, where he created a community science education outreach program entitled ‚ÄúHabitat for Science‚Äù that won awards from the Texas Alliance Legislative Conference on Science, Technology & Mathematics Education, and from the Sid W. Richardson Fellowship. Current position and interests In 2001, Diekwisch was recruited to the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Dentistry to become the first Director of the Brodie Laboratory for Craniofacial Genetics and the Allan G. Brodie Endowed Chair. Two years later, he was appointed professor and head of the Department of Oral Biology at the UIC College of Dentistry. Besides Oral Biology, Dr. Diekwisch holds appointments in anatomy and cell biology, bioengineering, orthodontics, and periodontics. Diekwisch discovered and characterized a gene, CP27 that plays an important role in craniofacial development. Other research areas include the development and evolution of tooth enamel and periodontal tissues as well as craniofacial tissue engineering.\\"World-Class Researcher Hired to Direct Brodie Laboratory,\\" Alumni Report Magazine, Fall-Winter 2001-2002 References External links * University of Illinois at Chicago College of Dentistry Category:University of Illinois at Chicago faculty Category:Living people Category:1961 births ","title":"Thomas Diekwisch"},{"id":"6669018","text":"Mach Song (, literally \\"Life Stream\\") is a national monthly bilingual Vietnamese-English newspaper published in Houston, Texas.

History \\"In the year of nineteen hundred and sixty, in the community of Windsor Park, there opened a school that became a legend. Only one other school in North America had this unique hexagonal architecture. The first principal of the school, Windsor Park Collegiate, was Mr. D. M. Slater, and the faculty population was 27. The first school President was R. D. McClelland. The school had a population of 619, ranging from Grade 7 to Grade 12. 93 of the students were graduating that year.\\" Taken from the 1978 Yearbook Currently, Windsor Park Collegiate is a grade 7 to grade 12 school. It harbors a staff force of 34 teachers and 40 support staff strive to maintain an environment that promotes student learning. The school offers an English Language Program. Architecture The building was designed by local Winnipeg firm 'Green Blankstein Russell', and construction began in 1959. The design is notable for its use of multiple two- storey hexagonal pods joined by hallways. The only other school know to feature the \\"unique hexagonal architecture\\" is Donald D. Lum Elementary School in Alameda, California, which opened in 1961. A larger gym, designed by firm 'Duncan Rattray Peters Searle' was later added in 1969. Windsor Park Collegiate was built during the cold war, and rumors of a large bomb shelter in the foundation of the school have been propagated by students, staff and alumni for decades. Despite the school being constructed with a large, open area in its foundation, there is no evidence that it was ever designed as any sort of bomb shelter. This unused underground space is accessible though a crawlspace near the former basement cafeteria, and a door near the main gym changing rooms. Special Needs Program WPC has the largest secondary school Special Needs program in the Louis Riel School Division. It is technically termed the Co-op Education Program and the Skills for Living Program. This program works with integration into standard classes, as well as work experience and life skills training. =Bistro in the Park= In 1999, the program opened up Crackers The Bistro, a full-service restaurant that was open to the public for lunch 5 days a week. Here they train and \\"employ\\" exclusively the students who are in the Occupational Skills Program within the Louis Riel School Division. It is located in a residential strip mall very close to WPC. The program was a great success in reaching its goals, but is still operated largely off donations and public funding. In 1999 this program won the Manitoba School Board Innovation Award.http://www.bigdatabase.ca/big- html/nonsecure/resources/success/success-crackers.html As of July 2006 the restaurant was renamed Bistro in the Park.http://www.lrsd.net/Administration/Boardroom/Minutes/Minutes06June2006.htm 50th Anniversary Celebration and Reunion A 50th anniversary celebration and reunion was held on May 13‚Äì14, 2011.

The establishment of the Canadian Nazi Party, re-named the National Socialist Party in 1967, marked a re-emergence of organized neo-Nazi activity in Canada that had been dormant since the days of Adrian Arcand. The Canadian Nazi Party leader Beattie organized a number of rallies in Toronto in the mid-1960s, although few actual Canadian Nazi Party members attended, and none of the rallies resulted in much support for Beattie's cause. One of these rallies on May 30, 1965, resulted in a violent encounter with Jewish activists who disrupted Beattie's rally at Allan Gardens.Shofar FTP Archives: \\"Hate Groups and Bigotry's Fellow Travellers\\", by Manuel Prutschi Beattie later found himself in legal trouble as a result of his rallies, and an expos√© article was written in Canadian newsmagazine Maclean's by private investigator John Garrity, who had been hired by the Canadian Jewish Congress to infiltrate Beattie's movement.Interview, Maclean's, October 1, 1966.

Among the messages recorded was one that claimed, \\"that blacks were being manipulated by Jew- communists.\\"Shofar FTP Archives: Heritage Front - I. OVERVIEW OF THE EXTREME RIGHT Activities after the Canadian Nazi Party Beattie disbanded the National Socialist Party in 1978. Soon after he and John Ross Taylor co- founded the short-lived British People's League. In both 1988 and 1989, Beattie organized \\"Aryan Fest\\" parties on his property in Minden, Ontario. Ernst Z√ºndel's Canadian Human Rights Tribunal hearing Beattie was to be a key witness for Paul Fromm during the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal concerning Holocaust denier Ernst Z√ºndel in 2000. Fromm's organization, the Canadian Association for Free Expression, had intervenor status during the hearings.Profile , NOWToronto.com, December 14, 2000. Fromm claimed that Beattie would testify that the Canadian Nazi Party had been a front created by the Canadian Jewish Congress as a means to enact Section 319 of the Criminal Code: :\\"Beattie will reveal that he was a dupe and a patsy, that everything from his group's name to its major activities was suggested or quarterbacked by persons acting as agents for or reporting to the Canadian Jewish Congress. Uncannily, at the very time that the Canadian Nazi Party was being built up and just as quickly destroyed a government committee was holding hearings to propose anti-hate legislation. The Cohen Committee made significant mention of the threat posed by John Beattie. The Canadian Jewish Congress, which largely created the short-lived Canadian Nazi Party, had, since the 1930s been lobbying for restrictions on freedom of speech. :\\"Beattie will reveal how an agent for the Canadian Jewish Congress lured him into a technical breach of the law, which landed the now unemployed, penniless Nazi leader in prison for six months. Beattie will also expose the fact that the same agent proposed legal maneuvers [sic] that were calculated to frighten and cause distress among Jews, thus heightening the \\"Nazi\\" menace, which was used as the argument for the 1971 \\"hate law\\" (Section 319 of the Criminal Code) and the subsequent section 13.1 (telephonic communication of hate) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, where truth is no defence.\\"CAFE news release: \\"John Beattie to Expose the Nazi Party That Never Was\\", 26 Nov 2000\\"The two faces of Paul Fromm\\", telusplanet.net, December 14, 2000.

The film follows the life of a married cat and dog couple who start off with a dream to open a bakery, only for their lives to drift apart due to a variety of circumstances. The film premiered at the Nashville Film Festival before getting released online several months later. Plot Doug and Kat, a dog and cat respectively, have recently gotten married and live in a small and rather old house. At the beginning Doug and Kat explain the \\"plan\\": to open their own bakery and \\"to keep on loving each other a lot, forever.\\" Despite some reluctance about the bakery from Doug, he goes along with the plan too. As they bake cupcakes in their small kitchen, the oven suddenly cracks and breaks. The two decide to search for jobs to pay for the damages; Kat as an ad agency assistant and Doug as a coffee barista. They both promise to quit after they earn enough. They buy a new oven, but it's too big and doesn't seem to fit their small kitchen. While messing with it, they accidentally break two ceramic dolls of themselves from their wedding. The two decide to work more so that they can renovate their kitchen; Kat joins the ad agency board and Doug gets promoted to manager. They expand their small house, but the constant work has made both of them too tired to bake. Six years later, Kat finds the still broken ceramic dolls and the two decide that for their anniversary to come home early so that they can bake something together. However, Kat ends up staying late to help an employee. When she arrives, Doug is sitting at the dinner table, sad and with the dolls fixed. When he suggests they quit, Kat refuses as they are financially secure. As Doug leaves upstairs, he accidentally bumps the table and the dolls shatter. Soon, their marriage begins to lose affection. Kat attempts to cheer up Doug with cupcakes, but he is disappointed by the fact that they were store-bought and decides to break up with Kat. As Doug packs his belongings to go, Kat suddenly remembers her passion for baking and stops him with another \\"plan\\" and takes a sledgehammer to the wall. The two embrace with their love restored. Doug and Kat are shown living in their new apartment situated above their newly built bakery. They look out together with them wondering what their new plan will be. After the credits, their ceramic dolls are seen repaired next their wedding photo. Cast *Alex Small-Butera as Doug, Kat's canine husband. *Lindsey Small-Butera as Kat, Doug's feline wife. Production Fernanda Frick came up with the idea for the short after watching movies about marriages. \\"I began to notice that every time a marriage was shown on screen it seemed as if the worst thing that could happen to you in life was to be married.\\" Frick was disappointed in the stereotypes of married couples; husbands as slobbish pigs and wives as hysterical manipulators. Shows like Parks and Recreation and indie films like Away We Go gave her a more positive outlook. Alex and Lindsay Small-Butera were a real couple, as well as fellow animators, that auditioned after several failed and \\"terrible\\" tryouts. Production was plagued by setbacks due to the fact that cgi animators were rare and uncommon in Chile. At one point, Frick had to outsource the rendering of the film to a render farm in China. The overall aesthetic was inspired by the Craig Thompson graphic novel Good-bye, Chunky Rice as it featured \\"cute animals with complex human emotions and relationships\\". The film was initially much shorter, but Frick chose to expand it despite the possible threat of it not being able to compete in festivals. She also had to convince people that the film needed a happy ending stating \\"It's sad that something has to reflect a nihilist view of the world to be considered deep or worthwhile.\\" References External links  * Category:2017 films Category:2017 3D films Category:2017 computer-animated films Category:2010s American animated films Category:American films Category:2010s animated short films Category:3D short films Category:American animated short films Category:Animated films about cats Category:Animated films about dogs Category:Chilean animated films Category:Films about marriage ","title":"Here's the Plan"},{"id":"6669072","text":"Gavin Richard Haynes (born 29 September 1969 in Wordsley, Stourbridge) is a retired professional cricketer who played for Worcestershire from 1991 to 1999.

Due to Wesley Snipes' tax problems the film went through many changes and delays, and was completed in 2010. It still had no official release until a 2012 screening at the \\"Film4 FrightFest\\" festival in the United Kingdom. In 2013 it was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States, nearly eight years after the film started production in 2006. Plot A group of disfigured people gather near a railroad in a desert where they are killed by a mysterious gunslinger named Aman (Wesley Snipes), who also rips out the head and spine from one of the dead bodies. Nearby in the same desert, a group of criminals is waiting to be transported. Aman arrives, kills most of the guards, and frees one criminal called Fabulos (Riley Smith). The rest of the criminals nonetheless end up being transported to a small settlement where they are supposed to be hanged. However, just as they arrive, the settlement is attacked by a bizarre gang led by a skinless man named Kansa (Kevin Howarth), who slaughters most of the inhabitants. Through flashbacks it is revealed that the same gang of outlaws once raped Aman's lover, so he went after them and brutally killed them while they were imprisoned and defenseless. While running away Aman, himself, was killed, so his mother, a nun, broke her covenant with God and sacrificed herself to save his life, which in turn cursed him for life. The curse makes all the people killed by Aman come back to life, so all the gang members that Aman had killed returned as undead to seek revenge, except for Kansa's son who remained dead. The undead lose their skin after a week, so they remove the skins from the people they kill to use as replacements. The only way the undead can be killed is by destroying their brains. Part of the undead gang attacks Aman and Fabulos while they are visiting a woman and a child, but the four manage to kill all the attackers. However, Fabulos is severely wounded, so Aman kills him in order for him to come back as undead. Kansa (who put on new skin) and his remaining 2 undead followers arrive at a secret temple with the beautiful Angel (Tanit Phoenix) whom they took hostage back in the settlement. Kansa believes that inside the temple they will find a way to resurrect his dead son, but this proves to be false. Aman and the undead Fabulos soon catch up with them, and Aman kills Kansa and his followers. While Aman is leaving with Kansa's head in his hand, Angel seductively approaches Fabulos.

The museum is located in a wing of one of the former Vermont Marble Company buildings. Vermont Marble Company Marble bust of President John F. Kennedy The Vermont Marble Company was founded in 1880 by businessman and politician Redfield Proctor, who served as the company's first president. Marble was quarried from several locations in the town of Proctor, then called Sutherland Falls, and the surrounding communities of Rutland, West Rutland and Danby. As railroads arrived in Rutland and Proctor, the Vermont Marble company became one of the largest producers of marble in the world. The company provided marble for the construction of such notable icons as the USS Arizona Memorial, the West Virginia State Capitol, the Oregon State Capitol, the United States Supreme Court Building, the Arlington National Cemetery, and Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library to name a few. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was also created there. The surrounding town was named after Redfield Proctor and became a company town. The buildings and quarries of the Vermont Marble Company are now owned by OMYA, a supplier of industrial minerals. Exhibit Hall of Presidents - reliefs carved from marble The exhibit offers self-guided tours focusing on the company's history, the geology of marble and other local stones, and the uses of marble in art, architecture, and industry. A short video narrates the history of the Vermont Marble Company, and historical photographs of VMC workers quarrying, carving, and shipping Vermont marble are displayed throughout the exhibit. Several geologic exhibits, including an artificial cave and a preserved triceratops skeleton are also on display. A display contains large slabs of decorative stone, including the local Danby white and deep green verde antique. This display also includes local granites and imported marbles. Numerous sculptures, including busts of nearly all the U.S. presidents, The Last Supper, and other works are scattered throughout the museum. An artists' studio allows visitors to watch carving demonstrations and ask questions of local sculptors. The architectural uses of marble are displayed in a small chapel and a modern kitchen and bathroom surfaced in stone. Visitors may also get a balcony view of one of the large 19th-century warehouses of the Vermont Marble Company, now used by OMYA. A nearby quarry (now defunct), located about a quarter mile from the museum itself, has recently been added to the exhibit. The grounds around the exhibit hold large chunks of quarried, unfinished marble. The Preservation Trust of Vermont acquired the Vermont Marble Company in 2014. Also, the town of Proctor has many sidewalks made of marble, and the high school and Catholic church are both faced in local stone. Most of the buildings of the former Vermont Marble Company still stand, and many are constructed of Vermont marble.

These flies are commonly encountered in temperate areas of Europe, Siberia, and northern China. They have been introduced to North America.Fact Sheets. Deer Keds. Department of Entomology, Pennsylvania State University. Retrieved 2015-09-26. They are parasites of elk, deer, and other deer family members, burrowing through the fur and sucking the blood of the host animals. Adults are only in length and brownish in colour. Their bodies are flat and elastic, making their removal difficult. L. cervi is a poor flier and can only fly for short distances. Once the insect reaches its target, it sheds its wings and starts burrowing through the fur. Bite Lipoptena cervi without wings. Although their life cycle depends on deer, they may on rare occasions bite humans, producing responses ranging from unnoticeable to highly allergic. Initially, the bite may be barely noticeable and leaves little or no trace. Within 3 days, the site may develop into a hard, reddened welt. The accompanying itch is intense and typically lasts 14 to 20 days. Occasionally, an itch papule may persist for up to a year. The main annoyance in humans is the inconvenience and unpleasantness of removing keds from hair and clothes. Anaplasma phagocytophilum, a Gram-negative, obligately intracellular bacterium that causes anaplasmosis, has been detected in L. cervi, as has Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease,Buss B, Kearnery C.B., Coleman, C., Henning, J.D. (December 2016). \\"Detection of Lyme disease and anaplasmosis pathogens via PCR in Pennsylvania deer ked.\\" Journal of Vector Ecology 41 (2): 292-294. but whether the insect can serve as a vector is as yet unknown. Horses can develop colic after a bite. Dogs that are bitten may develop a moderate to severe dermatitis. And L. cervi can carry and spread Bartonella schoenbuchensis in deer. Much, however, remains unknown about the ked's potential to pose a medical or veterinary threat. Remains of L. cervi have been found on √ñtzi, the Stone Age mummy from the Schnalstal glacier in South Tyrol. Life history Both males and females of L. cervi consume blood from their hosts. Feeding lasts 15 to 25 minutes. The female produces one larva at a time and retains the developing larva in her body until it is ready to pupate. The larva feeds on the secretions of a \\"milk gland\\" in the uterus of its mother. The female gives birth to a fully mature white prepupa. She may produce larvae for as long as 10 months. A newborn prepupa immediately darkens, forms the puparium, and begins to pupate on the forest floor, or where the deer are bedded. After pupation, the winged adult emerges and flies in search of a host. Upon finding a host, the adult fly breaks off its wings and it is permanently associated with its host. Distribution This species is found in most of Europe, including Great Britain (but not Ireland), as well as Algeria, eastern Siberia, and northern China. It was introduced to and is established in the Eastern United States (New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Idaho, and New York). It also spread to Finland from Russia in the early 1960s, where it primarily feeds on moose, though it is spreading to reindeer. Hosts Red deer, moose, roe deer, fallow deer, and Siberian musk deer are this fly's native host. In the United States, it has acquired hosts such as elk, white-tailed deer, and reindeer. There are stray records of bites on humans, dogs and badger, and it will occasionally commit to the wrong host.  See also  * Deer fly  References  Notes 11\\\\.

In a Public Utility Model system, the government is a \\"purchaser\\" of dispatchers, emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedic providers from an EMS provider (contractor). In most cases, this is a private (for-profit) ambulance company. In the ownership of a Public Utility Model, the community retains control of EMS system capital assets and accounts receivable through daily oversight. The EMS provider (contractor) manages the day-to-day operations of the service and provides the system with properly trained providers. The system is designed whereas the government not only regulates and oversees system performance, but the ambulance service contractor is held accountable to meet or exceed performance requirements. These requirements include, but not limited to, time constraints. Such limits are set to ensure an ambulance arrives to life-threatening emergencies without delay. The contractors failure in fulfilling the contractual obligations can result in fines being imposed, up to and including termination of contract. The agreement and contract between government and contractor are done through a competitive bidding process. This insures that the most cost-effective provision of EMS services is guaranteed. History Around 1983 Jack Stout proposed System Status Management in the Denver City and County EMS system. Soon after, he proposed, or was instrumental in developing Public Utility Models, EMS Performance Contracts, and helped design the very first Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system, specific to EMS needs. This gave communities the ability to monitor and measure the performance of their EMS providers (spurring continuous quality improvement and accountability). From this the response time standards were developed that most PUM's use. Public utility models in USA Public Utility Models are typically serviced by contract between a private ambulance supplier and the cities they service. Distinguishing characteristics Public Utility Model EMS systems have certain characteristics which make it different from other emergency medical services delivery models. They are: =Oversight= There must be a governmental oversight agency which coordinates the provision of emergency medical services throughout the entire service area. These are usually boards made up of stakeholders in an EMS system (citizens, elected/appointed government officials, physicians, paramedics, nurses, financial gurus, and even consumer advocates) =Patient care= High quality patient care is the number one focus of a public utility model EMS service. Continuous quality improvement is paramount, and every aspect of the EMS delivery process is examined and re-examined exhaustively in a never-ending cycle. =Performance-based contracts= Services are provided by contractors who are under \\"performance-based\\" agreements. These type of arrangements require results be achieved using the creativity and innovative methods of the providers. There are performance benchmarks established for dispatchers, unit response times. =Financial control= Financial controls must be in place where the public utility model oversight authority controls all EMS system funding. A public utility model is designed to be funded through the collection of user fees and not reliance on tax money. While some systems struggle with reimbursement issues, the fact remains that a substantial portion of PUM operating revenues are derived from user fees not tax subsidy. =Response level= Advanced Life Support (ALS) resources are sent to all calls - there may be a tiered response with a local fire department providing BLS first response via an engine or truck company, but the level of transporting care is always ALS and always at the paramedic level. Purists will argue, with merit, that a true PUM must encompass all five of these hallmarks. However, many existing PUM operations are a hybrid of a simple third-service EMS organization utilizing one or more of the above listed characteristics in an effort to provide the best advanced life support patient care possible. System Status Management System Status Management or (SSM) is the most widely accepted method for managing ambulance/EMS resources in the PUM environment. SSM has two dominant components: =Dynamic deployment= Ambulances are geographically deployed based on projected demand by the time of day and day of week by using historic demand data. This model responds to the fact that as populations move from home to work and back, geographic demand patterns vary. Using SSM, ambulances do not respond from fixed stations, but are \\"posted\\" to street corners on an hour to hour basis. The \\"posts\\" are selected to provide the best response times for the projected demand at that time of day. =Peak demand staffing= Shift schedules are designed to provide the number of ambulances needed for the time of day and day of week projected demand. Consequently, in a typical PUM EMS provider system, ambulances typically begin duty every hour from 5:00 a.m. until noon and then the numbers start declining about 5:00 p.m. until midnight. Shift lengths are typically 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 24 hours in a large and busy system. SSM enables a public utility model EMS contractor to match resources to demand more accurately than using a more traditional 'static' model of fixed staffing and fixed stations for all hours of the day and days of the week.

Happy Traum (born Harry Peter Traum, May 9, 1938, The Bronx, New York City) is an American folk musician who started playing music in the 1950s and became a stalwart of the Greenwich Village music scene of the 1960s and the Woodstock music scene of the 1970s and 1980s. For several years, he studied blues guitar with Brownie McGhee, who was a big influence on his guitar style. Happy is most famously known as one half of Happy and Artie Traum, a duo he began with his brother. They released several albums, including Happy and Artie Traum (1969, Capitol), Double Back (1971, Capitol), and Hard Times In The Country (1975, Rounder). He has continued as a solo artist and as founder of Homespun Music Instruction. Music career =Collaborations with Bob Dylan= Traum first appeared on record at a historic session in late 1962 when a group of young folk musicians, including Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, Pete Seeger, Peter LaFarge and The Freedom Singers, gathered in the studio at Folkways Records to record an album called Broadside Ballads, Vol. 1. With his group, The New World Singers, Traum cut the first version of \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" to be released (early 1963). Traum also sang a duet with Dylan, who performed under the pseudonym Blind Boy Grunt, on his anti-war song \\"Let Me Die in My Footsteps\\". These tracks were re-released in August 2000 by Smithsonian Folkways as part of a boxed set, The Best of Broadside 1962 - 1988: Anthems from the American Underground. Later that year, The New World Singers, which featured Traum, Bob Cohen and Gil Turner, recorded an album for Atlantic Records, with liner notes by Dylan. The album featured the first recording of Dylan's \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\\" In 1971 Happy once again joined Dylan in the studio, playing guitar, banjo, bass, and singing harmony on four songs, which appeared on Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II and The Bootleg Series Vol. 10 ‚Äì Another Self Portrait (1969‚Äì1971). Dylan also invited Happy to participate in a famous session with poet Allen Ginsberg, which resulted in the box set Holy Soul Jelly Roll.

As a result of the success at LSU, Laval was offered the head coaching position at nearby University of Louisiana at Monroe in 1993. Head coaching career =Northeast Louisiana/Louisiana‚ÄìMonroe= Laval became head coach of the Northeast Louisiana Indians (now the Louisiana‚ÄìMonroe Warhawks) for the 1994 season. Laval led the team to a 241‚Äì159 (.603) record, two NCAA Tournament appearances, two Southland Conference regular season championships (1999 and 2000) and one Southland Conference tournament championship (1995). As a result of this success he attracted the attention of LSU in the wake of Skip Bertman's impending retirement. =LSU= LSU hired Laval as an administrative assistant for the baseball team under Bertman in 2001, with the intention of promoting him to head coach succeeding Bertman. Bertman retired at the end of that season having won five national championships and Laval took over head coaching duties in 2002. Expectations were high for the new coach, as one would expect following a legend like Bertman. In 2002 Laval led the Tigers to a 44‚Äì22 record and an appearance in a Super Regional in his first season. Things got even better in 2003, Laval's second season, as he led the team to a 45‚Äì22‚Äì1 record and their first Southeastern Conference regular season championship since 1997. He was named the 2003 SEC Coach of the Year. He also led the team to an appearance in the College World Series as the #2 national seed. However, the Tigers went home after two straight losses. 2004 saw the Tigers compile a 46‚Äì19 record and included a return trip to the College World Series. Like the prior year, LSU went 0‚Äì2 in the CWS and was eliminated. LSU fans were not used to going winless in Omaha, leading to questions about Laval's ability to maintain the program's elite status. The 2005 Tigers struggled during the regular season but still managed to compile a 40‚Äì22 record. The team lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament and did not make an appearance in a Super Regional for the first time ever (Super Regionals began in 1999). Although Laval's first four years were fairly solid, they were below Tiger fans had come to expect. He began feeling pressure from LSU fans and the athletic administration, and it was generally felt that 2006 would be a make-or-break season for him. Unfortunately for Laval, the Tigers had their worst season since 1983, the year before Bertman arrived. The team finished the season with a record of 35‚Äì24 and its first losing SEC record in 24 years. They missed the NCAA tournament for the first time in 18 years. Under pressure, Laval officially resigned on June 4, 2006. He finished his career at LSU with a record of 210‚Äì109‚Äì1 (.658) in five seasons. Notre Dame coach Paul Mainieri was hired to replace him. Following his resignation, Laval worked as a scouting adviser for the Toronto Blue Jays. =North Florida= In 2009, the University of North Florida announced that Laval would succeed Hall of Fame coach Dusty Rhodes as head coach of the Ospreys upon Rhodes' retirement. He took over prior to the 2011 season, becoming the second baseball coach in the school's history. He led the team to its first Atlantic Sun Conference regular season championship in 2015 and was named Atlantic Sun Conference coach of the year that season. Laval was removed as head coach after the 2017 season. =Yearly record= Below is a table of Laval's yearly records as an NCAA head baseball coach.

Blue Pill originally required AMD-V (Pacifica) virtualization support, but was later ported to support Intel VT-x (Vanderpool) as well. It was designed by Joanna Rutkowska and originally demonstrated at the Black Hat Briefings on August 3, 2006, with a reference implementation for the Microsoft Windows Vista kernel. The name is a reference to the red pill and blue pill concept from the 1999 film The Matrix. Overview The Blue Pill concept is to trap a running instance of the operating system by starting a thin hypervisor and virtualizing the rest of the machine under it. The previous operating system would still maintain its existing references to all devices and files, but nearly anything, including hardware interrupts, requests for data and even the system time could be intercepted (and a fake response sent) by the hypervisor. The original concept of Blue Pill was published by another researcher at IEEE Oakland on May 2006, under the name VMBR (virtual-machine based rootkit). Joanna Rutkowska claims that, since any detection program could be fooled by the hypervisor, such a system could be \\"100% undetectable\\". Since AMD virtualization is seamless by design, a virtualized guest is not supposed to be able to query whether it is a guest or not. Therefore, the only way Blue Pill could be detected is if the virtualization implementation were not functioning as specified.'Blue Pill' Prototype Creates 100% Undetectable Malware, Ryan Naraine, eWeek.com This assessment, repeated in numerous press articles, is disputed: AMD issued a statement dismissing the claim of full undetectability.Faceoff: AMD vs. Joanna Rutkowska , eWeek.com Some other security researchers and journalists also dismissed the concept as implausible.Debunking Blue Pill Myth, virtualization.info Virtualization could be detected by a timing attack relying on external sources of time. In 2007, a group of researchers challenged Rutkowska to put Blue Pill against their rootkit detector software at that year's Black Hat conference,Rutkowska faces ‚Äò100% undetectable malware‚Äô challenge, Ryan Naraine at zdnet.com but the deal was deemed a no-go following Rutkowska's request for $384,000 in funding as a prerequisite for entering the competition. Rutkowska and Alexander Tereshkin countered detractors' claims during a subsequent Black Hat speech, arguing that the proposed detection methods were inaccurate.Showdown at the Blue Pill Corral The source code for Blue Pill has since been made public,Blue Pill 2007 Blue Pill 2008 under the following license: Any unauthorized use (including publishing and distribution) of this software requires a valid license from the copyright holder.

It was first published by Avision in 1907, and was later re-issued by Emerson in 1976. Movements and Analysis The piece is divided into four movements: # Vivace # Ballade: Moderato, ma sempre a piacere # Allegretto - Poco maestoso - Tempo I - Pi√π lento # Moderato - Animato - Vivace =I. Vivace= The first movement is divided into six sections. It opens in 6/8 with a forte statement of the theme on the bassoon. After 40 measures, the second section begins. It is in 2/4, and modulates from F to C. The tempo remains the same, but it is marked ma pi√π lente. The piano has the first statement of the second theme, which is more legato then the first theme. After a series of minor thirds descending chromatically, the second section ends. The third section is once more in 6/8, but is still has the key signature of C major. The key changes frequently, however, as the section is mostly composed of scales and arpeggios with many accidentals. After working up to a high B in the bassoon part, it gradually slows and decreases in pitch and volume, before ending with a low B on the piano. The fourth section is a restatement of the first section, once more in F. It begins piano this time, but quickly grows back to a forte. It is followed by the fifth section, which is a shortened version of the second section, this time transposed to F. The final section is marked Animato and begins with a three measure bassoon solo. The melody is sharply staccato, and the movement ends with the last four notes of an F major scale. =II. Ballade: Moderato, ma sempre a piacere= The second movement (ballade) is in G minor. It remains in 4/4 throughout. The piano opens with the melody, a very legato one with many dotted notes. The bassoon soon enters, with a long, mourning line. Variations on the melody are played, before a brief section in G major. The movement returns to G minor with a long bassoon line that slowly grows into a brief Poco animato in A major. The movement returns to G minor with a statement of the original theme, and gradually fades out, to end on a final G major chord. =III. Allegretto - Poco maestoso - Tempo I - Pi√π lento= The third movement is a clumsy waltz. Although marked Allegretto, there is much give and take with the tempo. It has many runs that are cut short by sharp staccatos. About a third of the way through the movement, it abruptly modulates into D flat major, and the Poco maestoso is reached. Although more legato, it still retains the light-hearted clumsiness of the earlier section. The movement then returns to F major, and the first theme returns. The last section is marked Pi√π lento, and the movement ends on a V chord. =IV. Moderato - Animato - Vivace= The final movement opens with an ad lib statement of the theme from the second movement. Soon, however, the sprightly Vivace in F is reached. The melody (in 2/4) uses many syncopated rhythms, along with many sixteenth notes. A second theme follows, which consists almost entirely of dotted-eight/ sixteenth rhythms, however the first theme restates itself quickly. Soon, however, the theme from the second movement is restated, this time in B flat minor. This quickly evolves back to the first theme of this movement, now in E major. After much modulation, the theme returns to its original form in F major. The piece ends with a final Animato. The last strains of the theme are heard, and the piece ends on a pedal F in the bassoon part.

Mathew Brady's National Photographic Portrait Galleries, photographer. From the Liljenquist Family Collection of Civil War Photographs, Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress Burns was born in Burlington, New Jersey, of Scottish ancestry; his father claimed a relationship with poet Robert Burns. He served as an enlisted man in the War of 1812, fighting in numerous battles, including Lundy's Lane, and volunteered for both the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and the Civil War. He was rejected for combat duty in the latter war due to his advanced age, but he served as a teamster in support of the Union Army. He was sent home against his will to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where he was named constable. During Confederate Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early's brief occupation of Gettysburg on June 26, 1863, Burns was jailed for his adamant assertion of civil authority in resisting. As the Confederates departed, Burns was released from jail and arrested some of the Confederate stragglers,[The Battle of Gettysburg by Samuel Penniman Bates .p.219 continuing his opposition to the invading army until he was relieved by Federal cavalry under Brig. Gen. John Buford.Appleton's, n.p. On the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg, July 1, 1863, Burns took up his flintlock musket and powder horn and walked out to the scene of the fighting that morning. He encountered a wounded Union soldier and asked if he could use his more modern rifle; the soldier agreed and Burns moved on with the rifle and with cartridges in his pocket. Approaching Major Thomas Chamberlin of the 150th Pennsylvania Infantry, Burns requested that he be allowed to fall in with the regiment. Chamberlin later wrote of Burns moving with deliberate step, carrying his Enfield rifle at a trail. His somewhat peculiar dress > consisted of dark trousers and a waistcoat, a blue \\"swallow tail\\" coat with > burnished brass buttons, such as used to be affected by well-to-do gentlemen > of the old school about 40 years ago, and a high black silk hat, from which > most of the original gloss had long departed, of a shape to be found only in > the fashion plates of the remote past.Martin, p. 372. Despite his skepticism about the request, Chamberlin referred him to the regimental commander, Colonel Langhorne Wister, who sent the aged Burns into the woods next to the McPherson Farm, where he would find better shelter from the sun and enemy bullets.Pfanz, p. 357. In McPherson (Herbst) Woods, Burns fought with the 7th Wisconsin Infantry and then moved to join the 24th Michigan near the eastern end of the woods.Pfanz, p. 358. He fought beside these men of the famous Iron Brigade throughout the afternoon, serving effectively as a sharpshooter, in one case shooting a charging Confederate officer from his horse. As the Union line began to give way and they fell back to the Seminary, Burns received wounds in the arm, the leg, and several minor ones in the breast; the Union soldiers were forced to leave him behind on the field.Martin, p. 374. Injured and exhausted, the old man was able to crawl away from his rifle and to hastily bury his ammunition. He convinced the Confederates that he was a noncombatant, wandering the battlefield seeking aid for his invalid wife, and his wounds were dressed by their surgeons. This was a narrow escape for Burns, for by the rules of war he was subject to summary execution as a non-uniformed combatant, or bushwhacker. He was able to crawl that evening to the cellar of the nearest house, and was later conveyed to his own home, where he was treated by Dr. Charles Horner.Martin, pp. 374‚Äì75.Burns' house shortly after the battle. Burns is seated at top of stairs. After the battle, Burns was elevated to the role of national hero. Hearing about the aged veteran, Mathew Brady's photographer Timothy H. O'Sullivan photographed Burns while recuperating at his home on Chambersburg Street and took the story of Burns and his participation in the battle back home to Washington. When President Abraham Lincoln came to Gettysburg to dedicate the Soldiers National Cemetery and deliver his Gettysburg Address that fall, he requested to meet with Burns. Burns accompanied the president on a walk from the David Wills house to the Presbyterian Church on Baltimore Street on November 19, 1863.Petruzzi, p. 236. Burns's fame quickly spread and a poem about his exploits was published by Bret Harte in 1864.NPS. According to Burns's biography in Appleton's Cyclopedia, during the last two years of his life his mind failed, and his friends were unable to prevent his wandering about the country. He was found in New York City on a cold winter's night in December 1871, in a state of destitution, and was cared for and sent home, but died of pneumonia in 1872. In memoriam A statue of John Burns at Gettysburg National Military Park The popularity of John Burns' participation in the battle grew in the post war years. His home on Chambersburg Street was razed after his death and veterans of the battle remarked that something should be done to commemorate his services. Reacting to a proposal by a Pennsylvania chapter of the Sons of Union Veterans, the state enacted legislation to provide funds for a fitting monument. The Pennsylvania Board of Commissioners on Gettysburg Monuments desired that the monument be placed on the field where Burns had fought with the 150th Pennsylvania and 7th Wisconsin regiments, and a site was chosen on McPherson's Ridge next to Herbst Woods. Sculptor Albert G. Bureau chose to depict a defiant Burns with clenched fist, carrying his borrowed rifle. Placed upon a boulder taken from the battlefield, the monument was dedicated on July 1, 1903, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the battle. Burns is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Gettysburg, one of only two graves there with permission to fly the American flag twenty-four hours per day (the other being the grave of Ginnie Wade, the only civilian killed during the battle). His original gravestone was vandalized, but replaced by the local chapter of the Grand Army of the Republic in 1902. It bears the inscription \\"Patriot\\". Notes References * Martin, David G.

Encounters is split into three parts, each covering environmentalist David Brower's confrontations with his ideological enemies. The book chronicles his struggles against miners, developers and finally the United States Bureau of Reclamation. McPhee blends traditional journalism--the reporting of facts and accounting of events, with thematic elements more common to fiction. The book was generally well received in the popular press and became an enduring part of the portrait of David Brower. Synopsis While notionally a profile of Brower, Encounters is broken into three sections. The first chronicles Brower's conflict with Charles Park, a mineral engineer hoping to find and exploit mineral reserves in Glacier Peak Wilderness. Charles Park is portrayed as calculating and pragmatic, unwilling to foreclose real economic value from current generations in order to leave the environment pristine for future generations. This pragmatic view was starkly contrasted with Brower's insistence that \\"I believe in wilderness for itself alone\\". McPhee facilitates or observes the dialogue between these two contrasted figures as he does for the other two sections in the book. The second section introduces Charles Fraser, a real estate developer in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. Fraser's characterization of environmentalists as modern druids who \\"worship trees and sacrifice human beings to those trees\\" provides the charge against Brower that forms the title of the book. Brower came to Georgia in order to stop Fraser's plan to develop Cumberland Island. Like Park, Fraser is depicted as nuanced and pragmatic: his vision of development is controlled and regulated land use. Fraser's development of Hilton Head Island is still considered a model for planned development and McPhee notes that Fraser considers himself a true conservationist.McPhee (1971), pp. 92-95 Brower would eventually win this battle, with a groundswell of opposition forcing Fraser to sell his development on Cumberland Island to the National Park Foundation.McPhee (1971), pp. 149-150 The third section presents David Brower's unraveling. Here Brower battles Floyd Dominy, then the commissioner of the United States Bureau of Reclamation. Displaying only some of the reserve and pragmatism of the previous two figures, Dominy relished the damming of rivers, while Brower considered damming the ultimate offense. Brower struggled to save the Glen Canyon from being flooded by the Glen Canyon Dam but failed and as the story progresses, he is increasingly marginalized in the environmental movement for his perceived militancy. Wendy Nelson Espeland, in The Struggle for Water, argues that the Bureau carries much of the blame (or credit) for \\"radicalizing\\" Brower. Reception and influence McPhee's catalog of these conflicts between the growing needs of society and the shrinking wilderness \\"pre-saged\\" what would become known as \\"wise use\\", or prescriptions for use that balance the existential value of the environment against societal needs. Encounters was positively received in both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Time gave a positive review as well, noting the narrative similarities to a novel. The term \\"archdruid\\" stuck with Brower and was used appreciatively in many of his obituaries, including one McPhee wrote for him, when he died in 2000.

The Nakijin dialect is often considered representative of Kunigami, analogous to the Shuri-Naha dialect of Central Okinawan. The number of fluent native speakers of Kunigami is not known. As a result of Japanese language policy, the younger generation mostly speaks Japanese as their first language. Location In addition to the northern portion of Okinawa Island, Kunigami is spoken on the small neighboring islands of Ie, Tsuken and Kudaka. Scope and classification Glottolog, following Pellard (2009), classifies Kunigami with Central Okinawan as the two Okinawan languages. Ethnologue adds Okinoerabu and Yoron; these (along with all other languages of the northern Ryukyu Islands) are classified as Amami languages by Glottolog. The UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger, following Uemura (2003), includes Okinoerabu and Yoron as varieties of Kunigami. Folk terminology The speakers of Kunigami have various words for \\"language\\", \\"dialect\\", and \\"style of speech\\". For example, linguist Nakasone Seizen (1907‚Äì1995) stated that the dialect of his home community Yonamine, Nakijin Village had (corresponding Standard Japanese word forms in parentheses): (kuchi), (kotoba) and (monoii). The language of one's own community was referred to as or . The Yonamine dialect was part of Nakijin's western dialect called . The northern part of Okinawa was colloquially known as Yanbaru and hence its language was sometimes called . Phonology Like most Ryukyuan languages north of Central Okinawan, Kunigami has series of so-called \\"tensed\\" or \\"glottalized\\" consonants. While the nasals and glides are truly glottalized, the stops are tenuis , in contrast to the aspiration of the \\"plain\\" stops .Samuel E. Martin (1970) \\"Shodon: A Dialect of the Northern Ryukyus\\", in the Journal of the American Oriental Society, vol. 90, no. 1 (Jan-Mar), pp. 97-139. Kunigami is also notable for the presence of an phoneme separate from , which is believed to be the historical source of in most other Japonic languages; Kunigami instead has two different sources: Proto-Japonic or otherwise the zero initial in certain conditioning environments. Thus, for example, the Nakijin dialect of Kunigami has (light, a lamp, a sh≈çji),Acute accent indicate a high tone which is cognate with Japanese (light, a lamp); the Kunigami form is distinguished from its Japanese cognate by the initial , tenuis , and elision of Proto-Japonic *r before *i. The Kunigami language also makes distinctions in certain word pairs, such as Nakijin dialect (cloud) and (spider), which are more similar ( and ) in Japanese. Morphology One notable difference in the use of certain morphological markers between Kunigami language and Standard Japanese is the use of the form as an adverb in Kunigami: e.g. Nakijin dialect , which is equivalent to Standard Japanese to√≥k√∫ han√°rete ir√∫ (\\"It is far away\\"). In Standard Japanese, the form is used adverbially, while the form is used exclusively to derive abstract nouns of quality (\\"-ness\\" forms) from adjectival stems.

Known for his elegance and impeccable manners, he was, by the people who knew him, known as \\"the prince\\". Waszy≈Ñski was born as Mosze Waks into a Polish Jewish family as Micha≈Ç Waks in 1904 in Kowel, a small town in Volhynia (now in Ukraine), which at the time was part of Imperial Russia. As Germany occupied this part of Europe during World War I, he moved first to Warsaw and later to Berlin. As a young man he worked as an assistant director of the legendary German director F.W. Murnau. Upon his return to Poland he changed his name to Micha≈Ç Waszy≈Ñski and converted to Catholicism. In the 1930s Waszy≈Ñski became the most prolific film director in Poland, directing 37 of the 147 films made in Poland in that decade, nearly one out of four. Along with the popular films in Polish directed to a wide local audience, he directed an important film in Yiddish The Dybbuk, today a monument of the rich cultural life of East European Jewry before the Holocaust. At the beginning of World War II Waszy≈Ñski escaped from Warsaw, which was being bombed by German planes, to Bia≈Çystok. That city was taken in mid-September 1939 by the Germans, but within weeks, as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, the city was given to the Soviet Union and occupied by its army. Waszy≈Ñski began a new career as a theater director, first in Bia≈Çystok and later in Moscow. In the summer of 1941, after Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Waszy≈Ñski joined the newly formed Polish Army of general W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders (loyal to the Polish government in Exile in London) and subsequently was relocated to Persia (Iran), and later as a soldier of the 2nd Corps of the Polish Army to Egypt and Italy. As a member of the army film unit, he filmed the Battle of Monte Cassino, where the Polish Army suffered great losses, but helped to win the day. After World War II, he stayed in Italy, where he directed a Polish-language feature film about the Battle of Monte Cassino, and then three Italian films. Later in his career, Waszy≈Ñski worked as a producer for the major American studios in Italy and (primarily) Spain, credited as Michael Waszynski. His credits include The Quiet American (1958) (associate producer), El Cid (1961), and The Fall of the Roman Empire (film) (1964) (executive producer and associate producer). He died of a heart attack on 20 February 1965 in Madrid, and was buried in a ceremonious Catholic funeral in Rome.

It runs for from K. I. Sawyer to Manistique. The highway is part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour during a concurrency with M-28. M-94 crosses the Siphon Bridge in Manistique, unique for the fact that the bridge roadway is below water level. M-94 has been realigned several times. It has had its own roadway between the M-28 junctions in Munising and Shingleton. Other changes have flip-flopped M-94 with M-28 between Harvey and Munising and extended it across the former K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base. Route description Hiawatha National Forest road sign on M-28/M-94 in Alger County west of Shingleton M-94 begins at an intersection with M-553 and crosses the former K. I. Sawyer AFB. Then it overlaps US 41 for a little over a mile near Skandia. East of Skandia, M-94 runs through forest lands and serves the communities of Sundell and Rumely before entering Eben Junction. There M-94 intersects the southern section of H-01. Further east is Chatham where there are junctions with the northern section of H-01 and M-67. M-94 turns southerly briefly before returning to an east‚Äìwest direction to head to the community of Forest Lake and ultimately Munising. There M-94 joins a concurrency with M-28 and the Lake Superior Circle Tour from Munising to Shingleton. Until the turn at Shingleton, the route is more decidedly east‚Äìwest than north‚Äìsouth. Between Shingleton and Manistique, M-94 is more north‚Äìsouth. South of Shingleton, M-94 runs through forest lands as a part of the Great Manistique Swamp. Along the way are national forest campgrounds located near Steuben. South of Crooked Lake, M-94 curves to the east before turning almost due south to the Manistique area. In Manistique, M-94 enters town on North 5th St before turning to follow Deer Street and River Street. On River Street, the trunkline uses the Siphon Bridge to cross the Manistique River and then uses Elk and Maple streets before terminating at US 2 at Lakeshore Drive. =Siphon Bridge= In Manistique, M-94 crosses the Manistique River on the \\"Siphon Bridge\\". Built as a part of a raceway flume on the river, the water level actually used to be higher than the road surface. This produced a siphon effect, giving the bridge its nickname. The Manistique Pulp and Paper Company was organized in 1916 and needed a dam on the Manistique River to supply their mill. This dam would have needed to flood a large section of the city. The shallow river banks meant difficulties in any bridge construction. Instead of expensive dikes, a concrete tank was built lengthwise in the river bed. The sides of this tank provided man-made banks higher than the natural banks. The Michigan Works Progress Administration described the bridge as having, \\"concrete bulkheads, formed by the side spans of the bridge, [that] allow the mill to maintain the water level several feet above the roadbed.\\" The bridge acted as a siphon because the water level was above the roadway, and the structure has been featured in Ripley's Believe It or Not! History Bridge over the Chocolay River The December 1927 Michigan State Highway Department Official Highway Service Map shows M-94 routed from Au Train west to Munising and further along its current routing to Manistique. In 1928 or 1929, M-94 was rerouted to run along Munising-Van Meer-Shingleton Road (now H-58 and H-15) and southerly to Shingleton. This routing was abandoned on November 7, 1963. It was later extended westward to Harvey in 1939. In 1941, the portion of M-94 west from Munising to Harvey was made a part of M-28, and M-94 was extended along its current routing from Munising to US 41. M-94 was extended for the last time in 1998 over US 41 and through the old K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base to end at a newly designated M-553. In October 2016, heavy rainfall cause the culverts directing the Chocolay River under M-94 in West Branch Township to fail. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) started construction of a , concrete, single-span bridge at a cost of $1.8 million on March 6, 2017, and opened the structure to traffic on June 28 of the same year.

It was released as the second song on their 1982 album Signals. It became a top 20 hit, reaching number 19 on the Mainstream Rock charts. \\"The Analog Kid\\" is a moderately fast song, and was originally written in the key of A major. It is played in common time. Recording The song originates from when the band stayed at Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands in January 1982, travelling on a yacht that was named Orianda. Drummer and lyricist Neil Peart wrote the lyrics for the song at first as a companion piece to \\"Digital Man\\", a song that Rush had started working on in late 1981, and presented it to bassist Geddy Lee. Peart and Lee talked about what could be done with the lyrics in a musical sense. They eventually decided on the opposite on what the words may suggest, with Peart describing the track as \\"a very up-tempo rocker, with some kind of a dynamic contrast for the choruses\\". Peart said that the song was his first attempt at non-fiction, and that he \\"for the longest time [Peart] stepped into characters until I had my own confidence and technique to be able to step outside them as a writer.\\" In popular culture \\"The Analog Kid\\", along with \\"Digital Man\\" (another song from the album) served as the inspiration for the writer Troy Hickman to create the comic book heroes of the same names in the 2004 comic Common Grounds. Reception Greg Prato of AllMusic, in a review for the album, said that the song was an example that Rush did not forget to \\"rock out\\" after adding synthesizers to their sound. In 2016, Prog wrote that it was the 7th best Rush song from the 1980s. Classic Rock readers voted \\"The Analog Kid\\" the band's 24th best song.

Besides coordinating and facilitating dating activities offered by the private sector, it also serves to educate the public on singlehood issues. Other responsibilities of the SDN include providing the necessary infrastructure and support for the dating industry, as well as to ensure the professionalism of dating agencies through an accreditation council that was formed in 2007. SDN's role in the industry has not always been that of facilitating and accrediting. When it was first established in 1984 as SDU, it functioned on its own, organising activities for its members without the help of commercial agencies. It was only in 2006 that the then SDU decided on a major change in approach: it let the private sector be the main provider of matchmaking and dating services, focusing instead on accrediting and funding private dating agencies and projects. This was done in the hopes of creating a more vibrant dating scene and of allowing singles to have more options to interact with others of different educational levels. Initiatives A census conducted in 1980 revealed that a large number of highly educated women were still unmarried, despite being above 40 years of age. It was also noted that there was an inverse relationship between a person's educational level and the number of children he/she had. Dr Tony Tan‚Äîthen Minister of Finance and Trade and Industry‚Äîattributed this finding to 2 factors: firstly, the cultural attitude among local men, who preferred to marry women with lower educational qualifications than themselves; and secondly, the preference among female university graduates to marry men who were better educated or at least of the same educational level as themselves. The SDU was thus formed in January 1984 to provide opportunities for single men and women to interact socially. Another objective of the unit was to encourage public discussion about the perceived problem of the large number of better-educated women remaining unmarried. Since it was first established, SDU's target group was limited to university graduates. The government justified this elitist approach by announcing that they had identified graduates‚Äîand in particular the females among them‚Äîas a group which required assistance in terms of finding lifelong partners. According to the government, non-graduates did not seem to have any difficulty in finding partners. However, the Social Development Service (SDS) was set up a year after the SDU to promote marriages among non-graduates. On 28 January 2009, the SDU and SDS merged to become a single entity, tentatively named SDU-SDS, consolidating their respective resources and exposing their constituent members to the larger, merged database. It was renamed as Social Development Network or SDN on 16 October 2009. Prior to the founding of the SDU, a Great Marriage Debate had been raging. During a speech made at the National Day rally in 1983, then- Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew alleged that the phenomenon of graduates remaining single would result in a projected loss of about 400 talented people per year. This estimation was made on the basis that talent was not so much nurtured as it was conceived, as studies at that time had shown. Lee had also expressed worry that the dearth of children produced by graduate women would lead to the faltering of the economy and ultimately a decline in society. Although Lee had not explicitly stated that the SDU would be set up in response this problem, he had promised that tough measures would be taken by the government to curb the problem. The fact that the SDU was formed the following year has led many to perceive the debate to be the main reason behind the establishment of the unit and its exclusive focus. Public response Public reaction to the former SDU was initially that of disdain; graduate women were unhappy about their plight being addressed so prominently, while non-graduate women and their parents were upset at the government for dissuading graduate men from marrying them. In fact, there was an outcry by the public at large about the unfair use of taxpayers‚Äô money to subsidise leisure activities for graduates, especially since they already had a higher income. Some were also displeased about the fact that civil servants who were single were given three extra days of leave to go on SDU-organised cruises. Besides those who treated the SDU with contempt, there were others who simply did not take the SDU seriously. One popular joke that was conceived in the early days was that ‚ÄòSDU‚Äô also stood for ‚ÄòSingle, Desperate and Ugly‚Äô. Results and success rates =Within the SDU= Results in the beginning were slow and the effectiveness of the SDU was questioned by both the public and members of parliament. From the time it was established in January 1984 to March 1985, only 2 marriages had taken place as a result of the SDU's efforts. This was not proportionate to the amount that SDU had spent on its activities, which came to $294,411.32 at the time. However, marriage figures began to increase from there. Between March and July 1985, another 4 couples were married. Since then, the number of SDU marriages has increased over the years. By the end of the first decade, the number of marriages as a result of SDU activities averaged about 1,000 a year. In 2003, SDU reported a significant increase in marriage figures for its members over the years, from 2,789 in 1999 to 4,050 in 2003. Over the first 2 decades since the SDU was first set up, SDU reported that more than 33,000 members were married (This includes Singaporeans who would have married irrespective of SDU). =On the national level= Despite the promising numbers reported by SDU, statistics at the national level do not mirror the trends within the SDU. According to the Singapore Department of Statistics, there was only a slight increase in marriages from 22,561 in year 2000 to 22,992 in year 2005. In fact, for those aged 30‚Äì34, the proportion remaining single had increased significantly between 2000 and 2005, as more people chose to delay marriage. In 2005, among citizens aged 30‚Äì34, the proportion that was single was 37 per cent for males and 26 per cent for females. As for those in the age range of 40‚Äì44, the proportion single at 2005 remained high at 15‚Äì17 per cent for males and females collectively. The number of marriages has steadily increased over the years from 2004 (22,189) to 2009 (26,081) and crude marriage rate (per 1000 resident population) has been on the rise from 6.4 in 2007 to 6.6 in 2009. However, more singles are also marrying later. The mean age for first marriage has increased from 28.7 to 29.8 (males) and 26.2 to 27.5 (females) over the last 10 years. =Survey results= In addition to marriage and membership statistics, surveys are also conducted by the SDU from time to time to assess the effectiveness of the SDU, and its public education objective in particular. In mid 2006, 2,041 university undergraduates and polytechnic students were polled in an SDU survey on undergraduates' attitudes towards social interaction, dating and marriage. The data, which was collected during a series of face-to-face interviews, showed that, while nine out of ten would like to get married, only 35 per cent of them were certain about their intentions. Earlier in the same year, SDU had conducted another survey which assessed attitudes of singles in general towards courtship and marriage. The survey, which included a variety of age groups, showed that 81 per cent of the 1,800 respondents indicated that they would like to get married. Yet, 74 per cent of the singles also mentioned that achieving success in work and studies was their top priority. In the Survey on Singles‚Äô Attitudes towards Courtship and Marriage conducted by the Social Development Network (SDN) in 2009, about 80% of more than 1500 singles surveyed indicated their intention to get married. However, respondents also cited ‚Äúnot finding the right one or someone who met my expectations‚Äù as the top key reason for delaying marriage. Other top reasons cited included ‚Äúnot enough opportunities to socialize‚Äù and ‚Äúlack of time‚Äù as career and other commitments were viewed as more/equally important, or as milestones to be achieved in life before they would think about marriage. Activities and events In the beginning, activities that the former SDU organised included personal-effectiveness workshops, computer courses, barbecues, dancing lessons, cruises/tours to the Maldives, Club Mediterrannee and Japan. SDU's policy then was that part of the fees for courses would be sponsored by the unit, while the full costs had to be borne by participants for cruises. However, it was discovered that the costs of cruises were significantly below the market rates and that participants were granted leave by their companies for the duration of the cruise. Types of activities offered by SDU range from dating, wine & dine, self-enrichment, sports & recreation to travel and more. The range of activities offered has become much more extensive over the years. Self-enrichment activities consist mostly of dance lessons, though these span from Hip Hop to Exotic Dance to Ballroom Waltz. Other self-enrichment courses include wine appreciation, Pilates and baking classes. Overseas trips to many parts of Asia (such as China, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and Nepal) are offered under the Travel category and the length of tours ranges from one day to 18 days, catering to different budgets and interests. SDU members are entitled to a subsidised rate for most activities, regardless of the nature of the event. Since 2009, SDN has been working with different partners from the people, private and public sectors to create a broad array of opportunities for singles to meet and form meaningful relationships. Apart from collaborating with Government agencies under the Social Development Officers (SDO) Network to provide small interaction activities for single employees in the civil service, SDN also partners selected commercial and community organisations to facilitate larger- scale events for singles. Membership When SDU was first started, membership was free of charge and valid until the member registered his/her marriage, either at the Registry or under the Muslim law. Members paid only for the activities they registered for and even then, the costs were subsidised by the government. Many revisions have since been made to the various membership schemes, including an annual membership fee. From October 2009, all membership schemes were removed and SDN extended its benefits to all resident singles without any fees. Currently, singles aged 20 and above who are Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents can join the network's database to receive communications and information on dating, or register with www.sdn.sg as a user to enjoy its online services, such as the chat function, forum discussion and personal ads, or to access information on events and other resources on dating and relationship. Project Network Project Network is an initiative that was started by the SDN in 2003 to provide funding for programmes helmed by local universities that promote social skills or provide socialisation opportunities for undergraduates. In order for projects to qualify for funding, they must satisfy one of the following two conditions: # Opportunities for interaction between the two genders are maximised # Undergraduates are taught social networking skills for personal development The amount of funding that is provided depends on several factors, such as gender balance (the bare minimum being 60‚Äì40%), the originality of the programme, the degree of reach as well as the extent to which participants will benefit from the social interaction. As of 30 March 2007, the SDN had funded a total of about $275,000 worth of social activities. Through Project Network, SDN has helped to co-fund orientation camps and student activities organised by the 3 local universities to facilitate more gender-balanced social interaction opportunities on campus. Official student bodies may apply for the fund if they meet the criteria of the funding scheme, such as balanced gender ratio, meaningful interaction among opposite genders, etc. References * External links *SDN website *SDN accredited agencies *Ministry of Social and Family Development website Category:1984 establishments in Singapore Category:Organisations of the Singapore Government Category:Marriage, unions and partnerships in Singapore ","title":"Social Development Network"},{"id":"6669574","text":"The Cogswell Society is a social group founded in 1972 by employees of the Federal Trade Commission, whose office neighbors the landmark Temperance Fountain designed by Henry D.

Upon completion of his first term, President Theodore Roosevelt twice reappointed the chief justice for additional terms.Anderson, p. 308 =Governorship= After Governor George Curry submitted his resignation, President William H. Taft nominated Mills to become Governor of New Mexico Territory. According to Curry, Taft found the chief justice's judicial background and conservative outlook attractive and viewed the nominee as a potential governor or U.S. senator if the territory should achieve statehood. Mills accepted the offer on November 24, 1909. The new governor was sworn in on March 1, 1910 as per the terms of his predecessor's resignation.Prince, p. 216 Upon taking office, Mills began lobbying efforts aimed at achieving statehood for New Mexico. With the signing of the enabling act on June 20, 1910 his activities switched to preparations for statehood.Prince, p. 216-7 An election of representatives for a constitutional convention was called for September 6, with the convention to draw up a state constitution running from October 3 till November 21, 1910.Prince, p. 217 The resulting document lacked many progressive reforms of the days, such as women's suffrage, and Mills was left to defend the document until it was approved by President Taft in August 1911. Mills called for election of new state office holders in November 1911. New Mexico was admitted as a state on January 6, 1912 with Mills leaving office at noon on January 15, 1912 as William C.

It is located on the back of the forearm, just proximal to the hand. It is continuous with the palmar carpal ligament, which is located on the anterior side of the forearm. It is a strong, fibrous band, extending obliquely downward and medialward across the back of the wrist, and consisting of part of the deep fascia of the back of the forearm, strengthened by the addition of some transverse fibers. The extensor retinaculum is attached laterally to the lateral margin of the radius. However, it is not attached to the ulna, as the distance between these two bones varies with supination and pronation of the forearm. Instead the medial attachment is to the most medial of the carpal bones, the triquetrum (or triquetral bone) and pisiformis (or pisiform bone). The retinaculum is also attached in its passage across the wrist, to the ridges on the dorsal surface of the radius.  Histology of the retinaculum  Structurally, the retinaculum consists of three layers. The deepest layer, the gliding layer, consists of hyaluronic acid-secreting cells. In studies of cadaver specimens this layer was found to show isolated chondroid metaplasia, an abnormal change in tissue which leads to it resembling cartilage. The thick middle layer consists of interspersed elastin fibers, collagen bundles, and fibroblasts. The most superficial layer is made up of loose connective tissue which contains vascular channels. Combined these three layers create a smooth gliding surface as well as mechanically strong tissue which prevents tendon bowstringing. The extensor retinaculum of the foot has similar structure. Surgical uses  Studies conducted on the retinaculum have exhibited it to have several possible surgical treatments uses. A graft of the extensor retinaculum was shown to be useful in treating boxer's knuckle when direct repair of the damaged capsule is not possible. Because of their similarities in histological structure, studies also show the extensor retinaculum to be a reasonable biological replacement for reconstruction of a deficient annular pulley.

The band has released four studio albums, two EPs, and two split 7\\" albums, and consists of guitarists James Joyce and Justin Garcia, vocalist John Strachan, drummer Alex Hernandez, and bassist Adam Campbell. History The Funeral Pyre were formed in La Habra, California in 2001, originally as Envilent, and entered the underground extreme music scenes in both LA and Orange counties. They have gained acclaim amongst metal internet press outlets for its Swedish-style melody, ethereal keyboards, and blackened vocals. Several demos and an early EP were released under the band's former moniker, Envilent, until the independent release of the 2003 EP, October, when the band changed their name to The Funeral Pyre. A year later the band released its first full-length album, Immersed by the Flames of Mankind in 2004, and a merger between Oregon's Leech and The Funeral Pyre was released in 2006, with limited quantities as a split 7\\" called The First Book Of The Kings, released through Forest Moon Special Products. The band released their second full-length album The Nature of Betrayal on August 22, 2006, recorded at Ulug studios in Costa Mesa, California through Creator-Destructor Records, an independent California based recording studio. In a distribution deal with Prosthetic Records, The Nature of Betrayal was re-released on March 20, 2007, due to decent success on the internet. Recorded in January and February with producer John Haddad, Wounds was mixed by Erik Rutan and mastered by Alan Douches and was released on May 27, 2008. This was the first album to not feature long time keyboardist, Daniella Jones, who was released by the band for \\"musical differences\\", and was in turn replaced by a second guitarist, Justin Garcia. However, the band suffered another loss when Garcia left the band, but soon was replaced by Lanny Perelman, formally of Cerberus, who, left the band as well. The band has more closely embraced black metal entirely with the release of Wounds, as well as later works. The band released December, mixed and mastered by Ryan Butler at Arcane Digital Recording during December 2008, a limited EP distributed by Creator-Destructor on March 10, 2009. A 7\\" split with Landmine Marathon was released shortly after through Forest Moon Special Products, showcasing a cover of short lived German act, ACME's song \\"Attempt\\", as well as another original song. The band's fourth studio album, Vultures at Dawn was released June 8, 2010, through Prosthetic Records. It was generally well received, much of the praise coming from the more experimental songs \\"Monolith\\" and \\"To Watch the Earth Rot\\", both being further from their normal genre of songwriting.

It is divided into three long essays, \\"Atchafalaya\\", \\"Cooling the Lava\\", and \\"Los Angeles Against the Mountains\\". The Army Corps of Engineers prevents the Mississippi River from changing course, but has had less success in controlling flooding along the river. The residents of Heimaey, Iceland saved their harbor by spraying water on the volcanic lava flow threatening to close it off. The residents of the San Gabriel Mountains have had little success in preventing debris flows from destroying their houses. Background In 1980, McPhee traveled with his daughter on a canoe trip on the Atchafalaya River due to her fascination with the novelist Walker Percy. He had conversations with natives about the efforts made by the Army Corps of Engineers in monitoring riverflow in the area. In Vicksburg, Mississippi, a man recommended to McPhee that he research the efforts being undergone to control the debris sliding down from mountains into Los Angeles. When he visited California, a geologist informed him about lava in Iceland. The book's title is derived from a sign on the engineering building at the University of Wyoming. Though he believes nature will win, \\"my book is not an editorial,\\" McPhee said. \\"It is a description of people defying nature. They may have no choice.\\" Like all of McPhee's books, The Control of Nature started out as an outline that he proceeded to fill in. Synopsis The book begins by describing how the Atchafalaya River drains 30 percent of the Mississippi River at its source 300 miles upriver from New Orleans. Thanks to its steeper gradient and more direct route, the Atchafalaya seeks to change the course of the Mississippi as has happened in its long geological history. Due to the Mississippi's vital importance to industry, the Army Corps of Engineers constructed a control structure at the Atchafalaya's source to prevent this from occurring and to maintain the 30 percent drainage. McPhee explains how Morgan City, Louisiana would be destroyed if the river's banks increase. Three million cubic feet of water would inundate the town in the case of a hundred-year flood, though the Corps of Engineers has been trying its hardest to build a more stable flood structure. Publication and reception All three essays that comprise \\"The Control of Nature\\" originally appeared in The New Yorker. After its publication as a book in 1989, The Control of Nature was McPhee's second-best selling book, after Coming into the Country. It received generally positive reviews from book critics. Los Angeles Times critic Jack Miles praised McPhee's \\"knack of presenting even the most ordinary folks in their best, most ingenious moments.\\" He liked \\"Los Angeles Against the Mountains\\" the most out of the three essays. He enjoyed how McPhee explained scientific and engineering concepts so a layperson could understand them. Martin Ruess, writing in Technology and Culture, thought that McPhee should have added more interpretation to his descriptions. \\"McPhee has the poet's knack for the telling point, the metaphor that incisively leads to greater understanding,\\" Ruess wrote. He believed that McPhee underestimated humanity's ability to exert its control on natural settings, since the U.S. infrastructure effectively did this. Ruess concluded that \\"McPhee's reports from the battlefronts are not as valuable as their implicit message that the control of nature is not nearly as important as knowing one's place in it.\\" References Category:1989 non-fiction books Category:1989 in the environment Category:Environmental engineering Category:Environmental non- fiction books Category:Vestmannaeyjar Category:Books by John McPhee ","title":"The Control of Nature"},{"id":"6669641","text":"Andrei Yurievich Sokolov (; born 20 March 1963, in Vorkuta, Komi ASSR, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union) is a chess Grandmaster of Russian origin, now living in France. He was one of the leading players in the world in the late 1980s. Formative years He learned the game from his father Yuri, a Soviet Army officer and Candidate Master. At just 6 years of age, inspiration arrived in the form of a book of Alekhine's games. At age 12, he attended one of the many chess schools that existed in and around Moscow and he occasionally frequented the legendary Pioneer Palace. Some major preparation followed in the years 1975-1982, mainly under the tutelage of renowned coach, Vladimir Yurkov. Alexei Suetin attended the same sports club (Trud) and as senior Moscow coach, observed the youngster's progress closely. Sokolov won the minor championship of Moscow in 1981, but fared less well in the major Open Championship a short while later. He had yet to learn the subtleties of positional play, but already there was much to admire. Suetin described him as \\"a practical-minded chess player ... most concentrated, deprived of any impulsiveness and very persistent in attaining his aims.\\" Career By 1982, the groundwork was paying off as he went on to win the Junior World Chess Championship, held in Copenhagen. A strong entry had included Joel Benjamin, Ivan Morovic, Nigel Short and Niaz Murshed. At this time Sokolov was an International Master with an Elo rating of 2450. At that time FIDE automatically awarded the International Master title to the winner of the Junior Championship. (Later the rule would be changed to make the Junior Champion a grandmaster.) His Grandmaster status was achieved in 1984, a year of outstanding achievement for the 21-year-old as he rocked the chess world by winning the Championship of the Soviet Union at his first attempt. Impressive was his penultimate round effort against ex-champion Beliavsky who, playing white, quickly mounted a ferocious attack against Black's king position. It was however already a quality of Sokolov that he remain ice-cool under pressure. He not only repelled the attack, but launched a counter-offensive of his own and won a crucial game. It was also a year that saw him finish a creditable second at the strong Novi Sad tournament and advance his Elo rating up to 2550. Representing the Soviet Union at the Thessaloniki 1984 and Dubai 1986 Chess Olympiads, his performances were assured, scoring close to 67% on each occasion and contributing to two team gold medals. Sokolov's career highlight was the 1987 World Championship cycle, where he reached the final of the Candidates Tournament. After qualifying through the Interzonal and round-robin Candidates Tournament, he won matches against Rafael Vaganian (6‚Äì2), and Artur Yusupov (7¬Ω‚Äì6¬Ω). However, in the final however he lost to Anatoly Karpov, 3¬Ω‚Äì7¬Ω. Having beaten Karpov at Bugojno 1986, he felt his pre-match mood had been overly optimistic and described his defeat as \\"very severe\\". Nevertheless, in 1987/88 his rating peaked at 2645 and he was listed as the third strongest player in the world behind Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov. He even went on to defeat Karpov again at Belfort 1988, a World Cup event. However, he was unable to repeat his success in later World Championship cycles. In the 1988 Candidates' matches, he unexpectedly lost his first-round match to Kevin Spraggett. In the 1990 Interzonal he scored 6¬Ω out of 13, failing to qualified for the Candidates. Exceptionally, in 1990, he scored a resurgent win at the Moscow Open (finishing ahead of Mikhail Tal, Rafael Vaganian, Alexey Vyzmanavin and Mikhail Krasenkov, among others). This preceded a period of lesser chess activity. Move to France He moved to France and acquired French nationality in 2000. While he has not yet won the French Championship, he came close in 2003 when he tied first with Jo√´l Lautier and √âtienne Bacrot, losing out to Bacrot in a playoff. In 2005, he finished equal second with 14-year-old Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, behind Lautier. There have been two appearances for the French Olympiad team (in 2002 and 2006) and he further represented his adopted country at the European Team Chess Championship of 2003, held in Plovdiv. Notable games As a participant of the 1988‚Äì89 World Cup series, he competed at Brussels, Belfort, Reykjav√≠k and Rotterdam, finishing an overall 11th from a field of 25 and winning a combined prize fund of $36,584. In the following game, played during the Brussels leg in 1989, Sokolov sacrifices a piece and then the exchange in order to create a powerful double threat of two passed pawns on one wing and a attack on the other. :Sokolov vs. Lajos Portischhttps://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1114224 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0 9.h3 Bb7 10.d4 Re8 11.Ng5 Rf8 12.Nf3 Re8 13.Nbd2 Bf8 14.a4 h6 15.Bc2 exd4 16.cxd4 Nb4 17.Bb1 c5 18.d5 Nd7 19.Ra3 c4 20.Nd4 Ne5 21.axb5 Qb6 22.Nxc4 Nxc4 23.Rg3 Bc8 24.b3 Ne5 25.Be3 Ng6 26.f4 Qd8 27.f5 Ne5 28.Qd2 a5 29.Bxh6 Qh4 30.Kh2 Bd7 31.Bg5 Qh5 32.Rf1 g6 33.Nc6 Bxc6 34.dxc6 Rab8 35.fxg6 fxg6 36.c7 Rbc8 37.b6 Qh7 38.Rxf8+ Rxf8 39.Qxd6 Nbc6 40.Bf6 Rxf6 41.Qxf6 Qd7 42.b7 References *Chess Magazine ‚Äì Christmas 1985, pg.255, Alexei Suetin article. * *Portrait of a Grandmaster.

These martyrs are mentioned already in the Martyrologium Hieronymianum (ed. G. B. de Rossi-L.

The other is said to have suffered with a companion, Carponius, in Diocletian's persecution circa 304 AD (cf. \\"Bibliotheca hagiographica latina\\", II, 1070; Acta SS., VI August, 18-19). # On 25 September, several martyrs at Damascus, among them one named Rufus. # On 7 November, a Rufus of Metz, who is said to have been Bishop of Metz; his history, however, is legendary.

St. Mark says in his Gospel (xv, 21) that Simon of Cyrene was the father of Rufus, and as Mark wrote his Gospel for the Roman Christians, this Rufus is probably the same as the one to whom Paul sent a salutation [cf.

It is an adaptation of the novel Japan Sinks and a remake of its earlier film adaptation Tidal Wave, both released in the year 1973. It stars Tsuyoshi Kusanagi, Kou Shibasaki, Etsushi Toyokawa and Mao Daichi. The film was released on July 15, 2006. The film is also known under the title Doomsday: The Sinking of Japan. It was parodied in Nihon Igai Zenbu Chinbotsu (\\"World Sinks Except Japan\\"). Synopsis Submersible pilot Toshio Onodera wakes up pinned inside his car in Numazu after an earthquake wreaks havoc in the city and nearby Suruga Bay. As an aftershock triggers an explosion, a rescue helicopter led by Reiko Abe saves him and a young girl named Misaki. In Tokyo, geologists and volcanologists around the world become concerned about Japan; one predicts that the archipelagic nation will sink within 40 years. Japanese geoscientist Yusuke Tadokoro doubts the prediction and analyzes rocks in Kyushu, Hokkaido and Mangaia of the Cook Islands, where he hypothesizes that the rock came from the ancient continent of Japan after it split from Pangaea thousands of years ago. Tadokoro realizes Japan will sink in 338.54 days (which is less than a year) instead of the original 40-year estimate. Tadokoro reports his theory to the Cabinet, recommending immediate action, but none of the ministers are convinced. He is ejected from the chamber, but not before he angrily explains to everyone how Japan will sink, with the destruction of the Fossa Magna and the eruption of Mount Fuji as the climax. The next day, Prime Minister Yamamoto goes to China to try to make arrangements for an impending resettlement of Japanese refugees and appoints a close colleague, Saori Takamori, as disaster management minister. Tadokoro's predictions come to light: in Hokkaido, the Daisetsuzan Volcanic Group bursts along with Mount Aso. The eruption destroys Yamamoto's plane while Kumamoto City residents flee in terror as the city is destroyed from lava bombs and pyroclastic flows. Takamori panics when she finds out about the Prime Minister's death. Volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and tsunamis rock Japan, starting from southwest to northeast, affecting a large-scale evacuation now underway. As the economy collapses, the government declares a state of emergency but acting Prime Minister Kyosuke Nozaki announces that the nation will take five years to sink. Because of Nozaki's indifference to the situation, Takamori runs to Tadokoro's laboratory, where he proposes using experimental N2 explosives drilled into the crust to separate the land from the megalith pulling it down. The minister, who is actually Tadokoro's ex-wife, calls for help from drillships around the world. Meanwhile, Hakodate City has been destroyed by a huge tsunami, causing the inhabitants to flee in terror as the tsunami destroys the Goryokaku and many other buildings and structures. Misaki, Reiko's family and the rest of Tokyo's population are evacuated. Onodera confesses his true feelings for Reiko and wants her to go to England with him. An aftershock finally destroys the Kinki region and many Tokyo evacuees are killed by a massive landslide, with people falling into the valley below as Misaki is rescued by Reiko's family and they witness a crowded bridge collapse. The next day, Tokyo is destroyed by a large earthquake, which triggered a tsunami which destroyed the special wards of Shibuya, Minato and Chiyoda. The earthquake, which struck Tokyo, has also struck a sunken Osaka, Nagano (engulfed by massive lava flows), Nagoya (destroyed by another earthquake) and Sendai (inundated by a series of tsunamis). Yuki Tatsuya, Onodera's fellow submersible pilot, dies in an attempt to activate the warheads from a central module. Onodera takes his place using an old submersible brought out of museum storage and spends a night with Reiko before the operation. Although he locates the detonation module, a sudden landslide damages his submersible to the point that it is running on emergency power. Onodera uses all the remaining power to move into position and install the detonator. Mount Fuji's initiation to eruption is being witnessed by volcanologists. Onodera succeeds in his task and calmly awaits his death. The warheads explode, creating a chain of explosions along the seafloor, effectively fracturing the tectonic plates and saving Japan. The success of the mission reaches Takamori aboard the amphibious carrier Shimokita, which has been converted as the Japanese government's temporary headquarters. Although she recommends that Nozaki address the refugees, her colleagues want her to do it instead, given her leadership during the crisis. She announces that people can finally return and holds a moment of silence in honor of Tatsuya and Onodera's sacrifice. In Fukushima Prefecture, Toshio's mother, who wanted to remain at her house until the end, is overjoyed when she sees birds return - a sign of his success. Reiko rescues her family as they look towards a bright sunrise, before the credits start rolling, showing a drastically altered Japan.

It would be his final film role before dying on September 24, 2006. Gundam creator Yoshiyuki Tomino appeared as one of the refugees boarding a transport plane and as a Buddhist monk in Kyoto praying over a shipment of national treasures being sent abroad. Comparison with Tidal Wave * The 2006 film ends with Japan being saved after a series of non-nuclear ultra-high explosive detonations breaks its tectonic plates from dragging the entire country down. The original 1973 movie's ending is more similar to the book - Japan does sink in the end and Mount Fuji violently erupts. * In the original movie, Reiko Abe is a single woman in search of a husband. The 2006 film recasts the character as a member of Tokyo's Hyper-Rescue Squad. Both versions of Reiko Abe survive by the end of the film, with the 2006 Reiko being able to save her family while the 1973 version successfully escapes Japan and is last seen aboard a refugee train passing through an unknown snow-capped country. Abe's fate in the book is left unknown after Mount Fuji destructively erupts near her as she calls Toshio and asks him to meet in Geneva. * In the original 1973 film, Toshio Onodera makes it out and is last seen riding a refugee train passing through a desert. Onodera dies in the 2006 film. * In the original 1973 film, Dr. Tadokoro stays behind in Japan to witness the end while the 2006 version of him successfully oversees the drilling operation that saves the nation. * In the original 1973 film, Prime Minister Yamamoto is one of the last evacuees from Japan while the 2006 version of the premier dies while flying to China to arrange aid for refugees. * The 2006 version of the film does not include Mr. Watari, a wise old man giving counsel to Tadokoro in the 1973 film. * The 1973 version of Dr. Tadokoro leads a government disaster-response group called D1, which accurately predicts the breakup of Japan. The 2006 version of the scientist is first discredited by the government despite presenting his research before the prime minister accepts the situation and establishes D1 (with Tadokoro temporarily out of the picture). The D1 team is based aboard a ship. The 1973 Tadokoro is apparently single while the 2006 Tadokoro has been divorced for 20 years. * The opening credits of the original 1973 film depicts scenes of an overcrowded Japan while the introduction of the 2006 film features various scenes of everyday Japanese life as well as wide shots of several locations in Japan. * The Wadatsumi 6500 in the 2006 film is based on the real-life Shinkai 6500 submersible. The remake pays homage to the 1973 film through the appearance of its older brother, the Wadatsumi 1, now called the Wadatsumi 2000. Releases =Home media= Prior to the release of the film, TBS released The Encyclopedia of Sinking of Japan, a special one-hour DVD featuring interviews with the cast and crew. A \\"Standard Version\\" was released on January 19, 2007. =Scale models= Takara Tomy released two batches of gashapon miniatures depicting various vehicles from the film in August 2006. The company followed it up in January 2007 with a 1/700 pre-assembled model of the Shimokita, which was released under its Microworld DX line. Critical reception The film garnered mixed reviews. Derek Elley of Variety lauded the visual effects, but regarded the drama elements as thin. Nix of Beyond Hollywood.com noted the ending as akin to Bruce Willis' character's sacrifice in Armageddon and the lines of some characters are practically the same as in Western disaster movies. Mark Schilling, a film reviewer for the Japan Times, stated the movie was all business in terms of the Hollywood-style effects graphically showing the devastation. He also took notice of Shibasaki's casting as Reiko Abe and the short conversation scenes as different from the 1973 movie, plus the \\"soft nationalism\\" of some characters opting to die in the chaos rather than leave the country.

The story is told by a Roman Officer called Publius Varrus, who is an expert blacksmith as well as a soldier. In the early fifth century, amid the violent struggles between the people of Britain and the invading Saxons, Picts and Scots, he and his former General, Caius Britannicus, forge the government and military system that will become known as the Round Table, and initiate a chain of events that will lead to the coronation of the High King known as Arthur. Plot summary ;Invasion: The book begins with Publius Varrus laying its framework: he is retelling his history and the history of the Roman withdrawal from Britain. He then begins by talking about an ambush by Celts where he and Caius Britannicus are injured. While thinking about his time spent with Britannicus recovering from these injuries, his thoughts lead to their meeting: Britannicus had been a captive of Berbers and Varrus freed him from them. After this encounter Varrus recalls how he and Britannicus traveled together to Britain to become primus pilus and legate, respectively, of Legion XX Valeria Victrix's Second Millarian Cohort. While they are in command of this unit, Hadrian's wall is overcome by a horde of Picts and other Celtic Tribes. The unit spends a year and a half fighting their way back to Roman Controlled Britain. Outside of Londinium they encounter a legion from the army of Theodosius. ;Colchester: After Varrus recovers from his injuries, he returns to Colchester, the location of his birth. When he returns he finds that his boyhood friend, and his grandfather's helper, Equus had ensured that his grandfather's smithy was not devoid of tools. Varrus begins to run the business again, striking deals with Cuno, Equus's brother in law. Varrus also gains several contracts with the local legion, because his swords use a higher quality of iron than the other local suppliers. Britannicus visits the Colchester legion and finds Varrus. While they are attending a military party, Britannicus proposes that he may create a colony similar to the Bagaudae's colonies in Gaul. After a visit when Varrus explains his grandfather's use of skystone metal to create the hardest sword and dagger in existence, Varrus and Plautus discover a conspiracy by family enemies of Britannicus, the Senecas. Another encounter with the Senecas follows several years later as Varrus and Plautus interfere with the youngest of the Seneca brothers. There encounters ends with Varrus beating the brother up and carving a V into his chest. The attack leads to a massive manhunt by the military because the youngest Seneca had connections with the emperor and the military hierarchy. Because of the persistent nature of this search and a conviction that the eldest brother, Primus, would eventually figure out who his brother's attacker was, Varrus flees Colchester. First heading to Verulamium, he beds Equus's sister, Pheobe who had previously bedded him for the first time since his injury. From there he leaves for Aquae Sulis, where Britannicus owns a villa. ;Westering: On the road to Aquae Sulis, Varrus encounters several bandits who attempt to murder him. He later, after another assassination attempt, finds out that these men had been hired by the Senecas. He finally arrives in Aquae Sulis and encounters Britannicus's brother-in-law Quintus Varo. Varo invites Varrus to his villa. At the villa, Varrus meets Caius Britannicus's sister Luceiia. Also while at the villa Varrus encounters a Welsh hunchback Cymric. Varrus demonstrates the African bow which his grandfather had left in his collection of weapons. Luceiia and Varrus return to the Britannicus villa. While there Luceiia introduces him to a druid who has knowledge of meteor shower that coincides with when Varrus the Elder discovered his skystone. The local people had called this the return of dragons, a local myth that had revolved around covert smelting and metal working by the Pendragons, a local tribe. The druid leads Luceiia and Varrus to the location where a number of cattle had been killed during that same night. There they find impact craters and a lake unknown to the druid. On a return trip from the site, the party gets caught in the dark during a downpour. The druid leads them to a hamlet where they take shelter in a cottage. While there Luceiia and Varrus express a growing interest in each other and agree to marry each other. ;The Dragon's Nest: Varrus finds seven sky stones in the valley, all marked by donut-shaped impact craters. He digs all of them up but they are all small, and Varrus does not think that these are large enough for the cataclysm that happened to the cattle. Meanwhile, Caius Britannicus returns to the villa. Upon his arrival he expresses his approval of Varrus and Luceiia's wedding, invitations are sent out and a number of individual soon begin arriving, among which is Equus with Varrus's smithing materials from Colchester. Also among the arrivals is Bishop Alric who, along with a military friend Atonious Cicero, tell Varrus of Pheobe's death by the hands of Caesarius Seneca, the youngest Seneca. The wedding is a jolly event despite Varrus' grief over Pheobe. A large group of friends stay at the villa for several weeks. Soon after the wedding Britannicus's friends, Tera and Firma, bring news that they lost their trading fleet to pirates. This news shakes the men of the group and they spend a long night discussing Brittanicus's proposition of a military colony. They all agree to begin recruiting in the colony and invest their livelihoods in the purchase of the villas surrounding Caius's and Varo's. Varrus is also able to discover the main part of the meteor, which is buried under the bed of a lake in the valley. By employing a handful of military engineers, Varrus drains the lake and retrieves the stone. ;The Dragon's Breath: While visiting Aquae Sulis Varrus encounters Quinctilius Nesca, a cousin of the Senecas. Varrus escapes with the help of a trader who had been hoodwinked by Nesca and by killing two of Nesca's guards. The man mysteriously dies during Varrus's escape. While he escapes, Varrus also learns that Seneca had returned to Britain. Varrus places him under surveillance and soon hatches a plot which he carries through to kill Seneca. Meanwhile, agents of the King of the Pendragon clan, Ullic, approaches Britannicus and entreats him for a meeting between the two leaders. They meet and after some vocal sparring the two agree to a protective alliance between the two regional powers as Britons. Soon after Bishop Alaric passes through the region again, telling the Colonists, they now called themselves such, that Frankish cavalry was now running rampant in parts of the empire, and that the political tensions were rising. Also Alaric brings news of Caius's son Picus, who was now aligned with the Roman emperor in Constantinople and the a new military commander Stilicho who favored the use of heavy cavalry. In the final chapter, Varrus reveals that he was able to smelt his skystone and casts a statue of the Celtic goddess Coventina who Varrus names The Lady of the Lake. Characters *Publius Varrus- a Roman soldier whose exploits have earned him the rank of primus pilus in the Valeria Victrix or the XX Legion of the Roman Army. Though initially he was stationed on the North African coast, he was given permission to return to Britain, the land of his birth. His grandfather, Varrus the Elder, taught his namesake about all the intricacies of being a master smith. *Caius Britannicus- also a native of Britain and commander of a division Valeria Victrix. He is an upper class Roman and Varrus's commanding officer. *Equus- Boyhood friend of Varrus and business partner in the new forge. *Plautus- a senior centurion stationed in the fort near Colchester. He and Varrus had been friends while they were stationed at a post in Africa and renewed their friendship when they meet in Colchester. *Bishop Alaric- A Christian bishop who is unhappy with the church's and Rome's ostentatious livelihoods. He tries to incorporate the Celtic artistic traditions, such as the Celtic knot, into Christian symbolism in order to make Christianity more accessible to the local Britons. He commissions Varrus to make silver crosses in this style. *Quintus Varo- a neighboring farmer, and close friend of the Brittanicus family. *Luceiia Britannicus- the sister of Caius Britannicus. She is portrayed by Varo as being extremely manly in temperament, however, Varrus soon finds out she is gorgeous. She, however, has taken on a more independent temperament because she has lost two husbands, so has had to manage her life as well as Caius's estates Style Instead of using proper Latin names for terminology, Whyte anglicizes many of the terms. For example, cohors milliaria is consistently termed a Milliarian Cohort. The text takes the form of an autobiographic memoir written as the information appears in the mind of Varrus not as it appears chronologically. In the first book the time jumps from the present to the time when Britannicus and Varrus are injured, to when they met in Africa, back to the present, to retelling the Celtic breach of Hadrian's wall, back to the time when they were injured, back to the present. Because of this, often conversation and events will be glossed, while at other times the use of dialogue is common. Each of the first three books of the novel involves an erotic encounter between Varrus and a sister of one of his friends.  Reception  A review in the Fantasy Book Review, described the novel as one of the \\"one of the potentially better explanations for the historical fact [and] one of the finest Arthurian historical series available\\". Reception of the novel in Kirkus reviews was positive calling the novle \\"an earnestly heroic tale\\" with \\"old-timey manly sentiments, some battle grue, info about smelting iron, and a modestly clever Arthurian-linked gimmick\\". A review in FantasyLiterature.com was a mixed, disappointedly describing the novel as \\"concerned with reflection, consideration and dialogue\\".

It consists of the Central Library, Claremont Branch, North Branch, West Branch, Tarea Hill Pittman South Branchhttps://www.berkeleypubliclibrary.org/locations/tarea-hall-pittman- south-branch‚Äîand the Tool Lending Library, which is one of the nation's first such libraries. History Berkeley Public Library opened in 1893 on Shattuck Avenue with 264 books. In 1905, the library moved to a new brick building on Shattuck Avenue at 2090 Kittredge Street. The new library was funded by Andrew Carnegie and built on land donated by Rosa M. Shattuck, the widow of Francis K. Shattuck. Immediately following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the resulting population surge from across the Bay, the library opened four other branches around Berkeley. In 1930, the library was demolished and a new design from architect James W. Plachek was approved. Construction of the new building began in 1931. The new central library opened in 1934, where it remains. It was renovated and reopened in 2002. In 2011, Berkeley Public Library began a series of renovations and expansions of its four neighborhood branches. It completed renovation of the Claremont and North Branches in 2012, and the South Branch and Tool Lending Library in May 2013. On December 14, 2013, the West Branch library reopened, revealing the $7.5 million project. During construction, a bookmobile called the Branch Van parked near each location to conduct basic transactions and provide access to library collections in the local neighborhoods. On July 1, 2018, Berkeley Public Library eliminated overdue fines for teen and adult books, CDs, DVDs, and magazines returned past their due date (children's materials were already fine-free). Also in 2018, Berkeley Public Library instituted the Easy Access Card, a library card available to persons without a fixed address. The Easy Access card offers access to the Library's electronic resources as well as limited checkouts of books and other materials. Technology All Berkeley Public Library branches have self-checkout machines. Patrons can use these to check out materials themselves by putting scanning the items and their library card. This checkout method works for all media‚Äîbooks, CDs, DVDs, etc.‚Äîand provides the patron with a receipt for the items. All branches still also offer checkout from library staff at circulation desks. Patrons can also request and renew books over the Internet from their homes, or over the telephone. Tool lending library The Tool Lending Library opened in 1979, and is one of the nation's first such libraries.One in Ohio opened in 1976. It is located at the South Branch. To borrow tools, patrons must be over the age of 18 and be residents or property owners of the city of Berkeley. Tool Lending Library offerings include basic hand tools, light power tools, and equipment: screwdrivers, various hammers, drills, biscuit jointers, string trimmers (\\"weed wackers\\") shovels, ladders, concrete mixers‚Äîand free advice. Late fees are $1, $5 or $10 per day, depending on the item. Lending times are seven days for manual items, and two days for power tools.

Matthew Bogdanos about the quest to recover over a thousand lost artifacts from the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad after the country's counter-invasion.  Themes  = Story of tracking down stolen objects = Much of the book is an accounting of how his unit set up camp in the library of the Iraq museum in April 2003 and tried to recover lost artifacts. He developed relationships with museum staff, and, drawing on his knowledge of ancient civilizations, as well as his knowledge of police work, having been a criminal prosecutor in New York for many years, tells how he and the team were able to recover a huge amount of priceless antiquities which had been looted from the museum in the past days, and even years. = Analyze the idea that the US allowed museum looting while protecting the oil ministry = He goes into great detail about the theme that the US let the museum be looted while it protected the oil ministry... a version of events that was widely reported. Bogdanos goes into great detail about why this story is not very accurate. First there are basic differences in the two sites. The oil ministry was a single building, which was bombed and had no occupants by the time US troops arrived. The museum, on the other hand, was an compound, full of various buildings, full of Iraqi army troops, fortified with sniper and gun positions, when a small group of Americans was first sent to check it out. The only way to have 'protected' the museum at that point in time, initially, would have been to attack it, and drive out the Iraqi army .... destroying the museum in a horrific firefight. This is roughly Bogdanos' argument. After this, there is a small window when the US failed to protect the museum, something he says was caused by planners not thinking that the museum would be looted. . . . they figured the looters would go after symbols of the Ba'ath party, like palaces. But the US finally did get there... Bogdanos had managed to find a sympathetic person in the military brass, thanks in part to press coverage, who supported his mission, despite opposition from many people in the military, and eventually, also despite a lack of interest or caring on the part of many civilian bureaucrats, even from the UN. = Analyze the state of the global illegal antiquities trade = A great deal of the end of the book is spent discussing and analyzing the problems of stopping the illegal trade in antiquities. He talks about how the problem is not just smugglers, it goes into the dealers, the brokers, the buyers, the historians and professors who authenticate stolen antiquities for buyers, museum staffs, and even governments that look the other way, while collecting import tariffs. Another problem is lack of support for law enforcement involvement in the problem. He points out that many governments have donated millions of dollars to the museum, but very little money has been given to the investigative work needed to track down and recover stolen antiquities that belong in the museum. Interpol, the FBI, and other agencies that could do the work have very few people assigned to the task, and those people have almost no budget to work with. He talks about his efforts to 'bridge the gap' between law enforcement culture and academic culture, and some of his successes. He also lays out a plan for how he would reform the system... One part of his plan includes having a single binding agreement, somewhat like the ABA code, that standardizes what constitutes 'legal' provenance for antiquities, to be used amongst archaeologists, collectors, dealers, museums, academics, law enforcement, customs, etc. = Reviews and press = * ‚ÄúMarine Col.

The story concerns the arrival of a young girl from Colombia at Saint Augustine's, a Roman Catholic school for boys located near Paris, and her effect on the young men there, particularly on a bookish and solitary student, Joanny L√©niot.

It was based upon the screenplay for the film The Saint, which in turn was loosely based upon the character Simon Templar, created by Leslie Charteris. Val Kilmer portrayed Templar and is pictured on the book's front cover. This was the first book featuring Templar since Salvage for the Saint ended the original series of books (which began in 1928) in 1983. It is also the first Saint story to be published since Charteris' death in 1993 and the first to not be published by either Hodder & Stoughton (UK) or The Crime Club (US). Barer wrote the book based upon the screenplay by Jonathan Hensleigh and Wesley Strick. Barer himself is a longtime fan of the Saint books and in 1993 had published a comprehensive study on the many literary, radio, and television stories featuring the character of Simon Templar. Barer uses as a framing sequence around his historical work then-current plans to launch a new film series based upon the Saint; these plans ultimately failed and the 1997 film resulted. The film only loosely adapted the Simon Templar character, making many wholesale changes to the concept of The Saint and Templar; Barer nonetheless incorporated elements from Charteris into his manuscript, including characters from past Saint books such as Roger Conway. Barer would go on to write an original Saint novel (more closely related to the character) entitled Capture the Saint, which was also published in 1997.

Running from Kingsford to near Champion in Humboldt Township, it is the main connection between Iron Mountain and Marquette along with US 41. M-95 was previously designated as M-45. The number was switched when US 45 was designated in Michigan. The trunkline incorporates a portion of the former M-12 which became US 2\\\\. A section of the highway near Republic was turned over to Marquette County during a rerouting of the highway in the 1940s, becoming County Road 601. Route description Starting on a bridge across the Menominee River, M-95 runs north along Carpenter Avenue in Kingsford. It turns east along Ludington Street in Iron Mountain and joins the US 2/US 141 concurrency out of town to the north, following Stephenson Avenue. Near the state line northwest of Iron Mountain, M-95 turns northward as a solo route through northern Dickinson County. There is a concurrency with M-69 from Randville to Sagola. Randville is just south of the junction with M-69 where the mining settlement formed because of the nearby Groveland Mine and was a station on the Milwaukee and Northern Railroad in 1880. A post office was in operation in Randville from 1891 until 1932. Channing. The Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad's EMD F7 #600 can be seen to the right. Near Sagola is a mill owned by Louisiana- Pacific that makes oriented strand board. The surrounding forest lands near the highway provide trees for the mill. Sagola was formed, when in about 1885, five Chicago men formed the Sagola Lumber Company to harvest pine timber in the area. The name was derived from the local Indian word for \\"welcome\\". A post office was first established there in 1889. North of Sagola is the community of Channing which began as a railroad junction called \\"Fort Siding\\". In 1892, a post office was established named Channing, after John Parke Channing, a mining engineer who surveyed the area. M-95 crosses the Michigamme River at the Marquette County line. It is here that M-95 also crosses over from the Central Time Zone to the Eastern Time Zone at the county line south of Witch Lake. From there it bypasses Republic and the former Republic Mine Complex to the west. Republic is divided into two smaller communities of North Republic and South Republic by the mine complex. Known for its sandy beachfront along the Michigamme River west of downtown North Republic, the beach is located just upstream of the Republic Dam. In South Republic is a roadside park maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) that provides a picnic area and canoe access to the river. M-95 comes to an end north of a railroad crossing at an intersection with US 41/M-28 named \\"Koski's Korner\\". History From its inception until 1934, M-95 held the M-45 designation. It was renumbered to avoid confusion with the then new US 45 designation in the Upper Peninsula. The original M-95 was an access route to Onaway State Park which was redesignated as M-211. The original roadway that became today's M-95 started in Sagola and run northward to M-15 (today US 41/M-28). M-45 was extended by 1927 to replace portions of M-12 that were not used in US 2. It would later be extended in 1932 to the state line south of Kingsford. The total of M-45 was converted to M-95 in 1934 as a realignment near Witch Lake is completed. M-95 was rerouted in 1942 from Republic north to Humboldt Township. This new section replaced the last section of gravel roadway that was transferred to Marquette County as County Road 601. Another rerouting in the Republic area moved the trunkline in 1957 to bypass South Republic. The former roadway was partially closed to become part of the Republic Mine. M-69 was shortened, eliminating the concurrency with M-95 in 1960 or 1961. M-69 was re-extended back to its pre-1960 routing in 1991, restoring the concurrency in the process.

The village has become a lot quieter since the construction of the new M1 motorway which bypasses the village. The population of Castlebellingham-Kilsaran (named for the two townlands which make up the census area) increased from 721 inhabitants as of the 2002 census, to 1,126 people as of the 2016 census. History and features of note Castle Bellingham, Co. Louth The castle of Castlebellingham has served as one of the ancestral homes for Bellinghams since the 17th century. The Bellingham family originated in the small town of Kendal, Westmorland in England, the original ancestor of the Irish Bellinghams, Alan Bellingham hailed from here. Henry Bellingham, a descendant of Alan was a cavalry officer who first came to Ireland during the English Civil War. The lands of Gernonstown were granted to Henry during the Cromwellian Settlement, in which a large amount of native Irish lands were given to Englishmen in reward for their service. Henry is named in the list of grantees under the Acts of Settlement and Explanation of Charles II s. In 1666, Charles II formally granted the lands to him for his ‚Äòfaithful service as a good soldier in the late wars‚Äô There is some variation on the spelling of Gernonstowne. On various maps and other documents it is spelled Gernonstowne, Gernonstown, Gernon's-Town, Gormanstown, Germanstown, Garlandstown, Garland, etc. Irish road signs show the English as Castlebellingham while the Irish translation still refers to baile an Ghearlanaigh - or Gernonstown. It was not called Castlebellingham for at least forty years after the purchase. The name does not appear on any document before the year 1700. About 1710 it began to appear in journals and other sources to be called Castlebellingham. The castle was occupied by troops and burned down in the autumn of 1689 by King James II in revenge for Colonel Thomas Bellingham being a guide for William III, prior to the Battle of the Boyne. It is said that King William's armies camped the night before the Battle of the Boyne in the grounds of the castle. Over time Castlebellingham became known as an important gathering point in the county. Fairs were held there every year. A church was constructed next door to the castle and graveyard with a family vault was built. The Bellinghams became one of the most powerful and influential family in the county. From 1880-85 Henry Bellingham held a seat in Parliament for County Louth as an MP for the Home Rule League. In the 1800s the family had converted to Roman Catholicism. Records also note Castlebellingham for having \\"the best malt liquor\\" in Ireland. Apparently a brewery was built on site about 1770 and belonged to an O'Bryen Bellingham. For a number of years a brewery partnership ran their liquor business. The brewery is still there but now houses the \\"button factory\\" or Smallwares Ltd. The brewery was the main supplier of drink to the Boer War troops. A history of the parish, dated 1908, states that the impressive Calvary standing close to the Castle was erected by Sir Henry Bellingham as a monument to the memory of his first wife Lady Constance. A collection of inset religious panels is to be seen on the upper facades of many of the village buildings. These are also a reflection of Sir Henry's religious sentiments, and they are unique in Ireland. In addition to the many panels, there are biblical quotations cut into the stone window sills of some buildings. North of the castle is a carefully preserved group of \\"widows dwellings\\", built from charitable motives by Sir Henry. The war memorial in the village was built in the Celtic style in 1920 and was unveiled by Cardinal Logue.Notes by Patrick Comerford, accessed 5 Dec 2016 Castlebellingham was the ancestral home of the eponymous Bellingham baronets until the late 1950s. The last Bellingham to live there was Brigadier General Sir Edward Bellingham, born in 1879, who was the last Lord Lieutenant of Louth in 1921, and Guardian of the Rolls (Custos Rotulorum). He was then elected to the Irish free State Senate in 1925-36. It was purchased by Dermot Meehan in 1958 from the Irish Land Commission for ¬£3,065.00. Meehan spent several years converting the house into the Bellingham Castle Hotel, which remains today. Meehan sold the hotel and 17 acres in 1967 for ¬£30,636.61. The hotel, including the 17 acres, was offered for sale at ‚Ç¨1,500,000 in 2011. In December 2012, it was announced that the Corscadden family, who own and run Cabra Castle Hotel in Kingscourt, County Cavan and Ballyseede Castle Hotel in Tralee, County Kerry, purchased Bellingham Castle. Bellingham Castle is a wedding venue since 1905. The town is home to the Gaelic football team the O'Connell's. In 2012, the team won their first Intermediate Championship. After victories over Laois and Meath opposition, they narrowly lost to Monasterevin of Kildare in the Leinster final.

Pastors was political leader of the local party Livable Rotterdam (Leefbaar Rotterdam), a member of the city council and also an alderman of the municipality of Rotterdam.

Early life In his political pamphlet At your service Marco Pastors Tot uw Dienst (in English: At your service) Uitgeverij van Praag Amsterdam 2006 which was published in 2006 he described his catholic and rural upbringing as unremarkable, with his parents' problematic marriage as a recurring theme. He obtained a degree in economics from Erasmus University in 1989 and from 1990 to 1993 he worked for OV- studentenkaart BV (a company managing public transportation for students) then headed by Pim Fortuyn, his future political ally. He then went on to work for Getronics and later on for Zenc (an IT provider for the public sector) of which he was a co-founder. Local politics Pastors started his political career in January 2002 when his formed boss Fortuyn was elected leader of Livable Rotterdam (Leefbaar Rotterdam). He was given the responsibility for infrastructure and housing as an alderman and he focused on improving living conditions in some of the Rotterdam slum areas. He introduced measures which allowed tenants to buy their house and also introduced legislation banning prospective residents without a proper income or job prospects given the high unemployment and poverty in some residential area's.

On a regular basis he was challenged for making denigrating remarks at the expense of the Muslim minority and left-wing politicians which he perceived as politically correct. A denigrating remark regarding immigration and the political party Groen Links in the beginning of 2005 resulted in Pastors colliding with the city council and he was forced to further refrain from public comments on immigration and integration. In October 2005 he again collided with the city council when he commented in a Catholic newspaper that Muslims abused their religion when justifying some of their actions.Official Rotterdam Municipality statement 9-11-2005 Link As a result, the city council forced him out as an Alderman on 8 November 2005. In the 2006 municipal elections in Rotterdam Leefbaar Rotterdam polled about a third of the vote, but lost 3 of their 17 seats and the Pastors-led party therefore moved to the opposition benches.

Together with the Sumatran orangutan and Tapanuli orangutan, it belongs to the only genus of great apes native to Asia. Like the other great apes, orangutans are highly intelligent, displaying tool use and distinct cultural patterns in the wild. Orangutans share approximately 97% of their DNA with humans. The Bornean orangutan is a critically endangered species, with deforestation, palm oil plantations, and hunting posing a serious threat to its continued existence. Taxonomy Taman Safari I park The Bornean orangutan and the Sumatran orangutan diverged about 400,000 years ago, with a continued low level of gene flow between them since then. The two orangutan species were considered merely subspecies until 1996; they were elevated to species following sequencing of their mitochondrial DNA. The Bornean orangutan has three subspecies: *Northwest Bornean orangutan P. p. pygmaeus ‚Äì Sarawak (Malaysia) & northern West Kalimantan (Indonesia) *Central Bornean orangutan P. p. wurmbii ‚Äì Southern West Kalimantan & Central Kalimantan (Indonesia) *Northeast Bornean orangutan P. p. morio ‚Äì East Kalimantan (Indonesia) & Sabah (Malaysia) There is some uncertainty about this, however. The population currently listed as P. p. wurmbii may be closer to the Sumatran orangutan (P. abelii) than to the Bornean orangutan. If this is confirmed, P. abelii would be a subspecies of P. wurmbii (Tiedeman, 1808). In addition, the type locality of P. pygmaeus has not been established beyond doubt; it may be from the population currently listed as P. wurmbii (in which case P. wurmbii would be a junior synonym of P. pygmaeus, while one of the names currently considered a junior synonym of P. pygmaeus would take precedence for the taxon in Sarawak and northern West Kalimantan). Bradon- Jones et al. considered P. morio to be a synonym of P. pygmaeus, and the population found in East Kalimantan and Sabah to be a potentially unnamed separate taxon. In early October 2014, researchers from domestic and foreign countries found about 50 orangutans in several groups in South Kalimantan Province, although previously there is no record that the province has orangutans. As a member of the family Hominidae, Bornean orangutans are one of the closest extant relatives to Homo sapiens. Juvenile male at Tanjung Puting National Park This species was originally discovered by native Malaysians. There are several mentions of orangutans in Malaysian folklore. However, this species was originally named and described by the notable zoologist Carl Linneus in 1799. Its original name was Simia satyrus, meaning \\"satyr monkey\\", but was changed when scientists discovered that not all orangutans are one species. The holotype of this organism is located in the British Museum in London. The current species name P. pygmaeus is not Latin unlike most other Linnean classifications. The genus name Pongo is derived from the Bantu word ' used to indicate a large primate. It was originally used to describe chimpanzees in Western African dialects. The species name pygmaeus is derived from the Greek word \\"pygmy\\" meaning dwarf.

The heaviest known male orangutan in captivity was an obese male named \\"Andy\\", who weighed in 1959 when he was 13 years old. The Bornean orangutan has a distinctive body shape with very long arms that may reach up to 1.5 metres in length. It has grey skin, a coarse, shaggy, reddish coat and prehensile, grasping hands and feet. Its coat does not cover its face unlike most mammals, although Bornean orangutans do have some hair on their faces including a beard and mustache. It also has large, fatty cheek pads known as flanges as well as a pendulous throat sac. A male orangutan at Moscow Zoo. The male's face pad widens as he grows older. Bornean orangutans are highly sexually dimorphic and have several features that differ between males and females. Males have much larger cheek pads, or flanges, that are composed of muscle and large amounts of fat. In females, the flanges are mostly composed of muscle. Males have relatively larger canines and premolars. Males have a more pronounced beard and mustache. The throat sac in males is also considerably larger. There are two body types for sexually mature males: smaller or larger. Larger males are more dominant but smaller males still breed successfully. There is little sexual dimorphism at birth. Habitat and distribution The Bornean orangutan lives in tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest in the Bornean lowlands, as well as mountainous areas up to above sea level. This species lives throughout the canopy of primary and secondary forest, and moves large distances to find trees bearing fruit. It is found in the two Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak, and four of the five Indonesian Provinces of Kalimantan. Due to habitat destruction, the species distribution is now highly patchy throughout the island; the species has become rare in the southeast of the island, as well as in the forest between the Rajang River in central Sarawak and the Padas River in western Sabah. The first complete orangutan skeleton that was discovered was in the Hoa Binh province in Vietnam and thought to be from the late Pleistocene epoch. It differed from modern orangutans only in that its body was proportionately smaller compared to its head. This fossil and others confirm that orangutans once inhabited continental Southeast Asia even though currently, Bornean orangutans are only found in Malaysia and Indonesia. Behavior and ecology Bornean orangutan in its nest In history, orangutans ranged throughout Southeast Asia and into southern China, as well as on the island of Java and in southern Sumatra. They primarily inhabit peat swamp forest, tropical heath forest, and mixed dipterocarp forest. Bornean orangutan are more solitary than their Sumatran relatives. Two or three orangutans with overlapping territories may interact, but only for short periods of time. Although orangutans are not territorial, adult males will display threatening behaviors upon meeting other males, and only socialize with females to mate. Males are considered the most solitary of the orangutans. The Bornean orangutan has a lifespan of 35‚Äì45 years in the wild; in captivity it can live to be about 60. Despite being arboreal, the Bornean orangutan travels on the ground more than its Sumatran counterpart. This may be in part because no large terrestrial predators could threaten an orangutan in Borneo. In Sumatra, orangutans must face predation by the fierce Sumatran tiger. The Bornean orangutan exhibits nest-building behavior. Nests are built for use at night or during the day. Young orangutans learn by observing their mother's nest-building behaviour. This skill is practiced by juvenile orangutans. Nests may be elaborate and involve a foundation and mattress made by intertwining leaves and branches and adding broken leafy branches. Additional features such as shade, waterproof roof, \\"pillow\\", and \\"blanket\\", all of which are made from branches, twigs and leaves, may also be added. Nest-building in primates is considered as an example of tool use and not animal architecture. =Diet= The Bornean orangutan diet is composed of over 400 types of food, including wild figs, durians (Durio zibethinus and D. graveolens), leaves, seeds, bird eggs, flowers, honey, insects, and, to a lesser extent than the Sumatran orangutan, bark. They have also been known to consume the inner shoots of plants and vines. They get the necessary quantities of water from both fruit and from tree holes. An orangutan peeling a banana with its hand and foot. Bornean orangutans have been sighted using spears to attempt (unsuccessfully) to catch fish. The species has been observed using tools such as leaves to wipe off faeces, a pad of leaves for holding spiny durian fruit, a leafy branch for a bee swatter, a bunch of leafy branches held together as an \\"umbrella\\" while traveling in the rain, a single stick as backscratcher, and a branch or tree trunk as a missile. In some regions, orangutans occasionally eat soil to get minerals that may neutralize the toxins and acids they consume in their primarily vegetarian diets. On rare occasions, orangutans will prey upon other, smaller primates, such as slow lorises. =Reproduction= A rehabilitated female with her young baby in Sepilok Orang Utan Rehabilitation Centre, Sabah, Malaysia Males and females generally come together only to mate. Subadult males (unflanged) will try to mate with any female and will be successful around half the time. Dominant flanged males will call and advertise their position to receptive females, who prefer mating with flanged males. Adult males will often target females with weaned infants as mating partners because the female is likely to be fertile. Females reach sexual maturity and experience their first ovulatory cycle between about six and 11 years of age, although females with more body fat may experience this at an earlier age. The estrous cycle lasts between 22 and 30 days and menopause has been reported in captive orangutans at about age 48. Females tend to give birth at about 14‚Äì15 years of age. Newborn orangutans nurse every three to four hours, and begin to take soft food from their mothers' lips by four months. During the first year of its life, the young clings to its mother's abdomen by entwining its fingers in and gripping her fur. Offspring are weaned at about four years, but this could be much longer, and soon after they start their adolescent stage of exploring, but always within sight of their mother. During this period, they will also actively seek other young orangutans to play with and travel with. On average, juveniles do not become completely independent until they are about seven years of age. The birth rate for orangutans has been decreasing largely due to a lack of sufficient nutrients as a result of habitat loss. A 2011 study on female orangutans in free-ranging rehabilitation programs found that individuals that were supplemented with food resources had shorter interbirth intervals, as well as a reduced age, at first birth. Conservation status The Bornean orangutan is more common than the Sumatran, with about 54,500 individuals in the wild, whereas about 15,000 Sumatran orangutans are left in the wild. Orangutans are becoming increasingly endangered due to habitat destruction and the bushmeat trade, and young orangutans are captured to be sold as pets, usually entailing the killing of their mothers. The Bornean orangutan is critically endangered according to the IUCN Red List of mammals, and is listed on Appendix I of CITES. The total number of Bornean orangutans is estimated to be less than 14% of what it was in the recent past (from around 10,000 years ago until the middle of the 20th century), and this sharp decline has occurred mostly over the past few decades due to human activities and development. Species distribution is now highly patchy throughout Borneo; it is apparently absent or uncommon in the southeast of the island, as well as in the forest between the Rajang River in central Sarawak and the Padas River in western Sabah (including the Sultanate of Brunei). A population of around 6,900 is found in Sabangau National Park, but this environment is at risk. According to an anthropologist at Harvard University, in 10 to 20 years, orangutans are expected to be extinct in the wild if no serious effort is made to overcome the threats they are facing. This view is also supported by the United Nations Environment Programme, which stated in its 2007 report that, due to illegal logging, fire and the extensive development of palm oil plantations, orangutans are critically endangered, and if the current trend continues, they will become extinct. When forest is burned down to clear room for palm oil plantations, not only does the Bornean orangutan suffer from habitat loss, but several individuals have been burned and killed in fires. Palm oil accounts for over one tenth of Indonesia's export earnings. It is in high demand because it is used in several packaged foods, deodorants, shampoos, soaps, candies, and baked goods. Climate change is another threat to Bornean orangutan conservation. The affects that human activity have had on Indonesian rainfall have made food less abundant and so Bornean orangutans are less likely to receive full nutrients so that they can be sufficiently healthy to breed. A November 2011 survey, based on interviews with 6,983 respondents in 687 villages across Kalimantan in 2008 to 2009, gave estimated orangutan killing rates of between 750 and 1800 in the year leading up to April 2008. These killing rates were higher than previously thought and confirm that the continued existence of the orangutan in Kalimantan is under serious threat. The survey did not quantify the additional threat to the species due to habitat loss from deforestation and expanding palm-oil plantations. The survey found that 73% of respondents knew orangutans were protected by Indonesian law. A young captive orangutan sleeping. However, the Indonesian government rarely prosecutes or punishes perpetrators. quoting Ashley Leiman, director of the Orangutan Foundation. In a rare prosecution in November 2011, two men were arrested for killing at least 20 orangutans and a number of long-nosed proboscis monkeys. They were ordered to conduct the killings by the supervisor of a palm oil plantation, to protect the crop, with a payment of $100 for a dead orangutan and $22 for a monkey. =Rescue and rehabilitation centers= A number of orangutan rescue and rehabilitation projects operate in Borneo. The Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation (BOS) founded by Dr Willie Smits has rescue and rehabilitation centres at Wanariset and Samboja Lestari in East Kalimantan and Nyaru Menteng, in Central Kalimantan founded and managed by Lone Dr√∏scher Nielsen. BOS also works to conserve and recreate the fast-disappearing rainforest habitat of the orangutan, at Samboja Lestari and Mawas. Orangutan Foundation International, founded by Dr Birutƒó Galdikas, rescues and rehabilitates orangutans, preparing them for release back into protected areas of the Indonesian rain forest. In addition, it promotes the preservation of the rain forest for them. The Sepilok Orang Utan Rehabilitation Centre near Sandakan in the state of Sabah in Malaysian Borneo opened in 1964 as the first official orangutan rehabilitation project. Orangutan Foundation, founded by Ashley Leiman, operates programmes in Central Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo. The Foundation rescues orphaned orangutans and enters them into their soft-release programme, allowing them to develop the skills necessary to survive in the wild. When old enough, orangutans are released into the protected Lamandau Wildlife Reserve. Orangutan Foundation works to protect orangutans by focusing on habitat protection and capacity building, especially in local communities. A seven- year longitudinal study published in 2011 looked at whether the lifespan of zoo-housed orangutans was related to a subjective assessment of well-being, with the intent of applying such measures to assess the welfare of orangutans in captivity. Of the subjects, 100 were Sumatran (Pongo abelii), 54 Bornean (Pongo pygmaeus) and 30 were hybrid orangutans. 113 zoo employees, who were highly familiar with the typical behavior of the orangutans, used a four-item questionnaire to assess their subjective well-being. The results indicated that orangutans in higher subjective well-being were less likely to die during the follow-up period. The study concluded that happiness was related to longer life in orangutans. In late 2014, Nyaru Menteng veterinarians failed to rescue the life of a female orangutan. An operation was performed in which 40 air- rifle pellets were removed from her body. The orangutan was found at a palm oil plantation in Indonesian Borneo. Genome The genome of the Bornean orangutan is programmed to be sequenced.

He was played by Gary Sandy. Travis was originally intended to be the lead character, the more-or-less normal person who would anchor the series and provide the focus for most of the stories. He is the subject of the theme song, and one critic went so far as to describe Sandy as \\"Gary Tyler Moore\\". As the first season went on, WKRP shifted to being more of an ensemble comedy, where any one of the eight regulars could carry an episode. Despite this change, Sandy retained top billing for all four seasons as the straight man to the rest of the cast. Program director In the pilot episode, Andy arrives in Cincinnati to take over as WKRP's program director. He previously worked the same job at a radio station in Santa Fe, New Mexico; but he also ran a station in Albuquerque and in Amarillo, Texas. In that episode, he claims to be from Santa Fe and, in the season two episode \\"Jennifer's Home for Christmas,\\" he refers to Santa Fe as home. However, in the season three episode \\"A Mile in My Shoes\\" Andy tells Smilin' Al, a business owner who advertises on WKRP, that he is originally from Phoenix, Arizona. Andy is young, handsome and friendly, and though he is viewed with suspicion by the old guard at the low-rated station‚Äîmanager Arthur Carlson, sales director Herb Tarlek, and news director Les Nessman‚Äîhe soon manages to win them over to his side. Mr. Carlson even defends Andy to his domineering mother, the station's owner, when she wants to fire him. Convinced that he is not going to last at WKRP, Andy spends about the first month in his apartment without furniture, just in case he has to suddenly leave town. In a flashback episode, it is revealed that Andy got his overweight landlady drunk to charm her into letting him out of his lease, which he does successfully. Described by Mr. Carlson as a \\"cowboy\\", Andy frequently wears boots and a cowboy hat. He also wears very tight jeans to work, which makes Mr. Carlson uncomfortable. \\"With denim,\\" Andy explains, \\"I feel comfortable and relaxed. I feel as though I can work better.\\" He wears his hair in the late 1970s \\"feathered\\" style, and many of the characters make fun of his abundant hair: Bailey Quarters, asking him to take part in a promotion, asks him to imagine \\"Your hair flowing in the wind -- now, that stuff will flow!\\" Though he is usually quiet and low-key, describing himself as \\"an easy-going guy with a natural ability to lead,\\" he can sometimes lose his temper when his employees will not listen to him, which is more often than not. In response to Johnny Fever's refusal to play his playlist of top 40 hits, Andy jokingly threatens to shoot himself. In fact, a common joke in the series is that Andy often has to literally run to the broadcast booth to stop some unacceptable material being broadcast at that moment. Andy's first act at WKRP is to change the format from \\"beautiful music\\" to top 40 rock n' roll. He has, in his own words, \\"lived and breathed radio ever since I was a little boy,\\" and his ambition is to turn WKRP around and make it a top-rated station. But he is unable to do what it would really take to improve the station: fire Herb and Les. He has come to feel affection for them, and he also knows a real housecleaning at the station would entail getting rid of Mr. Carlson too. After his first year on the job, when WKRP only rises from 16th to 14th in an 18-station market, and while the rest of the staff is elated, Andy, though outwardly happy, is furious, and considers it a personal failure. After a conversation with his friend, nighttime disc jockey Gordon \\"Venus Flytrap\\" Sims, Andy realizes that he cannot leave WKRP or fire anybody. He likes the people too much, and has made friends here, something that did not happen at the other stations where he worked. Andy decides to abandon his ambition of becoming a hugely successful program director, or as Venus puts it, \\"You gave up a chance to be Boy Wonder of American radio to be the head guard of a nut farm.\\" As the series goes on, Andy turns his attention to fighting against the increasingly bland, corporate world of modern radio. In one episode, he meets Norris Breeze (played by thirtysomething co-star David Clennon), a former colleague of his from New Mexico who is now a successful programming consultant. Breeze is appalled by Andy's decision to let the DJs pick the music they like instead of just playing the same songs over and over, like most radio stations. \\"Nobody is programming their own music,\\" Breeze says. \\"We are, and that's the way it's going to stay,\\" Andy replies. A story arc from the final season of WKRP has Andy working behind the scenes to get Mama Carlson to put more money into the station, so that he can improve the place and give the employees raises. When the staff considers unionizing, he strikes a deal with her: he will keep the union out of the station if she will pay higher salaries and allow him to renovate the station's lobby. The others never find out what Andy did. Also in the final season, Andy takes Mama Carlson out to dinner and the opera, hoping to get her to invest still more money (this time to buy a new transmitter). He begins to wonder if she expects him to sleep with her in exchange for the money. In the end, it turns out that she only wanted to go out with a personable young man on her arm, though she enjoyed allowing him to believe that she had other expectations. In the final episode, Andy is given his walking papers when Mrs. Carlson announces her plans to change the station's format from Top 40 to all news, despite the station's most recent finish in sixth place in the Cincinnati radio ratings, with the morning show at number one. She reverses her decision after Johnny, who has learned her ulterior motive of changing the format to doom the station to failure like she wants (in order to keep the station as a tax write-off for her other business ventures), threatens to divulge her motive to her son. Just as Mrs. Carlson tells Arthur that she's reconsidered changing the format, a drunken Andy and Venus burst into her home with the intent of telling her off. \\"Mrs. Carlson...I'm tired of your crud!\\" Both collapse on her floor. Between the end of WKRP in Cincinnati in 1982 and the start of The New WKRP in Cincinnati in 1991, he leaves the station. The station's fortunes fall dramatically after his departure, to the point that by the time of The New WKRP in Cincinnati, the station is back in the same position as it was before he arrived. His (apparently) first replacement, Steve DeMarco (an unseen character), is fired for using foul language on air. By the time of the later series, the program director's chair is filled by Donovan Aderhold (played by Mykelti Williamson), who disappears in the penultimate episode when he leaves the station, attempts to return, but has his plane disappear. The position is empty in the series finale. Andy Travis was one of two main cast members from the original series, along with Bailey Quarters, that never appeared in the new series. Personal life In the first-season episode \\"Love Returns\\", Travis is very tempted to leave WKRP. An old flame, now a very successful country and western singer (played by It's a Living star Barrie Youngfellow), shows up and rekindles old feelings. She offers him a job with her entourage, but he reluctantly turns it down. During the remainder of the show's run, Andy occasionally refers to having girlfriends and dates, and even uses Mr. Carlson's office to impress an attractive coat-check girl during a business party, but otherwise he is not actually seen actively pursuing a love interest. Andy is not immune to the charms of his female co-workers. After Andy is knocked unconscious during a tornado, Jennifer Marlowe begins giving him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, which a delirious Andy soon attempts to turn into a passionate kiss. Similarly, when reprimanding Bailey Quarters for crafting a fake news story that was subsequently read on-air, he informs her that should it ever happen again, she will be \\"the best-looking reporter on the unemployment line\\" (Bailey's response in turn is non-verbal, but does indicate that she is extremely flattered by the compliment). In the episode \\"Filthy Pictures\\", Bailey uses Andy's obvious discomfort at being asked to pose in a bathing suit (for a charity photoshoot) to gently mock male chauvinist attitudes, greeting him with \\"Hey, baby\\" and calling him \\"beefcake\\". However, Andy does get his own back when Bailey dresses stylishly in purple and pretends to be a former nude pinup model (in order to get nude photos of Jennifer back from a sleazy photographer); when she returns to the station after the successful ruse, Andy greets her by saying, \\"Hey, baby...purple's my favorite color.\\" He then begins chasing her around the station. Casting Hugh Wilson, the creator and showrunner of WKRP, originally wanted to offer the part of Andy to David Letterman. However, MTM decided to cast Letterman in another show, Mary Tyler Moore's comedy-variety show Mary (which was canceled after only three weeks). Several other actors were considered for the part, but CBS executives decided that Sandy was the best choice.

Naming themselves the Initiating Committee, they submitted an application to the Jefferson County School Board to operate as an educational option school with a request to be considered for a charter school if the educational option request was denied on December 17, 1993. The charter school application was denied by the school board on March 17, 1994, citing that the concept set forth in the charter application had been approved as an educational option. A memorandum of understanding was signed on April 4, 1994 to establish the school as an extension of the Dennison program with Dr. Lloyd Carlton, principal of Dennison, as the principal overseeing both programs for the 1994‚Äì1995 school year. In August 1994, the school commenced classes in the building formerly occupied by Manning Junior High School at 3200 West 32nd Avenue in Golden, Colorado with its first class of ninth graders and the seventh and eighth grade classes transferred to the school from the Dennison program. Succeeding years saw the first class advance in grade until the school served a full 7‚Äì12 program in the 1997‚Äì1998 school year. A bond issue passed by Jefferson County voters in 1998 funded a new building for the school, which opened at the school's present location in 2001. On September 23, 2012, the school was visited by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney during his campaign. Campus D'Evelyn's current location at 10359 W. Nassau Ave. The Jefferson County school district acquired of the historic Fehringer Ranch property during master planning for the area in the late 1990s. Funds to build the new campus were approved in a school bond election in 1998. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place in early 2000 and the school's grand opening was on August 25, 2001. The campus was designed by Slater Paull & Associates. A design advisory group that included steering committee members, teachers, and parents worked with the design team to develop the school's design concept and reflect classical academic architecture. The school's design was part of the 2002 Exhibition of School Planning & Architecture judged by the Council of Educational Facility Planners. Students Forty percent of seventh grade students graduate from Dennison Elementary School, D'Evelyn's predecessor and feeder school and the other sixty percent enroll through a random lottery or from sibling priority in the lottery pool. Eighth and ninth grade admission is also through the random lottery system and the school does not permit enrollment after the beginning of ninth grade.

Retrieved on March 12, 2012. Archived from the original on November 28, 2014. sometimes credited as R. Berns, was an American comic book writer, playwright and concert impresario, notable as the founder of the Island Concert Hall recital series which ran for 15 years on Long Island. Comic books As a writer, he is best known for his EC Comics tales and his Superman stories for DC Comics, where he also established the origin and mythos of Aquaman. With various artists, Bernstein co-created DC's Congorilla, Aqualad and Aquagirl, and also Archie Comics' the Jaguar. Like most comics professionals of this time, Bernstein went largely uncredited, often receiving credit belatedly in modern-day reprints of his work. His first confirmable credit is the signed, six-page story \\"Ghouls' Gold\\" in publisher Lev Gleason's Crime Does Not Pay #43 (Jan. 1946). Other early work includes a five-page story in Spark Publications' Golden Lad #4, featuring the character Swift Arrow, plus text fillers for DC Comics and Fawcett Comics, and a 1947 Green Lantern story. For Marvel Comics' 1950s iteration, Atlas Comics, Bernstein wrote for the war comics series War Comics, as well as several stories of the masked Western character Black Rider. Also during this decade, he wrote for DC's All-American Men of War, G.I. Combat, Our Army at War, Our Fighting Forces, and Star Spangled War Stories; psychological drama in EC's Psychoanalysis and Shock Illustrated; and superhero stories, working with artist Jack Kirby on at least one Green Arrow tale, in World's Finest Comics #99 (Feb. 1959). With artist Howard Sherman, Bernstein adapted the long-running \\"Congo Bill\\" jungle-adventure feature into the body-switching superhero feature \\"Congorilla\\", beginning in Action Comics #248 (Jan. 1959). =Superman and Aquaman= Bernstein's first recorded Superman story, for DC Comics, is \\"The Oldest Man In Metropolis\\", in Action Comics #251 (April 1959). Later work includes the DC titles Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane, Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen, Superboy (as well as the later Superboy feature in Adventure Comics), and features starring Green Arrow and Supergirl. With artist Ramona Fradon, he reintroduced the 1940s Golden Age superhero Aquaman in Adventure Comics #260 (May 1959) and scripted through at least #282 (March 1961), introducing major characters along the way. One of these, in Adventure Comics #269 (Feb. 1960), was the teen sidekick Aqualad,McAvennie, Michael \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 98: \\"Writer Robert Bernstein and artist Ramona Fradon provided a lifelong pal for Aquaman in a backup tale in this issue.\\" who decades later would become the adult hero Tempest. Bernstein and artist George Papp introduced the Phantom Zone and General Zod into the Superman mythos in Adventure Comics #283 (April 1961).McAvennie \\"1960s\\" in Dolan, p. 102 Later during this period historians and fans call the Silver Age of Comic Books, Bernstein scripted stories of the Archie Comics characters the Fly and the Jaguar, and, with plots by Marvel editor-in-chief Stan Lee, some of the earliest Iron Man and Thor stories, in Tales of Suspense and Journey into Mystery, respectively. He also scripted some Human Torch stories, plotted by penciler Jack Kirby, in Strange Tales. He used the pen name \\"R. Berns\\" for his Marvel work. Bernstein adapted the famed radio drama character The Shadow for Archie Comics in 1964, and his last work for that character was the two stories in The Shadow #3 (Nov. 1964). Bernstein's last original DC story in the 1960s was \\"Olsen's Time-Trip to Save Krypton\\" in Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #101 (April 1967). Bernstein wrote one final comics story, \\"The Miracle of the Catacombs\\", which was published in DC's Weird War Tales #91 (Sept. 1980). Concert impresario and playwright  Bernstein founded the Island Concert Hall recital series which ran for 15 years on Long Island. His presentations spanned three decades. In 1951, when he co-founded the Roslyn Music Group, presenting chamber-music ensembles and soloists on Long Island, his concert career as an impresario was underway. Because Long Island had \\"an omnivorous appetite for the arts\\", as he phrased it, Bernstein launched the nonprofit Concert Hall subscription series in 1964, offering approximately 30 annual performances of classical, jazz, dance and theater, including Broadway road company shows and New York Philharmonic concerts. The events were staged at Long Island University's C. W. Post Center, the Nassau Coliseum and other Long Island auditoriums. Bernstein's one-act plays received a posthumous performance in 1993 at the Arena Players Repertory Theater in East Farmingdale, Long Island. Personal life Bernstein lived in Upper Brookville, New York, on Long Island. At age 69, he died of heart failure at his Delray Beach, Florida winter home, survived by his wife, Beverly, of Upper Brookville; his daughter, Alison, of Manhattan; and his sister, Louise Sandler, of Elkins Park, Pennsylvania.

It is caused by infarcted muscle tissue, usually in the thigh. Epidemiology The mean age at presentation is thirty-seven years with a reported range of nineteen to sixty- four years. The mean age of onset since diagnosis of diabetes is fifteen years. The female:male ratio is 1.3:1. Other diabetic complications such as nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy and hypertension are usually present. Its major symptom is the acute onset muscle pain, usually in the thigh, in the absence of trauma. Signs include exquisite muscle tenderness and swelling. Investigations and diagnosis Tissue biopsy is the gold standard. Macroscopically this reveals pale muscle tissue. Microscopically infarcted patches of myocytes. Necrotic muscle fibers are swollen and eosinophilic and lack striations and nuclei. Small-vessel walls are thickened and hyalinized, with luminal narrowing or complete occlusion. Biopsy cultures for bacteria, fungi, acid-fast bacilli and stains are negative in simple myonecrosis. Creatine kinase may be normal or increased probably depending upon the stage of the condition when sampling is undertaken. ESR is elevated. Planar X-ray reveals soft tissue swelling and may potentially show gas within necrotic muscle, Bone scan may show non specific uptake later in the course. CT shows muscle oedema with preserved tissue planes (non-contrast enhancing). MRI is the exam of choice and shows increased signal on T2 weighted images within areas of muscle oedema. Contrast enhancement is helpful but must be weighed against the risk of Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis as many diabetics have underlying chronic kidney disease. Arteriography reveals large and medium vessel arteriosclerosis occasionally with dye within the area of tissue infarction. Electromyography shows non specific focal changes. Coronal fat suppressed STIR image demonstrating enlargement and increased signal in the left adductor muscle group with associated subcutaneous edema in a patient with diabetic myonecrosis. Axial fat suppressed T2 weighted MRI image showing hyperintense signal and enlargement of the left thigh adductor muscle group in diabetic myonecrosis. Axial fat suppressed post gadolinium contrast enhancement MRI image showing absent enhancement in the left thigh adductor muscles centrally indicating necrosis in diabetic myonecrosis. Treatment Treatment includes supportive care with analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents. Exercise should be limited as it increases pain and extends the area of infarction. Symptoms usually resolve in weeks to months, but fifty percent of sufferers will experience relapse in either leg. Pathophysiology The pathogenesis of this disease is unclear. Arteriosclerosis obliterans has been postulated as the cause, along with errors of the clotting and fibrinolytic pathways such as antiphospholipid syndrome. Differential Diagnosis A large number of conditions may cause symptoms and signs similar to diabetic myonecrosis and include: deep vein thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, cellulitis, fasciitis, abscess, haematoma, myositis, pseudothrombophlebitis (ruptured synovial cyst), pyomyositis, parasitic myositis, osteomyelitis, calcific myonecrosis, myositis ossificans, diabetic myotrophy, muscle strain or rupture, bursitis, vasculitis, arterial occlusion, haemangioma, lymphoedema, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, cat-scratch disease, amyloidosis, as well as tumours of lipoma, chondroma, fibroma, leiomyoma, and sarcoma.

Clermont-Ferrand Cathedral, or at greater length the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption of Clermont-Ferrand (), is a Gothic cathedral and French national monument located in the town of Clermont-Ferrand in the Auvergne. It is the seat of the Archbishops of Clermont (bishops until 2002). It is built entirely in black lava stone, which makes it highly distinctive, and visible from a great distance. Its twin spires are 96.1 metres tall, and tower above the town's rooftops. It has been listed since 1862 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. Cath√©drale Notre-Dame History In the 5th century, bishop Namatius laid the foundations of the city's first cathedral, allowing the Christian community to leave its ghetto, the \\"vicus christianorum\\". He dedicated the building to Saints Vitalis and Agricola, whose relics he brought from Bologna. It was 43 metres long and on a basilica plan, as is known by the account of Gregory of Tours. It was ornamented in marble, with a nave, two parallel aisles, a transept and 70 columns. It was destroyed in 760 by Pepin the Short who, repenting of this act, gave a large sum to bishop Haddebert to finance his reconstruction work, which lasted from 764 to 768. This second structure was again destroyed, this time by the Normans, in 915. Bishop Stephen II built a third Romanesque cathedral, which was consecrated in 946. Unsurpassed, this building probably served as the model and prototype for many churches in the Auvergne. The present crypt (made up of an ambulatory and radiating chapels) dates back to this 10th century church, and included a 4th-century white marble sarcophagus. In 1248, inspired by a visit on Sainte-Chapelle on a trip to Paris, bishop Hugues de la Tour decided to launch work on a new cathedral. Constructing a church in the prestigious Northern Gothic style would thus allow him to assert his supremacy over a city that had been put back into its bishop's power (rather than that of the counts of Auvergne) just some decades earlier. Notre- Dame-du-Port, that had inspired the cathedral of Stephen II, would thus again be surpassed. The main originality of the structure is the material used: the rock from Volvic (of the Trachy-and√©site type) that gives the building its dark colour and whose strength allows the construction of highly delicate pillars. Jean Deschamps was entrusted with the work. He had already worked on the cathedrals at Narbonne and Limoges. Inspired by Beauvais and Amiens, he realized original plans in which the windows do not occupy all the available space between the supports and do not have any bracing arches, the ribs directly penetrate under the arch, the choir-rotunda pillars' elliptical plan allows all the light from the apsidal windows to penetrate into the sanctuary, and flying buttresses allow ingenious d√©bords into the nave aisles . Jean worked from 1248 to 1287 on the choir, in which Louis IX came to marry his son (the future Philip III) to Isabella of Aragon. The king financed (maybe for this occasion) part of the stained glass windows that appear to be from the same workshop as those in Sainte-Chapelle. The choir, the transept and the start of the nave were finished about 1295. Pierre Deschamps took over from his father up to 1325, pushing the works beyond the transept crossing. From 1325 to 1340, the towers of the transept arms were raised by an anonymous master. One of them is familiar: the tour de la Bayette, the highest one, named after the watcher placed at its peak (Bayer means to watch). From 1340 to 1355, Pierre de C√©bazat, known to have worked on the la Chaise-Dieu, finished the three spans of the nave, that allowed it to be rejoined to the Roman towers of the church of Stephen II, though the disturbances of the Hundred Years' War did not leave him time to finish his work. During the years that followed, the chapter was satisfied to have him sculpt a new doorjamb for the door of its sacristy. Plan of the Cathedral. The mainly blue rose window over the north door and the mainly orange one overlooking the south door were made in the fourteenth century. They both fit into a square of 8.50 metres wide. Between 1444 and 1474, the so-called \\"clocher du retour\\" was placed above the choir, covered in carved stone. It was demolished after 1741. Between 1507 and 1512 a high roof was raised covered with lead, replacing the original roof. A planned flamboyant Gothic fa√ßade was refused by the chapter because it would cost too much. During the French Revolution, the revolutionaries wanted to tear down the church, but the Benedictine Verdier- Latour managed to persuade them that it would be an excellent gathering place for the people. Only the rood screen, choir stalls, altar, statues and furniture (with the exception of an Easter chandelier by Philippe Caffieri) were destroyed, though three transept towers were razed. La Bayette owed its survival only to its practical usefulness, for it gave the time. The Romanesque fa√ßade of the cathedral of Stephen II was destroyed by gunfire in 1851. It was not until 1866 that completion works began, built according to the plans of Viollet-le-Duc by his pupil Anatole de Baudot. In 1884, the western fa√ßade with its spires and the last span of the nave were finally completed, with full respect for construction methods of the Middle Ages. Only the size of a few of the dry stones shows any difference. A little-noticed detail is that the building was completely painted with lines to imitate masonry and cut stone blocks. The access steps on the rue des Gras were not built, however, until the very beginning of the 20th century, to make space for which the birthplace of Blaise Pascal was destroyed.

The Gothic cathedral building, constructed between 1280 and 1325, and dedicated on 9 April 1393, is a listed national monument. Originating as the church of the Abbey of St. Benignus, it became the seat of the Diocese of Dijon during the French Revolution, replacing the previous cathedral when it was secularised, and has been the seat of the succeeding Archbishopric of Dijon since the elevation of the diocese in 2002. Building history Reconstruction of William of Volpiano's Abbey by Ann Wethey and Kenneth Conant The first church here was a basilica built over the falsely reported sarcophagus of Saint Benignus, which was placed in a crypt constructed for it by Saint Gregory of Langres in 511; the basilica over the crypt was completed in 535. This building became the centre of a monastic community. In 871 Isaac, Bishop of Langres, re-founded it as a Benedictine abbey, and restored the basilica at the same time. In 989 Bruno, Bishop of Langres, requested Mayeul, Abbot of Cluny, to send monks to re- settle the abbey, grown decadent, as a Cluniac house. In 990 William of Volpiano was appointed the new abbot. By 1002, the ruin of the previous building had been razed and construction began on a new Romanesque structure designed by William, consisting of a subterranean church round the sarcophagus of Benignus, a ground floor church for worship, and a rotunda, 17 metres in diameter, on three levels in the place of the apse, linking the two.The construction the new abbey over the next decades became soon one of the most ambitious and most prestigious buildings of its time, since it exceeded even the dimensions of its contemporary mother monastery Cluny Abbey (known as Cluny II). See the reconstruction by Kenneth J. Conant (1965). Dedicated in 1016 by Lambert I, this suite of buildings was decorated in the ornate Cluniac style, of which only a few traces survive. In 1137 a fire destroyed most of the town of Dijon and damaged the monastery and its church. The repaired building was consecrated by Pope Eugene III in 1147. In 1272 the crossing tower collapsed, destroying the whole of the upper church and severely damaging the subterranean one, and smashing some of the supporting columns of the rotunda. Then the abbot, Hugh of Arc, of a powerful Burgundian family, was able thanks to his contacts to mobilise enough support to begin the construction of a new Gothic abbey church in 1281. Progress was at first rapid, and at Hugh's death in 1300 the building was close to completion. Progress slowed, however, and the work was not finished until 1325. The new church, unlike its Cluniac predecessor, is noted for its plainness and severity. The abbey was secularised during the French Revolution, but the church was made, firstly, a parish church, and then in 1792 the cathedral of the Diocese of Dijon. The rotunda was however destroyed at that time; all that remains is the lowest storey, which was excavated in the 19th century and has since been reworked as a crypt.

Construction  Interior with altar The site of the ancient town of Gland√®ves, where the bishops' seat had been established since the end of the Roman Empire, was insecure, and the population moved in the 11th century to Entrevaux, which was easier to defend. Gland√®ves Cathedral and the bishop's establishment however remained on the old site until 1603. In 1604 the bishop Octave Isnard decided to build a new cathedral at Entrevaux. Construction work lasted from 1609 to 1630; decoration was completed in the 1650s, and the bell tower in the 1660s. It was probably consecrated in 1627.

History Plan by Viollet-le-Duc, showing in black the actual structure and in grey his suggestion of some of the areas not built The cathedral is situated in the heart of the present city of Narbonne, but in the Middle Ages was located by the city wall. This placement was due to a long history of the site as a place of worship. In 313, just after the Edict of Milan, a Constantinian basilica was erected on approximately the same spot as the present cathedral. Ruined by a fire in 441, it took 37 days to demolish those parts of the basilica that had escaped destruction. Then a Latin basilica was constructed by Bishop Rusticus, who was encouraged in his work by the Gaulish prefect, Marcellus. The basilica was finished on November 29, 445. Originally dedicated to Saint Genesius of Arles, it was re-dedicated in 782 to the young Spanish martyrs Saint Justus and Pastor. Little remains of this building: two Roman columns from the former forum, used in the nave, can now be seen in the present cloister; the lintel and an aedicule of white marble can now be seen in the Lapidary Museum of Narbonne. A Carolingian cathedral was erected in 890 by Archbishop Theodard (d. 893). Its steeple, largely restored, is visible from the cloister. Yet despite the help given to it by three popes, this church fell into ruin. The idea to build a Gothic cathedral was a political decision made in 1268 by Pope Clement IV, the former archbishop of Narbonne. He decided that it would be a monument made in the magnificent style of the Kingdom of France. The construction of the new cathedral was supposed to begin in 1264, but did not actually start until 1272. The first stone of the current cathedral was laid by Archbishop Maruin on April 13, 1272, in the foundation of the current Chapel of the Sacred Heart. The choir was finished in 1332, but the rest of the building was never completed, as the result of many factors including sudden changes in the economic status of Narbonne, its unusual size and geographical location (to complete it would have meant demolishing the city wall) and financial constraints.

The cathedral, dedicated to Saint Maclovius otherwise Saint Malo (Saint Maclou), has been the episcopal seat of the Diocese of Pontoise since its creation in 1966. It was formerly a parish church. Construction began in the 12th century on the site of an ancient chapel of Saint Eustace and the building was enlarged and completed in the 15th and 16th centuries. Thus the central and eastern parts of the cathedral are 12th century, while the tower and the central portal are in the Flamboyant style. There are Renaissance additions flanking the central structure, and a north portal of the same period. The cathedral has been a monument historique since 1840.Monumentum.fr  History  Pontoise Cathedral was not built as a cathedral, but as a parish church in the northern part of the town of Pontoise, around the middle of the 12th century. The first parish priest was named Robert and was alive in 1165. The Seven Sacraments, Penitence by Abraham Godijn c. 1724 There is no record of a parish of Saint-Maclou until 1213, and it was possessed of a double cure until 1736, a peculiarity that could be explained by an older chapel of Saint-Eustache having coexisted for a time with the church of Saint-Maclou, or else by the division of a seigneurial inheritance comprising altar revenues. The second possibility is more plausible because the chapel was founded in 1110 and was only served by vicars of the parish of Saint-Mellon, and was perhaps only a side chapel of an earlier church of Saint-Maclou known since 1090. The creation of the Val-d'Oise department led to the establishment of the diocese of Pontoise on 9 October 1966 and the consequent elevation of the main church of the episcopal city to the rank of cathedral. Apart from the small group of cathedrals built as such in the territory of the present √éle-de-France region, the church of Saint-Maclou can be considered as one of the area's most important buildings, both for its dimensions and for its architectural value, along with the Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame of Mantes-la-Jolie, the Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame-du-Fort of √âtampes and the Collegiate Church of Saint-Martin of √âtampes. The first study of it appeared in 1587, and it is one of the first five buildings on the territory of the present department of Val-d'Oise to be listed as a historical monument, in 1840. No historical documents exist to attest the exact construction period of the church of Saint-Maclou. It had a cruciform plan consisting of a nave of five bays accompanied by two single aisles; a transept, each wing of which consisted of two bays; a central bell- tower above the crossing; and a choir of a single bay with a semicircular apse, surrounded by an ambulatory with five radiating chapels. Significant elements of this early church still exist, although their initial character has been lost as a result of reconstruction. The original church retained its appearance for about a century and a half until on 30 October 1309 a hurricane caused the collapse of the central belltower, which then partially destroyed the nave with the collapse of the last pillar on the south side. The repair of the nave was undertaken by the butchers of the city and finished in 1325. From the middle of the next century the church was enlarged by the addition of two additional bays to the nave and aisles to the west, along with the elevation of a new western fa√ßade and the construction of a new bell tower to its left. Work continued with the restoration of the vaults and windows of the choir and the ambulatory, and ended initially in 1477 with the construction of a sacristy on two levels on the site of the first radiant chapel south of the choir.

The cathedral has been a national monument since 1906. Cath√©drale Saint-Louis Present cathedral The Diocese of La Rochelle (Diocese of La Rochelle and Saintes from 1852) was created in 1648 but the first stone of the new cathedral was not laid until 1742, by which time the architect who drew up the plans, Jacques Gabriel, was dead; the work was supervised, from a distance, by his son Ange-Jacques Gabriel. Although still not complete, it was consecrated anyway in 1784. The structure is a rather bare Neo-Classical one. The cupola has paintings by William Bouguereau, a native of the city. St. Barth√©l√©my Attached to the chevet of the present cathedral is the late medieval Gothic bell tower of the Church of St. Barth√©l√©my (Saint Bartholomew), first constructed in 1152 by monks from the Ile d'Aix, the rest of which was destroyed by the Huguenots in 1568. The tower, on one of the highest points of La Rochelle, was used as a gun tower against the besieging army of Louis XIII in 1627. The displaced parishioners were able in 1628 to take over as their church the grand temple, a former Protestant church adjacent to the site of the medieval St. Barth√©l√©my, only to find in 1648, on the creation of the Diocese of La Rochelle, that the new chapter wished to use it as the cathedral. The parishioners therefore built a new church of St. Barth√©l√©my nearby, which was completed in 1678. The older church however burnt down in 1687 and the chapter moved into the new church, which they and the parish were obliged to share until the consecration of the new cathedral in 1784. The church was entirely destroyed during the French Revolution and the site re-developed with houses, which were demolished later in the 19th century when it was possible to finish the cathedral.

The city's modern tram network now consists of three lines, serving 32 stations and operating over of route. The current, modern Marseille tram network opened on 7 July 2007. The first horse tramway opened in Marseille on 21 January 1876; electric trams came to Marseille in 1899. Unlike most other French cities, trams continued to operate in Marseille, even through the 1950s and beyond, when trams disappeared from most cities around the world. The original tram system continued to operate until 2004, when the last line, Line 68, was closed. Trams remained out of operation for three years between 2004 and 2007, in advance of the effort to renovate the tram network to modern standards.  Modern tram network  A new tram network is being built in Marseille, France, which when completed in 2011 will consist of three tram lines. The first phase opened on 30 June 2007. It is part of an urban renewal project which aims to reduce car use and favour pedestrians, bicyclists and public transit users. = Phase 1: Mid-2007 to Mid-2008 = On 30 June 2007, the first phase of the new Marseille tram network opened. It consists of one line linking Eurom√©diterran√©e in the northwest with Les Caillols in the east. Between Blancarde Chave and Saint-Pierre stations, it runs on part of the former route of Line 68. Blancarde Chave station will not open until October 2007. In October 2007, the portion of the old Line 68 between Blancarde Chave. and E.-Pierre (near the entrance to the tunnel) will reopen, and two lines will be created. Line 1 will link E.-Pierre and Les Caillols, and line 2 will go from Eurom√©diterran√©e to La Blancarde, where a transfer between the two lines will be created. La Blancarde train station will become a transit hub: a station on Line 1 of the Marseille Metro will be built, and in 2009 it will be served by TER regional trains. In mid-2008, two further extensions will be opened. Line 1 will be extended to Noailles via an existing tunnel (used by line 68), and Line 2 will be extended north from Eurom√©diterran√©e to Eurom√©diterran√©e-Arenc. = Phase 2: 2011 = In 2011, a third tram line will be created. Line 2 will be modified: it will serve only the section of the existing line from Eurom√©diterran√©e-Arenc to Canabi√®re, where it will be extended south on new track to Castellane and north to Bougainville. A new Line 3 will be created, which will run along the existing Line 2 between La Blancarde and Canabi√®re. It will then run along new track west to Quatre Septembre on the south side of the Vieux-Port. Thus, Line 2 will become a north-south line, and Line 3 will become an east-west line. A new transfer station between Lines 2 and 3 will be built at Cours Saint-Louis. = Rolling stock = Bombardier Flexity Outlook trams used in Marseille Customized Bombardier Flexity Outlook trams are used on the new tram line.

History  The first tram, horse drawn, ran in 1876 on Canebi√®re. The electrification began in 1899 and preceded he delivery of new electric tramcars, all similar as to keep a consistent pool of cars. In 1905, a batch of bogie-tramcars was purchased, these were equipped with trailers and were used on suburban lines. The system comprised purely urban lines and suburban lines, which stretched to outlying villages. Many tram lines joined in the centre of Marseille on the Canebi√®re and harbour, resulting in headways of less than a minute in the centre city. This huge network was modernised by the constant introduction of newer tramcars, to replace the older ones. In 1938, thirty-three trailers were recuperated from Paris. These meant that reversible convoys could be operated. In 1939, the tramway company owned and operated 430 tramcars and 350 trailers and 71 lines. In 1943 a large project, never realised, was designed. This project planned to build large tunnels in the centre of Marseille. The busiest lines would join into two tunnels. In 1949 a further modernisation occurred. The first articulated tramcars was designed and built (Algiers tramway possessed articulated SATRAMO tramcars). These were created by joining two older tramcars. These tramcars remained unique until 1985 when Nantes tramway opened. Marseille city-council did not favour keeping its network of trams. Indeed, unorganised development of the car meant that modernisation and expansion of the tram network was hindered. The process of replacing tramways by trolleybuses and buses began after World War II in 1945 and accelerated from 1950. The first closures meant that Canebi√®re was tramway-free from 1955. The last closure occurred on 21 January 1960. = Line 68 = Line 68 opened in December 1893 and is the only tramway line to remain in service during the later part of the twentieth century. Line 68 stretched from Noailles to Alhambra, serving La Plaine, the Boulevard Chave, the La Blancarde railway station and Saint-Pierre cemetery. The central terminus is situated in a tunnel. This tunnel, built in 1893, is unique in France and was built to give access to the city centre, avoiding the narrow streets of some of Marseilles's suburbs. Because of the problems involved in converting the line to bus use it was decided to keep the line operational. Line 68 is 3 km long and it remained out of use until 1965 when it was decided to modernise it. Line 68 was modernised in 1969 with the introduction of twenty-one PCC tramcars and the whole track was relaid. The first of the PCC cars arrived on 26 December 1968 and the first tram went into service on 20 February 1969. The last of the old tramcars was withdrawn that spring. Modernisation resulted in an increase in passengers. Numbers increased from 4,917,000 passengers in 1968 to 5,239,000 in 1973. Further modernisation was applied to the PCC cars in 1984. Three new cars were delivered and all cars made into double cars. The line closed on Thursday, 8 January 2004 for reconstruction. The short section between La Blancarde and Saint Pierre was reopened as part of a new network on 30 June 2007. The section along Boulevard Chave to Eug√®ne Pierre was due to reopen in October 2007; the tunnel to Noailles was due to reopen in summer 2008.

He considers \\"The Stolen Dormouse... more solidly based,\\" but nonetheless singles out for praise \\"the description of the hero's wedding night, spent under his wife's bed in the company of a tame puma and in the throes of hay fever.\\"Aiken, John K. \\"The Humour of de Camp,\\" in Fantasy Review, v. 3, no. 14, April/May 1949, p. 23. Astounding reviewer P. Schuyler Miller praised the book for \\"provid[ing] more sheer entertainment than any the fantasy publishers have yet given us,\\" noting that de Camp uses his \\"detailed knowledge of history\\" to depict \\"hypothetical future societies which ape those of the past --with differences.\\"Miller, P. Schuyler. \\"Book Reviews,\\" in Astounding Science Fiction, v. 44, no. 1, September 1949, pp. 150-151. Sam Moskowitz saw the influence of Mark Twain in the title story. Calling de Camp \\"the funniest writer in science fiction,\\" he noted that \\"[t]hough the writing was choppy in spots, the details of an utterly unique social set-up, complete with its own slang, was engrossingly worked out and chuckle-provoking.\\"Moskowitz, Sam. Seekers of Tomorrow: Masters of Modern Science Fiction (New York : Ballantine Books, 1967), p. 160. William Mattathias Robins calls the title piece \\"a story of the awakening of political consciousness [in which] Sir Howard progresses from viewing all his relationships in terms of class divisions to respecting people for their merit as individuals,\\" and the second story one \\"which traces a boy's transition to manhood, his developing political awareness, and his winning of his heart's desire.\\" He finds \\"the two stories ... appropriately linked because [each] takes place in the future, with an aristocratic social milieu.\\"Robins, William Mattathias. \\"L. Sprague de Camp,\\" in Dictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science-Fiction Writers, Part 1:A-L (Detroit, Mich., The Gale Group, 1981), pp. 112, 115. According to Earl Terry Kemp \\"[t]his book ... shows de Camp's pre-war work at its best, [and] was a landmark in integrating adventure into the society out of which it arises.\\" He feels the author \\"has played with the forces that form a society in a very amusing way which shows considerable sociological insight\\" and that \\"[a]s is frequently the case with de Camp's work, the ideas behind the story are even more interesting than the stories themselves. De Camp's work is a sort of Lewis Carroll nonsense-made-sensible--and that phrase best describes the two novellas in this book.\\"Kemp, Earl Terry. \\"The Anthem Series, Part One,\\" in eI 27 (v. 5, no. 4), August 2006, item 11.

The cathedral is a national monument Cath√©drale Notre-Dame and is the seat of the Bishopric of Rodez. The closed west front once formed part of the city wall of Rodez. History Rodez was Christianized in the 4th-5th century AD, and the first mention of a cathedral dates from around 516. This structure was rebuilt c. 1000; almost nothing remains of it after the decision to rebuild it from scratch in 1276. The works were halted for many years by the Black Death and the Hundred Years War, and were restarted only in the early 15th century with the completion of the choir and its vault, as well as the transept and of the first sectors of the nave. After the fire of 1510, bishop Fran√ßois d'Estaing had it rebuilt in 1513-1526 under the direction of Antoine Salvan with a new majestic bell tower. The cathedral was completed around 1531. In 1792-98, Pierre M√©chain and Jean- Baptiste Delambre used Rodez Cathedral as the central surveying point for their calculation of the circumference of the earth. This was used in the definition of the metre (see History of the metre). Overview Despite the long construction process, the cathedral is characterized by a remarkable unity of style, which is mostly the Gothic one imported by architect Jean Deschamps into the Midi from northern France. The cathedral is constructed of red sandstone. It has a severe fa√ßade, flanked by two sturdy towers, which betray its defensive function: the west front once formed part of the city walls of Rodez. The belltower, standing at 87‚Äìm, is surmounted by a lantern carrying the statue of the Virgin with a choir of four angels.

She played the long-running role in Series 1 through 4 and also proved to be one of the show's favourite characters with fans. Biography Kaire-Gataulu was born at St. Helens Hospital in Auckland, New Zealand. She began appearing in short films and commercials at the age of 5. She made her acting debut in the short film The Kiwi and The Water Melon (1993) followed by appearances in two other short films, The Birthday (1994) and Clown Story (1996). Her other television roles included parts in The Visitation and the popular action hero show Xena: The Warrior Princess. She also worked as a reporter on What Now. During the series, she was particularly close to co-star Dan Weekes-Hannah (Ved), with whom her character would later become involved in a romantic storyline. While filming The Tribe, Jaimee lived in the cast house with Weekes. During an interview, Weekes claimed that they flirted together and dated, which was against the rules. Weekes claimed that an impromptu train ride to Auckland with Kaire-Gataulu caused them to miss a scheduled shooting. Their absence caused shooting to be rescheduled, costing the studio upwards of one hundred thousand dollars. Both were dropped from the show, Kaire-Gataulu being fired immediately while Weeks was written out later on in the season. The pair broke up soon after The Tribe ceased production. In 2008 Jaimee gave an interview where she talked about life after The Tribe. She is a mother now, to three boys: her eldest son named Phoenix and two toddlers Preston (2012) and Brooklyn (2013).

The east-west passageway spans 2600 kilometers. From Peru's Pacific ocean coastline, it continues across the Andes mountains and through a large part of the Amazon rainforest in the Peruvian department of Madre de Dios. It then travels into Brazil where it connects with a network of existing highways to the Atlantic. It entailed the renovation and construction of roughly 2,600 kilometers of roads and 22 bridges. Completed in 2011, it creates a connected highway from the Peruvian ports of San Juan de Marcona to Brazilian ports and cities throughout the City of Rio Branco ZPE (Special Export Zone). The project came into being via a 2004 agreement between Alejandro Toledo and Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, then presidents of the two countries. In Peru the project is known by the MTC (Ministerio de Transportes y Comunicaciones) as the Corredor Vial Interoce√°nico Sur Per√∫-Brasil (search for 'Corredor Vial Interoce√°nico') and by ProInversion (Private Investment Promotion Agency - Peru) as the Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America, (Iniciativa para la Integraci√≥n de la Infraestructura Regional Suramericana) (IIRSA), SUR axis. The project is part of a national road investment plan which involves the construction of three longitudinal highways, and 20 transversal highways. Parts of these transversal highways make up part of IIRSA SUR. Construction As the project now links three Peruvian ports to Brazil, the route has several branches (map). Furthermore, the construction of the various branches has been divided up into a number of stretches or sections, each of which has been constructed as part of a separate concession. Five concessions were constructed in two blocks: *block of concessions awarded in 2005: **2: Urcos (near Cusco) - Inambari, Inambari District (in the Amazon Basin, near Puerto Maldonado); 300 km of previously unpaved roads **3: Inambari - I√±apari, I√±apari District (on the Brazilian Border, opposite the Brazilian town of Assis Brasil); 403 km of previously unpaved roads **4: Azangaro - Inambari; 306 km of previously unpaved roads *block of concessions awarded in 2007: **1: San Juan de Marcona (Pacific Ocean) - Nazca - Abancay - Cusco ‚Äì Urcos; 763 km of previously paved roads **5: branch 1 Matarani (Pacific Ocean) - Arequipa - Juliaca (near Lake Titicaca) - Azangaro; and branch 2 Ilo (Pacific Ocean) - Moquegua - Humajalso - Puente Gallatini - Puno - Juliaca; 752 km of previously paved roads and 62 km of previously unpaved roads In June 2005, the second, third, and fourth sections were leased to specialized Peruvian and Brazilian consortia of private companies for 25 years, in which they will be responsible for looking after the highway, the built and forthcoming bridges, and tollbooths. The first and the last section were leased in 2007. The Brazilian section runs from the border town of Assis Brasil via BR-317 into the main Brazilian road network through Porto Velho and Cuiab√° via BR-364. The total project has an estimated cost of US$1.3 billion, but some analysts predict a higher cost. Of this, about US $810 million is for stretches 2 - 4, $199 million is for stretches 1 and 5, and the remainder for bridges, urban connections, and overhead. The project employed about 6,000 people during construction. It was inaugurated by Peruvian President Garcia in August 2011 and is now officially complete and operational. However, as of July 2013 some of its bridges across the Madeira River were still not constructed and parts of the rest of the road were not properly built to support truck traffic that would be needed for exporting goods overseas as originally conceived. Andean watershed crossings Two branches of the Interoceanic Highway cross the main Andean watershed. The Urcos - Inambari branch crosses the watershed approximately here, about 7 km (in a straight line) north-east of Urcos (the road distance is much longer). The Azangaro - Inambari branch crosses the watershed approximately here, about 85 km north of Azangaro. Practical results In 2017, it was found that the highway was practically not being used to trade. The average circulation was only seven commercial vehicles per hour, an extremely low average. According to the Peruvian authorities, there were basically no Brazilian products on the way to the ports in Peru. Rodovia Interoce√¢nica frustra previs√£o de integrar Brasil ao Pac√≠fico In 2020, official figures showed that, of the US $ 246 million exported or imported by Acre between 2009 and 2019, just over 18% were made by the road (about US $ 44.6 million was the value of the goods transacted by highway). The realization was that the highway was only designed to make the construction company Odebrecht, accused of corruption in the governments of the socialist Lula da Silva, make money. Em dez anos, s√≥ 18% de tudo o que o Acre comprou e vendeu passaram pela Rodovia Interoce√¢nica  Other Trans-Andean transport projects  There is an intention to build another route between Paita and Yurimaguas, both in Peru, to give river access to the Amazon and Brazil.

It closed in November 2013. Despite indications that the arts centre would be at the forefront of West Bromwich's 'Golden Future' on 9 May 2013 it was announced that Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council were in discussion with Sandwell College to potentially lease The Public for use as a sixth-form college. The College's own sixth-form is oversubscribed with six applicants for every place. In 2012‚Äì13 there were 380,000 visitors to the building from all sections of society ‚Äì an increase of over 40% from the previous year. The Public's mission is to be a place where people come to create and make things for themselves and to enjoy other people's creativity ‚Äì an echo of Cedric Price's concept of a Fun Palace. In 2012, The Guardians Robert Clark described The Public as \\"a playground for adults\\" and that \\"maybe that's a good role for a contemporary art gallery to embrace\\". It is also home to 27 small companies as well as the Sandwell Arts Trust, who manage the building. Between them they employ around 120 people with a further 120 digital media apprentices. An article in the previously critical Express and Star in 2012 demonstrated that The Public was finally winning local people over and had found its purpose, and that the odds of it having become one of the region's success stories had been quite remote in the recent past. The Public closed on 23 November 2013. Overview The project grew out of the work by Jubilee Arts (founded 1974) whose mission was to enhance the lives of the local community through artistic programmes and endeavours. One aim of this group was to create a building which would serve as a permanent piece of art, be visually and structurally challenging and provide a place for community groups to gather to carry on the vision of Jubilee Arts. British architect Will Alsop was selected to design the building with construction beginning in May 2003. Running over budget and with a number of organisations supporting the project going into liquidation and administration, The Public finally opened to visitors in 2008 (chiefly the ground floor), with construction of the ramp and digital artworks being completed in 2009. The building was finally completed in 2010 with the opening of its Level 2 Conference Suite and finalisation of office space on Level 4. The building is now operated and run by Sandwell Arts Trust (established August 2009) and features exhibition space, interactive art works, cafe bar, theatre, conference and meeting rooms and office space. By end of June 2013, Sandwell Arts Trust have indicated that 1,000,000 visitors will have been through the doors.  Arts Centre  Despite all its problems, The Public became an icon of the region and drew in visitors from the local area as well the Midlands and beyond. It was still reliant on public-subsidy but also gained income from hires, tenants and events, and planned to increase earned income once the building work that had surrounded was completed in summer 2013. The visual arts programme attracted work by notable contemporary artists, alongside work by local artists. This approach helped raise the profile of art in an area where participation had been low. In summer 2013 Ordinary/Extra/Ordinary, curated by David Thorp was the main show, bringing together work by Tracey Emin, David Shrigley, Jeremy Deller among others as well as a new commission from Birmingham artist Lucy McLauchlan. Later in the summer, the Annual Summer Open was due to show local talent. Previous exhibitions included The Art of Motion with work by Maurice Broomfield, a collaboration with other local art organisations and schools celebrating the work of local popular author Janet and Allan Ahlberg and contributions from well-known artists including photographer Martin Parr. The Public was home to an eclectic programme of events with comedy shows from established names like Al Murray, Jenny Eclair and Alexei Sayle, music featuring up and coming bands as well as a wide range of activities from tea dancing to knitting that were led by local people.  History  The construction and early history of the building were beset by many problems. The development had been highly controversial and encountered financial difficulties, going into administration before the expected opening date of July 2006, due to the withholding of a final tranche of ¬£2 million that was due to be contributed by Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council. Further controversy surrounded plans by The Public Gallery Limited to introduce a regular entry fee of ¬£6.95. These plans were scrapped and The Arts Council agreed to a further ¬£3 million grant, allowing The Public to grant free entry to the gallery to allow it to open in 2008‚Äì2009. In November 2004 Alsop Architects left the project and architect Julian Flannery of Flannery & de la Pole took responsibility for the detailed design of the building interiors and for overseeing construction, which at that stage was around one third complete. In the summer of 2006 the practice developed a new brief and completion strategy for the project and several areas of the building, such as the Theatre, the Pink Tank Cafe and the Level 2 Flexible Space were fully redesigned. Following the issue and problems, Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council took over the building in 2009 and established the organisation Sandwell Arts Trust (a subsidiary of Sandwell Leisure Trust) to run and operate the building under license.

As of August 2006 the association consists of 44 clubs and 115 registered gigs. This does not include gigs used in the Isles of Scilly. History of the Cornish Pilot Gig Association The first 'gigs' were built in the late 18th century and were used to carry the 'pilot' out to ships waiting off the Cornish coasts. The pilot would then navigate the ship through the potentially hazardous rocks into the harbour. Pilots needed to row out to the ships quickly - it was a competitive career as the first man to reach the waiting ship would receive the pilot's fee. Gig racing evolved both from this competition and from the testing of newly built gigs against others to measure their performance. Competitive gig racing was popular in Cornwall during the mid-19th century, but by the end of the century began to decline as the industrial revolution gathered speed and engines increasingly replaced sails and oars. Many gigs were subsequently broken up or left to rot, but Newquay in Cornwall managed to retain a few and formed Newquay Rowing Club in 1921. One of their boats, 'Treffry' built in 1838 still races and is used as the standard measurement for the construction of all new boats. Newquay Rowing Club also owns two other historic gigs: 'Dove' built in 1820 and 'Newquay' built in 1812 - which is considered to be the oldest rowing boat in the world. Between 1985 and 1986 four new gig clubs were formed (Truro, Cadgwith, Roseland and Mount's Bay). This was in addition to Newquay Rowing Club (formed in 1922) and the small number of rowing clubs that existed around the coast. During 1986 George Northey (Newquay Rowing Club), John Bawden and Ralph Bird all felt that a specification should be laid down as to how the new gigs should be built. A meeting was called for 5 December 1986, with total of 14 gentlemen attending. It was decided that the new gigs would be built to the specification laid down by the Peters family, which built the gigs 'Treffry' (1838), which is still actively rowed by the Newquay Rowing Club. It was decided that there would only be one officer which would be elected as the Chairperson and he would carry out the measuring of the gig during the construction phase to make sure the gig complied with the new specifications. The committee met again in the January 1987 at the Royal Hotel in Truro and accepted the plans that had been drawn up by Ralph Bird. In the meeting it was decided that the association would be called the Cornish Pilot Gig Association.

Background  According to their website, the mission of the Conference is: > to advance the effectiveness, independence and integrity of legislatures and > to foster interstate cooperation . . . especially in support of state > sovereignty and state flexibility and protection from unfunded federal > mandates and unwarranted federal preemption. The conference promotes > cooperation between state legislatures in the U.S. and those in other > countries. . . . [and] is committed to improving the operations and > management of state legislatures, and the effectiveness of legislators and > legislative staff. NCSL also encourages the practice of high standards of > conduct by legislators and legislative staff. NCSL maintains an office in Denver, Colorado and Washington, D.C. Eight Standing Committees, composed of legislators and legislative staff appointed by the leadership of the legislatures, serve as the central organizing mechanism for NCSL members. Each Committee provides a means by which state legislators can share experience, information, and advice on a variety of state issues ranging from policy to management. Committees meet together twice each year at the NCSL Capitol Forum and NCSL's Legislative Summit to adopt state-federal legislative policies that will ultimately guide NCSL's lobbying efforts in Washington, D.C. These committee meetings also serve as an opportunity for states to network and establish flows of information as well as experience-based suggestions from other states. In addition to the NCSL Capitol Forum and the Legislative Summit, NCSL builds the state legislative community by hosting various web seminars, leadership meetings, and access to relevant websites and online documents throughout the year. Issues spanning multiple committee jurisdictions are managed by NCSL's Task Forces. Unlike the permanent Standing Committees, Task Forces are created for a specific period time and aim to develop positions on highly complex and controversial issues such as immigration reform and welfare. Task Forces are composed of 20 to 30 legislators and legislative staff who are appointed by the NCSL president or staff chair. Day-to-day operations of the organization managed by its Executive Director, Tim Storey. The organization is led by a legislator who serves as its president and by a legislative staffer who serves as staff chair. Twenty years after its founding, NCSL was led in 1994 by its first female president, former Congresswoman Karen McCarthy. Its first African- American president, Rep. Dan Blue, served in 1998‚Äì99. The 2019‚Äì20 president of NCSL is Representative Robin Vos of Wisconsin, and the staff chair is Martha Wigton of Georgia. Each year, NCSL's presidency alternates between legislators of the Republican and Democratic parties. The NCSL is considered part of the 'Big Seven', a group of organizations that represent local and state government in the United States.

Task forces NCSL uses task forces to complement the work of the 8 standing committees. Composed of legislators and legislative staff, task forces are temporary and deal with issues that cut across the jurisdictions of multiple standing committees. Currently, there are 8 task forces: *Agriculture *Cybersecurity *Energy Supply *Immigration and the States *Innovations in State Health Systems *Insurance *International Relations *Military and Veterans Affairs *State and Local Taxation Policy positions In the most general terms, NCSL works to enhance the role of states in the federal system. NCSL opposes unfunded federal mandates and federal preemption of state authority, providing state legislatures with the flexibility to implement policy solutions. NCSL supports enactment of the Main Street Fairness Act, which would simplify existing sales tax collection laws. The Act would grant states the authority to require all sellers, including online merchants, to collect sales and use taxes, generating billions of dollars of tax revenue for state governments. Events NCSL organizes two annual events for the general membership: *NCSL Capitol Forum *Legislative Summit (Annual Meeting) The Legislative Summit is the largest of these events, partly because it occurs in the summer when state legislatures are in recess. Its location varies year to year. The NCSL Capitol Forum alternates between Washington D.C. and a location that varies year to year.

The cathedral is the seat of the Bishop of Saint-Brieuc and Tr√©guier. It was declared a minor basilica on 3 September 1875 and is a monument historique. Introduction The Cathƒódrale St-√âtienne on the Place du Gƒónƒóral de Gaulle in Saint-Brieuc has the look of a fortress, and did, in fact, fulfil the role of a church-fortress (\\"cath√©drale-forteresse\\") on many occasions when the town was laid siege to in earlier times. The central porch is flanked by two sturdy towers: the 14th-century Tour Brieuc. which is 92 feet high and the 15th- century Tour Marie, which is 108 feet in height. These towers have loop-holes and machicolations which would have allowed the use of a variety of defensive weapons and are supported by stout buttresses. The two arms of the transept jut far out and are protected by towers with pepper-pot roofs. Although stripped of many of its treasures by the zealots of the French Revolution, it still holds many splendid artefacts and works of art. The Chapelle de l'Annonciation has, for example, a superb baroque altarpiece and the organ was built by Cavaill√©-Coll, famous for having built the organ in the Church of Saint-Sulpice in Paris. The south arm of the transept is lit by 15th-century stained-glass windows and the tomb of Saint-Guillaume is amongst the many tombs and enfeu scattered throughout the building. The cathedral has an 18th- century pulpit and some interesting Stations of the Cross carved in 1958 by Georges Saupique Brieuc was born in the 5th or 6th-century in Wales and at an early age was entrusted to the care of Saint Germain. He stayed in Germain's monastery until he reached the age of twenty-four when he was made a priest. He decided to travel to the Armorican peninsula and set off with a group of monks, his mission to convert the local people to Christianity. He founded a monastery at what is now Tr√©guier but when called back to Wales because of a terrible plague there, he left his nephew Tugdual in charge. When he returned he found Tugdual totally in control and set off along the L√©guer estuary, landed where Saint-Brieuc stands today and founded a monastery after firstly setting up a modest oratory. Later he had the first cathedral built and took the role of bishop for himself. History of the cathedral The first church or oratory on this site was built in wood in the 6th century, and a replacement building was erected in around 970. Nothing remains today of these two constructions. The 10th century saw many attacks on Saint-Brieuc by the Normans, so much so that the relics of Saint-Brieuc which had been kept here were moved to the Saint-Serge Abbey in Angers for protection. The building we see today was commenced in around 1180 during the episcopacy of Bishop Geffroy de H√©non and building was well advanced when in 1212 Bishop Pierre was buried at the base of the Tour Brieuc. Pierre had brought the Saint-Brieuc relics back to the town from Angers in October 1210. Work on the building's west fa√ßade continued under the bishopric of Monseigneur Guillaume Pinchon from his arrival in 1220 to his exile to Poitiers in 1228 following Pinchon's conflict with Pierre Mauclerc. When he returned in 1231, he had a chapel built on the south side of the building, this dedicated to Saint Mathurin. His wish was to be buried in the chapel and this happened in 1234. The construction work was finished by Pinchon's successor Philippe before his departure to the Holy Land in 1248. It was Bishop Philippe who moved to have Pinchon canonised on 12 April 1247. Over one hundred years later the cathedral suffered much damage at the hands of the English during the destructive War of the Breton Succession and then by a fire at the end of 1353. After the fire, Bishop Guy de Montfort made the reconstruction a priority and started work on the choir which was completed between 1354 and 1357. Under de Montfort's successor, Hugues de Montrelais, whose bishopric ran from 1357 to 1375, the new cathedral was finished, but in 1394 the town was under siege again, this time by Olivier de Clisson and again was badly damaged. Now Bishop Guillaume Angier took charge of the reconstruction necessary and apart from the reconstruction of the choir, he finalised the long-awaited construction of the Tour Marie. Then Bishop Jean de Malestroit reconstructed the gable of the north wing of the transept and had a magnificent window installed there, sadly destroyed by the storm of 1735. By the beginning of the 15th century, the cathedral was finished and between 1460 and 1472, Bishop John Prigent began the construction of the chapel of the Annunciation. Finally, the nineteenth and twentieth centuries saw much restoration and important works including the repair of the vaulting and work on the window framing. As we have seen in this brief summary, the cathedral had to be rebuilt on many occasions this as a consequence of military attacks or natural disasters.

Ironwork by Pierre Fran√ßois Marie Boulanger File:Saint-Brieuc (22) Cath√©drale 05.JPGThe central portal of the western face of the Cath√©drale Saint-√âtienne in Saint-Brieuc The cathedral interior The remains of many canons of the cathedral are buried under the paving of the south aisle of the nave and an enfeu holds the tomb of Monseigneur Le Porc de la Porte who died in 1632 and was bishop at Saint- Brieuc from 1618 to 1632. The gisant on the tomb dates to the 17th century. This tomb came to the cathedral in 1833 when the Ursulines chapel had been destroyed. Le Porc de la Porte had founded that chapel. The nave has seven crossings with aisles and to the right of the fourth crossing is the Chapelle des Fonts Baptismaux which has a 16th-century granite font decorated by Alain de L√©on. The chapel contains an oil painting depicting John the Baptist at work. To the right of the last three crossings is the Chapelle de l'Annonciation whilst along the north side of the nave is the Porche du Martray and the Sacristy. The transept has two symmetrical wings and the main altar stands on a platform in the centre. The north wing of the transept had some beautiful fenestration dating to the early 15th century, but this was destroyed in a huge storm in 1735. The windows were replaced in 1852 and restored in the 20th century. The Choir is surrounded by a circular ambulatory from which emerge various side chapels A view along the nave of Saint Etienne cathedral in Saint-Brieuc. Note the enfeu or walled tombs and two of Saupique's \\"stations of the Cross\\" The cathedral exterior The West Porch is the best entrance to use to access the cathedral. Once inside six steps lead down to the floor of the nave and from here one has a good view of the altar erected at the crossing of the transept. The west porch was first built in the 15th century at the time the south tower was erected and was completely rebuilt in 1888. The west porch gable dates to the 13th century but was reworked in the 14th century and a rose window was added in the 16th century. Two doors give access to the cathedral, and the trumeau is decorated with a standing Virgin Mary which came from the Chapelle Saint-Colomban in Peumerit- Quintin. The North porch is known as the \\"du Matray\\" and was reconstructed in 1856. The tympanum is decorated with \\"Une Vierge √† l'oiseau\\" in polychromed wood. The Sacristy was added between the arm of the transept and the north aisle of the nave in the 15th century.The north gable of the transept has a large window destroyed during the French Revolution and completely replaced in 1852. It is topped by a clock tower dating to 1836 which replaced an earlier tower dated 1618. The cathedral has two towers. The Tour du Nordic or the Tour Brieuc is 28 metres high and holds two bells. The Tour du Midi is higher at 33 metres and holds three bells. The latter tower was built in the 15th-century partly as a consequence of the sieges of 1375 and 1394 and its spire was added in 1852. The gable of the north transept built with much red granite quarried in the local area has a modern window, the old window having been destroyed in the French revolution. The gable is topped by an 18th-century clock, and for many years this was the only clock in the town. The chevet has a small door called the \\"Porte de la Vierge\\". Above the door is a small window to a room which served as the chapter prison. The gable of the south transept has an ornate 15th-century window in the \\"flamboyant\\" style an addition which owed much to the generosity of Olivier de Clisson. The choir, the ambulatory and surrounding chapels The master altar is located in the centre of the transept and the choir area is surrounded by an ambulatory with 12th-century stylobates and columns which give access to various side chapels. On the \\"gospel\\" side or north side of the choir, the first side chapel is the Chapelle Saint-Giles. This chapel dates back to the 14th century, was reconstructed in the 16th century and was founded by Blanche d'Avaugour, the Lady of Kergroix. It contains a stairway giving access to the upper floors. On the exterior wall is a tomb thought to be the burial place of Bishop Guillaume VI Anger who died in 1404. His episcopacy commenced in 1385. Next is the Chapelle des Morts de la Guerre and then what was the Chapelle de Montfort which is no longer in use. We then reach the chevet and the apsidal chapel called La Chapelle Notre-Dame de la Cherche, also called the Chapelle de la Vierge , It was constructed in 1343 by Roland de Dinan and Cl√©mence d'Avaugour replacing an 11th-century chapel. On the left-hand side of the chapel entrance, there is an alabaster statue of the Virgin Mary with child. The child holds a bird in his right hand. On the right-hand side of the entrance is another statue of the Virgin Mary in gilded wood. It dates to the 18th century. The windows in the chapel are of 19th-century vintage save for the central window, which is by the stained glass artist Hubert de Sainte-Marie. The chapel has two tombs set within its walls. On the north wall is the tomb of Guillaume Beschard, who was the bishop from 1379 to 1385, and on the south wall the tomb of Guy Eder, the bishop from 1428 to 1431. Facing the apsidal chapel is the tomb of Canon Fran√ßois de Boisgelin which dates to 1633. Now on the south side of the ambulatory, we encounter the Chapelle Sainte-Anne which was established by Christophe de Penmarc'h between 1471 and 1505. De Penmarc'h arms can be seen in the keystone of the chapel's vaulting. The chapel contains a marble statue of Monseigneur Augustin David. David was the bishop at Saint- Brieuc for 20 years. He had a great interest in the arts and founded the local Societ√© d'√©mulation d'arch√©ologie et d'histoire in 1861. His tomb was carved from white marble by Henri Chapu in 1891. The altar is made from wood and has a work by Elie Le Goff entitled \\"Saint-Brieuc et le miracle des loups\\" which dates to 1891. The chapel was built by Bishop Christophe de Penmarc'h. In the chapel, there are also traces of the tomb of Alain de Penmarc'h who was Christophe's nephew and a canon at Saint-Brieuc and the tombstone of canon Rolland de la Fruglaye who died on 1 September 1454. Statue of Saint-Brieuc by Elie le Goff dated 1891. In old age, St. Brieuc is said to have been travelling in a cart, singing hymns together with a group of monks walking alongside, when suddenly they were surrounded by a pack of wolves. His companions fled, but Brieuc confronted the beasts fearlessly with the sign of the cross offered in benediction and they knelt before him humbly. The next chapel is the Chapelle Saint Yves which dates to the 15th-century and was commissioned by Christophe de Penmarc'h and his brother Louis. De Penmarc'h's coat of arms can be seen in the vaulting keystone. The chapel contains the 19th-century tombstone of Monseigneur Bouch√© and a 19th-century black bronze figure of Christ by Just Andr√© Fran√ßois Becquet, the French sculptor born in Besan√ßon in 1829 and who died in Paris in 1907. There is also a statue of Saint-Yves dating to 1892 by the sculptor Jean-Marie Valentin. The Chapelle des Reliques is the final chapel off the south side of the choir and can be traced back to the 13th century. It is accessed through a door in the Chapelle Saint Yves. Originally a courtyard, it was roofed over in the 14th century and was known as the \\"Petite Tr√©sorerie\\". In 1897 Monseigneur Falli√®res transformed it into a chapel to hold relics. The ornate reliquaries held within date to the 19th century and are said to contain a piece of the actual cross (\\"la Vraie Croix\\") and a thorn from the crown of thorns. The reliquaries also contain the skull of Saint Guillaume and a relic of Saint Brieuc. The chapel is secured by an ornate iron gate. The most important chapel in the cathedral is found by the south facade of the nave. The CHAPELLE DE L'ANNONCIATION or SAINT-SACREMENT The statues of Saint-Fran√ßois de Sales and Saint-Vincent-de-Paul Originally the chapel was dedicated to Saint-Guillaume or Saint-Mathurin and was built between 1462 and 1472 on the initiative of the bishop Jean Prigent, this confirmed by a shield decorating the door in the south of the chapel which bears Prigent's arms. Prigent's work on the chapel was completed by his successor Pierre de Laval (1472-1477). The altar \\"Autel du Saint-Sacrement\\" dates from the 18th-century and was restored in 1977. It was executed by the sculptor Yves Corlay and has panels with relief carvings of the resurrection and the ascension in the central panel. The altar is decorated with statues of the Angel Gabriel, and the Virgin Mary as well as Saint Michael and the guardian angel. On the wall opposite are statues of a mitred Saint-Fran√ßois de Sales on the left and Saint-Vincent-de-Paul on the right. These two saints were founders of the \\"Congr√©gation des Dames de la Croix\\". The altar had been made originally for the chapel of the \\"Filles de la Croix\\" and had been saved during the revolution. As with many baroque altars there is a mirror placed above the altar placed between two angels. It is in the Saint-Sacrement chapel that one sees the enfeus of Monseigneur Le M√©e and Monseigneur Fretat de Boissieux. The chapel of Saint Guillaume The tomb of Saint-Guillaume Pinchon, Bishop of Saint-Brieuc from 1220 to 1224. Note the elaborate reliquary above the gisant. Also, the two bishop's crooks fixed to the wall Only in 1956 were Saint Guillaume's remains placed in this chapel which had in earlier times served as the baptistery. When in the 17th-century the fonts were moved to a spot near to the Porche du Martray, the chapel was renamed the Chapelle de Saint-Joseph. The replacement tomb of Guillaume Pinchon can be seen in this chapel which was erected during the 12th and 13th- century. The replacement tomb was the work of the sculptor Hernot of Lannion. Pinchon was responsible for much of the 13th-century construction of the cathedral. In earlier days his tomb which dated to the 15th-century was located in the Chapelle de l'Annonciation but this was smashed during the revolution. A reliquary sits above the replacement tomb and contains relics of the saint. Also in this chapel is the tomb of Canon Fran√ßois de la Rue buried there in 1861 and the tomb of Monseigneur Martial with a statue by Og√© senior, one of his late works. The stained glass window of the south wing of the transept The rose window in the south transept. Further images of this eight lancet window with its elaborate tympanum can be seen at the end of the article The image top left depicts the story of manna in the desert and that top right depicts the feeding of the multitude. Bottom left is a depiction of the last supper and bottom right the story of the Easter lamb. In the centre the images deal with the treaty of Nic√©e, the \\"Fourth Council of the Lateran\\" and the \\"Council of Trent\\" This window is one of the great treasures of the cathedral. A statue of Saint-Yves has been placed on the wall nearby in recent years. It is a 16th-century work and was donated to the cathedral by a family in Chatelaudren. The fenestration itself dates to the 15th-century whilst the 60 metre stained glass window dates to 1863. It concentrates on the theme of the eucharist and the sacrement depicts various biblical stories; manna in the desert, the Feeding the multitude story, the Last supper and the Easter lamb. The two central compartments recall the treaties of Nic√©e in 325, the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215 and the Council of Trent in 1545. Under this window are statues of John the Evangelist and Thomas Aquinas both dating to the 19th century. The stained glass window in the apsidal chapel the \\"Chapelle de la Vierge\\" The cathedral's chevet was built in 1343 by Roland de Dinan and Cl√©mence d'Avaugour. On each side of the chapel entrance are statues. One, on the left, depicts the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus who holds a bird in his hand. That on the right is an 18th-century statue of the Virgin Mary in gilded wood. The chapel window dates to the end of the 19th century. It depicts events from the life of the Virgin Mary. The panels from left to right depict Mary's birth, The Annunciation and the visit to Elizabeth, the Dormition and Assumption (this a modern piece the original having been destroyed accidentally), the Nativity, Jesus' presentation in the temple and Pope Pie IX proclaiming Mary's Immaculate conception. Oil paintings The cathedral has an oil painting of Pope Gregory 1 by the artist A Hubert dated 1827. There is also a painting of the \\"Sainte Famille\\" and the \\"Nativity\\". This painting dates to the 17th-century and whilst the artist is not known it is said to be \\"after\\" Jean Jouvenet. Also in the cathedral are the paintings \\"Le martyr de saint Etienne\\" by A.d'Hardivillers and \\"Jesus et le paralytique\\" by P. Bisson. Tombs The cathedral contains the tomb of Monseigneur Jacques Jean-Pierre Le M√©e who was bishop of Saint-Brieuc and Tr√©guier from 1841 to 1858 succeeding Monseigneur Le Groing de la Romag√®re. He was the superior of the \\"Filles du Saint-Esprit\\", held a synod for them in 1851, and built a new seminary. He founded Saint-Brieuc's √©cole Saint-Charles, Guingamp's Notre-Dame institute and the Saint-Joseph college at Quintin. He died on the 31 July 1858 at the age of 64. The effigy of Le M√©e, kneeling at a prie-dieu was the work of Pierre-Marie-Fran√ßois Og√© and dates to 1859. The tomb stands in an enfeu originally holding the tomb of Jean Prigent who had built the chapel in 1472. This had been destroyed during the French Revolution. The tomb of Monseigneur Jacques Jean Pierre Le M√©e It also holds the tomb of Monseigneur Le Groing la Romag√®re. This elaborate tomb was the work of the sculptor Pierre-Marie-Fran√ßois Og√© in 1841. Detail of the tomb of Monseigneur Mathias Le Groing de La Romag√®re, bishop of Saint-Brieuc and Treguier from 1817 to 1841 The cathedral's altar The cathedral's high altar is made from marble and was made in 1831 at Rennes by Pince based on designs by the architect Richelot. The altar in the transept was created by the Rennes sculptor H√©rault in 1854 and is decorated with statues by the sculptor Og√© senior. The cathedral's cathedra or \\"tr√¥ne √©piscopal\\" is the work of the Etienne brothers from Tr√©v√©. The organ and organ casing The Cavaill√©-Coll organ The Cavaill√©-Coll organ was built in 1848 replacing a much smaller instrument. Aristide Cavaill√©-Coll is one of the great organ makers of France. The instrument was classified as a \\"Monument historique\\" in 1975. From 1986 to 1988 the organ was restored by Jean Renault. The organ casing or buffet in French was made in the 19th century by the √âtienne brothers. They included in the work some panels which came originally from England in 1540. The casing was classified as a \\"Monument historique\\" in 1906 when the cathedral itself was similarly classified. The organ is also decorated with a statue of sainte Cecilia by Jean-Marie Valentin. The cathedral's Treasury By the entrance to the ambulatory a grilled door leads to the Chapelle des reliques called La Petite Tr√©sorerie. The principal relics kept here are those of saint-Brieuc and saint-Guillaume and a thorn from the crown of thorns called \\"Saint-Bro\\".

It has been a monument historique since 30 October 1906.Base Merimee The cathedral is the seat of the Bishops of Saint-Flour. It is a Gothic structure, built between 1398 and 1466. History A first church was built to house the remains of Florus, a bishop of dubious historicity and first legendary apostle of Upper Auvergne. This building is attested by a papal bull of Pope Gregory V at the end of the 10th century.Jo√´l Fouilheron, La cath√©drale de Saint-Flour, (Nouvelles √©ditions latines, 1966), p. 14. In the 11th century, Odilon de Merc≈ìur, Abbot of Cluny built a Romanesque basilica that Pope Urban II consecrated in 1095 under the triple name of Saint-Sauveur, Saint-Pierre and Saint-Flour. In the 14th century, Pope John XXII created the dioces of Saint Flour.Albert Rigaudi√®re, Saint-Flour, ville d'Auvergne au bas Moyen √Çge: √©tude d'histoire administrative et financi√®re, (Publication Universitaire de Rouen, 1982), p. 67. In 1396 there was a partial collapse of the north side of the building. Bishop Hugues de Manhac oversaw the reconstruction in spite of a difficult situation (one hundred years war, plague). A new, Gothic cathedral with three naves and four towers (two on the west and one on each side) was consecrated by Bishop Antoine de Montgon in 1466. During the French Revolution in 1793, the building was ransacked and transformed into a temple of the Supreme Being. The cathedral was restored to a church in 1802. Between 1846 and 1856, important restoration work was undertaken under the leadership of Monseigneur de Marguerye, bishop of Saint- Flour. The two lateral towers are demolished between 1862 and 1866. The cathedral is classified as a historical monument on October 30, 1906.http://www2.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD;_1=REF&VALUE;_1=PA00093609 In 2010, Bruno Grua,bishop of Saint-Flour commissioned new works on the building.

Located in the Bullfrog Mining District south of Tonopah, Gold Center was established in December 1904 with a United States Post Office being authorized on January 21, 1905. The town began publishing its own newspaper in 1907. The location of the town was ideal as it was on the stagecoach route to Rhyolite and Beatty. It was also near the Amargosa River, allowing sufficient water for drinking and for two mills and an ice house. Gold Center also sold water to Rhyolite and Carrara. The Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad, the Las Vegas & Tonopah Railroad and the Bullfrog Goldfield Railroad all ran through Gold Center. Gold Center also had the first brewery in the area which was built underground to maintain a cool temperature. Today, little remains of the original town other than the foundations of a stamp mill, the footers for a tank at the cyanide plant and sections of the water line that ran between Gold Center and Carrara. It is a ghost town. However, what is left of the town does now sit along the paved road connecting U.S. Highway 95 to Beatty's airport. On January 22, 2011, new life came to the area in the form of Nevada's newest legal bordello when, somewhat appropriately given the area's railway history, a retired short-line railroad owner by the name of Guy Brenkman opened Bikini's Gentlemen's Club off Airport Road in Gold Center.

Life Giacomo was born in Viterbo in the Papal States around the year 1255. Little information is available regarding his early years. It is presumed that he joined the Order of St. Augustine around the year 1272, and he is first mentioned in the surviving historical records in the year 1283 in the capitular acts of the Augustinians‚Äô Roman province as a recently appointed lecturer in the Convent of Viterbo, meaning that he must have spent the previous five years from 1278 to 83 in the University of Paris, because the Augustinian Order required its lecturers to be trained in Theology in that city for a duration of five years. Giacomo returned to Paris soon after his appointment in Viterbo because his name is again mentioned in the capitular acts in 1288, where he is mentioned as holding a Bachelor of Theology degree from the University of Paris. After the completion of his studies, Giacomo was appointed Master of Theology in either 1292 or 1293, and taught in Paris for the next seven years, during which time his output was extensive as all of his works in the fields of speculative theology and metaphysics date from this time. Around the year 1300, he was named as a member of the governing council of the Augustinian Roman Province by the Augustinians‚Äô General Chapter, and in May 1300, he became regent master of the order's studium generale in Naples. These two years proved to be the last of his academic career, because Pope Boniface VIII appointed him as Archbishop of Benevento in September 1302, possibly as a sign of gratitude for Giacomo's support for the Pope against the King Philip IV in his treatise, De regimine christiano (On Christian Rulership). In December 1302, at the request of King Charles II of Naples, Giacomo was transferred to the Archbishopric of Naples, and remained there until his death in 1307.C√¥t√©, Antoine, \\"James of Viterbo\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition), Edward N.

History  The T.38 fax relay standard was devised in 1998 as a way to permit faxes to be transported across IP networks between existing Group 3 (G3) fax terminals. T.4 and related fax standards were published by the ITU in 1980, before the rise of the Internet. In the late 1990s, VoIP, or Voice over IP, began to gain ground as an alternative to the conventional Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). However, because most VoIP systems are optimized (through their use of aggressive lossy bandwidth-saving compression) for voice rather than data calls, conventional fax machines worked poorly or not at all on them due to the network impairments such as delay, jitter, packet loss, and so on. Thus, some way of transmitting fax over IP was needed.  Overview  In practical scenarios, a T.38 fax call has at least part of the call being carried over PSTN, although this is not required by the T.38 definition, and two T.38 devices can send faxes to each other. This particular type of device is called Internet-Aware Fax device, or IAF, and it is capable of initiating or completing a fax call towards the IP network. The typical scenario where T.38 is used is - T.38 Fax relay - where a T.30 fax device sends a fax over PSTN to a T.38 Fax gateway which converts or encapsulates the T.30 protocol into T.38 data stream. This is then sent either to a T.38 enabled end point such as fax machine or fax server or another T.38 Gateway that converts it back to PSTN PCM or analog signal and terminates the fax on a T.30 device. The T.38 recommendation defines the use of both TCP and UDP to transport T.38 packets. Implementations tend to use UDP, due to TCP's requirement for acknowledgement packets and resulting retransmission during packet loss, which introduces delays. When using UDP, T.38 copes with packet loss by using redundant data packets. T.38 is not a call setup protocol, thus the T.38 devices need to use standard call setup protocols to negotiate the T.38 call, e.g. H.323, SIP & MGCP. Operation A diagram showing how the T.30 protocol can utilize the T.38 protocol There are two primary ways that fax transactions are conveyed across packet networks. The T.37 standard specifies how a fax image is encapsulated in e-mail and transported, ultimately, to the recipient using a store-and- forward process through intermediary entities. T.38, however, defines a protocol that supports the use of the T.30 protocol in both the sender and recipient terminals. (See diagram above.) T.38 lets one transmit a fax across an IP network in real time, just as the original G3 fax standards did for the traditional (time-division multiplexed (TDM)) network, also called the public switched telephone network or PSTN. A special protocol is needed for real-time fax over IP (Internet Protocol) since existing fax terminals only supported PSTN connections, where the information flow was generally smooth and uninterrupted, as opposed to the jittery arrival of IP packets. The trick was to come up with a protocol that makes the IP network ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù to the endpoint fax terminals, which would mean the user of a legacy fax terminal need not know that the fax call was traversing an IP network. The network interconnections supported by T.38 are shown above. The two fax terminals on either side of the figure communicate using the T.30 fax protocol published by the ITU in 1980. Interconnection of the PSTN with the IP packet network requires a ‚Äúgateway‚Äù between the PSTN and IP networks. PSTN-IP Gateways support TDM voice on the PSTN side and VoIP and FoIP on the packet side. For voice sessions, the gateway will take in voice packets on the IP side, accumulate a few packets to ensure a smooth flow of TDM data upon their release, and then meter them out over TDM where they eventually are heard by a human or stored on a computer for later playback. The gateway employs packet- management techniques to enhance the quality of the speech in the presence of network errors by taking advantage of the natural ability of a listener to not really hear the occasional missing or repeated packet. But facsimile data are transmitted by modems, which aren't as forgiving as the human ear is for speech. Missing packets will often cause a fax session to fail at worst or create one or more image lines in error at best. So the job of T.38 is to ‚Äúfool‚Äù the terminal into ‚Äúthinking‚Äù that it's communicating directly with another T.30 terminal. It will also correct for network delays with so-called spoofing techniques, and missing or delayed packets with fax-aware buffer- management techniques. Spoofing refers to the logic implemented in the protocol engine of a T.38 relay that modifies the protocol commands and responses on the TDM side to keep network delays on the IP side from causing the transaction to fail. This is done, for example, by padding image lines or deliberately causing a message to be re-transmitted to render network delays transparent to the sending/receiving fax terminals. Networks that do not have packet loss or excessive delay can exhibit acceptable fax performance without T.38, provided the PCM clocks in all gateways are of very high accuracy (explained below). T.38 not only removes the effect of PCM clocks not being synchronized, but also reduces the required network bandwidth by a factor of 10, while it corrects for packet loss and delay. =Bandwidth reduction= As shown in the diagram below, a T.38 gateway is composed of two primary elements: the fax modems and the T.38 subsystem. The fax modems modulate and demodulate the PCM samples of the analog data, turning the sampled-data representation of the fax terminal's analog signal to its binary translation, and vice versa. The PSTN network samples the analog signal of a voice or modem signal (it doesn't know the difference) 8,000 times per second (SPS), and encodes them as 8-bit data bytes. This means 8000 samples-per-second times 8-bits per sample, or 64,000 bits per second (bit/s) to represent the modem (or voice) data in one direction. For both directions the modem transaction consumes 128,000 bits of network bandwidth. However, the typical modem in a fax terminal transmits the image data at 33,600 bit/s, so if the analog data are first converted to the digital content they represent, only 33,600 bits (plus network overhead of a few bytes) are needed. And since T.30 fax is a half-duplex protocol, the network is only needed for one direction at a time. Refer to RFC 3261 =PCM clock synchronization= In the diagram above, there is a sample-rate clock in the fax terminal and one in the gateway's modems that is used to trigger the sampling of the analog line 8,000 times per second. These clocks are usually quite accurate, but in some low-cost terminal adapters (a one or two-line gateway) the PCM clock can be surprisingly inaccurate. If the terminal is sending data to the gateway, and the gateway's clock is too slow, the buffers (jitter buffers) in the gateway will eventually overflow, causing the transaction to fail. Since the difference is often quite small, this problem occurs on long, detailed fax images giving the clocks more time to cause the jitter buffer in gateway to either underflow or overflow, which is just the same as missing or duplicated packets. Image:PSTN-IP Gatway Figure 02.jpg =Packet loss= T.38 provides facilities to eliminate the effects of packet loss through data redundancy. When a packet is sent, either zero, one, two, three, or even more of the previously sent packets are repeated. (The specification does not impose a limit.) This increases the network bandwidth required (it's still much less than not using T.38) but it allows the receiving gateway to reconstruct the complete packet sequence, even with a fairly high level of packet loss. Related standards * T.4 is the umbrella specification for fax. It specifies the standard image sizes, two forms of image-data compression (encoding), the image-data format, and references, T.30 and the various modem standards. * T.6 specifies a compression scheme that reduces the time required to transmit an image by roughly 50-percent. * T.30 specifies the procedures that a sending and receiving terminal use to set up a fax call, determine the image size, encoding, and transfer speed, the demarcation between pages, and the termination of the call. T.30 also references the various modem standards. * V.21, V.27ter, V.29, V.17, V.34: ITU modem standards used in facsimile.

The aft pressure bulkhead is the white circular component, and its web-like structure led a NASA technician with a sense of humor to add a large stuffed spider to the decor. The aft pressure bulkhead or rear pressure bulkhead is the rear component of the pressure seal in all aircraft that cruise in a tropopause zone in the earth's atmosphere. It helps maintain pressure when stratocruising and protects the aircraft from bursting due to the higher internal pressure. Design Aft pressure bulkheads can either be curved, which reduces the amount of metal needed at the cost of reducing the usable space in the airliner, or flat, which gives more internal space but also more weight. Patents have been filed that propose deliberately creating cavities within the rear bulkhead with the purpose of providing more usable cabin space. On several airliners, production of the rear pressure bulkhead has been outsourced to third party manufacturers. While typically being a time- consuming and somewhat uncommon process, an aircraft's aft pressure bulkhead can be wholly replaced. During the twenty-first century, various parties became increasingly interested in developing aft pressure bulkheads composed from composite materials, seeking benefits such as lower manufacturing costs, easier sealing, elimination of corrosion risk, along with weight and part count reductions. During the early 2000s, Airbus Group developed the largest manufactured resin film infusion structure then in production to function as the aft pressure bulkhead for their double-decker A380 airliner. the German aerospace supplier Premium AEROTEC, which successfully manufactured the world's first thermoplastic-based rear pressure bulkhead during the 2010s; according to the firm, the new unit had reportedly resulted in a 75% reduction in processing and assembly time as well as a noticeable weight saving over traditional aluminium counterparts.  Failure incidents  A diagram of the aft pressure bulkhead of the Boeing 747 used on Japan Airlines Flight 123 Multiple instances of damage to the aft pressure bulkhead have occurred; while a few cases have led to serious failures leading to aircraft losses, others have proven to be survivable. Aviation certifying authorities have often mandated inspections of an aircraft's aft pressure bulkhead in the interest of safety. Various techniques have been devised to determine the integrity of the rear pressure bulkhead; these have been used not only to inspect in-service examples but also in the design process, helping to design efficient bulkheads that possess sufficient strength to ensure a safe operational life. In 1971, British European Airways Flight 706 crashed in Belgium, killing all 63 on board; the cause was determined to be corrosion of the rear pressure bulkhead by fluid contamination, perhaps from the lavatory. The corrosion was not detectable by the inspection techniques at the time. In 1985, Japan Airlines Flight 123 crashed after a catastrophic failure of the aft pressure bulkhead. The failure occurred due to faulty repair of the bulkhead after a tailstrike seven years earlier, when a single repair patch plate was incorrectly cut in two \\"to make it fit\\". Failure of the bulkhead damaged hydraulic pipes passing through. Boeing later calculated that the incorrect installation would be expected to fail after approximately 10,000 pressurizations; the repaired aircraft accomplished 12,318 successful flights before the crash. During 2013, National Airlines Flight 102 crashed after loose freight on the main deck is believed to have penetrated the aft pressure bulkhead and caused damage to control systems in the vicinity of the bulkhead.

Because of the insecurity of the coasts and the malaria which was endemic in the marshes that surrounded the foot of the hill on which the cathedral stands, it was abandoned by the bishops. At the beginning of the 16th century the humanist Agostino Giustiniani, bishop of Nebbio, had the cathedral repaired. It was also at this time that the belltower was almost certainly added which was destroyed by the 19th-century restorers. Despite these works, the cathedral was abandoned again in 1576. It was described as being roofless during a visitation by Mgr Sauli, the then Bishop of Aleria. In 1611 Mgr Ruscone had a new episcopal palace built next to the cathedral, later destroyed, and later still re-constructed in 1714 by Mgr Aprosio. Both cathedral and palace were occupied in 1748 by Genoese troops. The last bishop of Nebbio was Mgr Santini, from 1776 to 1801, when the bishopric of Nebbio was incorporated into that of Ajaccio, and the cathedral lost its status.

Although in this symphony Glazunov returned to his conventional four-movement layout (his Fourth Symphony had only three) he frequently utilizes thematic transformation. Glazunov described it as \\"silenced sounds\\" and \\"an architectural poem\\". Instrumentation The symphony calls for a romantic orchestra of the following instruments: 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 3 clarinets in B flat (3rd doubling bass clarinet), 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, triangle, cymbals, bass drum, bells, harp, strings Structure The symphony has four movements: # Moderato maestoso - Allegro # Scherzo. Moderato # Andante # Allegro maestoso - Animato Overview Glazunov dedicated his Fifth to Sergei Taneyev, a Russian composer, pianist, and teacher, and it was first performed at the Second Russian Concert at the Hall of the Nobility in St. Petersburg on 17 November 1896; the premiere was conducted by the composer himself. A Leipzig newspaper called the symphony \\"very profound\\" and \\"sparkling\\" and reported that the scherzo had to be reprised on opening night to the delight of the audience.

Details on Dalzeel‚Äôs early life - his career under pirate Henry Avery and exploits against the Spanish - appear only in Alexander Smith‚Äôs 1720 collection ‚ÄúA Compleat history of the lives and robberies of the most notorious highwaymen,‚Äù while his later activities are corroborated by newspaper accounts and trial records. Early History (purported) Born in Port Patrick, Scotland, Dalzeel went to sea as a child and, by the age of 23, was captain of his own ship with six successful voyages to his credit. Earning a reputation for dishonesty, Dalzeel arrived in Madagascar in 1685 and soon enlisted into the ranks of Captain Avery. According to pirate lore, Dalzeel participated in the capture of the treasure ship Ganj-i-Sawai, which carried The Great Mogul's daughter to her arranged marriage. Avery, who had decided to take her as his own wife, gave Dalzeel his own ship and crew within Avery's fleet. Dalzeel would continue to serve under Avery until finally leaving for the West Indies on his own. However, upon their arrival in the Caribbean, the pirates' search for targets was fruitless. With their supplies slowly running short, starvation began to set in before a Spanish vessel was sighted. As the ship came into view, Dalzeel realized the Spanish ship was a well-armed Spanish war galleon which had presumably become separated from its escorts. Despite their ship's smaller size, Dalzeel gave orders to close in on the ship. Although the Spanish ship's captain had been informed of the pirate ship's presence earlier, he felt it too small to be a threat and retired to his cabin for a game of cards. As the ship approached the galleon, Dalzeel ordered a hole to be drilled in the side of his own ship so that his crew would be forced to fight to the death. Caught completely off guard, the Spaniards offered little resistance as Dalzeel's crew boarded the galleon. Within minutes the ship was theirs and, storming into the captain's quarters, they demanded his surrender at gunpoint. After sailing his prize to Jamaica, Dalzeel was apprehended while attempting to capture a fleet of twelve Spanish pearl ships escorted by a Spanish man-o-war. In exchange for his surrender, Dalzeel and his crew were not forced into slavery or hard labor, as was common practice for captured pirates. Released ashore, Dalzeel made his way back to Jamaica. There he began outfitting another ship and was soon sailing for Cuba. Again his outnumbered crew was captured by a Spanish naval patrol of three warships bound for Havana, where he was sentenced to be hanged at sea. Dalzeel, however, quickly made his escape after stabbing a guard and using two empty jugs to float to shore. Soon encountering another band of pirates, Dalzeel was able to convince them to attack and successfully capture the warship which had held him prisoner. As the pirates neared Jamaica, their ship sank in a sudden storm although Dalzeel was able to survive the storm in a canoe. Later History During the War of the Spanish Succession, Dalzeel commanded the vessel Agrippa and was granted a commission by the French as a privateer. A Jacobite, Dalzeel sailed under the banner of James Stuart, who had fled to France after his father James II was deposed in the 1688 Glorious Revolution. He enjoyed considerable success against British and allied nations before his eventual capture. Taken back to England, he was tried and convicted in 1712 of treason and sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. However, at the behest of the Earl of Mar, Dalzeel received a royal pardon. Upon his release he sailed for French waters, where he captured a French ship near Le Havre. He then had the captured crew's necks tied to their heels and thrown overboard to watch them drown. Eventually captured in Scotland, he was returned to London, tried and convicted of piracy. Paul Lorrain ministered to the imprisoned Dalzeel and found him ‚Äúa pernicious and dangerous person; of a morose, stubborn, and ill disposition by nature,‚Äù and ‚Äúso brutish and so obstinate that he would not be satisfied with anything I offered to him in this matter, saying, he hated to see my face, and would not attend in the Chapel.‚Äù Lorrain had acted as translator at Dalzeel‚Äôs trial, presenting evidence in French for the English court. Because of this, Dalzeel blamed Lorrain for his sentence: ‚Äú[Dalzeel] with his dying breath declared that I was the cause of his death, and he would do me some mischief or other before he died, or haunt me afterwards.‚Äù Dalzeel even threatened to kick Lorrain down the stairs and tear up the Bible Lorrain had offered him. He later apologized and asked forgiveness, but ‚Äúwhether that repentance was sincere, and not too late, was much to be doubted.‚Äù Dalzeel was hanged on 15 December 1715.

It also contains the area known as Palm Bay. The original Palm Bay estate was built in the 1930s as a number of large, wide avenues with detached and semi-detached houses with driveways, garages and gardens. This land was sold by Mr Sidney Simon Van Den Bergh to the Palm Bay Estate Co on 23 June 1924. Such avenues include Gloucester Avenue and Leicester Avenue. East Cliftonville The estate covers the eastern part of Cliftonville and was fields when the first was built. It extends east beyond Northumberland Avenue and has been developed in phases. An earlier phase covered the northern ends of Leicester and Gloucester Avenues and the whole of Clarence and Magnolia Avenues; the later phase extending eastwards of Princess Margaret Avenue is a Wimpy-style housing estate with small houses largely identical in appearance and of less substantial build quality than the original 1930s estate. The eastward expansion of Cliftonville has included much of the former parish of Northdown including Northdown Park and House. West Cliftonville West Cliftonville was originally developed as the up-market alternative to bustling Margate and had many small private hotels and guest houses with outstanding Victorian architecture which catered for the many visitors to what was in the first half of the 20th century a thriving holiday resort. Many of the large hotels have been converted into one bed flats; this has brought about positive action from Thanet District Council which introduced selective licensing ensuring that quality home improvements are maintained by landlords (2006) and restricting planning permission for one bedroom flats (2007). Cliftonville now has many of its streets protected by conservation areas orders and these have been introduced in (2017) by Thanet District Council. The seafront area once included many large hotels, including at one time a large Butlins complex. Some fantastic hotels remain, e.g. Smiths Court Hotel overlooking the sea, and The Walpole Bay Hotel. However, tourism and visitor numbers have increased in Cliftonville (2018) with the additions of newly opened bed and breakfasts changing the Cliftonville landscape, including the recently opened Cliftonville Townhouse Boutique Bed and Breakfast and the opening of The Albion Rooms by the band The Libertines expected late 2020. Northdown Road and Cliff Terrace have also had a resurgence, with many trendy and hip businesses opening since (2010) these include Haeckels an up-market beauty brand gaining international success with its natural products made from seaweed here in Cliftonville. Whilst restaurants and cafes are flocking to the area e.g. Roost, an up market street food establishment, Cliffs caf√©, yoga, records; The Grain Grocer with its wholefoods store, Urchin Wines brings beautifully selected wines to Cliftonville, Transmission Records bring unique vinyl collection, Banks Bar Gins and beers, Batchelor's Patisserie continental cakes and coffee (which has been situated in Cliftonville since the late 1970's) and MarMar with its plants and caf√© are all bringing an exciting new East London edge to Cliftonville. The Oval Bandstand and lawns host a monthly award- winning farmers' market (the last Sunday of every month) and during the summer there are a number of activities and events, including musical shows, held on weekends. The Tom Thumb Theatre and Radio Margate bring a host of music events and theatre to Cliftonville. Cliftonville also has a host of community groups that have been engaging with the community and those such as ABC - A better Cliftonville and GRASS Cliftonville are bringing about positive change within the community through positive community engagement. Facilities The shopping area of Cliftonville is called Northdown Road and includes a number of main banks and building societies, larger corporate concerns including Boots and Tesco, a number of family run specialist shops including an award- winning art gallery, a post office, several pubs, many coffee shops and cafes, two churches and a number of estate and letting agents as well as an award- winning media company all along its two-mile length. Entertainment Cliftonville also has an indoor ten-pin bowling alley and sports bar, tennis courts, a bandstand with regular events including a farmers market, bowling green and the famous Winter Gardens theatre. Cliftonville is the home of local radio station KMFM Thanet. Writing and poetry During the first half of the 20th century Cliftonville was considered the fashionable hotel quarter of Margate. It was during the autumn of 1921 that T.S. Eliot spent a period of convalescence at the Albermarle Hotel, Cliftonville. His widow has confirmed that he found inspiration for, and wrote significant sections of The Waste Land in the Grade II-listed Nayland Rock promenade shelter. The spirit of early 20th century Cliftonville was caught by John Betjeman in his poem \\"Margate Pier\\". Notable people The stage and film actor Trevor Howard was born in Cliftonville in 1913.

From there, it travels posteriorly between the transversus abdominis muscle and the internal oblique muscle to anastomose with the iliolumbar artery and the superior gluteal artery. Opposite the anterior superior iliac spine of the ilium, it gives off a large ascending branch.

The original plant was established in 1908 as a workshop attached to a local brick factory. In 1977, after eight years of successful co-operation, the iron foundry in Kikinda signed a joint venture and long-term co-operation manufacturing contract valid for a period of 15 years with Adam Opel AG (Opel). US$78.5 million were invested in the newly established IDA-Kikinda factory, funded 51% by Kikinda Iron Foundry and 49% by General Motors. The first delivery of manufactured parts from two new factories in Kikinda (Livac and Metalac), took part in December 1979. The export of Yugoslav-made parts allowed IDA to import mostly finished Opels, about 3,000 per year in the early 1980s, and have them treated as Yugoslav products. By exporting partly manufactured and fully manufactured parts/components for Opel vehicles, an import/export ratio of 1:1 was enabled. Up to the imposition of economic sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) in May 1992, 38,700 Opel vehicles and large number of spare parts worth around DM 100 million were produced. During the 12 years of IDA-Opel manufacturing co-operation, over DM 1.3 billion have been made from this joint venture.

The train The Southern Railway was anxious to encourage the resumption of normal leisure activities after the war years, and it commenced operation of the train on 20 June 1947. It set high standards for comfort and luxury, and it was made up entirely of Pullman coaches. Two unusual features of the train were that all seats were reservable (not a common facility at the time) and the observation car, attached at the rear for the benefit of passengers to and from Ilfracombe. The Southern Railway was especially adept at publicity, and both the westbound and eastbound trains started their journey at mid-day, and uniquely the train ran non-stop between London and Sidmouth Junction, a distance of 160 miles. The throughout journey time was about five and a half hours. At this time all other trains on the Southern Railway's West of England main line stopped at Salisbury for water and to trim the tender coal, as the Southern Railway did not have water troughs. To enable the non-stop run, the train made an unadvertised stop at Wilton, a small station two miles west of Salisbury, for an engine change. The train headboards had a red background unlike the customary green nameboard backgrounds on Southern Railway express trains. Three boards were used: one on the locomotive's buffer beam, and one on each side of its smokebox, mounted on the smoke deflectors. Following the war, Britain was in a state of economic austerity for several years, and a luxury train service involving a supplementary fare was a difficult concept to sell. Despite initial popularity, the train was not as much of a success as hoped, and the Plymouth portion was dropped in September 1949. Services were further reduced in 1952 and withdrawn entirely at the end of the 1954 summer season. The Southern ran three Pullman trains with the suffix Belle. The others were the Brighton Belle (originally the Southern Belle) and the Bournemouth Belle. British Railways introduced the Thanet Belle (later renamed the Kentish Belle) in 1948. Traction and rolling stock Usually the train was hauled by a Merchant Navy class 'Bulleid Pacific' locomotive between Waterloo and Exeter Central, with Light Pacific locomotives handling the train west of that point. The normal formation was for four carriages to form the Plymouth portion, and eight to form the Ilfracombe portion, although longer trains were sometimes needed. The use of powerful locomotives was essential on the Ilfracombe Branch, due to the very steep gradients and sharp curves on that section of line. For the eastbound departure from Ilfracombe, it was usually necessary for assistance to be provided by a bank engine for the 1 in 36 climb from the terminus to Mortehoe & Woolacombe station. The observation cars No 13 in use on the Paignton and Dartmouth Steam Railway Two distinctive observation cars were used on the service. They were numbered 13 and 14, and both had started life as other vehicles. No. 14 was a London & North Western Railway ambulance coach of 1918 that was converted into a Pullman car in 1921. It was rebuilt as a Bar car in 1937. Both carriages were remodelled as observation cars in 1947, especially for the Devon Belle service. They had seating for 27 passengers, and a bar for a drinks service. This latter work was undertaken at Pullman's Preston Park works, Brighton. The observation cars were 'single-ended', due to the large windows that allowed passengers to see out from the back of the train. The carriages therefore had to be turned on the turntable at the end of each journey for the return journey. This could be a difficult operation at Ilfracombe station, as the site was exposed to the winds from the Atlantic Ocean. After use on the Devon Belle the cars were transferred to the London Midland Region, repainted and renumbered 280 and 281, curiously with an 'M' suffix, despite their origins. M280M (ex 13) was used for a couple of seasons on 'The Welsh Chieftain' Land Cruise train in north Wales and M281M (ex 14) on charter services. In 1961 the cars were transferred to the Scottish Region for use on the lines between Inverness and the Kyle of Lochalsh, and from Glasgow to Oban. =Preservation= Both observation cars have been preserved in England and are still in revenue-earning service: No.13 is based on the Dartmouth Steam Railway, in south Devon (having originally be preserved by the Dart Valley Railway, down the South Devon Railway, which; as the name suggests, is in South Devon), where it re-entered service at the start of the 2018 season following an overhaul carried out the previous year and remains in service; while No.14 is now at the Swanage Railway in Dorset, after a lengthy sojourn in North America. No. 14 went to the USA in 1969 for a tour accompanying the Flying Scotsman. Due to financial difficulties, the carriage could not be shipped home immediately, and it remained in America and was attached to an office building in San Francisco. As the building was unoccupied, the owner donated No. 14 was given to a preservationist and it was subsequently repatriated to the Swanage Railway UK on 13 January 2007 at a cost of around ¬£60,000. No. 14 arrived in the UK at Southampton Docks on 26 February 2007, having travelled by ship via the Panama Canal, and was then immediately transported by road to Ramparts railway workshops at Derby where restoration work was carried out, including the refitting of the interior, retaining the Watneys pub modelled 'The Firemans Rest' bar from the USA tour. It returned to the Swanage Railway on 16 May 2008 and was officially re- launched into service on 16 July 2008. Sample timetable In the summer of 1950 the westbound train left Waterloo at 12:00, and called at Sidmouth Junction (15:16), Exeter Central (15:35 - 15:40), Exeter St Davids (15:46), Barnstaple Junction (16:43), Barnstaple Town, Braunton, Mortehoe and arrived at Ilfracombe at 17:27. The eastbound train left Ilfracombe at 12:00, calling at Mortehoe, Braunton, Barnstaple Town, Barnstaple Junction (12:37), Exeter St Davids (13:33), Exeter Central (13:38 - 13:42), Sidmouth Junction (14:04) and arrived at Waterloo at 17:20. (The journey time from Waterloo to Exeter St Davids was 15 minutes longer than the Atlantic Coast Express required, stopping only at Salisbury.) The train ran on Mondays, Tuesdays (eastbound), Thursdays (westbound), Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays in the summer of 1950. Unusually, the advertised schedules were identical every day of the week on which the train ran.

Deputy director is army chief General Apirat Kongsompong. ISOC's FY2019 budget is 10,240.1 million baht. ISOC has about 5,000-6,000 staff nationwide, excluding those working in the south, and there are 500,000-600,000 internal security volunteers, as well as tens of thousands of people in its information network. Communist Suppression Operations Command The Communist Suppression Operations Command (CSOC) was established in 1965 with the assistance of the United States to coordinate nationwide anti-communist operations. Following the 17 November 1971 coup by military dictators Thanom Kittikachorn and Praphas Charusathien, Praphas appointed himself interior minister, chief of police, and head of CSOC. The CSOC was implicated in several atrocities in its 1970s war against leftist groups. This included the Red Drum Massacre, the mass murder of southern Thai activists by burning them alive in gasoline drums. Student leader Thirayuth Boonmee showed evidence that the destruction of Ban Na Sai village, Bueng Kan District, Nong Khai Province (, Bueng Kan Province) in northeast Thailand was the handiwork of the CSOC.Anderson, Benedict, \\"Murder and Progress in Modern Siam\\" The military had earlier claimed that the Communist Party of Thailand (CPT) was responsible for the village's destruction. CSOC's name was changed to ISOC in 1974. Operations during the 1970s ISOC conducted operations in cities and the Thai countryside to subvert leftist groups through propaganda and violence. In 1973, the ISOC commenced a bombing campaign against hill tribe villages in northern Thailand. Prime Minister to-be Prem Tinsulanonda was a senior officer of the ISOC. ISOC's role declined starting in the early-1980s after the downfall of the CPT. However, it still had great influence. On 1 April 1987, after Prime Minister Kukrit Pramoj claimed that ISOC had been brainwashed by communists, over 200 Thai Army Rangers attacked the prime minister's residence. Plot to assassinate Thaksin Shinawatra ISOC Deputy Director Pallop Pinmanee was sacked after Lieutenant Thawatchai Klinchana, his driver, was found driving a car containing 67 kilograms of explosives near the residence of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Pallop denied all involvement, noting that \\"If I was behind it, I would not have missed.\\" A government spokesperson stated that the explosives in the car were completely assembled, equipped with a remote sensor ready to be detonated, and would have had a blast radius of around one kilometre. Post-2006 coup ISOC ISOC received a boost when the 2006 coup installed the government of General Surayud Chulanont. His government passed the Internal Security Act, 2008, granting ISOC the status of a state organization reporting to the Office of the Prime Minister. Thaksin planned a major restructuring of the ISOC prior to the coup which overthrew him in September 2006. Soon after the coup, the junta released three army suspects in the car bomb plot. Junta leader and Army Commander-in- Chief General Sonthi Boonyaratglin appointed himself head of ISOC (its previous head had been the prime minister) and transformed ISOC into a \\"government within a government\\". The new ISOC was criticized as being a shadowy puppet master pulling the strings of existing agencies, answerable to no one but its leader.The Nation, Thailand's Dept of Homeland Security , 12 December 2006 To protect people in south Thailand from insurgency-related violence, ISOC produced Jatukham Rammathep amulets for distribution to the Buddhist minority. The renowned animist amulets were believed to have magical powers to protect their wearers from violence and large sums are paid for them. The plan was developed by Colonel Manas Khongpan, deputy director of ISOC in Yala Province.The Nation, Amulets to 'help protect' Buddhists in South , 14 March 2007 The cabinet of General Surayud Chulanont gave 732 ISOC staff members an 84.3 million baht \\"reward\\" in mid-2007. ISOC explained that police and soldiers were temporarily transferred to support ISOC's operation. ISOC wanted to reward them for their hard work and sacrifice. ISOC had originally requested the reward in 2003, but was turned down by the Thaksin government. Post-2014 coup ISOC Following the 2014 coup, junta leader Prayut Chan-o- cha used ISOC to handle not just military matters, but also political and social issues. In 2017, Prayut issued NCPO Order 51/2017 to bolster ISOC's powers. A key provision was the inclusion of public prosecutors under ISOC's ageis, marking ISOC's first involvement in the Thai justice system. The order also gave ISOC the power to summon citizens to provide \\"information\\", a function formerly seen as a police responsibility. ISOC, under the order, is also responsible for \\"social order\\", a task previously shared by the police and ministries. In October 2019, ISOC filed sedition charges against 12 opposition politicians and academics, including leaders of Future Forward and Pheu Thai parties. They were accused of inciting insurrection against the state for discussing amendments to the junta-drafted 2017 constitution on 28 September in Pattani Province. Their choice of venue is unfortunate as Pattani operates under a \\"state of emergency\\" enacted by the army to combat local separatists. This means that the defendants may be tried in a military tribunal. A leading Thai political scientist warned that giving a militarized surveillance agency free rein in internal security issues risked turning Thailand into a totalitarian state.  Information Operations  In a parliament debate in February 2020, Future Forward MP Viroj Lakkana-adisorn presented a document revealing the percentage of the Internal Security Operation Command (ISOC) budget dedicated to information warfare in Thailand‚Äôs three southern provinces of Narathiwas, Songkhla, and Yala. Three additional documents detailed Defense Ministry orders to conduct information warfare against opposition parties and politicians, including specific budget details for the internet and mobile phones and the internet. As ISOC reports directly to the prime minister‚Äôs office, General Prayut denied all the allegations and promised to investigate. In October 2020, Twitter took down a \\"low-intensity\\" Royal Thai Army information operation apparently designed to stifle and influence democratic opinion on social media regarding Army scandals and democratic processes in the country, as part of a major wider investigation by Facebook and Twitter into attempts to influence the 2020 US Presidential Election.

It is featured in Chappell & Co Ltd v Nestle Co Ltd ([1960] AC 87), which stated that \\"a peppercorn does not cease to be good consideration if it is established that the promisee does not like pepper and will throw away the corn\\". Function in contract law In English law, and other countries with similar common law systems, a legal contract requires that each side must provide consideration. In other words, each party will give something of value to the other party for the contract to be considered binding. The situation is different under contracts within civil law jurisdictions because such nominal consideration can be categorised as a disguised gift. However, courts will not generally inquire into the adequacy or relative value of the consideration provided by each party.E.g., Batsakis v. Demotsis, 226 S.W.2d 673 (Court of Civil Appeals of Texas, 1949). So, if a contract calls for one party to give up something of great value, while the other party gives up something of much lesser value, then it will generally still be considered a valid contract, even though the exchange of value greatly favors one side. Courts, however, will reject \\"consideration\\" that was not truly bargained for. For example, in the 1904 case Fischer v. Union Trust Co., the Michigan Supreme Court held that the one dollar paid for the sale of real property did not constitute valuable consideration since the transaction had not been bargained for‚Äîa dollar was handed to a mentally incompetent \\"buyer\\" who then dutifully handed it to the \\"seller\\". The dollar was not considered real consideration, not because the dollar was too small an amount, but because it did not induce the seller to part with the property. Such promises that are motivated by love and affection are insufficient to constitute consideration. So, in order for an essentially one-sided contract (such as a gift) to still be valid and binding, the contract will generally be written so that one side gives up something of value, while the other side gives a token sum‚Äîone pound, dollar, or literally one peppercorn. Peppercorn payments are sometimes used when selling a struggling company whose net worth may be negative. If some party agrees to take it over and assume its liabilities as well as its assets, the seller may actually agree to make a large payment to the buyer. But the buyer must still make some payment, however small, for the company in order to establish that both sides have given consideration. =Concealing the value of consideration= A peppercorn is also used in more balanced contracts, where one side wishes to conceal the nature of their payment. For example, since real estate contracts are generally matters of public record, the purchaser of a house may not wish to list the exact amount of the payment on the contract. But there must be some specific payment listed in the contract, or the contract will be considered void for lack of consideration. So the contract may be written to reflect that the house is being sold in return for \\"ten dollars and other good and valuable consideration\\". The ten dollars is the \\"peppercorn\\" that provides concrete consideration and ensures that the contract is valid, while the actual amount paid for the house is hidden and referred to only as the \\"other good and valuable consideration.\\" =In leases for real property= Another common example is the English practice of \\"peppercorn rent\\", the nominal rental sum for property, land or buildings. Where a rental contract is put in place and the owner of the property wishes it to be rent-free, it is normal to charge a small sum as \\"peppercorn rent\\", because if the owner wants to lease the property, he must charge some rent so that consideration exists for both parties. Furthermore, a peppercorn rent is often used as a form of nominal ground rent where a (potentially substantial) premium has also been paid on commencement of a long lease of, say, 99 or 125 years (a \\"virtual freehold\\"). The notional collection of the annual peppercorn rent helps to maintain a formal landlord‚Äìtenant relationship between the two parties, precluding the risk of a claim for adverse possession from the tenant arising, were no consideration to be paid for an extended period. The land on which the Ontario Legislative Building resides was leased by the University of Toronto for a peppercorn lease of 999 years.https://www.blogto.com/city/2013/04/a_brief_history_of_queens_park_in_toronto/ It is not uncommon, even in the modern day, for a peppercorn rent to be denominated in (sometimes whimsical) physical goods rather than currency. For example, many of the buildings in London's Covent Garden are leased at a peppercorn rent of \\"one red apple and a posy of flowers\\", the National Coastwatch station at St Albans Head occupies buildings owned by the Encombe Estate in exchange for \\"one crab per annum if demanded\\" while the Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust leases untenanted land on the Isles of Scilly from the Duchy of Cornwall for one daffodil per year. Transactions involving actual peppercorns The Masonic Lodge of St. George's, Bermuda, rents the Old State House as its lodge for the annual sum of a single peppercorn, presented to the Governor of Bermuda on a velvet cushion atop a silver platter, in an annual ceremony performed since 1816 on or about 23 April. The Sevenoaks Vine Cricket Club in Sevenoaks, England, rents the Vine Cricket Ground from Sevenoaks Town Council at a yearly rent of one peppercorn. It is many years since the club paid only one peppercorn for the rent of the pavilion. The council, in return, gives a new cricket ball to Baron Sackville every year if requested. The University of Bath's main campus is on a 999-year lease from the then Bath City Council. Each year a peppercorn is presented by the Treasurer of the University to the Chairman of the Bath and North East Somerset Council as rent (but also to further the relationships between \\"town and gown\\").

The route begins at SR 20 in Sutallee and ends at the intersection of SR 53 and SR 53 Business in Tate. Route description Georgia State Route 108 in Cherokee County SR 108 begins at its intersection with SR 20 in Sutallee in west- central Cherokee County, west of Canton and north of Lake Allatoona, and right in between I-75 and I-575. The route heads north, locally known as Fincher Road, in the direction of Lake Arrowhead, before angling slightly to the northeast to pass the lake to its east, and runs into Waleska, just northeast of the Lake Arrowhead. In Waleska, SR 108 crosses SR 140 and passes Reinhardt College, which is located at the intersection of the two routes, before continuing northeast through northern Cherokee County and into south-central Pickens County, paralleling I-575 to this point. Just inside Pickens County, the route makes a sudden turn to the southeast at its intersection with Henderson Mountain Road, nearly crosses back into Cherokee County, and then curves sharply to the north to run through the community of Cagle. In Cagle, SR 108 turns to the northeast and crosses SR 5/SR 53/SR 515, just north of where I-575 ends and these routes continue north as the Appalachian Highway. East of SR 5, the route, known as Waleska Highway in Pickens County, picks up a concurrency with SR 53 and runs east into Tate, where SR 108 terminates at its intersection with SR 53 Business, and where SR 53 continues east in the direction of Dawson County. =Traffic= The Georgia Department of Transportation average annual daily traffic (AADT) numbers for the year 2011 show a steady increase of the daily average vehicle load as SR 108 travel south to north. From its southern terminus, the average load increases from 1,380 vehicles to 1,630 vehicles per day as the route approaches Waleska, then increases more rapidly to just under 3,000 vehicles north of Waleska, with 10% of those vehicles being trucks. Number decrease just slightly again in northern Cherokee County and southern Pickens County, with averages hovering around 2,700 vehicles, then jump sharply to stay around 5,000 vehicles both west and east of SR 5. History The first portion of the roadway that is signed as SR 108 today makes its appearance on Georgia state road maps in the middle of 1933, when a route signed as SR 108, and measuring , ran from Jasper, at the intersection of SR 5 and SR 53 at the time, north into Cartecay in Lumpkin County, to what was then signed as SR 43, and which corresponds to SR 52 today. This route took vehicle traffic from Atlanta via SR 5 and SR 108 to the community of Tate Mountain Estates, a summer retreat planned by Colonel Sam Tate for wealthy Atlantans. In the middle of 1941, the first roadway corresponding to today's routing of SR 108 appears, with the construction of a stretch of road, designated as SR 154, and measuring , which ran north from what was then signed as SR 20 (and today is SR 140) in Waleska. It merged with a roadway to the south of SR 53, what is today called Henderson Mountain Road, which was designated as SR 143 at the time. SR 143 covered the portion of today's SR 108 from this intersection to Tate, the present northern terminus. From there, using SR 5 northbound for , travelers were then able to connect to what was actually designated as SR 108 at the time. By 1946, no additional roadway had been added to this picture; however, the route which had been designated SR 154 from Waleska, had been re-signed as SR 156, and the road intersecting what had been SR 154, and forming the southern terminus of that route, had been changed from a designation of SR 20 to the present designation of SR 140. It was 1963 before the next significant change on this route took place, when a connecting route, signed SR 108, was constructed from its intersection with SR 143 west of Tate, to Jasper, picking up and extending the original roadway signed as SR 108. This new stretch of roadway would eventually end up being removed from the state route system, and is named Refuge Road/South Main Street. In 1969, about 6 years later, the missing portion of today's routing, from SR 20 to Waleska, was first indicated as a connecting county route on Georgia state highway maps. This county route connected to SR 156 in Waleska, which connected to SR 143, which in turn connected to SR 108, and ran through Jasper to SR 52 in Cartecay. It was then 1972 before this missing piece was integrated into the state route system, when this portion was designated as part of SR 156. In 1979, the parts of the route that had been signed as SR 156 were re-designated as SR 108, which extended this designation from SR 20 all the way up to SR 52 in Lumkpin County. The one remaining portion of SR 143, from SR 108 to Tate, was renumbered as SR 108 Connector. At the start of 1983, SR 108 had assumed its present routing. This meant that the former SR 108 Connector had been made part of the main route, and the entire portion north of Tate into Jasper and on into Lumkin County had been removed from the state route system. Finally, until 2007, the main route of SR 53 ran through downtown Jasper, following what is today signed as SR 53 Business. In 2006-2007, this route was realigned to follow SR 5/515 south, and is then concurrent with SR 108 running east to its northern terminus in Tate.  Major intersections  Tate connector route State Route 108 Connector (SR 108 Conn.) was a short-lived connector route of SR 108 that existed in the south-central part of Pickens County, in the north-central part of the state. The roadway that would eventually become SR 108 Conn. was established in 1941 as part of an eastern segment of SR 143 from SR 53 east of Fairmount to SR 5 and SR 53 in Tate. By the end of 1946, the eastern half of this segment had a \\"sand clay, top soil, or stabilized earth\\" surface. In 1977, all of SR 143 from its western terminus to northeast of Sharp Top was redesignated as SR 379; northeast of this point to west of Tate was redesignated as part of SR 108; and from there to Tate was redesignated as SR 108 Conn. In 1981, SR 379 was decommissioned. In 1981, SR 5 was shifted west. Its former alignment was redesignated as SR 53 Bus./SR 53. The next year, SR 108 was shifted east, replacing SR 108 Conn.

It was discovered in 1820 by Giovanni Battista Caviglia at the Great Temple of Ptah near Memphis, Egypt. It is made from red granite. The statue was found broken in six pieces and earlier attempts at restoration failed. In 1955, Egyptian Prime Minister Gamal Abdel Nasser moved it to the large Bab Al-Hadid Square in Cairo, outside Cairo's main railway station; the square was then renamed Ramses Square. There the statue was restored to its full height of 11 meters and erected on a three-metre pedestal at the edge of a fountain. It was stabilized by iron bars inside the body. Over time Ramses Square turned out to be an unsuitable location, as the statue was exposed to corrosive pollution and constant vibration from traffic and subways. The Egyptian government decided to relocate it to a more appropriate location in 2006. At a temporary site on the Giza Plateau it underwent restoration before being moved into the staircase close the entrance of the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) in Giza in 2018. The transport of the statue from Ramses Square to Giza was a technological challenge that had been in the planning since 2002. The statue weighs about 83 tons. A replica had been made and was transported several weeks before the scheduled actual move along the planned route to Giza to test the proposed relocation process. The move took place on August 25, 2006. During its ten-hour transport the statue was wrapped and covered in rubber foam. Two flat-back trucks carried the weight of the statue and its support structures as it travelled in a vertical position.

Dictionary of Minor Planet Names. 5th ed. Berlin and New York: Springer (2003), 317 and 474. In 1995, Waldron was first exposed to Paint Shop Pro because of the Observatory's early exploration of digital photography. This software inspired Waldron to manipulate photographs for artistic purposes, creating kaleidoscopic patterns. In 1998, Duncan Waldron and his family moved to New South Wales, Australia.

The centre of Mexico City lies some 50 km further to the east. The name Metepec comes from N√°huatl meaning hill of the maguey plants. However, it is also known in the Matlatzinca language as \\"Nepinta-Tuhi\\" meaning 'people of corn land' and in the Otomi language as \\"Ntaguada\\". The city The city centre lies at the foot of the hill that gives the city and municipality its name. There has been a community here since the Otomis and Matlatzincas settled in this part of the Valley of Toluca: the Matlatzincas reached their cultural peak between AD 1120 and 1450 as part of the Teotihuacan culture. The Aztecs conquered this community, along with the rest of the area by AD 1470 by the tlatoani (chief) named Ax√°yacatl. The Spanish arrived here in AD 1526 obliterating native rites that were practiced on the \\"maguey hill\\" and built a church there, now-called the Ex-convento de San Juan, renaming the area San Juan Bautista Metepec. According to the Codex of Metepec the Spanish town was founded in the same year. The Ex-convento de San Juan is the main religious structure in the town and dates from the 16th century; however, other churches worth visiting include Las Capillas de El Calvario, La Santa Cruz, del Esp√≠ritu Santo, San Bartolom√©, de San Salvador, de Santa Mar√≠a Magdalena and la Parroquia de San Mateo. The 24th of June is the feast day of Metepec's patron saint, John the Baptist. Additionally, since 1990 the city has an international arts and culture festival called Quimera, which occurs in October. The Cerro de Maguey (Maguey Hill) has a number of small caves with names like \\"La cueva del diablo\\" (The Devil's Cave) that can be explored. While most of the food in Metepec is typical of the region (with dishes such as barbacoa, tamales, and huaraches) it does have a unique drink called \\"Gara√±ona\\". It is made from 15 herbs and is a strong, sweet drink. Some locals say it is an aphrodisiac. The only place that sells and distributes this drink is a bar called the \\"2 de Abril\\", located in the city centre. =Economic activities= Arbol de la Vida, handcraft. Metepec is known for its pottery items and it is still of economic importance. The artisans of this area have organized into the Asociaci√≥n de Artesanos de Metepec y la Uni√≥n de Alfareros de Metepec, A.C. (Association of Artisans of Metepec and the Union of Potters of Metepec). Principal crafts include objects made from clay, glass and includes saddlemaking. The city has about 300 craftsmen as well as 275 family workshops. The craft Metepec is best known for is the Arbol de la vida (\\"Tree of Life\\") which is a traditional pottery representation of the tree from which Adam and Eve ate in the Biblical story. Monday is market day in the city centre, called plaza, where merchants go to sell fruit, vegetables and even a few electronic items. In recent years, the municipality has increased its economic importance with the construction of shopping malls, commercial plazas and automobile agencies etc. The following are some of the recognized establishments, restaurants and plazas to be found in this municipality: Walmart, Sam's Club, Costco, Mega, Sears, Liverpool (store), Chedraui, Soriana, Radio Shack, McDonald's, Burger King, Mercedes Benz, SEAT, Volkswagen, Cinemex and Cinepolis among others. According to INEGI 2005 census figures, the city had a population of 164,182, while the municipality had a population of 206,005 inhabitants. The municipality covers an area of 70.43 km¬≤ (27.19 sq mi) and includes several smaller communities besides Metepec. Most commercial activity occurs in the city of Metepec proper and has grown considerably in the past years, along with its population. The Municipality Municipal Headquarters, Metepec As municipal seat, the city of Metepec has governing jurisdiction over the following communities: Barrio Santiaguito, Colonia √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n, Colonia Llano Grande (El Salitre), Rancho el Carmen Progreso, San Bartolom√© Tlaltelulco, San Gaspar Tlahuelilpan, San Lorenzo Coacalco (San Lorenzo), San Lucas Tunco (San Lucas), San Miguel Totocuitlapilco, San Sebasti√°n, Santa Mar√≠a Magdalena Ocotitl√°n, and Tepoluli. The municipality borders with the municipalities of San Mateo Atenco, Santiago Tianguistenco, Toluca, Chapultepec, Mexicaltzingo and Calimaya and has a territory of 70.43 square kilometers. Due to its altitude, average temperatures here vary between 14 and 30 ¬∞C with cold spells down to -5 ¬∞C that can occur as late as March or April. =Economic activities= San Juan Bautista Parish. El Calvario Chapel. Outside of the city of Metepec, the main economic activity is still agriculture, with 5,271.59 hectares devoted to crops. Fish farms comprise 208.18 hectares, with urban areas totaling only 1,193.16 hectares. Livestock raising includes cattle, sheep, pigs, horses, goats, rabbits and various fowl such as turkeys and chickens. Most is raised for autoconsumption and for nearby localities. However, industrial activities have grown in importance with enterprises dedicated to food-processing, bottling, tobacco, clothing, paper products, construction materials, as well as machinery and other equipment. = History = During the Spanish Conquest, Gonz√°lo de Sandoval and his Otomi allies, conquered Toluca, Tenango, Tlacotepec, Tecaxic-Calixtlahuaca, Calimaya along with Metepec and other Matlatzinca and Mexica population centers, whose lands were then abandoned by the natives. These lands were then redistributed among the Spaniards who participated in the Conquest and to those local chiefs that supported the Spanish. Lands in and around Metepec were given to Captain Juan Guti√©rrez Altamirano, who brought the Franciscans in to evangelize the area, and then these lands passed on to form the estates of the Counts of Santiago. The area was considered an \\"alcald√≠a mayor\\" (literally 'major mayorship') by 1560 with the village of Metepec as its seat. Records of municipal government transactions begin in the 19th century. Finally, the municipality of Metepec was created in 1821; although this was not ratified by the government of the State of Mexico until 1827.

The rooms are built in the form of tipis, mistakenly referred to as wigwams. It originally had seven different locations: two locations in Kentucky and one each in Alabama, Florida, Arizona, Louisiana, and California. They are very distinctive historic landmarks. Two of the three surviving motels are located on historic U.S. Route 66: in Holbrook, Arizona, and on the city boundary between Rialto and San Bernardino, California. All three of the surviving motels are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the Wigwam Motel in Cave City, Kentucky, was listed in 1988 under the official designation of Wigwam Village #2; the Wigwam Motel in Arizona was listed as Wigwam Village #6 in 2002; and the Wigwam Motel in California was listed in 2012 as Wigwam Village #7. History Frank A. Redford developed the Village after adding tipi-shaped motel units around a museum-shop he had built to house his collection of Native American artifacts. He applied for a patent on the ornamental design of the buildings on December 17, 1935, and was granted Design Patent 98,617 on February 18, 1936. The original drawing includes the swastika, at the time a symbol associated with Native Americans or often worn as a good-luck charm. Seven Wigwam Villages were built between 1933 and 1949. Wigwam villages =Village #1: Horse Cave, Kentucky= The first Wigwam Village was built in 1933 by Frank A. Redford. It was located on the corner of US-31E and Hwy 218 in Horse Cave, Kentucky. The central building and gas pumps are visible on undated postcards. Six more wigwams were built to be used as guest rooms. Village #1 closed in 1935 when the nearby Wigwam Village #2 was opened, but operated under different names until it was eventually abandoned; it was razed in 1982. =Village #2: Cave City, Kentucky= Wigwam Village #2 in Cave City, Kentucky Wigwam Village #2 was built in 1937 on U.S. Route 31W in Cave City, Kentucky, close to Mammoth Cave National Park and a few miles south of the original Wigwam Village #1. The address is 601 North Dixie Hwy, Cave City, Kentucky. It consists of 15 wigwams used as guest rooms that are arranged in a semicircle. In the center is a much bigger concrete and steel central structure that originally served as a restaurant, plus a common area with playground, recreation space, and pavilion. Each wigwam has a paved pad to accommodate one car. The restaurant is no longer in operation, but the motel is still open. The diameter at the base of each tipi is , and they are in height. Behind the main room of each unit is a small bathroom with sink, toilet, and shower. In 2008, the rooms contain the original restored hickory furniture and a window-mounted air conditioner. There are no telephones to maintain the original atmosphere of the motel, but the rooms do have cable TV and internet access. Original Drawing for Wigwam Motel in Design Patent 98,617 Wigwam Village #2 is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It achieved this status on March 16, 1988. =Village #3: New Orleans, Louisiana= This wigwam village was built in 1940, on U.S. Route 61 in Metairie, a suburb of New Orleans, Louisiana. It included a restaurant, cocktail bar, souvenir shop, and Esso service station. Village #3 went out of business in 1954, leaving little documentation behind. =Village #4: Orlando, Florida= Wigwam Village #4 was built in 1948, and was located at 700 S. Orange Blossom Trail. The builder, Jerry Kinsley, later served as mayor of Edgewood, Florida. This relatively large wigwam village consisted of 27 guest rooms, each in a separate wigwam constructed to resemble a horseshoe shape, with four additional wigwams, likely housing offices and a restaurant. A pool was located in the middle of the lot. Village #4 claimed to be \\"Orlando's largest and finest Motel.\\" Village #4 was razed in 1974, and replaced with a Days Inn. The only part of the original design that survived was the swimming pool. An attempt to save some of the tipis by using a helicopter to airlift them to a YMCA Summer Camp failed, as they were too heavy to move. A 330-room Vacation Lodge now sits on the site. =Village #5: Bessemer, Alabama= The Wigwam Village #5 was built in 1940 in Bessemer, Alabama. It was located north of downtown Bessemer, on U.S. Route 11, and included 15 guest cabins, arranged in a semicircle around the restaurant, restrooms, and offices. Rather than the steel, lath, and plaster of Redford's original design, the Village #5 structures were made of steel, wood, and felt, then covered in canvas and treated with linseed oil. Village #5 went out of business in 1964, and was demolished after falling into ruin, although the restaurant reportedly stood until 1970. =Village #6: Holbrook, Arizona= Individual unit, Wigwam Motel, Holbrook, Arizona Arizona motel owner Chester E. Lewis built this Wigwam Village in 1950. It is located on the historic Route 66, at 811 West Hopi Drive in Holbrook, Arizona. Nearby places of interest include Petrified Forest National Park, Meteor Crater (Barringer Crater), and the Grand Canyon. The plans for this motel were based on the original of Frank A. Redford. Lewis first became aware of the distinctive wigwam designs when passing through Cave City in 1938. He purchased the rights to Redford's design, as well as the right to use the name \\"Wigwam Village,\\" in a novel royalty agreement: coin- operated radios would be installed in Lewis's Wigwam Village, and every dime inserted for 30 minutes of play would be sent to Redford as payment. Wigwam Motel, Holbrook, Arizona The motel is arranged as a square, with 15 concrete and steel wigwams on three sides and the main office on the fourth, flanked by two smaller sized wigwams; there was also originally a gas station on the complex. The individual units are called \\"wigwams,\\" not \\"rooms\\" or \\"tepees\\" or \\"cabins.\\" The units are numbered from 1 to 16, (there is no 13). The base diameter is , with each unit in height. Behind the main room of each unit is a small bathroom with sink, toilet and shower. Current rooms contain the original restored hickory furniture, two double beds, cable TV and a window- mounted air conditioner. In keeping with the authenticity of the restoration, there are no telephones, Internet access or ice machine. Vintage restored automobiles from the 1960s and earlier are located throughout the parking area. Small green metal benches etched with the words \\"Wigwam Village #6\\" are scattered throughout the complex as well. Lewis operated the motel until closing it in 1974 when Interstate 40 bypassed downtown Holbrook. Two years after his death in 1986, sons Clifton and Paul Lewis and daughter Elinor renovated the motel before reopening it in 1988. The Lewis family continues to run and maintain Wigwam Village #6. Near the registration desk is a small room that contains much of Chester Lewis's memorabilia, including a collection of petrified wood. Wigwam Village #6 has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places since May 2, 2002. =Village #7: Rialto/San Bernardino, California= Wigwam Village No. 7 Frank Redford built this complex for himself in 1947‚Äì49 and not as a franchise. The address of the motel is Rialto, California, but the motel is physically located in San Bernardino. It is on the boundary between the two cities on historic Route 66, with an address of 2728 East Foothill Boulevard, Rialto, California. Unlike the one arch of wigwams in other surviving villages, Village #7 has a double row of wigwam guest rooms. They total 20 in number, as well as a base for what seems to be another never-completed wigwam in the back of the property. A central building is currently used as an office, with a lobby that is open 24 hours a day. There is also a swimming pool, a large grass front and palm trees surround the property. The property had become very run down and rooms were rented by the hour, aggravated by a sign advertising \\"Do it in a Tee Pee\\" that is still on site in the back. The complex underwent renovation, for which the National Historic Route 66 Federation awarded the Cyrus Avery Award in 2005. Attention to detail was the main focus during renovation, as the wigwams lost their zigzag pattern. Since 2012, the motel has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Other wigwam-like motels The Tee Pee Motel in Wharton, Texas near Houston, which was built in 1942 by George and Toppie Belcher; George Belcher had the idea while on vacation in Wyoming. It is not of the same design nor heritage as the Wigwam Motels; each of the tipis at the Tee Pee Motel are of different shapes, and line up in a straight line. The Belchers sold the motel in 1955, and it had been in disrepair for decades. A man named Dan Ryan bought it in 1995, but subsequent attempts to locate him failed, and the taxes on the property weren't paid. Then, in July 2003, Bryon Woods, a diesel mechanic, won the Texas Lottery. At his wife's urging, Woods bought the property. Modern conveniences were added, and the Tee Pee Motel reopened for business in October 2006. In March 2012 the motel was the site of a large drugs seizure. It closed in 2017, due to flood damage from Hurricane Harvey. Similar motels also stood in San Antonio, Port Neches, and Corsicana, Texas. Appearances in popular culture The motels and their imitators have been parodied many times. Rockstar's 2004 Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas game contains a Tee Pee Motel. In the 2006 Pixar film Cars, one of the characters runs a \\"newly refurbished\\" neon-lit motel that is clearly inspired by Wigwam Village #6. The motel is called the Cozy Cone Motel, and each room is fashioned as a traffic cone. In 2012 a digitally altered image of Wigwam Village #6 appeared in an advertisement for Microtel Inn and Suites. Wigwam number 1 of the Holbrook, Arizona, Wigwam Village #6 was featured in the second episode of Oprah and Gayle's Big Adventures on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Wigwam Village #6 is featured in the 1991 movie The Dark Wind, based on the 1982 Tony Hillerman novel of the same name.

They pass backward close to the linea aspera of the femur under cover of small tendinous arches in the muscle. The first is given off above the Adductor brevis, the second in front of that muscle, and the third immediately below it. First The first perforating artery (a. perforans prima) passes posteriorly between the Pectineus and Adductor brevis (sometimes it perforates the latter); it then pierces the Adductor magnus close to the linea aspera. It gives branches to the Adductores brevis and magnus, Biceps femoris, and Gluteus maximus, and anastomoses with the inferior gluteal, medial and lateral femoral circumflex and second perforating arteries. Second The second perforating artery (a. perforans secunda), larger than the first, pierces the tendons of the Adductores brevis and magnus, and divides into ascending and descending branches, which supply the posterior femoral muscles, anastomosing with the first and third perforating. The second artery frequently arises in common with the first. The nutrient artery of the femur is usually given off from the second perforating artery; when two nutrient arteries exist, they usually spring from the first and third perforating vessels. Third/fourth The third perforating artery (a. perforans tertia) is given off below the Adductor brevis; it pierces the Adductor magnus, and divides into branches which supply the posterior femoral muscles; anastomosing above with the higher perforating arteries, and below with the terminal branches of the profunda and the muscular branches of the popliteal. The nutrient artery of the femur may arise from this branch. The termination of the profunda artery, already described, is sometimes termed the fourth perforating artery of Elliott after the anatomist who first dissected its course.

Its northern terminus is an intersection with US 27/SR 1 in Rock Spring Route description SR 95 begins at an intersection with SR 151 south-southeast of Catlett and northeast of LaFayette, in the northeastern part of Walker County. This intersection is along the northwestern edge of the Armuchee-Cohutta Ranger District of the Chattahoochee‚ÄìOconee National Forest. It heads to the north-northwest through rural portions of the county. The highway curves to the northwest and crosses over Little Chickamauga Creek before entering Catlett. There, it curves back to the north-northwest. It then travels over the Peavine Ridge. SR 95 curves to the west and crosses over Peavine Creek. After curving back to the north-northwest, it passes Rock Spring Elementary School. The highway crosses over Rock Spring Creek before entering the southern part of Rock Spring. It passes the Rock Spring Athletic Association, whose entrance is across the street from the Walker County Local Government Services building. It curves to the northwest and meets its northern terminus, an intersection with US 27/SR 1\\\\. Here, the roadway continues to the northwest as Rock Spring Drive. History Originally a route built and maintained by the Department of the Interior as part of Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, SR 95 was designated in the 1930s when the National Park Service ceded control of roads outside of the park. Originally extending from SR 143 (now SR 136) to US 27 in Rock Spring, the highway was truncated to SR 151 when SR 151 was extended south to US 27\\\\. Not a major highway, the route has otherwise seen very little change since it was first commissioned and bisects the Round Pond community, noted on maps as Catlett (the store there carries the Catlett name). However, guide signs on US 27/SR 1 identify Catlett as a control city.

In Metra's zone-based fare system, Wilmette is in zone C. The station is located at Green Bay Road and Washington Avenue in Wilmette's central business district. It is also in close proximity to the Wilmette Village Hall. Northbound trains stop on the west platform and Chicago-bound trains stop on the east platform. The closest CTA Purple Line station is Linden, about a mile away.  History  The first railroad station in Wilmette opened in 1871 at a cost of $700 (the equivalent of $14,000 today). In 1875, it took 30 minutes to get to Chicago (about the same as now), and the fare was 11 cents (adult one- way tickets cost $3.05 in 2006).Cary, Joan. \\"Railroads retain their importance.\\" Chicago Tribune 4 Feb. 2004: NS-24.

History  Founded in 1930, the WFPL produced documentaries of the U.S. labor movement including the National Hunger marches of 1931 and 1932 and the Bonus March 1932. These newsreels were generally not distributed to mainstream theaters, but shown at party or trade union events. When shown in theaters, they often opened for films produced in Europe or the Soviet Union. In New York, the \\"Harry Alan Potamkin Film School\\" was established by the Workers Film and Photo League to train working-class filmmakers. Initially affiliated with the Workers International Relief, the group first organized to project films at fundraising events for striking workers. Although the best known chapter of the WFPL was in New York, groups in Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, and other cities created and screened documentaries under the \\"Film and Photo League\\" moniker. Nationally, the Film & Photo Leagues emerged as a loosely knit alliance of local organizations that provided leftist visual propaganda. Their efforts during the years of the early Depression helped to define social documentary film and photography as a genre. Much has been made of the association of the Workers Film and Photo League with Communism, both in the United States and abroad. While many members were self identified Marxists and Communist Party USA members, the groups usually functioned independently. They were largely composed of idealists who saw the documentary film as a vital element of the movement for radical social change. In 1933 \\"Workers\\" was dropped from the title and the New York organization became the Film and Photo League. The FPL survived for another year in New York, where its photographers formed the Photo League. Some filmmakers formed an independent private production company, others founded Nykino and some, later, the Frontier Film Group. In other cities, such as Chicago and Los Angeles, Film and Photo League activities continued throughout the 1930s.

The dialogue is a mixture of Cockney rhyming slang, London Yiddish, and thieves' cant.

Breslin, a prominent hotelier of the time, for three years. Nonetheless, Dewey had difficulty with the financing for the building: unable to purchase steel locally, he imported it from Europe, which caused an unusually long construction period, which in turn made it difficult for Dewey to pay his creditors. In early 1905 The American Mortgage Company repossessed the building, which was sold at auction. Breslin's lease remained, but the hotel passed through the hands of a series of owners in the following decades. The hotel was popular with travelers, but also housed many permanent residents, including dancer Isadora Duncan and Doris Duke, the heiress. Other prominent guests of the hotel included Edith Wharton and Henry Miller, and Buddy Holly and the Everly Brothers stayed there while recording at Beltone Studios, which was in the building.

The highest intercostal artery (supreme intercostal artery or superior intercostal artery) is an artery in the human body that usually gives rise to the first and second posterior intercostal arteries, which supply blood to their corresponding intercostal space. It usually arises from the costocervical trunk, which is a branch of the subclavian artery. Some anatomists may contend that there is no supreme intercostal artery, only a supreme intercostal vein. The anterior intercostal branches of internal thoracic artery supply the upper five or six intercostal spaces. The internal thoracic artery (previously called as internal mammary artery) then divides into the superior epigastric artery and musculophrenic artery. The latter gives out the remaining anterior intercostal branches. Two in number in each space, these small vessels pass lateralward, one lying near the lower margin of the rib above, and the other near the upper margin of the rib below, and anastomose with the posterior intercostal arteries from the thoracic aorta. They are at first situated between the pleurae and the intercostales interni, and then between the intercostales interni and innermost. They supply the intercostal muscles and, by branches which perforate the intercostales externi, the pectoral muscles and the mamma. The musculophrenic artery arises from the internal thoracic artery, directed obliquely downward and laterally, behind the cartilages of the false ribs; it perforates the diaphragm at the eighth or ninth costal cartilage, and ends, considerably reduced in size, opposite the last intercostal space. It gives off intercostal branches to the seventh, eighth, and ninth intercostal spaces; these diminish in size as the spaces decrease in length, and are distributed in a manner precisely similar to the intercostal arteries from the internal thoracic artery. The musculophrenic artery also gives branches to the lower part of the pericardium, and others which run backward to the diaphragm, and downward to the abdominal muscles. The posterior intercostal arteries are arteries that supply blood to the intercostal spaces. There are eleven posterior intercostal arteries on each side. * The 1st and 2nd posterior intercostal arteries arise from the supreme intercostal artery, a branch of the costocervical trunk of the subclavian artery. * The lower nine arteries are the aortic intercostals, so called because they arise from the back of the thoracic aorta. The right aortic intercostals are longer than the left because of the position of the aorta on the left side of the vertebral column; they pass across the bodies of the vertebrae behind the esophagus, thoracic duct, and azygos vein, and are covered by the right lung and pleura. The left aortic intercostals run backward on the sides of the vertebrae and are covered by the left lung and pleura; the upper two vessels are crossed by the left superior intercostal vein, the lower vessels by the hemiazygos vein. Opposite the heads of the ribs, the sympathetic trunk passes downward in front of them, and the splanchnic nerves also descend in front by the lower arteries. Each artery then divides into an anterior and a posterior ramus. A given posterior intercostal artery travels along the bottom of the rib with its corresponding posterior intercostal vein, as well as the intercostal nerve of the given space. The vein is superior to the artery, and the intercostal nerve is inferior to it. Commonly, the mnemonic, \\"Van,\\" is used to recall the order of the vein, artery and nerve, from superior to inferior.

Along with the Synagogue of Castelo de Vide, it is one of two existing pre-expulsion synagogues in the country. It is located at 73 Rua Dr. Joaquim Jaquinto in Tomar's historic city center. Built in the mid-1400s, the building was active as a synagogue only until 1496, when Jews were expelled from Portugal. It now houses the Abraham Zacuto Portuguese Jewish Museum (). History The Synagogue of Tomar was built between 1430 and 1460 by the city's then thriving Jewish community. Tomar's Jewish community traced its origins to the 14th century, when some individuals came to work for the Knights Templar and their successors the Order of Christ. By mid-century when the synagogue was built, Tomar's Jewish community numbered between 150 and 200 individuals‚Äî30% to 40% of Tomar's total population at the time‚Äîand the city center had a Jewish quarter. The community grew even larger when Spanish Jews settled in Tomar after Spain expelled them in 1492. The synagogue's congregation was openly active only until 1496, when King Manuel I of Portugal ordered the forced conversion or expulsion of Portuguese Jews. The building may have been abandoned until 1516, when a private individual purchased it intending to convert it to Tomar's prison. The building probably served as a prison from 1516 until the 1550s. At the end of the 16th century or beginning of the 17th century, the former synagogue became a Catholic chapel called the Ermida de S√£o Bartolomeu (Hermitage of Saint Bartholomew), serving in this capacity until the 19th century. From the 19th century until 1920‚Äîwhen Portuguese archaeologists first visited the building‚Äîit functioned as a hay barn and then as a wine and grocery warehouse. On 29 July 1921 the Portuguese government classified the building a national monument. On 5 May 1923 then owner of the building Joaquim Cardoso Tavares sold it to the Polish Jewish engineer and scholar Samuel Schwarz, who restored the building and conducted the first excavations. Schwarz donated the building on 27 July 1939 to the Portuguese government on the condition it be turned into a museum. In return Schwarz and his wife were granted Portuguese citizenship, protecting them during the Holocaust. Since 1939 the building has functioned as the Abraham Zacuto Portuguese Jewish Museum. The museum's collection includes several medieval tombstones from Jewish cemeteries throughout Portugal. Two notable exhibits include a stone plate from the Lisbon Synagogue, dated 1307 and bearing a greeting inscription, and a 13th-century inscription from Belmonte on which the Divine Name is represented by three dots in a manner reminiscent of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Architecture The Synagogue of Tomar is one of two existing preserved medieval synagogues in Portugal. The other is the Synagogue of Castelo de Vide. Four pre-expulsion synagogue buildings exist in neighboring Spain: H√≠jar Synagogue, the Synagogue of Santa Mar√≠a la Blanca and Synagogue of El Tr√°nsito in Toledo, and C√≥rdoba Synagogue. All other existing Portuguese synagogues were built after the Portuguese Inquisition ended in 1821. The building's whitewashed exterior mimics the architecture of neighboring houses, such that apart from the current Star of David and informational signage, it is not immediately recognizable as a synagogue or other religious building. The current north-facing, rectangular main entrance did not exist in the Middle Ages. The Gothic pointed arch facing east ‚Äî toward Jerusalem ‚Äî used to be the main entrance. Inside, the synagogue is a by rectangular hall with three short naves divided by four columns supporting Gothic vaulting. The vaults engage into the exterior walls, ending in carved brackets. The column capitals bear geometric and vegetal motifs. The four columns are thought to symbolize the four matriarchs‚ÄîSarah, Rebecca, Leah, and Rachel‚Äîwhile the twelve brackets represent the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Excavations in a building beside the synagogue in 1985 revealed remnants of a mikveh (ritual bath).

His story is recorded in Samguk Sagi, Samguk Yusa and Book of King Dongmyeong.  Birth and background  Geumwa (ÈáëËõô or ÈáëËù∏) was the son of Hae Buru, who was the king of Dongbuyeo. According to the Samgukyusa, Hae Buru was old and without an heir, when he found a gold-colored frog-like (or a gold-colored snail-like) child under a large rock near Lake Gonyeon. Hae Buru named the child Geumwa, meaning golden frog (or golden snail), and later made him crown prince. Hae Buru established Dongbuyeo when he moved the capital east to Gaseopwon () by the Sea of Japan (East Sea).  Reign  = Jumong's departure = Geumwa became king after Hae Buru's death. At Ubal river (), south of Mount Taebaek, Geumwa met Lady Yuhwa (), the disowned daughter of Habaek (), the god of the Amnok River or, according to an alternative interpretation, the sun god Haebak (), and brought her back to his palace. She was impregnated by sunlight and conceived Jumong. Geumwa's seven sons resented Jumong, and so did he. He attempted numerous times to destroy Jumong when he was an egg, but later gave up, as the egg was indestructible. Jumong later ran away to Jolbon, or former Bukbuyeo, where he later established Goguryeo. = Mother of Goguryeo = Lady Yuhwa, Jumong's mother, died. Geumwa gave her the burial of a Queen Mother (Queen Mother of Goguryeo), despite the fact that she had never been a queen. Jumong sent numerous gifts to Geumwa in gratitude of caring for his mother, and peace was seemingly restored between the two kingdoms.  Death  Geumwa died, and the throne was passed to his eldest son Daeso. King Daeso attacked Goguryeo during the reign of its second ruler, King Yuri. Goguryeo's third ruler King Daemusin attacked Dongbuyeo and killed Daeso. After internal strife, Dongbuyeo fell, and its territory was absorbed into Goguryeo.

After a 2006 military coup overthrew Thaksin, the military junta appointed Pallop public relations adviser to the Internal Security Operations Command of Thailand. He eventually switched sides and became an adviser to Thaksin's younger sister Yingluck Shinawatra while she was serving as prime minister. Military career Pallop was a member of Class Seven of the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy, the \\"young Turks\\", where he befriended classmate Chamlong Srimuang.Sutin Wannabovorn, \\"Thai Ruling Party Lawmakers Sour on Thaksin\\", 21 February 2006 He began his military career as a commando and self-professed assassin.New York Times, Thai Security Chief Vows a Tough Stand Against Muslim Separatists, 27 May 2007 With his young Turk classmates, Pallop was involved in successful military coups against the governments of Seni Pramoj and Tanin Kraivixien and an unsuccessful April Fool's Day 1981 coup against the government of Prem Tinsulanonda. He also admitted masterminding a number of assassination attempts against General Arthit Kamlang-ek, commander of the Army under Prem. He participated in guerrilla-warfare missions in Laos in 1966 and 1967 and was appointed chief of the Special Thai Ranger Army, a volunteer unit which carried out clandestine, anti-communist guerrilla operations financed by the US Central Intelligence Agency against the North Vietnamese Army along the Ho Chi Minh Trail in the Kingdom of Laos, in 1968.Bangkok Post, \\"A controversial figure\\", 25 August 2006 Two years later, he was appointed leader of a secret seven-man unit which carried out extrajudicial killings. \\"The assignment was to kill the leaders of communist groups all over Thailand\\", he told a reporter, and claimed to have assassinated many suspected communists. Pallop was appointed a senator by the military-led government in 1979, and became commander of the 19th Infantry Regiment the following year. He participated in operations along the Thai-Cambodian border in 1986 and 1987.Bangkok Post, \\"General urges two-pronged attack\\", 15 January 2006 He was involved in several coups. With other members of the Young Turks, he helped topple the elected government of Seni Pramoj after the massacre of 6 October 1976. Pallop also participated in the 1977 coup against the ultra-conservative government of Tanin Kraivixien. During the Prem government, the Young Turks tried to seize power on 1 April 1981. When it became clear that the royal family continued to support Prem, the coup failed; although Pallop fled to the Lao People's Democratic Republic to escape punishment, he was jailed for two months by the Laotian government. He later admitted masterminding a number of assassination attempts against General Arthit Kamlang-ek, commander of the army in Prem's administration. Although Pallop was rehabilitated and retired from the Royal Thai Army with the rank of general in 1996, he was appointed deputy director- general of the Internal Security Operations Command. In this position, he ordered military forces to storm the Krue Sae Mosque during a standoff with southern insurgents.  Krue Sae mosque incident  Pallop was appointed commander of the Southern Peace Enhancement Center to deal with insurgency in southern Thailand. On 28 April 2004, more than 100 militants carried out attacks against 10 police stations across Pattani, Yala and Songkhla provinces in southern Thailand.The Nation, \\"Shattered by horrific events\\", 29 April 2006 Thirty-two insurgents retreated to the Krue Sae Mosque, the main mosque in Pattani. A seven-hour standoff ended when Pallop, the senior army commander on the scene, ordered an assault on the mosque; all the insurgents were killed. He later said, \\"I had no choice. I was afraid that as time passed the crowd would become sympathetic to the insurgents, to the point of trying to rescue them.\\"The Nation, \\"Southern Carnage: Kingdom Shaken\\", 29 April 2004 It was learned that Pallop's order to storm the mosque contravened an order by defense minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh to seek a peaceful resolution to the standoff, regardless of how long it took.Asian Centre for Human Rights, \\"Killings At Pattani's Krue Se Mosque And A Cover Up Enquiry\\" Pallop was immediately ordered out of the area, and later tendered his resignation as commander of the Southern Peace Enhancement Center. The forward command of the Internal Security Operations Command (ISOC), which Pallop headed, was also dissolved. Although a governmental investigative commission found that security forces had overreacted, the Asian Centre for Human Rights questioned the commission's independence and impartiality. During a 3 May 2004 Senate hearing, Senator Kraisak Choonhavan noted that most of those killed at Krue Se Mosque were shot in the head and had signs that rope had been tied around their wrists. The incident sparked conflict between Pallop and Defense Minister Chavalit (who was also director of the ISOC),Wassana Nanuam, \\"Panlop to face trial for the storming of Krue Se mosque\\" and Pallop later demanded that the defense minister end his involvement in managing the southern insurgency.Wassana Nanuam, \\"Security conflicts erupt in open\\" General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh compared Pallop to American General Douglas MacArthur.http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.855.1452&rep;=rep1&type;=pdfhttps://facthaibackup.wordpress.com/2009/04/29/nonviolence- needed-in-patani-the-nation/  Opposition to Thaksin Shinawatra  Pallop is critical of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. During protests against Thaksin in early 2006, Pallop said: \\"As a real friend and former classmate from military school, I fully support Chamlong (Srimuang) in his move [to oust Thaksin]\\". He also threatened Thaksin with a military coup if Thaksin did not resign from the premiership. Bangkok Post, \\"Panlop: Military coup possible\\", 27 February 2006 = Assassination plot = Pallop was dismissed from his ISOC deputy-director position after Thawatchai Klinchana, his driver, was found driving a car containing 4.5 kg of explosives near Thaksin's residence. According to Metropolitan Police Bureau commissioner Wiroj Jantharangsee, the explosives were assembled, equipped with a remote sensor and ready to be detonated.The Nation, 'Bomb plot to kill Thaksin foiled', questions linger, 15 August 2006 Kamthorn Ooycharoen, head of the police bomb-disposal squad at the scene, confirmed that the bomb was ready for detonation. It was composed of a remote control unit, M-8 military fuses, sticks of TNT, C-4 plastic explosives, and nine plastic containers containing ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO). Pallop denied any involvement: \\"If had wanted to do it, I would have done it more subtly. In my career, I have led death squads. If I had wanted to kill him, the prime minister would not have escaped\\".' The Nation, 'If I was behind it, PM would be dead', 25 August 2006, Retrieved 25 August 2006Bangkok Post, \\"Thaksin escapes bomb, fires Gen Pallop\\", 25 August 2006The Nation, \\"Army officer arrested in alleged car bomb attempt is Pallop's driver: police\\", 25 August 2006 According to him, \\"The explosives were being transported; they were not assembled to be detonated.\\"The Nation, \\"'If I was behind it, PM would be dead'\\", 25 August 2006 A military coup overthrew the Thaksin government on 19 September 2006, and the junta appointed Pallop public-relations adviser to the ISOC in May 2007. He promised to use \\"secret tricks\\" and negotiation, avoiding violent clashes: \\"Don't see me as a man who favours violence\\".  Support for Thaksin Shinawatra  Prior to the 2011 election Pallop eventually changed sides and joined the pro-Thaksin Pheu Thai Party as well as its associated activist group United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD, also known as the 'Red Shirts'). However a highly public falling out with the leaders of the UDD, over tactics in 2010, ended his role within the latter organisation. He also served as an advisor to Thaksin's sister Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. In 2012 Pallop as a security adviser to the prime minister, says he plans to bring former premier Thaksin Shinawatra back to Thailand that year. Pallop proposed the collecting of 20,000 signatures to submit an amnesty bill to parliament, as one way to bring Thaksin back if the national reconciliation proposal by the King Prajadhipok Institute does not result in an amnesty for the exiled politician. Pallop said the Pheu Thai Party promised an amnesty bill allowing Thaksin to come back, during the election campaign in Buri Ram last year, and the pledge must be fulfilled. Pallop was confident the bill would pass parliament. Pallop also divulged that he had met Thaksin in person and that he had agreed with the idea of the amnesty bill. The failure of the amnesty bill led to the 2013‚Äì2014 Thai political crisis. During the political crisis which began in October 2013, Pallop told the media in late February 2014 that he had been asked by the caretaker government (under Yingluck) to join the Centre for Maintaining Peace and Order (CMPO). He was also recruited as a advisor to a new movement led by Suporn Attawong, Deputy secretary-general to the prime minister and red-shirt leader. Suporn planned to recruit 600,000 young men to join the new pro-government Democracy Protection Volunteers Group as an opposition to the People's Democratic Reform Committee. According to an Australian academic, Pallop was recruited to advise on dealing with \\"men in black\\" gunmen at protests; the term originated during the 2010 crackdown on red-shirt supporters, when mysterious armed figures emerged. Military sources have said that the \\"men in black\\" may be mercenaries. Pallop is opposed to the National Council for Peace and Order, the ruling junta since 2014.

Actually, a French inventor, Adrien-Jean-Pierre Thilorier (1790‚Äì1844), discovered dry ice. Unfortunately, in almost all of his technical articles, Adrien Thilorier gave his name simply as \\"Thilorier\\";However, his name is given as \\"A. Thilorier\\" in one article: A. Thilorier (1836) \\"Acide carbonique liqu√©fi√© et solidifi√©\\" (Liquefied and solidified carbonic acid), Journal de chimie m√©dicale, de pharmacie et de toxicologie, 2nd series, 2 : 3-8. similarly, whenever others referred to him in technical articles, his name was also given only as \\"Thilorier\\". This impeded efforts by scholars to identify him subsequently.Even a brief (romanticized) biographical article about Thilorier didn't mention his first name. See: Samuel-Henry Berthoud, Les Petites chroniques de la science (Paris, France: Garnier Fr√®res, 1861), volume 2, pages 180-186. The confusion was compounded when Paul Th√©nard wrote a biography of his father, Louis Th√©nard, a French chemist:Paul Th√©nard, Un grand Fran√ßais: Le chimiste Th√©nard (1777-1857) (Dijon, France: Imprimerie Jobard, 1950). In 1835, Adrien Thilorier had created dry ice by spraying liquid carbon dioxide into a glass vessel. He had thought that the dry ice was merely snow; that is, water vapor from the atmosphere which had condensed as a result of the cold that the evaporation of the liquid carbon dioxide had produced. Louis Th√©nard had explained to Thilorier that his \\"snow\\" was actually solidified carbon dioxide.See: * Thilorier (1835) \\"Solidification de l‚Äôacide carbonique\\" (Solidification of carbonic acid), Comptes rendus ‚Ä¶ , 1 : 194-196; see especially page 196. * Thomas O'Conor Sloane, Liquid Air and the Liquefaction of Gases: A Practical Work ‚Ä¶ , 3rd. ed (New York, New York: Norman W. Henley Publishing Co., 1920), page 138. * Paul Th√©nard (1950), p. 177. In a footnote of Louis Th√©nard's biography, Paul Th√©nard identified the \\"Thilorier\\" who discovered dry ice as \\"Charles-Saint-Ange Thilorier\\", a student at the √âcole polytechnique in the class of 1815.Paul Th√©nard (1950), p. 176. This (mistaken) identification was mentioned by Duane H. D. Roller, a graduate student at Harvard University, in a paper that was published in 1952.Duane H. D. Roller (1952) \\"Thilorier and the first solidification of a \\"permanent\\" gas (1835)\\", Isis, 43 : 109-113 ; see especially page 111. Consequently, many sources claim that Charles-Saint-Ange Thilorier discovered dry ice. Adrien-Jean-Pierre Thilorier was an employee of the French Post Office in Paris who invented, among other things, an oil lamp, a gas compressor, and an apparatus for producing liquid carbon dioxide. It was a French scholar who revealed that he had discovered dry ice. During the 1960s, Madeleine Ambri√®re-Fargeaud, a scholar in France, was trying to identify the person who served as the model for a \\"mad scientist\\" character, Balthazar Cla√´s, in Honor√© de Balzac's novel La Recherche de l‚Äôabsolu (The Quest of the Absolute). Her research suggested that Cla√´s was inspired (in part) by Adrien- Jean-Pierre Thilorier.Madeleine Ambri√®re-Fargeaud, Balzac et \\"La Recherche de l‚Äôabsolu\\", 2nd ed. (Paris, France: Presses Universitaires de France, 1999), pp. 91-107. By 2003, Joost Mertens, a Dutch historian of science, had verified many of the findings that Ms. Ambri√®re-Fargeaud had made about Thilorier.Joost Mertens (2003) \\"Du c√¥t√© d‚Äôun chimiste nomm√© Thilorier: Balthazar Cla√´s mod√®le d‚ÄôAdrien Thilorier\\" (Towards a chemist named Thilorier: Balthazar Cla√´s model Adrien Thilorier), L'Ann√©e balzacienne 2003, 1 (4) : 251-263. That \\"Thilorier\\" is actually Adrien-Jean-Pierre Thilorier is proved by French government documents, especially patents. In 1826, he was granted a patent for a \\"hydrostatic lamp\\"; the patent lists his name as \\"Thilorier (Adrien-Jean- Pierre)\\" of Paris.Patent 4913: Adrien-Jean Thilorier, \\"Pour une lampe hydrostatique,\\" Description des machines et proc√©d√©s sp√©cifi√©s ‚Ä¶ , 44 : 416-429 (1841); issued: May 12, 1826. His 1831 patent for a gas compressor also lists his name as \\"Thilorier (Adrien-Jean-Pierre)\\" and describes him as an employee of the \\"Administration des postes\\" (i.e., the Post Office) in Paris.Patent 2896: Thilorier, Adrien-Jean-Pierre, \\"Pour le perfectionnement d'une machine √† comprimer le gaz, ‚Ä¶\\" (For the improvement of a machine to compress gas, ‚Ä¶), Description des Machines et Proc√©d√©s consign√©s dans les brevets d'invention, ‚Ä¶ , 30 : 251-267 (1836); issued: May 16, 1831. In 1832, the Bulletin of the laws of the kingdom of France also lists him as \\"Thilorier (Adrien-Jean-Pierre)\\" and as an employee of the Post Office, who resided at number 21 on the Place Vend√¥me in Paris, and as the inventor of a gas compressor.The Bulletin des Lois du Royaume de France (Bulletin of the laws of the kingdom of France), 9th series, part ii, no. 92, page 74 (February 1832) lists: \\"24¬∞ M.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Chuck Jones, in his first collaboration with writer Michael Maltese. The cartoon was released on December 5, 1942, and stars Daffy Duck and Porky Pig. It was the second color entry in the Looney Tunes series, and the first pairing of Porky and Daffy produced in Technicolor. The title was presumably inspired by a film of that era, either My Favorite Wife (1940) or My Favorite Blonde (1942). In this case the title is used ironically. This is one of several entries in a series where Daffy (during his \\"screwball\\" period) torments Porky in a variety of ways. Plot Porky is on a camping vacation beside a lake where Daffy happens to live. The duck quickly insinuates himself into Porky's attempts at relaxation, and every time the duck gets Porky riled enough to threaten violence, Daffy shows him a sign that says it is not duck hunting season, and that there is a hefty fine for even \\"molesting\\" (i.e. \\"bothering\\") a duck. When Porky calls Daffy screwy, Daffy makes eyes with Porky and responds \\"That, my little cherub, is strictly a matter of opinion\\". Porky and Daffy both sing to different effect. Porky, who has trouble with words starting with M and B (among others), stammers and stutters his way through the standard \\"On Moonlight Bay\\" from 1912, while Daffy periodically breaks into a somewhat-sultry version of a then-recent hit called \\"Blues in the Night.\\" At one point, Porky unconsciously starts to sing Daffy's number, then stops, looks into the camera with a \\"Harumph!\\" and returns to \\"Moonlight Bay\\". Daffy is able to get away with a lot \\"Hoo-hooing\\" after every gag, until near the end, when a new sign says duck hunting season is now open, and it even specifically invites shooting this duck. The tide has turned dramatically, and Porky gets his revenge. While Porky chases Daffy around a tree, the picture gets out of order and breaks, then Daffy appears saying \\"Ladies and gentlemen, due to circumstances beyond our control, we are unable to continue this picture. But don't worry, I'll tell you how it came out.\\". The duck asides to the audience that he beat up Porky. A hook whisks Daffy offscreen and a loud smashing sound is heard. Porky then drags the dazed duck across the screen, his shotgun now bent in the form of Daffy's head. Cast ‚Ä¢ Mel Blanc as Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Eagle and Baby Eagle Production notes The song, \\"Blues in the Night\\" (Music by Harold Arlen; lyrics by Johnny Mercer) is perhaps better known as \\"My Mama Done Tol' Me When I Was in Kneepants\\" and is from the 1941 Warner Bros. film, Blues in the Night. The song had been recently nominated as the Best Song Oscar for Warner Bros. shortly before My Favorite Duck was released. Availability The short occurs in its entirety in the documentary Bugs Bunny: Superstar, Part 2, which is available as a special feature on Disc 2 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 4.

Players place special track pieces onto an irregular octagon board, winning by being the first to create an unbroken path between two opposite sides. It is an example of a connection game. Rules =All games= Play begins with an empty board, and players choose certain color groups as their individual \\"stocks\\". To win, a player must connect any two opposite sides of the board in an unbroken path, regardless of whose pieces the path goes through. Game players move according to three \\"basic rules\\", one and only one of which is to be executed every turn: #Players may place a piece from their own stock onto an unoccupied spot on the board. #Player may rotate a piece already on the board to any chosen orientation, if they placed it there. #Player may move one of their pieces already present on the board to any unoccupied space in any orientation. =Two-player game= In a two player game, each player chooses two colors (two sets of six) to form their stock. =Three-player game= In a three player game, each player chooses one color (six shapes) to form their stock, and the last color is set aside as a common stock. Any player may play from the common stock on their turn, and rotate or move common pieces on the board. However, after a common piece is acted upon in one of these three manners, it cannot be moved or relocated on the next two turns. In other words, if player A rotates a common piece on the board, neither player B nor C will be able to move or rotate it on their immediately subsequent turns. However, once play returns to A, any player is free to rotate or relocate the piece again‚Äì unless, of course, A chooses to move or rotate the piece again. =Four-player game= Players choose one color each as well as a partner, and play as two opposing teams. Partners sit opposite each other, with play passing between teams every turn. Players have the power to rotate or relocate a team member's piece if it is already on the board, but do not have the ability to play unplayed pieces from their partners' stocks. Strategy Control of the \\"ports\\" at the edges of the board is important, as control or successful manipulation of these is necessary in order to establish a path across the board. Players should also be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of the different pieces.

It was her ninth album of new recordings released since 1982. The front cover of the CD has the title Live at Town Hall, New York City September 19‚Äì20, 2001, however the official title of the album is just Live in New York. Recorded less than 10 days after the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York City, the album was produced during a tour Anderson gave of the United States in which she performed a mixture of older pieces from earlier in her career and newer works, including songs from her then-recent album Life on a String, as well as earlier albums such as United States Live, Big Science, Bright Red, Home of the Brave and Strange Angels. Following so close to the attacks, Anderson makes several statements about them in her recognizable style. The performance is highlighted by a performance of \\"O Superman,\\" the song that launched Anderson to stardom in 1981 and that contains lyrics that can‚Äîin retrospect‚Äîbe seen to relate to the terrorist attacks. One song, \\"Progress\\", is a retitled performance of the song \\"The Dream Before\\" which Anderson debuted in her 1986 short film What You Mean We? and later featured on Strange Angels. The original release of the album included a loose insert with short piece written by Anderson about the experience of performing in New York soon after 9/11. She also indicates that the tour was intended to be just a live version of Life on a String but her partner at the time, Lou Reed, suggested she include some older works as well.

The short was released on December 30, 1944, and features Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. Plot Elmer Fudd attempts to catch Bugs Bunny with a carrot on a fish hook, but Bugs attaches the hook to Elmer's pants and reels Elmer in. Then Elmer chases Bugs into a Vaudeville theater; Bugs disguises himself as a can- can dancer, but Elmer recognizes Bugs, and prevents him from exiting the stage. Bugs dances, then plays the piano where Elmer hides and gets bounced around. Bugs then tricks Elmer into high-diving into a glass of water. Elmer is then tricked into wearing a Shakesperean costume, then, prompted by Bugs, acts, then does poses and silly faces; Bugs prompts the booing audience to throw a tomato at Elmer. Elmer is then tricked into performing a striptease down to his shorts. Bugs disguises himself as a southern sheriff while a real one arrests Elmer for \\"indecent southern exposure\\". But the sheriff stays for the Bugs Bunny cartoon on the movie screen. Elmer notices the scene with Bugs' disguise, thinks the sheriff is an impostor, and pulls off his pants ‚Äî disrobing a real sheriff, who furiously escorts Elmer out of the theater with his rifle as Bugs conducts the orchestra in a finale.

This is the first cartoon to feature Bugs' signature song \\"What's Up Doc?\\" playing during the title card. Bugs' goofy yell to Elmer, \\"Here I ya-um!\\" was a catchphrase used by radio star Red Skelton's country bumpkin character \\"Clem Kadiddlehopper\\". The Southern sheriff in this cartoon is a prototype of Yosemite Sam, which was later confirmed in the Toonheads episode \\"Before They Were Stars\\". This prototype version of Sam appears to be a little taller in height (almost as tall as Bugs), older in age (hence the white hair), and is a good guy who is a fan of Bugs and his cartoons, in contrast to the \\"official\\" Sam who is evil, hates rabbits (including Bugs), shorter in height and younger in age with red hair. Bugs' final line, \\"I got a million of 'em!\\" was a Jimmy Durante catchphrase; Bugs also mimics Durante's standard body language while saying it. This cartoon marks the debut of \\"Untitled Soft Shoe Number\\", an original music score by Carl Stalling. Animation of Bugs dancing to this music cue would later be re-used in Bugs Bunny Rides Again and Hot Cross Bunny (both 1948). The basic plotline was re-used in the 1949 Bugs-and-Elmer cartoon, Hare Do and again in the 1950 Bugs-and-Elmer cartoon, Rabbit of Seville. A modified version of the high dive is used in Hare Do, where Bugs tricks a blindfolded Elmer into riding a unicycle from a wire high above a stage into the jaws of a man-eating lion, with the result having an ending reminiscent to the ending of A Day at the Zoo (1939), which featured Elmer's prototype Egghead being swallowed up by a lion. The high-diving gag from this cartoon is later used as the entire plot device for High Diving Hare (1949), where Yosemite Sam tries to force Bugs Bunny to perform the high-diving act when Fearless Freep is unavailable. The line Elmer is prompted by Bugs Bunny to recite is based upon Romeo and Juliet II.ii.2 (which is actually \\"But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?\\") See also *Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography (1940‚Äì1949) *List of Bugs Bunny cartoons References Further reading * External links * * Stage Door Cartoon on the Internet Archive Category:1944 films Category:1944 short films Category:1944 animated films Category:1940s American animated films Category:1940s animated short films Category:American films Category:Films about hunters Category:Films scored by Carl Stalling Category:Films set in a theatre Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:Short films directed by Friz Freleng Category:Warner Bros.

With its reversed offset body, the Hi- Flier has an intentional resemblance to the Mosrite \\"Ventures\\" guitar. The name is often misspelled (e.g. High Flyer). Phases The Hi-Flier went through many changes, generally divided into four \\"phases.\\" However, the changes that define these have \\"transitional\\" periods, where characteristics from an older phase carry over into early production of a new phase. It is impossible to date these guitars by the serial number as it is uncertain whether records were kept on their production. =Phase One= The Hi-Flier model debuted around 1967, with two P-90-style pickups. The design is loosely based on the body shape of the Mosrite Mark 1 and its later iterations, though with a thinner and much lighter body. The top of the Hi-Flier headstock has two \\"U\\"-shaped cuts, echoing the three-notch \\"M\\" shape of the Mosrite. The pickguard shape and control layout also mimicked Mosrite. The first Hi-Fliers have a three-tone sunburst finish, pearloid white pickguard and truss rod cover. These very early Hi-Fliers are distinctly different from later models, having thicker bodies and necks, a \\"bar\\" type string tree that covers all six strings, larger fret markers for all frets except the two on the twelfth fret, dual black rocker switches on the pickguard, and a raised chromed-plastic \\"Univox\\" headstock logo. Sometime in late 1968 or early 1969, a limited special version, the Hi-Flier Custom, was produced. With this new model, a black finish was offered along with the standard sunburst finish. These are very similar to the earliest Hi Fliers, except that they have a red tortoiseshell pickguard and truss rod cover, often slimmer neck/body (which became standard for all Hi-Fliers around this time period), and a badge that reads \\"Univox Custom.\\" In addition, there were Hi-Fliers made that have all the characteristics of the Custom version, but are fitted with a standard \\"Univox\\" badge, with no Custom tag. This is likely due to the Hi-Flier Custom being created simply to use leftover stock badges from a previous Univox Custom model (a hollowbody 335-type guitar built in the early 1960s). The factory presumably had many badges left over, and used them on the Hi-Fliers until they ran out, returning to the standard \\"Univox\\" badge. =Phase Two= A redesign retained the P-90 pickups but included the following changes: * string trees changed to separate metal pieces * fret markers smaller, and uniform in size * three-way toggle switch replacing the earlier rocker switches * addition of white finish (options were now: sunburst, black, white) * pickguard no longer pearloid or tortoise shell, but rather plain white three-layer (w/b/w) * midway through production of the Phase Two models, the headstock logo was changed from the plastic \\"Univox\\" logo to a 1970s-style block-letter \\"UNIVOX\\" decal under the lacquer finish between the tuners. This would remain for the rest of production. =Phase Three= alt=Around 1974, the Hi-Flier was updated with a new finish option (Natural). Twin humbuckers in black plastic surround rings replaced the P-90-type pickups. These pickups were already in production for the Ripper (Strat copy) and Gimme (Les Paul style). They are extremely high output pickups, with a distinctive open-top cover and three-screw mounting. Though these humbuckers strayed significantly from the Mosrite design, their unique tone and high output have made this a sought-after version of the Hi Flier. Production of the Hi-Flier reached its peak in the mid 1970s. Consequently, Phase Three Hi-Fliers are the most common variety found today. In addition, the natural-finish guitars and many later Phase Three guitars (in Black) were fitted with maple fingerboards. =Phase Four= Hi-Flier Phase IV (1977) in sunburst Around 1977, the Hi-Flier was once again changed. The white and black guitars retained their white pickguards, while sunburst and natural guitars were fitted with black pickguards. Many had the pickup surrounds in white plastic (from the previous standard black ). The knob layout was changed from in-line tone and volume knobs to a horizontally-opposed knob layout. Most prominently, Phase Four Hi- Fliers saw a hardtail Gibson-style stop-bar bridge/tailpiece replace the former Fender Jazzmaster-style separate vibrato and roller bridge setup.

They would often take a standard \\"house\\" model they made, and apply a variety of brand names to the same guitar, depending on the market the guitar was headed for. As a result, contemporary guitars identical to the Hi-Flier have been seen under various brands, including *DeArmond ‚Äî rocker switches, P90-style pickups, tortoiseshell pickplate, \\"DeArmond\\" on headstock as decal (black lettering) under clear finish *Unicord ‚Äî late models shipped to Canada. Raised plastic \\"Unicord\\" logo. *Raven ‚Äî very early models shipped to Canada. Identical to the Phase 1 Univox Custom except for a peculiar integrated bridge/tailpiece that was also used on the Epiphone ET-270. Raised plastic logo with raven bird *Aria ‚Äî part of Aria's \\"Diamond\\" series, as the 1702T model. Identical to a Phase 2 Hi-Flier with \\"ARIA\\" decal under the finish, horizontally at the top of the headstock. *DIA ‚Äî possibly short for \\"Diamond.\\" Identical to Phase 2 Hi-Flier, mostly sunburst, with an inlaid \\"DIA\\" logo or circular \\"Dia\\" decal. *PAN ‚Äî three types. An early version identical to a Phase 1 with a small black decal of a Pan figure playing a set of pan pipes, and \\"Pan\\" text. Another model was similar to a Phase 2 Hi-Flier with a gold decal the same as described previously. Later versions had an inlaid mother of pearl \\"PAN\\" logo, and were mostly sunburst Phase 2 models.

Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 Unlike Schreder's other designs, which are all designated HP (for High Performance), the RS-15 takes its nomenclature from the designer's initials and its wingspan in metres. Design and development The dominating aesthetic feature of the RS-15 is its pod-and- boom fuselage. The forward fuselage is a composite molding, and the aft portion is a 6\\" diameter aluminum tube. The V-tail is essentially the same as on other contemporary Schreder sailplanes, differing only in detail design from that of the HP-18. Unlike Schreder's HP-series gliders, the RS-15 was intended to achieve more modest performance, sacrificing performance for a shortened build time. Early RS-15 models featured wings that were essentially the same as the HP-16, and using the same one-piece machined aluminum I-beam wing spar. Later units were supplied with wing kits nearly identical to those of the HP-18, using that ship's riveted aluminum box spar. Unlike the HP-18, however, RS-15 examples usually lack the flap/aileron interconnect that adjusts the neutral aileron deflection to match that of the flap in the range of -10 to +10 flap deflection. Some of these sailplanes with the updated HP-18 wings have -10 to +90 degrees flap deflection. Major features: *Pod-and-boom fuselage with relatively deep cockpit *V-tail that folds upwards for easy storage *Wing structure composed of spars with caps pre-machined from solid aluminium plate and aluminium wing skins bonded to closely spaced foam ribs *Fiberglass fuselage pod, wing tip skids and tail fairings *Tubular aluminum aft fuselage *Winglets added by some homebuilders *Water ballast carried inside the hollow aluminium wing spars *Typical Schreder trailing edge flaps/airbrakes Specifications right See also References *Schreder Designs webpage *Sailplane Directory Category:1970s United States sailplanes Category:Glider aircraft Category:Schreder aircraft ","title":"Schreder RS-15"},{"id":"6673371","text":"Francis Henry Jeune, 1st Baron St Helier, (17 March 1843 ‚Äì 9 April 1905), known as Sir Francis Jeune (1891‚Äì1905), was a British judge.Herbert Stephen, Jeune, Francis Henry, Baron St Helier (1843‚Äì1905), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, September 2004.

It was a commercial success when published in Japan. Multiple English translations have been published, including a 1990 edition translated by Francis Mathy and a 2013 edition translated by William F. Sibley. Pico Iyer wrote the introduction for the 2013 edition, which was published by New York Review Books. Background S≈çseki did not choose the title Mon (The Gate). When S≈çseki's publisher needed to announce the title for his next work, Toyotaka Komiya, one of S≈çseki's pupils, chose the title at random from a nearby book, which happened to be Friedrich Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra. The part of the novel describing Sosuke's retreat to a Zen temple mirrors S≈çseki's own experience in Kamakura. Shortly after completing The Gate, S≈çseki nearly died from an ongoing illness and its treatments, and his later works changed in tone and content. Plot synopsis The Gate concerns a middle-aged married couple, Oyone and Sosuke, who married for love in their student days. As the novel opens, they languish in ennui because they have no children and Sosuke has to focus on his career. Over the course of the novel it is revealed that Oyone was the wife of a former friend, and that Oyone and Sosuke suffered exclusion from society due to their ill-advised marriage. Oyone's ill health and a visit from Sosuke's younger brother provoke a familial crisis which becomes the central story. Oyone feels her childlessness was a punishment sent by the gods for abandoning her previous husband. Major themes Though S≈çseki did not identify The Gate as part of an official trilogy, scholars and critics usually consider The Gate to be the third in a trilogy of novels begun by Sanshiro (1908) and (1909). All three novels deal with the themes of self-knowledge and responsibility ‚Äì on the one hand, accountability to society, and on the other, responsibility to one's own emotions. However, the three novels do not share characters. According to critic Pico Iyer, The Gate is a book \\"about what never comes to pass.\\"The Gate focuses on detailed description of characters and setting, leaving the reader to fill in the blanks where action is left undescribed. The action that is described is often portrayed as fruitless, or as making a bad situation worse. For example, Sosuke's trip to the Zen temple only teaches him that his efforts to seek enlightenment are unlikely to succeed.

It is a sequel to 1942's A Tale of Two Kitties, with the Abbott and Costello characterizations (\\"Babbit and Catstello\\") now cast as mice. They are voiced by Tedd Pierce and Mel Blanc respectively. Plot Catstello is being chased by a cat rapidly at high speed around the house, yelling \\"Hey Babbit!\\" Catstello narrowly escapes into the mousehole, while the cat crashes into a wall. Babbit notices this and asks Catstello for the cheese, which he replied that he hasn't got any because he is scared of the cat. Babbit then chastises Catstello for his cowardice, but when this doesn't get into Catstello's head. Babbit continuously slaps him on the head. They attempt to steal cheese that is being guarded by a cat. Their schemes include past a sleeping cat, which doesn't go so well as Catstello runs off at first time, a small airplane and a rope and pull system. Finally, Catstello manages to escape the cat with a wedge of Swiss cheese, which unfortunately Babbit doesn't like. Fed-up with Babbit constantly ordering him around and repetitively slapping him as well as his ingratitude for all of Catsello's efforts, Catstello continuously slaps him and force-feeds Babbit chunks of Swiss cheese, remarking \\"Ooohhh, I'm a baaaaaaad boy!\\" Home media *Laserdisc - The Golden Age of Looney Tunes Volume 2 Side 3 Frank Tashlin *DVD - San Antonio (USA 1995 Turner print) *DVD - TCM Spotlight: Errol Flynn Adventures (USA 1995 Turner print) Notes *This is the first cartoon where Babbit and Catstello are recast as mice instead of cats as in their debut cartoon \\"A Tale of Two Kitties\\" (1942), as well as the protagonists rather than as antagonists to Tweety. They would later be recast as mice again in \\"The Mouse-Merized Cat\\" (1946) *This is also the first cartoon where Catstello turns against Babbit in the end due to the former fed-up of the latter's constant abuse. This would happen again in The Mouse-Merized Cat. *Frank Tashlin, the director of this short, is not credited during the opening credits, this is due to him leaving before the cartoon was released into theaters. *The unnamed cat in this cartoon physically resembles Babbit from \\"A Tale of Two Kitties\\". It is possible that director Frank Tashlin and the animators of this short designed the cat based on the said character. *This cartoon was re-released into the Blue Ribbon Merrie Melodies program on January 10, 1953, retitled A Tale of Two Mice.

In the German language they are called Amerikaner. There are regional differences: a black-and-white cookie is flat, has fondant icing on a denser cake base, and is common in New York City, while a half-moon cookie is slightly dome-shaped, has frosting on a fluffier cake base, and is common in Central New York and Boston. Often one side is frosted higher than the other. Black-and-white cookies may also be found with frosting instead of fondant. The origin of the black-and-white cookie in New York City is commonly traced to Glaser's Bake Shop, founded in 1902 by Bavarian immigrants in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan.Not to be confused with the village of Yorkville near Utica in Central New York. The black-and-white cookie was among the original recipes used by the bakery. Half-moon cookies, however, can be traced to Hemstrought's Bakery in Utica, New York, around 1925. The relationship between the two origins is murky; it is likely that both recipes share a common German root, although the origin and name of Amerikaner in Germany is also unclear. Purported explanations include a corruption of the word Ammoniumhydrogencarbonat (ammonium bicarbonate, a leavening agent), or that the cookie was (re)introduced to Germany by American GIs in the 1950s. German Amerikaner are often frosted entirely in white frosting. In the former East Germany, due to anti-American sentiment, the name Ammonpl√§tzchen (Ammonia cookies) was used.. In popular culture Box of Black and white cookies Black-and-white cookies are mentioned twice on Seinfeld, set in New York City. In the episode \\"The Dinner Party\\", Jerry eats a black-and-white cookie while waiting in a bakery with Elaine. He uses the cookie as a metaphor for racial harmony, saying the chocolate and vanilla represent black and white people living together and if they mix together well on a cookie they can do the same in society, suggesting the answer to poor race relations is to \\"Look to the cookie!\\" They are also mentioned on the Amazon series The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, also set in New York City, in one of the first episodes (Miriam) grabs some black and whites on her way out of the grocers, which she then gives to the concierge of her Upper West Side apartment. Also in reference to racial harmony, Barack Obama dubbed them Unity Cookies when visiting a deli in Hollywood, Florida in 2008. On June 17, 2010, video footage of Howard Stern show producer Gary Dell'Abate asleep at his desk was shown on in-studio monitors during the Howard Stern Show.

She has been told that her father has died, and is returning to find out what will be done with the estate. They arrive on a stormy night, and are greeted by her invalid uncle Robert, the housekeeper Mrs. Krug and the housekeeper's son Hanns. While exploring the mansion, Ruth is dismayed to find a large ape her father used to conduct experiments in the basement. She and the others then gather to learn how the Earlton estate will be divided. Earlton has left his estate to Ruth, but it will go to her uncle Robert in the event of her death. Very small monthly sums are also left to the housekeeper Mrs. Krug and her son Hanns, and these two are very upset about the small amount of the allowance. When Ruth goes to bed that night, a large, hairy hand reaches through the headboard and attempts to strangle her. When she screams, it disappears. Her fianc√© and Mrs. Krug arrive at her room, and attempt to comfort her. Ted gives her a sleeping potion, and she falls asleep in a chair in her room while Mrs. Krug stays with her, taking the bed. The hairy hand reappears through the headboard and strangles Mrs. Krug this time, killing her. Ruth awakens and alerts the rest of the household to what has happened. Afterward, Hanns Krug meets with Robert Earlton in secret, who tells him that their plan to kill Ruth Earlton has failed and Hanns has accidentally murdered his own mother. Hanns blames Robert for this, and after mentioning that Robert is actually his father, he strangles him as well, leaving him for dead. Dr. Clayton visits Robert's room, and Robert regains consciousness. He tells Clayton about the plan he and Hanns had to murder Ruth, so that the estate would go to them instead. Clayton rushes out to find Ruth and warn her. She has already been taken by Hanns to the basement though, where he attempts to force the ape to kill her. The ape turns on him instead, killing him.

He was President of the Republic of Nauru (acting) in 2003.  Political role  Gioura has been fighting many years with Kennan Adeang over a parliamentary seat in the Ubenide constituency, resulting in numerous vacations and by-elections between them two; the fight ended when they were both continually elected since 1980. Gioura was the Speaker of the Parliament of Nauru from 1987 until November 1992. He served as Minister Assisting the President of Nauru in cabinets of Kennan Adeang, Bernard Dowiyogo and Ren√© Harris in 1986, 2000-2001, 2003, 2003, 2003-2004. During the tumultuous year of 2003, the office of President of Nauru changed hands on six occasions. The perennial challenge for Presidential office-holders in Nauru is to stave off a vote of no confidence, to which frequent recourse is made; in 2003, these factors were particularly acute, given the ill health of President Bernard Dowiyogo. = President of Nauru = In 2003, on the death in office of President Bernard Dowiyogo, Gioura emerged as President of Nauru, initially on an interim basis. One of the results of Gioura's short period of office was the facilitating of the path of his successor, Ludwig Scotty, who, after a hiatus of several months, oversaw a more stable period of politics in Nauru.  Health  During his brief Presidency, Gioura underwent a period of enforced absence from the country, since there were concerns for his health; he received a series of medical treatment in Australia. By the year 2007, Nauruan political figures of Gioura's generation had been somewhat eclipsed by a younger set of leaders: in December 2007 the incoming President of Nauru Marcus Stephen was nearly four decades younger than Derog Gioura. While there were a few changes of President since 2003, Gioura did not resume the office since relinquishing it in that year. =Death= Derog Gioura died in 2008.

Garranger was able to locate the grave on Eretoka island by analyzing local folklore. According to legend, when Roi Mata conquered the land, his first goal was to unite the tribes to form an army. His reign is reputed to have been a peaceful one. Roi Mata was fatally poisoned by his brother. His body was not buried in his homeland and his name was not used in future generations because the locals feared his spirit.

Ed Decker and Dave Hunt co-authored the book and film. Jeremiah Films produced the film in 1982, expressing a highly critical view of the LDS Church, its practices, and its teachings. The film purports to be an expos√© of the church's secrets, and has occasioned controversy among church members and non-members since its release, provoking passionate debates about its veracity and message. Two years after the release of the film, the book was published in 1984.  Overview of the film  The God Makers was first shown to a group of 4,000 evangelical Christians on December 31, 1982, at Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, California. It was thereafter screened in various churches as an attempt to educate or warn their members about Mormonism. = Introduction and setting = The film depicts a meeting between Ed Decker and Dick Baer with two actors who portray Los Angeles attorneys. Swenson states, \\"All the people in this film are presented as 'real people', although several are actually actors re-creating incidents. Quickly, the film includes, in roughly chronological order: an invisible narrator, a middle-aged man whose family is torn from him (I call this man the stevedore; he is portrayed by an actor); a bearded, artistic-looking professorial man who lost his family (an actor); Ed Decker; Dick Baer; two attorneys (I call one the Doubting Thomas-he is wearing a velvet jacket- and the other I call Mr. Silver Gray, a distinguished older man-both actors)\\" The film states that Decker and Baer are there to consult \\"with a Los Angeles-based law firm about filing a class action lawsuit\\" against the LDS Church. Decker states that the church is a massive, multibillion-dollar corporation which shatters the lives of families and has ties into Satanism and the occult. Much of the dialogue occurs between Decker, Baer and the two actor/lawyers, in addition to interview segments with various other people interspersed throughout the film. = Temples = Dr. Harold Goodman, who is introduced as a Brigham Young University (BYU) professor, former Latter-day Saint bishop, and current mission president, provides quotes at various points throughout the film. Goodman states that the church is very family centered, and notes the importance of temple attendance and marriage to church members. The film's narrator adds that the temple is used for \\"only secret ceremonies which are reserved for an elite few,\\" and that temple attendance is required in order that \\"the worthy Mormon can become a god himself in the life hereafter, ruling over his own planet, with a number of goddess wives.\\" It is stated that temple open houses are the only opportunity some members will ever have to enter the temple, as all those who do enter are required to live according to the basic tenets of the faith and receive a temple recommend from their ecclesiastical authority (bishop). = Many gods = Baer states that members of the LDS Church believe that there are \\"billions of these highly evolved humanoids\\" in space ruling their own planets. A woman is interviewed who said that her goal as a church member was to be \\"eternally pregnant\\". One of the actor/lawyers states that he finds it difficult to believe that the church members who are attorneys and judges that he associates with expect to become \\"infinite gods\\" and populate planets through \\"celestial sex\\" with their \\"goddess wives\\". He further states that he would be embarrassed to ask them about this. Decker responds that the Mormons are so embarrassed by it that they themselves don't even talk about it. Floyd McElveen,McElveen also appears in the 2007 video Search for the Truth who is introduced as author of the bestseller, The Mormon Illusion, states that \\"their whole doctrine flows from this about becoming gods\\". = Animated segment = Decker and Baer run an animated film which utilizes teachings from Mormon prophets, including Joseph Smith's 1844 sermon the King Follett Discourse to illustrate the differences between Mormonism and Christianity. The animation depicts God the Father living on a planet called Kolob with his many identical, blonde \\"goddess wives\\" who are taking care of \\"spirit children\\" produced through endless celestial sex. A plan is presented to create and populate the Earth, and all of the spirits in attendance vote on the matter. One third of the spirits follow Lucifer's plan and are denied physical bodies. Those that are \\"neutral\\" are born with black skin. Those who were valiant were to be lighter skinned and born into Mormon families on planet earth. The narrator refers to statements made by LDS prophet Brigham Young teaching that thousands of years later, God the Father journeyed to earth \\"from a planet nearest to the star Kolob\\", to have sex with the virgin Mary, in order to provide Jesus with a physical body. It is also stated that LDS prophets have taught that the \\"Mormon Jesus\\" had a number of children through multiple wives. The narrator states that Joseph Smith Jr. claimed to be a direct descendant of Jesus Christ. The animation portrays a brief history of the events described in the Book of Mormon. The narrator states that the Book of Mormon was recovered by \\"a young treasure seeker named Joseph Smith, who was known for his tall tales in upstate New York.\\" The narrator states that the Mormons thank God for Joseph Smith and that Smith will sit in final judgment over them, along with God the Father and the Mormon Jesus. The film depicts Smith sitting in the center position with God the Father and the Mormon Jesus to either side during the judgment process. It is stated that Joseph Smith shed his blood for us, so that we too may become gods. Upon viewing the animation, one of the actor/lawyers comments that it sounds like something from von D√§niken or Battlestar Galactica (the latter's creator, Glen A. Larson, was a Mormon, who added themes derived from the religion into the show). Parts of the animated segment were featured in Bill Maher's religious documentary Religulous, due to the segment being posted on various video- sharing websites. = Divorce and suicide = The film states that the church pressures couples to divorce if they cannot endure the pressure of living up to the church standards. Decker states that his five children were pulled away from him by the LDS Church. Baer states that his wife had to divorce him and find another man who was \\"working his way to godhood\\". It is also stated the Mormon women are under such constant pressure to be perfect that they are chronically depressed. The father and brother of a young suicide victim named Kip Eliason are interviewed. The family relates how Kip could not live up to the pressure of finding that his sexual compulsions placed him at odds with the teachings of the church. The narrator states that Mormons used Christian terminology when speaking with nonmembers of the LDS Church, using words such as \\"God\\", \\"Jesus\\", and \\"salvation\\" to deceive potential converts. = Changing scriptures = Decker states that the LDS Church keeps changing its scriptures, but that Christian scholars are \\"always refining, always going back to the earliest manuscripts to improve and validate the authenticity of the holy scripture\\". He later states that \\"scripture is not to be tested\\". Sandra Tanner is introduced as one of the greatest living authorities on Mormonism. Tanner states that Mormon leaders have deliberately kept members from their true history. Tanner discusses the various accounts written by Joseph Smith of the First Vision. Many of these accounts were unknown until the 1960s when LDS scholar Paul Cheeseman produced a master's thesis documenting some of the earliest first vision accounts. Baer states that Joseph Smith claimed that the moon was inhabited, and that Brigham Young stated that the sun was inhabited as well.These claims were repeated by the narrator in the 2007 video Search for the Truth. Tanner and Decker discuss polygamy at some length. Tanner suggests that the Church has hidden documents that are not available to the public. She states that most members and missionaries are unaware of the deception and that the typical missionary \\"doesn't even realize he couldn't go to Salt Lake and see these documents for himself\\". = Book of Mormon and Book of Abraham = Dr. Charles Crane is introduced as an author, college professor, and expert on Mormon archaeology,Crane has a Master of Divinity degree (Lincoln Christian Seminary) and a Doctor of Ministry (Luther Rice Seminary). He is also the author of the books Mormon Missionaries in Flight, Archaeology as Proof of the Book of Mormon, and Why I Do Not Believe the Book of Mormon. while Dr. Richard Phales is introduced as an author, lecturer, and archaeologist. Crane states that he has looked over maps and checked archaeological information, and that he cannot locate the land of Zarahemla. Phales adds that \\"we have never excavated one single artifact\\" related to the Book of Mormon. The narrator further states that archaeology has been able to prove the existence of all great civilizations. Coins are used as an example, and Crane mentions what he states are coins listed in the Book of Mormon. Crane concludes that the Book of Mormon is a fairy tale, much like Alice in Wonderland. Decker adds that the church is converting people by claiming that archaeology has proven the Book of Mormon to be true. The Smithsonian Institution also seems to assert the same thing. It predicates that the Book of Mormon is not supported by Smithsonian Institution's archaeological research, and states, \\"The Smithsonian Institution has never used the Book of Mormon in any way as a scientific guide. Smithsonian archaeologists see no direct connection between the archaeology of the New World and the subject matter of the [Book of Mormon]. Crane also mentions the Book of Abraham, stating that it was translated from fragments of papyrus that Joseph Smith purchased from an Egyptologist, and that the manuscript resurfaced in 1967 and was found by several famous Egyptologists to have nothing to do with Abraham. Crane adds that Smith took \\"one little letter\\" that \\"looks like a backward 'e'\\", and produced from it 76 words. = Temple rituals = A reenactment of temple rituals is shown,Portions of this temple ritual reenactment are included in the 1993 sequel The God Makers II and the 2007 video Search for the Truth. which are said to be performed for the purpose of \\"evangelizing the dead\\". The narrator states that without these rituals, \\"no one can enter the presence of Joseph Smith and become a god\\". The narrator states that Mormons are encouraged to contact the dead and that it is common for demons to appear to Mormons asking them to perform family history work for them. Several people discuss temple garment, or \\"holy Mormon underwear\\", and several stories are told of people who refused to remove this underwear under any circumstances, including bathing and giving birth. = Occult = Baer states that Joseph Smith was arrested and convicted for pretending to find buried treasure using a seer stone. Decker produces what he refers to as a Satanic Bible, in which the word \\"Mormo\\" is said to represent the \\"king of ghouls\\", and whose followers are called Mormons. Baer also claims that in Chinese, the word Mormon means \\"gates of hell\\". The term \\"Mormon\\" is a nickname given to the Latter-day Saint community and based on the name of one of the central spiritual texts of the religion, the Book of Mormon. It is a phrase used in the LDS Church's \\"I'm a Mormon\\" campaign to describe the church's members. Some members of the LDS Church officially refer to themselves only as Latter- day Saints. = Economic power = The economic power of the LDS Church is discussed. A man introduced as \\"Doctor John L. Smith, author and expert on the vast wealth of the Mormon church\\", states that the LDS Church is the second largest financial institution west of the Mississippi and that it is difficult to determine what the church actually owns. The narrator adds that the church has \\"vast land holdings\\", and that billions of dollars are extracted from church members through a mandatory tithing program. The church is also said to own a substantial portion of the state of Hawaii. = Conclusion = The film concludes with the two actors playing lawyers stating that they cannot take the case, because they don't believe that a jury will believe them. They state that the LDS Church has \\"billions\\" with which to fight the case and that it would take years. Kip Eliason's father reads a letter that his son left him before he committed suicide, after which a woman is asked by an interviewer what she would miss the most if she left the church. The woman replies that she would \\"rather be dead\\" than leave.  Controversy over the film  The film created considerable controversy in some of the communities in which it has been shown, and was described by Truman G. Madsen, LDS professor of religion and philosophy, as \\"religious pornography\\".Arizona Republic, 12 Nov. 1983 The negative reaction came from both Mormons and non-Mormons. The Anti- Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith publicly presented their concerns of the film which they described as \\"Mormon bashing\\" and \\"invidious and defamatory\\". Rhonda M. Abrams, Regional Director stated the following: > I sincerely hope that people of all faiths will similarly repudiate The God > Makers as defamatory and untrue, and recognize it for what it truly > represents ‚Äî a challenge to the religious liberty of all.Statement by Rhonda > M. Abrams, 25 May 1984, Regional Director of Anti-Defamation League of the > B'nai B'rith, as quoted in Letter to Dr. Richard Lindsay, Director of Public > Communications, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, May 25, > 1984 It was noted by LDS scholars that the film portrays Mormonism as a cult far removed from mainstream Christianity, and that many statements that are represented as Mormon doctrine are not actual doctrine, with a particular emphasis on \\"those ideas which would seem most anomalous to Christians\\". In particular, the repeated references to endless celestial sex are viewed as absurd and profane. LDS respondents claim that the film portrays all Mormons as either part of a conspiracy to cover up information or as being deluded by their leaders. Swenson states, \\"You can only conclude Mormons are brainwashed or corrupt. They are hypocrites who preach family togetherness and love, but practice demonic rituals and punish any who deviate from a very rigid norm.\\" = Criticism from the National Conference of Christians and Jews = Max Jennings, editor of the National Conference of Christians and Jews (NCCJ), attended a showing in Mesa, Arizona that was sponsored by a group known as Concerned Christians, whose purpose was \\"to reach out in love to those lost in Mormonism\\". Jennings reported that \\"If what I saw Tuesday night is love, I must have had the wrong Sunday School lessons back in that dusty, west Texas Methodist Church of my childhood. I didn't hear anyone reaching out in love Tuesday night. I heard people reaching out in hatred of another's right to believe what he wants.\\" The NCCJ committee sent a letter to Concerned Christians on December 5, 1983 which stated, among other things, that > [t]he film does not fairly portray the Mormon Church, Mormon history, or > Mormon belief. It makes extensive use of half-truths, faulty > generalizations, sensationalism, and is not reflective of the true spirit of > Mormon faith. We find particularly offensive the emphasis that Mormonism is > some sort of subversive plot ‚Äî a danger to the community, a threat to the > institution of marriage, and destructive to the mental health of teenagers. > We are of the opinion that the film relies heavily on appeals to fear, > prejudice and unworthy human emotions. The film's creator has criticized the NCCJ for allegedly failing to contact Jeremiah Films, which produced The God Makers, for the purpose of elucidating claimed errors and prevarications in the film. = Further criticisms = Decker's work has also attracted criticism not only from Latter-day Saints,Michael Griffith, \\"Even as anti-Mormon books go, The God Makers is one of the worst, most inaccurate attacks on Mormonism ever written.\\"Michael T. Griffith. \\"Another Look at The Godmakers\\". ourworld.cs.com. but also from outside the faith.Massimo Introvigne, \\"the second book and film are worse than the first: they include an explicit call to hatred and intolerance that has been denounced as such by a number of Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish organizations.\\" Jerald and Sandra Tanner and Bob Passantino have said that Decker's writings grossly misrepresent Mormonism, and thereby dilute his message and offend Mormons without attracting them to evangelical Christianity. The Tanners, themselves prominent critics of the LDS Church, have noted what they contend are inaccuracies and errors in some of Decker's works such as \\"Ed Decker's ability to make up stories,\\" \\"his ability to fabricate evidence to support his own opinions,\\" and his choice of \\"the path of sensationalism in his work on Mormonism.\\" Jerald and Sandra Tanner, Serious Charges against the Tanners: Are the Tanners Demonized Agents of the Mormon Church? (Salt Lake City: Utah Lighthouse Ministry, 1991), 32, 29. One of Decker's associates offered to exorcise the Tanners's demons, and expressed great sadness when they refused. Gilbert W. Scharffs, a teacher from the LDS Institute of Religion near the University of Utah, wrote a lengthy rebuttal, stating that \\"The book relies on scare words that are emotionally laden. It is filled with words calculated to alarm others and give offense to Latter-day Saints\\" and has also noted that \\"some have said The God Makers is its own worst enemy.\\" \\"Disrespectful, Derogatory and Demeaning Language (Verbal Violence)\\" = Effects of the film = The film was publicized through conservative Christian broadcast media, which was on the rise in the 1980s. It was primarily screened for church attendees, who saw it as a definitive explanation of Mormonism. This damaged the public perception of the LDS Church. But despite popularity in some Christian circles, by the time the sequel was produced, the books and films received strong criticism for their outlandish claims and tone, even from other critics of Mormonism. The film's impact might have stayed with mostly evangelical Christians, but for a series of LDS-related scandals in the 1980s and 1990s, which turned media attention toward Mormon criticisms. In January 1990, Decker claimed that the film had produced a three million person shortfall in projected converts to the church.Saints Alive in Jesus Newsletter, January 1990 This claim was based upon a statement made by M. Russell Ballard at BYU on November 14, 1989. Ballard never mentioned a shortfall, but instead stated that the church continued to grow despite films such as The God Makers. Decker later retracted his claim.Saints Alive in Jesus Newsletter, July 1990 Sequels and books Following the debut of the original 1982 film, a book was published as The God Makers in 1984 by Harvest House. In 1984 another short film was released as The Temple of the Godmakers, depicting more of the temple ceremony reenactment than in the 1982 film. A sequel film The God Makers II was released in 1992, followed in 1993 by the book published by Harvest.

It is one of two Regional Arts Schools in the Peel District School Board. Regional Arts Program Four disciplines of art are hosted at Mayfield: drama, dance, music, and visual arts. Each has its own night to showcase the talents of the students at a junior (grades 9 and 10) and senior (grades 11 and 12) level. Their improv team also competes in various National competitions. Jazz, classical, and alternative music styles are offered. =Dance Program= Mayfield's dance program, part of the Regional Arts Program, accepts 50-60 students per year for the four-year program. It includes theoretical (dance history, culture, important figures in the dance world, the dance industry and different styles of dance) and practical components about the program. The program focuses primarily on classical ballet and modern dance; however, to ensure students are exposed to other styles of dance, the program brings in experienced instructors to hold workshops a few times per semester. In this way, students are able to learn important dance technique while experiencing other styles of dance such as jazz, hip hop, ballroom styles, and many other styles of dance from around the world. Every year, the department prepares a winter dance production. Each year explores a different winter related theme but every other year, the department performs The Nutcracker. The department also prepares a spring show in May and themes for this show can vary greatly.

Since the Chola power no longer constituted a threat, Kopperunchinga II acted as the de facto protector of the Chola king and helped him maintain his position on the throne. As he expanded his territorial holdings, Kopperunchinga II assumed such titles as Maharajasimha, Khadgamalla, Kadava Pallava, Alappirandan, Avaniyalappirandan, Kanakasabhapathy, etc. He has left numerous inscriptions mainly in the South Arcot and Chingleput districts and the northern portion of Thanjavur, and a few have also been found in the North Arcot and Chittoor districts. Ultimately, however, the resurgence of the power of the Pandya kingdom of Madurai ended Kopperunchinga's reign and the Kadava dynasty. Expansion of Kadava power Kopperunchinga II followed his father to the throne in the early months of 1243 CE. His residence was at Sendamangalam, where his father had established the Kadava capital. At the outset of his reign, his lands extended from Kanchipuram in the north to near Kumbakonam in the south. The territories north of Kanchipuram and the remaining parts of ancient Tondaimandalam up to Tiruvenkadam (modern day Tirupathi) were conquered during his reign. (In an inscription Kopperunchinga claims to have created a sea of blood from the bodies of his slain enemies.) The political situation of the Tamil country was at first very favourable for Kopperunchinga II not only to continue the consolidation of the Kadava territories but to expand them. The Kadavas' main adversary, the Hoysalas, had fought the Kadava army in many battles during Kopperunchinga I's reign; but in Kopperunchinga II's time, his Hoysala contemporary Somesvara II stayed away from the Tamil country, as he was busy maintaining his own precarious position at home. Relationship with Cholas and Pandyas Meanwhile, Kopperunchinga actively assisted Rajendra Chola III to ascend the Chola throne and acted as his protector. The Chola territories were now confined to the area around Thanjavur and portions of Tiruchi. Kopperunchinga was much the stronger ruler, and as a result the Chola king was practically his feudatory. The former would continue to issue records under his own name. Chidambaram, the temple town favoured by the Cholas, now lay within the Kadava territories. As some of Rajendra Chola III's inscriptions are found in places under Kopperunchinga's control, we may assume that these two rulers were acting as allies both against the Kakatiya dynasty and against the Pandyas to the south, who historically had been enemies to both Pallavas and Cholas. Kopperunchinga's relationship with the Pandya king Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan, though by no means cordial, somehow never led to outright war. This is because Kopperunchinga at the time was engaged in prolonged wars against other rulers of Karnataka and the Telugu chiefs, and his repeated successes against them indirectly helped the Pandya king. An inscription of Kopperunjinga in chidambaram describes his war against sundara pandyan referred to therewith as sundarattol. The End of the Kadavas Kopperunchinga's fortunes changed in 1268 CE, when Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I ascended the Pandya throne. Under his leadership the Pandya armies swept across the Tamil country, extending Pandya rule over the entire South Indian peninsula up to the River Krishna in the north. During this process Kopperunchinga II, along with his Chola ally, evidently perished. We hear no more of the Kadavas or the Cholas after 1279 CE. All the painstaking efforts at recovery and their continual wars to \\"tame the excessive pride of age of kali\\" unfortunately led to their going down fighting while their opportunistic foes like the Pandyans gaining for their efforts. .

Ironically, the station's opening was reported for News 5 by Hyacinth Latchman, who currently works at WAVE as an announcer. Mossiah denied reports that the UDP had financed the establishment of WAVE, but those reports gained some steam following an incident on May 13, 1999. = 1999 Michael Rudon false accusations = WAVE's Young reported on May 13 that then editor of the Belize Times, Michael Rudon, was under lockdown for allegedly molesting a primary school student.http://www.channel5belize.com/archive_detail_story.php?story_id=2294 False accusations raised at Belize Times editor Channel 5 and other media houses had been fed the same story, proven false. After checking with the police to confirm the story, WAVE claimed, they had gone ahead, believing in the accuracy of the report. Rudon called over to complain and WAVE's contact retracted the story, saying there had been a mistake in the police files. WAVE retracted onair and Channel 5 laid the blame at the door of then Senator, attorney, and editor of the Guardian, Audrey Matura, who had apparently been wronged by the Times editorial staff, though Matura denied it. = Takeover by the UDP and transition = Entering the 2000s WAVE Radio faced several changes in staff. Mossiah, Harris, and Yorke had all left for Love FM and FM 2000 respectively, with Mossiah being named Government Press Officer in 2002. It is presumed that by this time the Opposition UDP moved WAVE to its headquarters on the Belchina Bridge. WAVE was now in transition as new stars emerged, led by Juliet Thimbriel, who became WAVE's general manager. The station lost the popular Olden Young to suicide in 2003.

In addition, it has been a collector's item among rap music and rare groove enthusiasts since the early 90s when several of the songs were sampled by many hip hop producers including Pete Rock, Q-Tip and later Earl Sweatshirt.

The organization, based in Berlin, later produced films and coordinated propaganda efforts on behalf of the USSR. Organizational history =Formation= The Internationale Arbeiter-Hilfe (IAH), also known as International Workers' Aid or Workers International Relief (WIR) was created in Berlin on September 12, 1921, in response to a call by Lenin, in order to recruit international support in response to a drought and famine in the Volga area, particularly those lands occupied by the Volga Germans. The drought and reduced crop production in the area was turned into a humanitarian disaster when Bolshevik forces known as \\"The Iron Broom\\" began a campaign of massive \\"tax collections\\" (food requisitions) to seize food supplies and redistribute them to other parts of Soviet Russia.McMeekin, Sean, The Red Millionaire: A Political Biography of Willi M√ºnzenberg, Moscow's Secret Propaganda Tsar in the West, 1917-1940, New Haven, CT: Yale University Press (2004), pp. 105-115, 128 Lenin's call for international support was motivated by a desire to counteract the influence of Herbert Hoover's American Relief Association (ARA) in providing food aid to the people of the Volga as well as in the rest of Eastern Europe, as Soviet troops were in the process of confiscating food supplies in the Volga region. Lenin regarded the ARA as \\"mercenaries\\" who were seeking to defeat Bolshevism by alleviating hunger in Soviet Russia, thus embarrassing the Bolshevist government as ineffective and incompetent. This attitude was echoed by left-leaning commentators and editors in the United States, with the Nation speculating that Hoover might \\"use his food to overturn the Soviet government.\\" In the view of Marxist historian E.H. Carr, the original purpose of the WIR was both humanitarian and ideological: > \\"Its initial function was to provide a Left-wing counterweight to the > generous relief supplies sent to Soviet Russia by the ARA and other > bourgeois agencies to mitigate the horrors of the famine. German workers > undertook to work overtime and set aside their surplus production of > machines or consumption goods for Soviet Russia; later, collections of money > were made for Soviet workers and a loan was floated; and [Mezhrabpom] began > distributing popular literature and propaganda on behalf of Soviet > Russia.\\"E.H. Carr, A History of Soviet Russia. In 14 Volumes. London: > Macmillan, 1953; vol. 3, pg. 404. WIR was formed by Willi M√ºnzenberg, a member of the German Communist Party (KPD) and a skilled propagandist. M√ºnzenberg came to Lenin's attention through his activities as leader of the Young Communist International. With Soviet government funding, M√ºnzenberg promptly set up a series of benignly-titled front organizations such as the Friends of Soviet Russia (FSR). The FSR and similar relief organizations set up by M√ºnzenberg were conceived as a method of raising money from a broad coalition of left-wing groups for famine relief in Soviet Russia while simultaneously concealing the Soviet government's role in organizing such groups (a fact which might have otherwise impeded fundraising efforts). In the FSR, socialist politician and women's rights campaigner Clara Zetkin served as president until her death in 1933. In subsequent years WIR supported workers in Germany and other countries suffering from the effects of strikes, armed conflict, and natural catastrophes by distribution of clothes, food, and funds by adding an industrial assistance program. Initial funding of WIR was through secret Soviet funding in the form of ten million paper rubles (sovznaki) issued directly from the Soviet Central Bank. Most of WIR's funding assistance was provided through bank credits backed by the Kremlin; other sources included fund drives and tool/technology donations from other countries, from sales of confiscated assets, and from sales of donated foreign equipment such as tractors to private bidders and enterprises inside the Soviet Union. =Propaganda efforts= The national sections of WIR, such as the \\"Friends of Soviet Russia\\" in the USA, provided aid to Soviet Russia and assisted in getting the Soviets' message out to the West. M√ºnzenberg recognized the potential for cinematic propaganda, and therefore the WIR imported Soviet films as well as producing their own films. In 1922 M√ºnzenberg founded Aufbau Industrie und Handels AG to distribute Soviet films. Hermann Basler led the office for film distribution, which in March 1923 with Polikuschka (director Alexander Sanin, 1922), production of Mezhrabpom-Rus for the first time brought a Soviet film into German cinemas. As Weimar Republic Germany imposed regulations against the importation of foreign films, the WIR moved in 1924 to Vienna, Austria. WIR at first brought out only one film at its Austrian location however: Kurt Bernhardt's directorial debut Nameless Heroes (1924). Eventually, the Viennese center took over and produced later films like Kuhle Wampe (1931/32). In 1928 the WIR began to produce communist documentary films via the specialized film production company World Film. The WIR was active in the United States, known for organizing the filming of the Passaic Textile Strike in conjunction with providing strike relief, and being instrumental in the founding of the Workers Film and Photo League. The WIR was supported by numerous left intellectuals, among them Martin Andersen Nex√∂, Henri Barbusse, Maxim Gorki, George Grosz, Maximilian Harden, Arthur Holitscher, K√§the Kollwitz, George Bernard Shaw, Upton Sinclair and Ernst Toller. =Dissolution= After Nazi takeover in 1933 the WIR was severely disrupted. The Secretariat of the Executive Committee of the Communist International decided to abolish WIR in October 1935, although the decision was not announced publicly.Branko Lazitch and Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: New, Revised, and Expanded Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pg. xxix.

The band released their debut album, From Them, Through Us, to You, through Roadrunner Records on March 27, 2007. Madina Lake won Best International Newcomer at the Kerrang! Awards 2007. The group disbanded in September 2013 before reuniting in February 2017. History =Formation and The Disappearance of Adalia EP (2005-2006)= Nathan and Matthew Leone were first in a band known as The Blank Theory based in Chicago, Illinois. Drummer Dan Torelli and Mateo Camargo were in a band called Reforma that had relocated to Chicago and both bands shared the same manager and often toured together. Nathan and Matthew befriended Dan and Mateo, and unhappy with their current situations decided to disband their respective bands, and form Madina Lake. Shawn Currie of The Blank Theory was in the original line up as the band's keyboardist for Madina Lake, but left shortly after the band started working on material causing Camargo to become the band's keyboardist. They played their first show as Madina Lake on May 21, 2005, at Chicago's historic Metro. Nathan and Matthew Leone first gained nationwide media recognition when they appeared in a special edition of Twin Fear Factor. They won $45,000 ‚Äì $20,000 from finishing the first stunt the fastest, and $25,000 from finishing one of the two last stunts the fastest ‚Äì and used it to pay for a recording process and demo of Madina Lake's first self-produced EP entitled The Disappearance of Adalia, which was released on August 22, 2006. =From Them, Through Us, to You (2006-2008)= After releasing The Disappearance of Adalia, Madina Lake gained a recording contract and signed with Roadrunner Records in April 2006 and created their first full length album entitled From Them, Through Us, to You, which was released on March 27, 2007.Lynch, Casey (March 2007). \\"100 Bands You Need to Know - Madina Lake[sic]\\".

Lead vocalist Nathan Leone on November 18, 2007. The release of From Them, Through Us, to You was followed up by a headlining tour with Fightstar and participating in the Projekt Revolution tour. At first they had originally planned to play Warped Tour 2007, but dropped out to play on the Revolution Stage when Linkin Park specifically chose them. The band has also toured (at different times) alongside such acts as Story of the Year, Aiden, Halifax, and Mayday Parade, among others. Between Jan and Feb 2008 they toured the UK playing in the Kerrang tour alongside Fightstar and Coheed and Cambria. On May 3, 2008, Madina Lake played their third year of The Bamboozle festival in New Jersey and on June 14, 2008, they also played the infamous Download Festival in Donington Park on the Main stage and wrapped up touring From Them, Through Us, to You on Warped Tour 2008 from July 9 to July 25.

Local bands got the chance of a support slot through a competition Madina Lake ran with Atticus Clothing. It was intended to support their new EP, The Dresden Codex, which according to vocalist Nathan Leone sounds closer to their debut \\"From Them, Through Us, To You\\" than \\"Attics to Eden\\". The name of the album refers to a Mayan astrological codex, one of the oldest existing, as it is thought to be a copy of an even older text. This holds with Madina Lake's tradition of bringing astrology into their backstory, known colloquially as 'The Folklore'. The Dresden Codex was recorded in South Beach, Florida, in early 2010, and made appearances at the UK Sonisphere Festival on August 1 and Hevy Music Festival on August 8, 2010 in Kent. In May 2010 it was announced via an interview with Rocksound that they had left their record label, Roadrunner. On 30 June, bassist Matthew Leone was hospitalized after intervening in a domestic violence incident involving a man beating his wife. He suffered many injuries including a fractured skull, broken jaw and a swollen brain. On August 2, it was reported that Leone was recovering from \\"a second significant surgery, and is on his way to recovery.\\" Just days earlier, The Smashing Pumpkins, the favorite band of both Leone brothers, played a benefit show in Chicago for Matthew to pay his hospital bills. They raised $80,000. =World War III, From Them, Through Us, To You reunion (2011‚Äì2013, 2017‚ÄìPresent)= The band played the first two weeks of the 2011 Vans Warped Tour. It was confirmed via an interview with NBC that Sony had signed the band at the beginning of April and their new record World War III will be released September 13, 2011, as recording was complete as of April 17. The new album will be the third and final installment of their concept trilogy, World War III, which continues the Leone brothers' tales of a metaphorical universe. In the final chapter, World War III, concludes with the discovery of Adalia and an epic battle of good and evil that mirrors human internal struggles with self. The album was produced, engineered and mixed by Mateo Camargo and Madina Lake except the song \\"Imagineer\\" which was produced and written by Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins) and Madina Lake. On July 5, 2012 Madina Lake announced the 'Trilogy Finale Tour' that would spread across 8 days, playing 8 shows in small and intimate venues across the UK. Along with this tour they announced that guitarist Mateo would be joining them on the finale tour across the UK. Madina Lake went on to announce that they would be playing their debut album 'From Them, Through Us, To You' in its entirety as well as other songs from their next 2 albums to wrap up the story of fictional character 'Adalia.' As well as general admission tickets, package deals would be available, the ¬£25 package offered a 'disappearance' t-shirt, trilogy book as well as entrance to the show. The ¬£50 package would offer the same as the ¬£25 package along with a pre-show meet and greet as well as a Q and A session with the band regarding the story and concept behind the disappearance of Adalia. On 21 January 2017, Madina Lake updated their Facebook cover photo with an old style 'programme interruption' picture with the words 'Please Stand By', hinting at a possible reunion. On 15 February, Madina Lake announced a six show United Kingdom Reunion Tour, including three dates at Slam Dunk Festival, in May 2017. On 21 February 2017, Madina Lake announced that they would release new music in support of the reunion shows. On 3 April 2020, the band released a new song called Playing With Fire, their first offering of new material since 2011.https://www.deadpress.co.uk/news-madina-lake-return-with-new-single- playing-with-fire/ In July 2020, the band announced details of a new EP called 'The Beginning Of New Endings', which was originally set to be released on 4 September 2020.https://www.deadpress.co.uk/news-madina-lake-announce-new-ep- the-beginning-of-new-endings/ After a few set backs, the EP was eventually released on 28 September 2020.https://music.apple.com/gb/album/the-beginning- of-new-endings-ep/1533714207 In an interview with DEAD PRESS! in September 2020, bassist Matthew Leone confirmed that the band were working on releasing another EP before the end of 2020.https://www.deadpress.co.uk/interview- madina-lake-21-09-2020/ Concept The band sets its music in a fictional town from the 1950s isolated from the rest of the world that's been turned upside-down with the mysterious disappearance of their most famous socialite, Adalia. The music provides an outlet for the band's views on politics, culture, and the media's obsession with celebrity status. The theme behind the band's music is in relation to the mystery of Adalia. The album artwork shows images of her and the mysteries behind her and the town of Madina Lake. It's a concept from the mind of Matthew Leone that is set to span three albums and includes a book as well as a website devoted to helping fans solve the case by uncovering \\"clues\\" hidden in the lyrics, album art, and videos.

It was to be situated near the town of Crandon and the Mole Lake Ojibwe Reservation in Forest County. The mine was the center of a multi-decade political and regulatory battle between environmentalists, American Indian tribes, sportfishing groups, and the State of Wisconsin and several large mining corporations. The purchase of the mine site in 2003 by the Sokaogon Ojibwe and Forest County Potawatomi marked a major victory for the tribes and environmental activists, and raised questions about the future of mining, economics, and tribal power in Wisconsin. Background The Crandon site was the location of one of several deposits of metallic sulfide ore found in northern Wisconsin during the 1970s, and its estimated 60 million tons of copper, zinc and other metallic sulfides was thought to hold the highest potential for profit. Three sites in all were proposed for digging. From the outset, environmental groups opposed the process of extracting metals from the sulfide ore, which if not properly handled may create sulfuric acid as a waste product. Each of the three sites was sufficiently close to an Ojibwe reservation to attract tribal opposition as well. As news of the proposed mine spread, many environmental groups such as the Sierra Club sprang into action.Lee Bergquist, \\"Mining Gets New Backing,\\" Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 23‚Äì29 January 1995. Other groups formed in opposition to the mine, such as Protectors of the Wolf River (POW'R), and eventually worked with Al Gedicks on coordinating environmentalist efforts.John J. Mutter, \\"To Slay a Giant: The Fight to Protect the Wolf River from the Proposed Crandon Copper Mine,\\" (Shawano, WI: Burstone-LLC, 2000) 1-158. Among their fears was the potential for acid mine drainage that results from sulfides mixing with air or water. Sulfide rock can produce high levels of poisonous heavy metals such as mercury, lead, zinc, arsenic, copper, and cadmium. This process is the single largest cause of negative environmental impact resulting from mining. This was of particular concern because the proposed mining area was in extremely close proximity to the Wolf River. Furthermore, environmentalists were not pleased about the discharge into that river, which would contain heavy metals. The estimate of the density of these heavy metals varied range depending on who made the estimation. Lastly, there was a concern about the amount of waste that the mine would create and how it would be contained from adversely affecting the natural world. Over its lifetime of production, the mine would generate about 44 million tons of waste. Half would be rocky \\"coarse tailings\\", which would be dumped to fill the mine shafts, while the other half would be powdery \\"fine tailings\\", which would be dumped into a waste pond equivalent to the size of 340 football fields with a plastic liner separating the tailings from the environment.Al Gedicks, What You Should Know About Exxon/Rio Algom's Proposed Mine at Crandon/Mole Lake. La Crosse, Wis.: Wisconsin Resources Protection Council, 1996. Proposals by Kennecott Minerals Company to mine a metal sulfide deposit near Ladysmith, Wisconsin were initially rejected by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. However, after Kennecott's buyout by Rio Tinto Zinc, and the governorship of the pro- business Tommy Thompson, the mine was allowed to open in face of the opposition, and operated from 1993 to 1997. The site has since been reclaimed. A similar proposal by the Canadian company Noranda to mine a deposit in Oneida County failed in part because of heavy opposition by the Lac du Flambeau Ojibwe. These smaller battles set the stage and prepared both sides in the larger fight over the Crandon proposal.  Potential opposition  Although the mine was known by the name of the nearby town of Crandon, the site lay adjacent to the Mole Lake reservation of the Sokaogon Ojibwe. The Ojibwe feared the consequences that runoff from the sulfide mine could have on the reservation's Rice Lake, a site of immense cultural and historical importance to the band. Five miles east, the Forest County Potawatomi had similar fears that the wind would carry air pollution from the mine to their reservation. Furthermore, its location on a tributary of the Wolf River meant that any liquid waste escaping the mine threatened one of the National Wild and Scenic RiversList of National Wild and Scenic Rivers in the state. In addition to non-Indian residents all along the bank, the Menominee and Mohican (Stockbridge-Munsee) reservations lay downstream and brought more concerns of indigenous people to the table.Zoltan Grossman Unlikely Alliances: Treaty conflicts and environmental cooperation between Native American and rural White communities . pp. 375-379.  History  The first proposal to mine the Crandon site was put forth by Exxon in the late 1970s. In the summer of 1975, they had conducted test drilling of 25 electro-magnetic areas, which confirmed that there was indeed a mineral deposit.Exxon Minerals Company, The Quest and The Questions. Crandon, Wis.: Public Affairs Office, Exxon Minerals Co., 1979. The Mole Lake community opposed it from the start, which put them at odds with many in nearby towns who hoped that mining jobs would provide steady employment for the depressed region. The Sierra Club, the Wisconsin Resources Protection Council, a non-profit environmental group dedicated to providing information about large scale metallic sulfide mining, and the Mining Impact Coalition, a grassroots organization dedicated to protecting and preserving natural and cultural communities, were among the many groups in opposition to the mine. The proposed mine would be near the headwaters of the Wolf River and environmentalists claimed that there was a high potential for damage to the water quality, as well as the living things that reside in the river. In addition to the negative environmental effects on the Wolf River, the Sokaogon Chippewa, as well as the Menominee, who resided directly downstream from the proposed mine, were facing the potential for their food sources to be contaminated. Already facing an increased threat of illness and health problems because of a cultural diet of fish, deer, and other wildlife already contaminated by industrial pollutants, they faced the risk of having their lands and everything living on them further tainted. As fishing groups became aware of this issue and feared the degradation of their quarry in world-class trout fishing waters, they too joined in opposition of the mine. With an alliance of opposition created, a strong force was rendered. Exxon, after working in the state since 1975 performing environmental assessments and working to be granted a mining permit, withdrew from the permit process in 1986 stating that it was due to \\"depressed metal prices\\". Strong local opposition may have also been a factor. By the time they returned in 1994, the alliance of sport fisherman, environmentalists, and Native Americans were waiting in opposition. In the late 1980s and 1990s, clashes over spearfishing and the experience of other mining conflicts resulted in a broad-based coalition prepared to use treaty rights to stop the mine at any cost. The Ojibwe joined with the Potawatomi, Menominee, and Mohican to lobby against the mine in the capital at Madison and in the courts. In doing so, they secured numerous protective designations for the Wolf, which made the standards for pollution harsher on a mine. In addition, the spearing conflict and an educational campaign undertaken by the four tribes to raise awareness of Native issues, had the effect of showing white residents the value of the treaty rights possessed by the Indians.Grossman 381; 2002 As a result, the tribes and Wolf River locals formed a much more unified opposition than had been seen in the other conflicts. Coming off a 1996 victory in the Bad River Train Blockade, this coalition's greatest success came when Governor Thompson was forced by political pressure to sign a mining moratorium into state law on Earth Day 1998. The bill had gone through the assembly 77 days earlier when Representatives voted 91-6 in favor of the bill. The moratorium mandated that mining companies prove similar mines had existed safely before the state would grant permits.Grossman 405; 2002  Conclusion  In a mid-1990s lawsuit finally decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2002, the right of Indian nations to have \\"Treatment as a State\\" status on applicable issues was interpreted to apply to setting and enforcing clean air and water standards. This meant the tribes could set their own, potentially far more restrictive limits than those of the state Department of Natural Resources, essentially meaning a potential Crandon mine would have to be completely free of pollution.Bergquist 1A; 2002 This was the end of the economic viability of the project, and on October 28, 2003, the Mole Lake Ojibwe and Forest County Potawatomi used $16.5 million worth of casino revenue to purchase the mine site and Nicolet Minerals Inc., its latest owner. Neither tribe has plans to develop the site in the foreseeable future.Rinard and Jones 1A; 2003 The death of the Crandon project disappointed many in the area who had hoped it would bring an economic boost to the depressed region, instead of what a former Crandon project manager referred to as the \\"end of mining in the state\\".Dale Alberts qtd. in Imrie; 2003 Mining publications consistently rank the anti-mining climate in Wisconsin as the most hostile to the industry.Midwest Treaty Network; 2003  See also  *Bad River Train Blockade *Sokaogon Chippewa Community *Forest County Potawatomi  References   Notes  *Bergquist, Lee. 2002. \\"Decision puts water quality in tribe's hands; Sokaogon can set standard near mine.\\" Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, 6/4/2002, 1A. *Gedicks, Al. 1993.

He was born in Valens, Ontario. Telford was a member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia as CCF representative. He campaigned for Vancouver mayor in late 1938, defeating incumbent mayor George Clark Miller by approximately 2000 votes in a city race that involved a total of seven mayoral candidates, which split the right-wing vote.

He is, on his mother's side, the great-grandson of Jakob Zeugheer-Herrmann, the first conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, who conducted for Paganini and Jenny Lind.Chris Walton. Mendelssohn on the Mersey: the lives and work of Jakob Zeugheer. The Musical Times, Vol. 151, No. 1912 (AUTUMN 2010), pp. 25-40. Another maternal ancestor is Sir Jonah Barrington, the Irish High Court Judge, who was also a writer and author of several classic volumes of Irish history and local chatter and colour. On his father's side he is descended from Dr. Richard Whittington-Egan, his great-grandfather, who was Crown pathologist for Ireland. Educated by a private tutor and at Stonyhurst College, the noted Jesuit public school near Clitheroe, Lancashire. Whittington-Egan originally read medicine in the family's traditional medico- legal tradition and was also to qualify for the Bar. During the Second World War, he served in the army, in France, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and Italy, where he broadcast to the Allied Forces. Illness while in Italy forced him to curtail his medical studies and concentrate on writing. As a freelance journalist, he contributed to many newspapers and periodicals, including The Times, The Daily Telegraph, The Guardian, Contemporary Review, Books and Bookmen, Chambers's Journal, the Daily Mail, the Daily Express, the Liverpool Daily Post, and the Liverpool Echo as well as the New York Times. He spent 30 years on Fleet Street with Associated Newspapers. He also served as a director of Contemporary Review, and in 2004 and 2011, two selections of his critical writings were published in book form. Later Biography Whittington-Egan's literary career began in 1955 when he published Liverpool Colonnade, a study of his native city. This book was soon followed by Liverpool Roundabout, another colourful book of essays on Liverpudlian history, with particular emphasis on ghosts, criminals and various historical oddities. In 1969, he published Liverpool Soundings and in 1972 the well illustrated Liverpool: This is my City. In the 1980s, his early Liverpool books were reissued in the popular Liverpool Dossier series. In 2002, he published Liverpool Echoes and Liverpool Shadows, two more books of essays on Liverpool history. Yet another volume, Liverpool Landfall, was published in 2016. Whittington-Egan has also taken an interest in Victorian history, and written several critically praised biographies of literary figures of this time. In 1960, he wrote, with Geoffrey Smerdon, the standard biography of the Liverpool-born 'nineties poet and man of letters Richard Le Gallienne: The Quest of the Golden Boy. In later years, he has chronicled the lives of the poet and dramatist Stephen Phillips, the self-destructive poet Lionel Johnson, the curious poet and musician Theophile Marzials, and the prolific naturalist the Rev. J.G. Wood. Having a keen interest in the spectral world, he edited five volumes of the Weekend Books of Ghosts and Horror between 1975 and 1985, contributing many stories himself. In 2010, he published a biography of the mysterious Teresa Higginson, a religious fanatic who believed herself to be tormented by the Devil, and who is thought by some to have a claim to sainthood. In 2016 he published The Master Ghost Hunter, a full-length biography of the once-famous ghost hunter Elliott O'Donnell. It is as a true crime writer that Whittington-Egan particularly excelled. His earliest book in this genre was The Ordeal of Philip Yale Drew, about the 1929 unsolved murder of the Reading tobacconist Alfred Oliver, and the question of the guilt of the main suspect, the American actor Philip Yale Drew. Three years later, he published The Riddle of Birdhurst Rise, a full- length study of the Croydon poison mystery of 1928. Both these books are recognized as classics in the field of true crime history, and after being reissued as Penguin paperbacks, they enjoyed considerable sales. In 1975, Whittington-Egan published a Casebook on Jack the Ripper, which has been much sought after by collectors of Ripperine literature. In 1991, he published the standard biography of the great Scottish criminologist William Roughead, with extensive and valuable comments on the celebrated cases covered by Roughead during his lifetime. His next crime book was a full-length study of the Oscar Slater case, and in 2002, he published the standard account of the fascinating Cheltenham torso mystery. In 2013, he published a much extended Definitive Casebook on Jack the Ripper, containing a full historiography of this celebrated case. In 2015, he published Mr. Atherstone leaves the Stage, an account of the unsolved Battersea murder of the actor Thomas Weldon Atherstone in 1910, and the following year Tales from the Dead-House, a collection of essays concerning macabre crimes. For some years, Whittington-Egan lived in Great Malvern, Worcestershire, with his wife, Molly Whittington-Egan, also a writer. Whittington-Egan was a member of the Medico-Legal Society, the Crime Writers' Association, and the Society for Psychical Research.

He was arrested in London six days later and held on house arrest for a year and a half before being released by the British government in March 2000. Authorised to return to Chile, Pinochet was subsequently indicted by judge Juan Guzm√°n Tapia and charged with several crimes. He died on 10 December 2006 without having been convicted. His arrest in London made the front pages of newspapers worldwide; not only did it involve the head of the military dictatorship that ruled Chile between 1973 and 1990, it marked the first time judges had applied the principle of universal jurisdiction, declaring themselves competent to judge crimes committed in a country by former heads of state, despite the existence of local amnesty laws. Pinochet led a 11 September 1973 coup which deposed Socialist President Salvador Allende. His 17-year regime was responsible for numerous human rights violations, some of which were committed as part of Operation Condor, an illegal effort to suppress political opponents in Chile and abroad in coordination with foreign intelligence agencies. Pinochet was also accused of using his position to pursue personal enrichment through embezzlement of government funds, the illegal drug trade and illegal arms trade. The Rettig Report found that at least 2,279 people were conclusively murdered by the Chilean government for political reasons during Pinochet's regime, and the Valech Report found that at least 30,000 people were tortured by the government for political reasons. Pinochet's attorneys, headed by Pablo Rodr√≠guez Grez (former leader of the far-right group Fatherland and Liberty), argued that he was entitled to immunity from prosecution first as a former head of state, then under the 1978 amnesty law passed by the military junta. They also claimed that his alleged poor health made him unfit to stand trial. A succession of judgments by various Courts of Appeal, the Supreme Court, medical experts, etc., led to Pinochet's subsequent house arrest and release, before he died on 10 December 2006, just after having been again put under house arrest on 28 November 2006 in the Caravan of Death case.Procesan a Pinochet y ordenan su arresto por los secuestros y homicidios de la \\"Caravana de la Muerte\\" , 20minutos, 28 November 2006.

El secreto mundo de los armamentos.\\" , Punto Final, 18 December 1998 While in London, he was arrested on 17 October 1998 under an international arrest warrant issued by judge Baltasar Garz√≥n of Spain, and placed under house arrest: initially in the clinic where he had just undergone back surgery, and later in a rented house. The charges included 94 counts of torture of Spanish citizens, the 1975 assassination of Spanish diplomat Carmelo Soria, and one count of conspiracy to commit torture ‚Äî allegations of abuses had been made numerous times before his arrest, including since the beginning of his rule, but had never been acted upon. Grappling with the conditions set by Chile's turbulent transition to democracy, the coalition government known as Concertaci√≥n and headed by President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle opposed his arrest, extradition to Spain, and trial. A hard-fought 16-month-long legal battle ensued in the House of Lords, then the highest court of the United Kingdom.The judgements of the House of Lords and the other British Courts which considered Pinochet's case can be found on the British and Irish Legal Information Institute website. Pinochet claimed immunity from prosecution as a former head of state under the State Immunity Act 1978. This was rejected by a majority of the Law Lords (3-2), who ruled that some international crimes, such as torture, did not grant a former head-of-state immunity.Naomi Roht-Arriaza (Professor of Law, University of California, Hastings College of Law), The Pinochet Precedent and Universal Jurisdiction in New England Law Review Vol. 35:2 (9 pages) However, the judgement was set aside in a subsequent, unprecedented case on the basis that one of the judges involved was potentially biased due to his ties to Amnesty International, a human rights organization that had campaigned against Pinochet for decades and acted as an intervenor in the case. A third ruling in March 1999 confirmed the original verdict; this time, the Lords held that Pinochet could only be prosecuted for crimes committed after 1988, the year in which the United Kingdom implemented legislation ratifying the United Nations Convention Against Torture in the Criminal Justice Act 1988.\\"Straw considers Pinochet case\\" , BBC, 25 March 1999 This invalidated most, but not all, of the charges against Pinochet and gave the green light for his extradition to Spain to proceed. In April 1999, former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and former US President George H. W. Bush called upon the British government to release Pinochet.\\"Thatcher pleads Pinochet's case\\" , BBC, 6 October 1999 Former U.S. President Bush urges Pinochet release , CNN, 12 April 1999 They argued that Pinochet should be allowed to return to his homeland rather than be extradited to Spain. On the other hand, United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights, Mary Robinson, hailed the Lords' ruling, declaring that it was a clear endorsement that torture is an international crime subject to universal jurisdiction. Furthermore, Amnesty International and the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture demanded his extradition to Spain.\\"Pinochet must go to Spain, says Amnesty\\" , BBC, 21 January 1999 In protest against Spain's action, Chile withdrew its ambassador from Madrid for a time.Talks set to ease Pinochet rift , BBC, 20 June 2000 Thatcher sent Pinochet a bottle of single malt whisky during this time, with a note saying \\"Scotch is one British institution that will never let you down\\". Meanwhile, questions began to emerge in the media about Pinochet's allegedly fragile health. After medical tests were conducted, Home Secretary Jack Straw ruled in January 2000 that the former dictator should not be extradited to Spain. This triggered protests from human rights NGOs, and led the Belgian government, along with six human rights groups (including Amnesty International), to file a complaint against Straw's decision before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in January 2000.Belgium begins Pinochet challenge , BBC, 25 January 2000 Belgium, as well as France and Switzerland, had deposed extradition requests in the wake of Spain's demand. Despite protests by legal and medical experts from several countries, Straw finally ruled, in March 2000, that Pinochet had to be set free and authorized his return to Chile.Pinochet set free , BBC, 2 March 2000 On 3 March 2000, Pinochet returned to Chile. His first act upon landing in Santiago de Chile's airport was to triumphantly stand up from his wheelchair to the acclaim of his supporters.Alex Bellos and Jonathan Franklin, Pinochet receives a hero's welcome on his return, The Guardian, 4 March 2000 The first person to greet him was his successor as head of the Chilean Armed Forces, General Ricardo Izurieta.Pinochet arrives in Chile , BBC, 3 March 2000 President Ricardo Lagos, who had just been sworn into office on 11 March, said the retired general's televised arrival had damaged Chile's international reputation, while thousands held demonstratations against the ex- dictator.Thousands march against Pinochet , BBC, 4 March 2000 Despite his release on grounds of ill health, the unprecedented detention of Pinochet in a foreign country for crimes against humanity committed in his own country, without a warrant or request for extradition from his own country, marked a watershed in international law. Some scholars consider it one of the most important events in legal history since the Nuremberg Trials of Nazi war criminals. Judge Garz√≥n's case was largely founded on the principle of universal jurisdiction ‚Äî that certain crimes are so egregious that they constitute crimes against humanity and can therefore be prosecuted in any court in the world. The British House of Lords ruled that Pinochet had no right to immunity from prosecution as a former head of state, and could be put on trial.The Ripple Effect of the Pinochet Case , Global policy.org, 2004 In Spain, the Court of Appeal of the Audiencia Nacional affirmed Spanish jurisdiction over Argentine and Chilean cases, declaring that domestic amnesty laws (in the case of Chile, the 1978 amnesty law passed by Pinochet's regime) could not bind the Spanish courts. Both for matters concerning the \\"Dirty War\\" in Argentina and for Chile, they characterized the crimes as genocides. However, both the Spanish and British rulings relied not on international law, but on domestic legislation: \\"They talked about universal jurisdiction, but grounded their decision in domestic statutory law.\\" =Return to Chile= In March 2000, after Pinochet's return, the Chilean Congress approved a constitutional amendment creating the status of \\"ex-president\\", which granted Pinochet immunity from prosecution and guaranteed him a financial allowance. In exchange, it required him to resign his seat of senator-for-life. 111 legislators voted for, and 29 against.Chile offers Pinochet new immunity , BBC, 25 March 2000 Despite this political move, on 23 May 2000, the Court of Appeal of Santiago lifted Pinochet's parliamentary immunity concerning the Caravan of Death case. This was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Chile, which voted on 8 August 2000, by 14 votes against 6, to strip Pinochet of his parliamentary immunity. On 1 December 2000, judge Juan Guzm√°n Tapia indicted Pinochet for the kidnapping of 75 opponents in the Caravan of Death case ‚Äî Guzm√°n advanced the charge of kidnapping on the grounds that the victims were officially \\"disappeared\\": even though they were most likely dead, the absence of their corpses made any charge of homicide difficult.Pinochet charged with kidnapping , BBC, 1 December 2000 Shortly after, on 11 December 2000, the ruling was suspended by the Court of Appeal of Santiago on medical grounds. In addition to the Caravan of Death, 177 other complaints were filed against Pinochet. In January 2001, medical experts stated that Pinochet was suffering from \\"mild dementia\\", which did not impede him from being prosecuted before the courts.Pinochet 'fit enough' for trial , BBC, 16 January 2001 Subsequently, judge Guzm√°n ordered his arrest in late January 2001.\\"Pinochet arrest ordered\\" , BBC, 30 January 2001 However, the judiciary procedures were again suspended on 9 July 2001 because of alleged health reasons. In July 2002, the Supreme Court dismissed Pinochet's indictment in the various cases on medical grounds (an alleged \\"vascular dementia\\"). That same year, the prosecuting attorney Hugo Guttierez, who headed the Caravan of Death case, declared that \\"Our country has the degree of justice that the political transition permits us to have.\\"\\"The Appeals Court Ruling Is Negotiated Out for Pinochet\\" , Interview with Attorney Hugo Gutierrez, by Memoria y Justicia, 21 February 2002 Shortly after the verdict, Pinochet resigned from the Senate, thus benefiting from the 2000 Constitutional amendment granting him immunity from prosecution. Thereafter, he lived a quiet life, rarely made public appearances and was notably absent from events marking the 30th anniversary of the coup on 11 September 2003. =House arrest= On 28 May 2004, a Court of Appeals voted 14 to 9 to revoke Pinochet's dementia status and, consequently, his immunity from prosecution. In arguing its case, the prosecution presented a recent television interview Pinochet had given for a Miami-based television network. The judges found that the interview raised doubts about the alleged mental incapacity of Pinochet. On 26 August, in a 9 to 8 vote, the Supreme Court upheld the decision. On 2 December, a Santiago Appeals Court stripped Pinochet of immunity from prosecution over the 1974 assassination of General Carlos Prats, his predecessor as Army Commander-in-Chief, who was killed by a car bomb while in exile in Argentina. On 13 December, Judge Juan Guzm√°n Tapia placed Pinochet under house arrest and indicted him over the disappearance of nine opposition activists and the murder of one of them during his regime. However, the Supreme Court reversed the Appeals Court ruling in the Carlos Prats case on 24 March 2005, thereby upholding Pinochet's immunity. Later that year, on 14 September, the Supreme Court decided to strip Pinochet of his immunity in the Operation Colombo case involving the killing of 119 dissidents.Court strips Pinochet of immunity , BBC, 14 September 2005 The following day, he was then acquitted of the human rights case due to his purported ill health. In late November, he was once again deemed fit to stand trial by the Chilean Supreme Court and indicted, this time for the disappearance of six dissidents who had been detained by Chile's security forces in late 1974. He was placed under house arrest on the eve of his 90th birthday. In July 2006, the Supreme Court upheld a January judgment by the Court of Appeal of Santiago, which argued that the 2002 Supreme Court's ruling stating that Pinochet could not be prosecuted in the Caravan of Death case did not apply to two of its victims, who were former bodyguards of Salvador Allende.Chile high court allows Pinochet 'Caravan of Death' case to proceed , 17 July 2006 Chile court upholds Pinochet bail in one case, removes immunity in another , 11 January 2006 On 9 September, Pinochet was stripped of his immunity by the Supreme Court.Court 'lifts Pinochet immunity', BBC, 8 September 2006. Judge Alejandro Madrid was thus able to indict him for the kidnappings and tortures at Villa Grimaldi.

On 28 November 2006, judge V√≠ctor Montiglio, charged with overseeing the Caravan of Death case, ordered Pinochet's house arrest. However, Pinochet died a few days later on 10 December, without having been convicted of any crimes committed during his administration. Tax fraud and foreign bank accounts The U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a report on 15 July 2004 concerning Riggs Bank, which had solicited Pinochet and controlled between US$4 million and US$8 million of his assets. According to the report, Riggs participated in money laundering for Pinochet, setting up offshore shell corporations (referring to Pinochet as only \\"a former public official\\"), and hiding his accounts from regulatory agencies. The report said the violations were \\"symptomatic of uneven and, at times, ineffective enforcement by all federal bank regulators, of bank compliance with their anti-money-laundering obligations\\". In 2006, Pinochet's total wealth was estimated to be at least $28 million.Larry Rohter, Colonel's Death Gives Clues to Pinochet Arms Deals , The New York Times, 19 June 2006 Five days later, a Chilean court formally opened an investigation into Pinochet's finances for the first time, on allegations of fraud, misappropriation of funds and bribery. A few hours later, the state prosecutor, Chile's State Defense Council (Consejo de Defensa del Estado), presented a second request for the same judge to investigate Pinochet's assets, but without directly accusing him of crimes. On 1 October 2004, Chile's Internal Revenue Service (\\"Servicio de Impuestos Internos\\") filed a lawsuit against Pinochet, accusing him of fraud and tax evasion, for the amount of US$3.6 million in investment accounts held at Riggs between 1996 and 2002. Furthermore, a lawsuit against the Riggs Bank and Joe L. Allbritton, chief executive of the bank until 2001, was closed after the bank agreed in February 2005 to pay $9 million to Pinochet's victims in compensation for its money-laundering activities on behalf of Pinochet.Terence O'Hara, Allbrittons, Riggs to Pay Victims Of Pinochet , The Washington Post, 25 February 2005 Pinochet could have faced fines in Chile totaling 300% of the amount owed, and prison time, if he had been convicted before his death. Aside from the legal ramifications, this evidence of financial impropriety severely embarrassed Pinochet. According to the State Defense Council, his hidden assets could never have been acquired solely on the basis of his salary as President, Chief of the Armed Forces, and Life Senator. = BAE Systems = In September 2005, a joint-investigation by The Guardian and La Tercera revealed that the British arms firm BAE Systems had been identified as having paid more than ¬£1m to Pinochet through a front company in the British Virgin Islands, which BAE has used to channel commissions on arms deals.David Leigh and Rob Evans, Revealed: BAE's secret ¬£1m to Pinochet, The Guardian, 15 September 2005 The payments began in 1997 and lasted until 2004.David Leigh, Jonathan Franklin and Rob Evans, Detective story that linked ¬£1m Pinochet cash to BAE, The Guardian, 15 September 2005 BAE had tried to conclude a deal in the 1990s to sell Chile a rocket system and as of 2005 was trying to sell it naval electronics. The Chilean Army reportedly spent $60 million on the Rayo rocket system on a joint-venture with BAE Systems starting in 1994, before abandoning the project in 2003. Since 2001, British legislation outlaws corruption of foreign public officials (part 12 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001). = Charges against Pinochet and family members = In November 2005, Pinochet was deemed fit to stand trial by the Chilean Supreme Court and was indicted and put under house arrest on tax fraud and passport forgery charges but was released on bail; however, he remained under house arrest due to unrelated human rights charges. This tax fraud filing, related to Pinochet's and his family's secret bank accounts in the United States and in Caribbean islands, for an amount of US$27 million, shocked the pro-Pinochet wing of Chilean public opinion more than the accusations of human rights abuses. Ninety percent of these funds would have been raised between 1990 and 1998, when Pinochet was Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and would essentially have come from weapons traffic (when purchasing Belgian Mirage fighter aircraft in 1994, Dutch L√©opard tanks, Swiss Mowag tanks or by illegal sales of weapons to Croatia, in the middle of the Balkan war; the later case has been linked by Chilean justice with the assassination of Colonel Gerardo Huber in 1992). General Pinochet was reported to have owed the Chilean tax administration a total of $16.5 million. In that case, Pinochet's immunity was stripped by the Appeal Court of Santiago, and confirmed by the Supreme Court on 19 October 2005. The legal proceedings could have eventually led to a trial against Pinochet, his wife Lucia Hiriart and one of his sons, Marco Antonio Pinochet, who was sued for complicity. Judge Juan Guzm√°n Tapia was skeptical, however, of the probability of a trial, either for human rights violations or for financial fraud. Nonetheless, indications from a number of medical examinations suggested that the physical and mental condition of the former dictator would have allowed him to be prosecuted. On 23 November 2005, judge Carlos Cerda charged Pinochet for fraud and ordered his arrest. Pinochet was freed under caution on the grounds that \\"his freedom did not represent a danger for the security of the society\\". This was the fourth time in seven years that Pinochet was indicted and charged for illegal behavior. On 23 February 2006, Pinochet's wife Lucia Hiriart, children Augusto, Luc√≠a, Jacqueline, Marco Antonio, and Maria Ver√≥nica, daughter-in-law, and personal secretary were indicted on charges of tax fraud, including failing to declare bank accounts overseas, and using false passports. Luc√≠a fled to the US, but was detained and returned to Argentina, her country of departure, after attempting unsuccessfully to claim political asylum.\\"U.S. sends back Pinochet daughter\\" , CNN, 18 January 2006 Pinochet's wife, five children, and 17 other persons (including two generals, one of his ex-lawyer and his ex-secretary) were arrested in October 2007 on charges of embezzlement and use of false passports in the context of the Riggs affair. They are accused of having illegally transferred $27m (¬£13.2m) to foreign bank accounts during Pinochet's rule.Pinochet family arrested in Chile , BBC, 4 October 2007 \\"Cobertura Especial: Detienen a familia y principales colaboradores de Pinochet\\" , La Tercera, 4 October 2007 Allegations during Pinochet's last days In 2006, General Manuel Contreras, head of the Chilean secret police DINA under Pinochet, alleged in testimony sent to Judge Claudio Pavez (overseeing the Huber case) that Pinochet and his son Marco Antonio Pinochet had been involved in the clandestine production of chemical and biological weapons, and in the production (under Eugenio Berr√≠os's direction), sale and trafficking of cocaine.Jonathan Franklin, Pinochet 'sold cocaine to Europe and US', The Guardian, 11 July 2006 These allegations were never fully investigated by the Chilean courts, nor by a government commission set up to establish their veracity. Fifteen years of investigations also revealed that Pinochet was at the center of an illegal arms trade organized around FAMAE (Factories and Arsenals of the Army of Chile), which received money from various offshore and front companies, including the Banco Coutts International in Miami.Andrea Chaparro Sol√≠s, Generales (R) y civiles de Famae procesados en caso armas a Croacia , La Naci√≥n, 13 June 2006 One of the deals notably included the transfer of 370 tons of weapons to Croatia, which was under UN embargo because of the war against Serbia. Another involved a 1995 arms contract with Ecuador which gave rise to kickbacks, some of which ended up in Pinochet's bank accounts abroad.Andrea Chaparro Sol√≠s, Consejo de Defensa del Estado se hace querellante en caso armas a Ecuador , La Naci√≥n, 5 June 2006 See also * Operation Condor * Chile under Pinochet * Chilean transition to democracy * Chilean political scandals * Leonard Hoffmann, Baron Hoffmann * Pinocheques * Pinochet in Suburbia, 2006 docudrama References External links * The Pinochet Case in London, 1998‚Äì2000 at Augusto Pinochet (1915‚Äì2006) ‚Äì A Biography * TRIAL: Pinochet's trials * Timeline of Pinochet Prosecution (Amnesty International) * Pinochet Real ‚Äì For Supporters of General Pinochet * \\"The crimes of Augusto Pinochet\\" (several case studies) * BBC coverage (special report) * Article: \\"Doubts Remain over Pinochet's Fate: Chile's 'antiquated penal code' could be his undoing\\" * Reconcile Chile * Valech report on political imprisonment and torture, November 2004 * BBC News report: \\"Banks accused over Pinochet cash\\" * Amnesty International * George Washington University article Category:1998 in Chile Category:1998 in London Category:1998 in law fr:Augusto Pinochet#Arrestation √† Londres ","title":"Indictment and arrest of Augusto Pinochet"},{"id":"6674270","text":"Dil Ki Baat is a music album released by Pakistani pop singer, Junaid Jamshed.

Thomas was president and CEO of Nissan Motors USA from 1993 to 1997. In 2000, he became chief executive officer for the North American operations of Edmunds.com, an automotive news provider. Early life Thomas was born in Denver, Colorado, in 1945, and grew up in Hyannis, Nebraska, where he worked summers on a ranch. While in high school in North Platte, Nebraska, Thomas was selected to the All-State football team and was also a Scholastic All-American in his senior year. He was appointed to the United States Air Force Academy, where he received a bachelor of science degree in engineering management in 1967. He was also a member of the academy's track and field team, participating in the sprint medley, shot put and discus. In his senior year, he was commander of the 22nd Squadron and a member of the academy's ethics committee. Military and professional career Upon graduation he served in the United States Air Force until 1972, achieving the rank of captain. His service included a tour of duty at the Space and Missile Systems Center in the Los Angeles area, where he was the financial manager for a program office handling a restricted-data defense system. Following his honorable discharge, he worked briefly for the Allstate Insurance Company before moving to the Ford Motor Company, where he spent ten years with Ford's Lincoln-Mercury division prior to joining Nissan. Soon after arriving at Nissan Thomas was running its sales operations, and in a 1988 reorganization that divided the company into three entities (Nissan, Infiniti and parts and service) Thomas was made a vice president and head of the Nissan division. In 1993 he succeeded Thomas Mignanelli as corporate president and CEO when Mignanelli retired after heart surgery. However, after 21-month slide in sales, Nissan announced on October 7, 1997, that Thomas was resigning for personal reasons. He was replaced by Minoru Nakamura, then-current chairman of Nissan Motors USA and president of Nissan North America (the parent company of Nissan Motors USA). In July 2000, Roberts was named chief executive officer for North American operations of Edmunds.com, responsible for North American sales and marketing, partner relationship management and business development. In November of that same year, he was promoted to corporate chief operating officer, with Peter Steinlauf (the controlling shareholder) assuming the titles of chairman and CEO. He served in that position until his retirement in August 2004. Honors and awards In February 1997, Thomas was appointed as an advisory board member to the \\"One America in the 21st Century: The President's Initiative on Race\\" commission as the sole business representative on the seven-person body. He also served on the Board of Directors for the Smithsonian Institution's New Business Ventures in 1998 and 1999.

Professional career Robinson, a , relief pitcher, was originally selected by the Detroit Tigers in the fourteenth round of the 1982 amateur draft. He did not sign with the team and was sent back into the draft pool. A year later, in the 1983 amateur draft, he was selected by the San Francisco Giants in the second round. He was originally a starting pitcher, making his major league debut on April 7, against the St. Louis Cardinals at Candlestick Park. He pitched six scoreless innings, allowing four hits, and struck out four batters and walked three in an 11‚Äì0 victory. He started 33 games for the Giants during the 1984 season, going 7‚Äì15 with an earned run average of 4.56 in 34 appearances. Robinson only played in eight games the following season. His ERA shot up to 5.11 in 12‚Öì innings. In 1986, he played full-time as a reliever, starting only one game for the Giants. He went 6‚Äì3 with an ERA of 3.36 and 90 strikeouts. But he also led the team in wild pitches with eleven. He saw the same amount of time in with the Giants, but on August 21 he was traded with Scott Medvin to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Rick Reuschel. Robinson finished the season with a 2‚Äì1 record and a 3.04 ERA in eighteen relief appearances for the Pirates. In the seventh inning of the September 7 game against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, he struck out Leon Durham, Andre Dawson and Rafael Palmeiro, the number three, four and five hitters, each on three pitches to become the thirteenth National League pitcher to strike out three batters on nine pitches, the twenty-first such occurrence in major league history. Two days later, Robinson won a game with his bat when he hit an unlikely home run, his first in the majors, off of ace closer Lee Smith to break a tie with two outs in the ninth inning. Over the course of the whole 1987 season, he went 8‚Äì9 with an ERA of 2.85 ‚Äì the lowest average of his career ‚Äì in 81 relief appearances. He had one of his best seasons in 1988 as he went 11‚Äì5 with an ERA of 3.03, appearing in a team-high 75 games. In 1989, he started nineteen games and went 7‚Äì13 in 50 total appearances with an ERA of 4.58, which wasn't good enough to keep him in Pittsburgh. Following the season, he was traded with Willie Smith to the New York Yankees for catcher Don Slaught. He started seeing less time in New York, pitching in about half the innings he did in his final season in Pittsburgh. He went 3‚Äì6 in 54 appearances with a 3.45 ERA. After the season, he was on the move once more. He was granted free agency by the Yankees and signed with the California Angels. With the Angels, he had perhaps his worst season; he failed to win a game and had his highest career ERA, at 5.37. The Angels released him following the season, and he signed a one-year contract with the Cubs. In his final season in 1992, he went 4‚Äì3 with a 3.00 ERA. After his contract expired, he was granted free agency by the Cubs. A couple months later, he signed with the Cubs once more, but he never played another major league game, and his career eventually came to a close.

The Court found that actions do not necessarily breach the peace just because they cause violent reactions. Due to this finding, courts would have less say in determining what is criminal as a breach of the peace, and the Parliament of Canada would have more. Background At the time, peeping was not specifically prohibited. Allegedly, the appellant Frey had left his truck to look into a window of a house at 11:15 P.M. A woman saw him looking in, and shouted, and her adult son took a butcher knife and went outside. He chased Frey, caught him, and called the police. The police, seeing footprints near the house, arrested Frey. Frey also alleged the police constable attacked him, although in court Frey mainly fought his arrest as false imprisonment.Page 522. The British Columbia Court of Appeal found the imprisonment was not false imprisonment, since Frey had, in the words of Justice O'Halloran, \\"disturbed their tranquillity and privacy in a manner that he would naturally expect to invite immediate violence against him.\\" A breach of the peace was thus defined by this judge as being a reference to riots, or something that interferes with the peace of private persons; the latter was said to go \\"so deeply into the roots of the Common law.\\"Quoted on page 534. Decision Justice John Robert Cartwright, for the majority of the Supreme Court, found that the burden of proof that the imprisonment was lawful rested on the woman's son Fedoruk and Constable Stone. Both Fedoruk and Stone had said the arrest was a response to an action, namely peeping, that could have led to a breach of the peace.Page 523. Cartwright replied that while it is true that seeing a man peeping into one's home can be horrifying, that would not necessarily make a violent reaction a defence. Without evidence that the \\"peeping tom\\" is attacking, a violent response would simply be revenge. Cartwright also noted the peeping was \\"not otherwise criminal and not falling within any category of offences defined by the Criminal Law,\\" and that recognizing it as criminal now could lead to many other legal actions, such as adultery or giving insults, being considered criminal. In general, this would make the law less clear.Page 526. As Cartwright said, \\"I think that if any course of conduct is now to be declared criminal, which has not up to the present time been so regarded, such declaration should be made by Parliament and not by the Courts.\\"Page 530. Moreover, while a lexicon did define a breach of the peace as including actions that can cause others to violate the peace, Cartwright concluded that it would stretch the meaning of these words too broadly to cover actions that would probably result in violent revenge.Page 528. Cartwright also found Stone's arrest, done without an arrest warrant, could not be justified under the Criminal Code. The Criminal Code could not protect an officer's wrong opinion that something that is not an offence is an offence. Concurrence Justice Patrick Kerwin wrote an opinion concurring with the dissent on the Court of Appeal. Kerwin defined a breach of the peace as violence or something that provokes commotion. However, something does not breach the peace simply because it is irritating.

The U.S. government considers him a \\"domestic terrorist,\\" having been arrested and charged in federal court on multiple counts of arson and conspiracy, relating to the arson of Superior Lumber company in Glendale, Oregon on January 2, 2001, and Jefferson Poplar Farms in Clatskanie, Oregon on May 21, 2001. His arrest is part of what the FBI dubbed Operation Backfire. McGowan was facing a minimum of life in prison if convicted when he accepted a non-cooperation plea agreement, pleading guilty on November 9, 2006. A \\"terrorism\\" label was applied to his sentence, and McGowan was ultimately sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment. He was released on probation in June 2013\\\\. Biography McGowan was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Queens, New York City, and graduated from Christ the King Regional High School in Middle Village. He has worked on many activist issues including military counter-recruitment, demonstrations against the Republican National Convention, the Really Really Free Market, and the support of prisoners such as Jeff Luers and others. McGowan was a graduate student earning a master's degree in acupuncture, and was an employee of WomensLaw.org, a nonprofit group that helps women in domestic abuse situations navigate the legal system. Arrest and Operation Backfire On December 7, 2005, one of the largest arrests of environmental activists in American history began. Using the code name Operation Backfire, the FBI arrested six people. Chelsea Gerlach, William Rodgers, Kendall Tankersley, Kevin Tubbs, McGowan, and Stanislas Meyerhoff were arrested for allegedly taking part in a wide variety of crimes, including arson and domestic terrorism. Meyerhoff agreed to be a federal cooperating witness almost immediately. On December 22, Rodgers was found dead in his cell in Flagstaff, Arizona, from an apparent suicide. On January 20, federal prosecutors, the head of the FBI, and US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales held a press conference announcing a 65 count indictment against 11 individuals relating to 17 different incidents in Oregon, Washington, and California. In addition to the six arrested on December 7, the Oregon indictment also named Jonathan Paul, Suzanne Savoie, Joseph Dibee, Rebecca Rubin, and Josephine Overaker. The Oregon indictment charged certain defendants with arson, attempted arson, and using and carrying a destructive device. The destructive device charge carried a 30 year mandatory sentence and a life sentence for a second conviction. On June 28, the government arraigned Nathan Block, Joyanna Zacher, McGowan and Jonathan Paul on a 65 count superseding indictment. All four pleaded not guilty. Criticism of prosecution The Christian Science Monitor reports that the \\"Operation Backfire\\" indictments have elicited concern, from activists, that authorities have \\"cracked the super-secrecy of ALF and ELF\\". Alternative media organizations have condemned the arrests, some calling them a \\"witch-hunt\\", \\"aimed at disrupting and discrediting political movements\\". Activists, alluding to the Red Scare, claim the operations are \\"fishing expedition[s]\\" carried out \\"in the midst of 9/11 McCarthyism\\". The government disputes these claims: FBI director Robert Mueller stated the agency takes action \\"only when volatile talk crosses the line into violence and criminal activity\\". Plea agreement On November 9, 2006, McGowan and co-defendants Jonathan Paul, Joyanna Zacher and Nathan Block pleaded guilty and signed a plea agreement. The agreement does not require the defendants' cooperation (i.e., informing on others). Zacher and Block each pleaded to one count of conspiracy, attempted arson, and two separate incidents of arson. McGowan pleaded to conspiracy and to two separate incidents of arson. The government recommended that they be sentenced to 8 years in prison. Paul pleaded to one count of arson and one count of conspiracy. The government recommended Paul be sentenced to 5 years in prison. All four defendants were free to argue for a lesser sentence. Prosecutors asked the court to apply a \\"terrorism enhancement\\" at sentencing. The defendants could have faced up to 20 years in prison in addition to the terms of the plea agreement. The government was seeking the enhancement because, despite the fact that the crimes involved only the destruction of private property, it was possible their actions could have led to people's injuries or deaths. No government property was damaged in any of the incidents. Sentencing and prison On June 4, 2007, McGowan was sentenced to seven years in federal prison and ordered to pay $1.9 million in restitution. U.S. District Court Judge Ann Aiken presided over the sentencing, which took place at Oregon Federal Court in Eugene, Oregon. Judge Aiken applied a \\"terrorism enhancement\\" to the sentence. McGowan was incarcerated in the highly restrictive Communication Management Unit (CMU) at the United States Penitentiary, Marion, Illinois, from August 2008 to October 2010. On October 19, 2010, McGowan's request for a transfer from the CMU to general population was granted. However ‚Äì for reasons never explained to McGowan, his family, supporters, or lawyers ‚Äì four months later he was transferred to another Communications Management Unit, this time in Terre Haute, Indiana. Close to a year prior to the latest transfer, in March 2010, the Center for Constitutional Rights filed a lawsuit on behalf of multiple prisoners, including McGowan and his wife. In the time following the filing of this case, several news pieces that expose the CMUs have been published. On December 11, 2012, McGowan was released to a halfway house in New York City. He was taken into custody again on April 4, 2013, several days after writing an article for the Huffington Post criticizing CMUs. The stated reason for McGowan's detention was that the Huffington Post article violated a regulation against inmates ‚Äúpublishing under a byline‚Äù; the Center for Constitutional Rights pointed out that this regulation had been declared unconstitutional, and McGowan was released back to a halfway house on April 5. On June 5, 2013, McGowan was released on probation. Documentary In 2011, Sam Cullman and Marshall Curry's documentary If a Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front was released in theaters and on DVD by Oscilloscope Laboratories. The documentary follows McGowan's history with the ELF while examining the group at large. The film was shown on the PBS documentary series POV and on-line in September‚ÄìOctober 2011.

It is credited to the English mathematician Percy John Daniell and the Russian mathematician Andrey Nikolaevich Kolmogorov.. Statement of the theorem Let T denote some interval (thought of as \\"time\\"), and let n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}. For each k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} and finite sequence of distinct times t_{1}, \\\\dots, t_{k} \\\\in T, let u_{t_{1} \\\\dots t_{k}} be a probability measure on (\\\\mathbb{R}^{n})^{k}. Suppose that these measures satisfy two consistency conditions: 1\\\\. for all permutations \\\\pi of \\\\\\\\{ 1, \\\\dots, k \\\\\\\\} and measurable sets F_{i} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^{n}, : u_{t_{\\\\pi (1)} \\\\dots t_{\\\\pi (k)}} \\\\left( F_{\\\\pi (1)} \\\\times \\\\dots \\\\times F_{ \\\\pi(k)} \\\\right) = u_{t_{1} \\\\dots t_{k}} \\\\left( F_{1} \\\\times \\\\dots \\\\times F_{k} \\\\right); 2\\\\. for all measurable sets F_{i} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^{n},m \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} : u_{t_{1} \\\\dots t_{k}} \\\\left( F_{1} \\\\times \\\\dots \\\\times F_{k} \\\\right) = u_{t_{1} \\\\dots t_{k}, t_{k + 1}, \\\\dots , t_{k+m}} \\\\left( F_{1} \\\\times \\\\dots \\\\times F_{k} \\\\times \\\\underbrace{\\\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\\\times \\\\dots \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^{n}}_{m} \\\\right). Then there exists a probability space (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{F}, \\\\mathbb{P}) and a stochastic process X : T \\\\times \\\\Omega \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} such that : u_{t_{1} \\\\dots t_{k}} \\\\left( F_{1} \\\\times \\\\dots \\\\times F_{k} \\\\right) = \\\\mathbb{P} \\\\left( X_{t_{1}} \\\\in F_{1}, \\\\dots, X_{t_{k}} \\\\in F_{k} \\\\right) for all t_{i} \\\\in T, k \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} and measurable sets F_{i} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}^{n}, i.e. X has u_{t_{1} \\\\dots t_{k}} as its finite-dimensional distributions relative to times t_{1} \\\\dots t_{k}. In fact, it is always possible to take as the underlying probability space \\\\Omega = (\\\\mathbb{R}^n)^T and to take for X the canonical process X\\\\colon (t,Y) \\\\mapsto Y_t. Therefore, an alternative way of stating Kolmogorov's extension theorem is that, provided that the above consistency conditions hold, there exists a (unique) measure u on (\\\\mathbb{R}^n)^T with marginals u_{t_{1} \\\\dots t_{k}} for any finite collection of times t_{1} \\\\dots t_{k}. Kolmogorov's extension theorem applies when T is uncountable, but the price to pay for this level of generality is that the measure u is only defined on the product œÉ-algebra of (\\\\mathbb{R}^n)^T, which is not very rich. Explanation of the conditions The two conditions required by the theorem are trivially satisfied by any stochastic process. For example, consider a real-valued discrete-time stochastic process X. Then the probability \\\\mathbb{P}(X_1 >0, X_2<0) can be computed either as u_{1,2}( \\\\mathbb{R}_+ \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}_-) or as u_{2,1}( \\\\mathbb{R}_- \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}_+). Hence, for the finite- dimensional distributions to be consistent, it must hold that u_{1,2}( \\\\mathbb{R}_+ \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}_-) = u_{2,1}( \\\\mathbb{R}_- \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}_+). The first condition generalizes this statement to hold for any number of time points t_i, and any control sets F_i. Continuing the example, the second condition implies that \\\\mathbb{P}(X_1>0) = \\\\mathbb{P}(X_1>0, X_2 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}). Also this is a trivial condition that will be satisfied by any consistent family of finite-dimensional distributions. Implications of the theorem Since the two conditions are trivially satisfied for any stochastic process, the power of the theorem is that no other conditions are required: For any reasonable (i.e., consistent) family of finite-dimensional distributions, there exists a stochastic process with these distributions. The measure-theoretic approach to stochastic processes starts with a probability space and defines a stochastic process as a family of functions on this probability space. However, in many applications the starting point is really the finite-dimensional distributions of the stochastic process. The theorem says that provided the finite-dimensional distributions satisfy the obvious consistency requirements, one can always identify a probability space to match the purpose. In many situations, this means that one does not have to be explicit about what the probability space is. Many texts on stochastic processes do, indeed, assume a probability space but never state explicitly what it is. The theorem is used in one of the standard proofs of existence of a Brownian motion, by specifying the finite dimensional distributions to be Gaussian random variables, satisfying the consistency conditions above. As in most of the definitions of Brownian motion it is required that the sample paths are continuous almost surely, and one then uses the Kolmogorov continuity theorem to construct a continuous modification of the process constructed by the Kolmogorov extension theorem. General form of the theorem The Kolmogorov extension theorem gives us conditions for a collection of measures on Euclidean spaces to be the finite-dimensional distributions of some \\\\mathbb{R}^{n}-valued stochastic process, but the assumption that the state space be \\\\mathbb{R}^{n} is unnecessary. In fact, any collection of measurable spaces together with a collection of inner regular measures defined on the finite products of these spaces would suffice, provided that these measures satisfy a certain compatibility relation. The formal statement of the general theorem is as follows. Let T be any set. Let \\\\\\\\{ (\\\\Omega_t, \\\\mathcal{F}_t) \\\\\\\\}_{t \\\\in T} be some collection of measurable spaces, and for each t \\\\in T , let \\\\tau_t be a Hausdorff topology on \\\\Omega_t. For each finite subset J \\\\subset T, define :\\\\Omega_J := \\\\prod_{t\\\\in J} \\\\Omega_t. For subsets I \\\\subset J \\\\subset T, let \\\\pi^J_I: \\\\Omega_J \\\\to \\\\Omega_I denote the canonical projection map \\\\omega \\\\mapsto \\\\omega_I . For each finite subset F \\\\subset T, suppose we have a probability measure \\\\mu_F on \\\\Omega_F which is inner regular with respect to the product topology (induced by the \\\\tau_t) on \\\\Omega_F . Suppose also that this collection \\\\\\\\{\\\\mu_F\\\\\\\\} of measures satisfies the following compatibility relation: for finite subsets F \\\\subset G \\\\subset T, we have that :\\\\mu_F = (\\\\pi^G_F)_* \\\\mu_G where (\\\\pi^G_F)_* \\\\mu_G denotes the pushforward measure of \\\\mu_G induced by the canonical projection map \\\\pi^G_F. Then there exists a unique probability measure \\\\mu on \\\\Omega_T such that \\\\mu_F=(\\\\pi^T_F)_* \\\\mu for every finite subset F \\\\subset T. As a remark, all of the measures \\\\mu_F,\\\\mu are defined on the product sigma algebra on their respective spaces, which (as mentioned before) is rather coarse. The measure \\\\mu may sometimes be extended appropriately to a larger sigma algebra, if there is additional structure involved. Note that the original statement of the theorem is just a special case of this theorem with \\\\Omega_t = \\\\mathbb{R}^n for all t \\\\in T, and \\\\mu_{\\\\\\\\{t_1,...,t_k\\\\\\\\}}= u_{t_1 \\\\dots t_k} for t_1,...,t_k \\\\in T. The stochastic process would simply be the canonical process (\\\\pi_t)_{t \\\\in T}, defined on \\\\Omega=(\\\\mathbb{R}^n)^T with probability measure P=\\\\mu. The reason that the original statement of the theorem does not mention inner regularity of the measures u_{t_1\\\\dots t_k} is that this would automatically follow, since Borel probability measures on Polish spaces are automatically Radon. This theorem has many far-reaching consequences; for example it can be used to prove the existence of the following, among others: *Brownian motion, i.e., the Wiener process, *a Markov chain taking values in a given state space with a given transition matrix, *infinite products of (inner-regular) probability spaces. History According to John Aldrich, the theorem was independently discovered by British mathematician Percy John Daniell in the slightly different setting of integration theory.J.

It can be either a whole musical piece or part of a larger musical arrangement. In terms of performance, the major categories are live dance music and recorded dance music. While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving medieval dances. In the Baroque period, the major dance styles were noble court dances (see Baroque dance). In the classical music era, the minuet was frequently used as a third movement, although in this context it would not accompany any dancing. The waltz also arose later in the classical era. Both remained part of the romantic music period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the barcarolle, mazurka, ecossaise, ballade and polonaise. Modern popular dance music initially emerged from late 19th century's Western ballroom and social dance music. During the early 20th century, ballroom dancing gained popularity among the working class who attended public dance halls. Dance music became enormously popular during the 1920s. In the 1930s, called the Swing era, Swing music was the popular dance music in America. In the 1950s, rock and roll became the popular dance music. The late 1960s saw the rise of soul and R&B; music. The rise of disco in the early 1970s led to dance music becoming popular with the public. By the late 1970s, electronic dance music was developing. This music, made using electronics, is a style of popular music commonly played in nightclubs, radio stations, shows and raves. Many subgenres of electronic dance music have evolved. Origins Folk dance music is music accompanying traditional dance and may be contrasted with historical/classical, and popular/commercial dance music. An example of folk dance music in the United States is the old-time music played at square dances and contra dances. Historical dance music While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving medieval dances such as carols and the Estampie. The earliest of these surviving dances are almost as old as Western staff-based music notation. =By period= The Renaissance dance music was written for instruments such as the lute, viol, tabor, pipe, and the sackbut. In the Baroque period, the major dance styles were noble court dances (see Baroque dance). Examples of dances include the French courante, sarabande, minuet and gigue. Collections of dances were often collected together as dance suites. In the classical music era, the minuet was frequently used as a third movement in four-movement non-vocal works such as sonatas, string quartets, and symphonies, although in this context it would not accompany any dancing. The waltz also arose later in the classical era, as the minuet evolved into the scherzo (literally, \\"joke\\"; a faster-paced minuet). Both remained part of the romantic music period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the barcarolle, mazurka and polonaise. Also in the romantic music era, the growth and development of ballet extended the composition of dance music to a new height. Frequently, dance music was a part of opera. Popular dance music Modern popular dance music initially emerged from late 19th century's Western ballroom and social dance music. =By genre= Dance music works often bear the name of the corresponding dance, e.g. waltzes, the tango, the bolero, the can-can, minuets, salsa, various kinds of jigs and the breakdown. Other dance forms include contradance, the merengue (Dominican Republic), and the cha-cha-cha. Often it is difficult to know whether the name of the music came first or the name of the dance. Ballads are commonly chosen for slow-dance routines. However ballads have been commonly deemed as the opposite of dance music in terms of their tempo. Originally, the ballad was a type of dance as well (hence the name \\"ballad\\", from the same root as \\"ballroom\\" and \\"ballet\\"). Ballads are still danced on the Faeroe Islands. Dansband \\"Dansband\\" (\\"Dance band\\") is a term in Swedish for bands who play a kind of popular music, \\"dansbandsmusik\\" (\\"Dance band music\\"), to partner dance to. These terms came into use around 1970, and before that, many of the bands were classified as \\"pop groups\\". This type of music is mostly popular in the Nordic countries. Disco Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, soul, pop, and salsa. It was most popular during the mid to late 1970s, though it has had brief resurgences afterwards. It inspired the electronic dance music genre. Electronic By 1981, a new form of dance music was developing. This music, made using electronics, is a style of popular music commonly played in dance music nightclubs, radio stations, shows and raves. During its gradual decline in the late 1970s, disco became influenced by electronic musical instruments such as synthesizers. The first notable fully synthesized disco hit was \\"I Feel Love\\" by Giorgio Moroder and Pete Bellotte with lyrics by Donna Summer. Looping, sampling and segueing as found in disco continued to be used as creative techniques within trance music, techno music and especially house music. Electronic dance music experienced a boom in the late 1980s. In the UK, this manifested itself in the dance element of Tony Wilson's Ha√ßienda scene (in Manchester) and London clubs like Delirium, The Trip, and Shoom. The scene rapidly expanded to the Summer Of Love in Ibiza, which became the European capital of house and trance. Many music genres that made use of electronic instruments developed into contemporary styles mainly due to the MIDI protocol, which enabled computers, synthesizers, sound cards, samplers, and drum machines to interact with each other and achieve the full synchronization of sounds. Electronic dance music is typically composed using synthesizers and computers, and rarely has any physical instruments. Instead, this is replaced by analogue and digital electronic sounds, with a 4/4 beat. Many producers of this kind of music however, such as Darren Tate and MJ Cole, were trained in classical music before they moved into the electronic medium. Associated with dance music are usually commercial tracks that may not easily be categorized, such as \\"The Power\\" by Snap!, \\"No Limit\\" by 2 Unlimited, \\"Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)\\" by C+C Music Factory, and the Beatmasters' \\"Rok da House\\" but the term \\"dance music\\" is applied to many forms of electronic music, both commercial and non-commercial. Some of the most popular upbeat genres include house, techno, drum & bass, jungle, hardcore, electronica, industrial, breakbeat, trance, psychedelic trance, UK garage and electro. There are also much slower styles, such as downtempo, chillout and nu jazz. Many subgenres of electronic dance music have evolved. Subgenres of house include acid house, electro house, hard house, funky house, deep house, tribal house, hip house, tech house and US garage. Subgenres of drum & bass include techstep, hardstep, jump-up, intelligent D&B;/atmospheric D&B;, liquid funk, sambass, drumfunk, neurofunk and ragga jungle. Subgenres of other styles include progressive breaks, booty bass, Goa trance, hard trance, hardstyle, minimal techno, gabber techno, breakcore, broken beat, trip hop, folktronica and glitch. Speed garage, breakstep, 2-step, bassline, grime, UK funky, future garage and the reggae-inspired dubstep are all subgenres of UK garage. =By decade= 1900s‚Äì1910s During the early 20th century, ballroom dancing gained popularity among the working class who attended public dance halls. 1920s Dance music became enormously popular during the 1920s. Nightclubs were frequented by large numbers of people at which a form of jazz, which was characterized by fancy orchestras with strings instruments and complex arrangements, became the standard music at clubs. A particularly popular dance was the fox-trot. At the time this music was simply called jazz, although today people refer to it as \\"white jazz\\" or big band. 1930s‚Äì1940s Genres: Swing music, Western swing 1950s Genres: Rock and roll In 1952, the television show American Bandstand switched to a format where teenagers dance along as records are played. American Bandstand continued to be shown until 1989. Since the late 1950s, disc jockeys (commonly known as DJs) played recorded music at nightclubs. 1960s In 1960, Chubby Checker released his song \\"The Twist\\" setting off a dance craze. The late 1960s saw the rise of soul and R&B; music which used lavish orchestral arrangements. Other genres: Funk 1970s Genres: Disco, funk, R&B;, hip hop In 1970, the television show Soul Train premiered featuring famous soul artists who would play or lipsync their hits while the audience danced along. By the mid-1970s, disco had become one of the main genres featured. In 1974, Billboard added a Disco Action chart of top hits to its other charts (see List of Billboard number one dance club songs). Disco was characterized by the use of real orchestral instruments, such as strings, which had largely been abandoned during the 1950s because of rock music. In contrast to the 1920s, however, the use of live orchestras in night clubs was extremely rare due to its expense. The disco craze reached its peak in the late 1970s when the word \\"disco\\" became synonymous with \\"dance music\\" and nightclubs were referred to as \\"discos\\". 1980s Genres: New wave, Italo disco, Euro disco, post- disco, synthpop, dance-pop, funk, contemporary R&B;, hip hop, new jack swing, house, acid house, hip house, techno, freestyle, Miami bass, bounce, electro, hi-NRG, Madchester, EBM, cosmic disco, Balearic beat, new beat 1990s Genres: House, Italo dance, Italo house, Eurodance, Europop, hip house, electro, electroclash, progressive house, French house, techno, minimal techno, trance, alternative dance, new jack swing, contemporary R&B;, dancehall, hip hop, G-funk, Miami bass, drum and bass, big beat, breakbeat, breakbeat hardcore, rave, hardcore, happy hardcore, speed garage, UK garage, soca, reggaeton, psytrance, Goa trance 2000s Genres: Trance, electropop, dance-pop, snap, crunk, dancehall, reggaeton, dance-punk, nu- disco, electro house, minimal techno, dubstep, grime, bassline, UK funky, contemporary R&B;, hip hop, drum and bass, progressive house, hardstyle, funky house 2010s Genres: Electropop, synthpop, glitchpop, hip house, nu- disco, new wave, new rave, trance, house, hi-NRG, hard NRG, dance-pop, electro-industrial, deep house, drum and bass, dubstep, techstep, liquid funk, electro house, glitch house, progressive house, breakbeat, hardstyle, dubstyle, drumstep, hip hop, ghetto house, Jersey club, trap, drill, moombahton, moombahcore, dancehall, tropical house, UK garage, Europop Radio formats The Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart tracks the most popular tracks played by radio stations using a \\"dance music\\" format.

They are sometimes purported to have originated from the Sanigoi tribe mentioned by the Classic authors. In the 6th century, they formed a tribal principality, which later commingled with the Abasgoi, Apsilae and Missimianoi into the Kingdom of Abkhazia. Until 1864 Sadz lived at the Black Sea coast north to Gagra until the Khosta River (Khamysh River). They formed the Sadzyn area, which consisted of the possessions of Kamysh, Arydba, Amarshan and Gechba clans, under the hegemony of Tsanba clan. The Ubykh princes Oblagua, Chizmaa and Dziash also originated from the Sadz. Some think that in the 12-14th centuries a part of the Sadz have been forced to resettle to the northern mountainside of Caucasus Major under the Ubykh pressure. They formed there Abazin people. This is only one of the theories explaining the migration from Abkhazia of the ancestors of what is now the Abaza people. After the Russian-Circassian War ended in 1864 the most of Sadz were forced to turn muhajirs, moving to the Ottoman Empire. Some of them settled in Adjara (then under the Ottoman possession). Now the Sadz dialect of the Abkhaz language is spoken only in Turkey. It consists of Akhaltsys and Tswyzhy subdialects. The Sadz, Aibga and Akhchipsou tribes of Abkhazia were the last ethnic groups to have offered the resistance to the Russian advances during the Caucasus War. The last tribes conquered by Russians were Ahchypsy and Aibga, who lived in and around of what is now Krasnaya Polyana.

Mulele had also been minister of education in Patrice Lumumba's cabinet. With the assassination of Lumumba in January 1961 and the arrest of his recognised deputy Antoine Gizenga one year later, Mulele became one of the top Lumumbists determined to continue the struggle. He went to Cairo as the representative of the Lumumbists' Congo National Liberation Committee based in Brazzaville. From Cairo he proceeded to China in 1963 to receive military training, and also took a group of Congolese youths with him, who received training in guerrilla tactics.China's Policy in Africa 1958-71. By Alaba Ogunsanwo. . Page 175. Mulele was lured out of exile after Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu promised him amnesty, but Mobutu had him tortured and executed after Mulele returned to the Congo. He was a member of the Bapende ethnic group.Congo, David van Reybrouck, 2010 Career Mulele (third from the right) with the Lumumba Government, 1960 =Simba Rebellion= In January 1964, a new conflict broke out as Congolese rebels calling themselves \\"Simba\\" (Swahili for \\"lion\\") rebelled against the government. They were led by Mulele, Gaston Soumialot and Christophe Gbenye, former members of Antoine Gizenga's Parti Solidaire Africain (PSA). During the Simba rebellion, Mulele, who had previously undergone training in the Eastern Bloc as well as China, led a Maoist faction in the Kwilu Province. This came to be known as the Kwilu Rebellion. Mulele was an avowed Maoist, and for this reason his insurgency was supported by communist China. By the end of April 1964, Mulele's rebellion had been rendered somewhat less dangerous by the government. The Soviet Union, with an embassy in the national capital of Leopoldville, did not support Mulele's Kwilu revolt and had no part in its preparation: lack of support from the Soviets was in the first place responsible for Mulele turning to China as his patron.China's Policy in Africa 1958-71. By Alaba Ogunsanwo. . Page 175. Nonetheless, by August the Simba insurgents had captured Stanleyville and set up a rebel government there. However, the Congolese central government requested foreign intervention, and the troops fighting under the command of Soumialot and Gbenye were routed in November 1964, after intense drives by central government troops officered by foreign mercenaries. The landing of Belgian paratroopers in Stanleyville also proved instrumental in the rebels' defeat, as did key military assistance from the United States. On 24 November 1964, five United States Air Force C-130 transports dropped 350 Belgian paratroopers of the Paracommando Regiment onto the airfield at Stanleyville to rescue 2,000 European civilians being held hostage by the Simbas. This move made the United States very unpopular in Africa at the time.China's Policy in Africa 1958-71. By Alaba Ogunsanwo. . Page 177. After the rebellion's defeat, Mulele fled into exile in Congo-Brazzaville. In 1968, then-President Joseph- D√©sir√© Mobutu (later Mobutu Sese Seko) lured Mulele out of exile by promising him amnesty. Mulele returned to Congo-Kinshasa, believing he would be granted amnesty. Instead, he was publicly tortured and executed: his eyes were pulled from their sockets, his genitals were ripped off, and his limbs were amputated one by one, all while he was alive. What was left was dumped in the Congo River. =Ideology and Maoism= When the Kwilu rebellion broke out in 1964, the revolt was led by Mulele in a way reminiscent of the Chinese communist revolutionary tactics during the Chinese Civil War. Mulele required his fighters to adhere to a very strict moral code, emphasising self-discipline and respect for civilians. The tribal peasant fighters proved difficult to control and many disregarded Mulele's orders. The eight instructions on conduct Mulele issued to his guerrilla fighters showed the great influence Mao Zedong's writings regarding \\"people's war\\" had on the Kwilu insurgency. Mulele's code of conduct was as follows:China's Policy in Africa 1958-71. By Alaba Ogunsanwo. . Page 175. #Respect all men, even bad ones. #Buy the goods of villagers in all honesty and without stealing. #Return borrowed things in good time and without trouble. #Pay for things which you have broken and in good spirit. #Do not harm or hurt others. #Do not destroy or trample on other people's land. #Respect women and do not amuse yourselves with them as you would like to. #Do not make your prisoners of war suffer. The attempt to adapt Maoist Chinese practice to African conditions also extended to Mulele's use of the peasants as the mainstay of his revolution. Personal life Mulele was born in Isulu-Matende. He, alongside Antoine Gizenga, received his early secondary education at a seminary in Kinzambi. He continued his education at the Ecole Moyenne de Leverville established by the Huileries du Congo Belge and coordinated under the Brothers of Charity for a further three years.\\"The Second Independence\\": A Case Study of the Kwilu Rebellion in the Congo (1965) Renee C. Fox, Willy de Craemer and Jean-Marie Ribeaucourt, Retrieved 16 July 2019 He married L√©onie Abo, a fellow fighter who spent five years in the underground rebel movement alongside guerrillas loyal to Mulele.

Yonge Philip Keyes Yonge (May 27, 1850 ‚Äì August 9, 1934), usually given as P. K. Yonge, was a businessman and civic leader. A resident of Pensacola, he was a prominent Floridian. A founding member of the Florida Board of Control (the governing body of the State University System of Florida, Florida's public university system), he served on that board for almost 30 years as a member and chairman. The P.K. Yonge Developmental Research School in Gainesville is named for him. Yonge was associated with the Southern State Lumber Company and its predecessors and served as president and manager of the corporation. The company was one of Florida's largest lumber firms at the time, with its headquarters in Pensacola. An active citizen of Pensacola for nearly half a century, Yonge served as alderman from 1905 to 1909, and was president of the Chamber of Commerce in 1908. He received his LL. D. degree from the University of Florida in 1921. He was Phi Kappa Phi at the University of Florida, Phi Beta Kappa at the University of Georgia and a member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. Yonge family history in Georgia and Florida P. K. Yonge was the son of Chandler Cox Yonge, a distinguished lawyer and public leader. Yonge's ancestor, Henry Yonge, Sr., (b. 1713, London) emigrated from England to South Carolina, where he pursued a career as a surveyor. In 1754, Henry, along with William Gerard de Brahm, was appointed Joint Surveyor of Georgia, and later became Surveyor General of the province. He served in the lower house of the General Assembly and as a member of the Governor's Council. His son, Henry Yonge, Jr., had begun a career in law but because of his Loyalist leanings was forced to leave Georgia when the American Revolution broke out in 1776. He made his way to St. Augustine, capital of East Florida, where he gained employment in service of the Crown, serving as acting Attorney General; and eventually being appointed Secretary and Registrar General of the Bahamas in 1788. Because of his Loyalist sympathies, in 1778 Henry Yonge, Sr., with his sons Philip and William John, was banished from Georgia as well by the rebel usurpers of the colony's government. They took a ship headed to the Bahamas, but it was seized by a British privateer who conveyed them to St. Augustine. P. K. Yonge's father, Chandler Cox Yonge, was born at Fernandina in 1818, when it was still a Spanish possession. The elder Yonge became a lawyer and was only twenty years old when he served as assistant secretary of the first Florida constitutional convention held in 1838 at St. Joseph. In 1843, Chandler Yonge was elected to the Florida state senate, and in 1845 he was appointed by President Polk as the United States district attorney for Florida. When Florida seceded and joined the Confederacy he served in the same capacity for the Confederate States; later he was commissioned as a quartermaster in the Confederate Army with the rank of major and stationed at Tallahassee. Early years Chandler Yonge's son, Philip Keyes Yonge, was born on May 27, 1850 in Marianna, Florida. In 1859, the family moved to Pensacola, where both men spent the rest of their lives. P. K. Yonge was educated by tutors and in private schools, and finished his education at the University of Georgia at Athens. He attended the University of Georgia, his father's alma mater, receiving a Bachelor's degree in 1871, and his Master of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degrees in 1872. He was scholarly enough to be elected a member of the national honor society, Phi Beta Kappa. He served as British vice consul's clerk at Pensacola in 1872‚Äì73, and as acting British vice consul in 1873‚Äì74. By 1875 Yonge was engaged in the real estate and insurance business rather than the practice of law, and in 1876, he got into lumber manufacture and export, in which he was active for over fifty years. On December 13, 1876, he married Lucie C. Davis at Pensacola. Career in the timber and lumber industry and public service In 1876, P. K. Yonge became secretary of the Muscogee Lumber Company, a position he held until 1889 when the business was taken over by the Southern States Land & Timber Company, of which he was made corporate assistant manager and manager of its New York office. In 1892 he was appointed superintendent of the company's Muscogee Mills; when the Southern States Land & Timber Company went into receivership in 1895, he was appointed agent for the receivers and had full charge of company affairs until 1898 when the Southern States Lumber Company was organized to take over the business. In that year Yonge was elected vice president and general manager of the company and in 1903 he became its president, a position he held until 1930, when all the timber on its land, over 400,000 acres, had been cut, and the company was dissolved. He then retired from business at age eighty. Yonge founded a demonstration farm and ranch called Magnolia Farms in 1899, located twenty miles northwest of Pensacola along the Perdido River near Muscogee, but just over the Alabama state line. This enterprise was owned by the Southern States Lumber Company under the supervision of himself and Oscar Williams, its superintendent, and later included a dairy that eventually developed one of the South's premier herds of Jersey dairy cattle. With consolidation of Florida state schools in 1905, Yonge was appointed a member of their Board of Control, the governing body of the state university system of Florida. He served, except for one term, until his retirement in 1933 at the age of eighty-three, and was its chairman for the last twenty years. Florida Historical Society and later years P. K. Yonge was a charter member of the reorganized Florida Historical Society in 1902 and served as its president from 1932 until his death in 1934. He was an active collector of Florida historical materials and assembled a vast collection of books and documents that his son, Julien C. Yonge, inherited and further expanded. Julien Yonge later donated the collection, which formed the nucleus of the P.K. Yonge Library of Florida History, to the University of Florida. Yonge's wife, Lucie C. Davis, died in 1932. A life-long member of the Episcopal Church, he was survived by five of his nine children. Yonge died in Pensacola on August 9, 1934, and was buried there in St. Michael's cemetery P. K. Yonge was designated a Great Floridian by the Florida Department of State in the Great Floridians 2000 Program. A plaque attesting to the honor is located at the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (formerly the P.K. Yonge School), on Palafox Street in Pensacola.Florida Department of State: Great Floridians 2000 Program References * This article incorporates some text from a publication History of Florida: Past and Present, Historical and Biographical, Harry Gardner Cutler, Lewis Publishing Company, 1923, p. 243, now in the public domain.

Oberste-Vorth (1994) Henon mappings in the complex domain II: projective and inductive limits of polynomials and he has written several books.  Writing  Hubbard is a former student of Harvard University's infamous Math 55, where he famously struggled initially because he \\"just didn't know proofs.\\" He later returned to Harvard to teach that same class. However, Hubbard developed a profound distaste for Math 55's method of teaching proofs largely centered on algebraic induction. In response, he and his wife Barbara wrote the book Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms: A Unified Approach. He has also published the first two volumes of a book on Teichm√ºller theory and its applications to four revolutionary theorems of William Thurston.  Personal life  He is married to Barbara Burke Hubbard, the science writer. Together they have a son, Alexander, and three younger daughters, Eleanor, Judith and Diana. The children sometimes help them with their books, in illustration, writing answer keys and pointing out the minor errors.Hubbard, John; Hubbard, Barbara.

Early life Unlike most of the players brought up at Athletic Bilbao, Iturriaga was not born in the Basque Country, or even in Spain. He was born and grew up in Mexico City, his family having moved to Mexico in the early 1980s from their native city of Zarautz after his father was relocated for business purposes to that Latin American country. Iturriaga went to elementary school in Mexico, but at the age of 13 his family returned to Europe where he attended St Edmunds College Catholic School near Ware, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom. He showed his natural sporting talents there, quickly learning to play cricket and gaining a place in the Hertfordshire under-14 rugby county team, having played the game for only a few weeks; after high school he finally went back to Spain, where he became a regional junior champion in the racquet sport padel and began to play football with local CD Getxo while planning to study civil engineering. Club career In 2002, aged 18, Iturriaga joined Athletic Bilbao following in the footsteps of his brother I√±igo, and meeting the criteria of the club's philosophy despite his birthplace by having developed as a footballer in the Basque region. He first appeared for the farm team, CD Basconia followed by the reserves, spending two seasons playing regularly with each squad. Iturriaga was definitely promoted to the main squad for the 2006‚Äì07 campaign,Conf√≠a Iturriaga en mejor√≠a del Athletic (Iturriaga trusts in Athletic improvement) ; Es M√°s, 21 November 2006 (in Spanish)Athletic de Bilbao, cien a√±os sin extranjeros (Athletic de Bilbao, one hundred years without foreign players); La Vanguardia, 18 December 2011 (in Spanish) but only appeared in four La Liga games as the side finished one place above relegation (17th). His debut came on 15 October 2006, as he came on as a substitute for Pablo Orbaiz in the 58th minute of the 3‚Äì2 away win against Gimn√†stic de Tarragona;Gimnastic de Tarragona 2‚Äì3 Athletic Bilbao; ESPN Soccernet, 15 October 2006 during his spell at the San Mam√©s Stadium, he was mainly restricted to Copa del Rey matches.El mexicano Iturriaga, posible ante los rojillos (Mexico's Iturriaga, a possibility against the reds); La Jornada, 15 March 2007 (in Spanish) In the following summer, Iturriaga was released by Athletic and signed with Segunda Divisi√≥n team UD Salamanca where he was also highly unsuccessful, going on to serve two loans in Segunda Divisi√≥n B, including one at SD Lemona. In 2009, he left but stayed in the Biscay area, moving to amateurs Club Portugalete. After three seasons in Tercera Divisi√≥n, Iturriaga signed for Getxo where he had already spent his formative years. International career Iturriaga declared he wished to represent Mexico internationally. Hugo S√°nchez, the legendary striker who played in Spain for twelve years and was then in charge of the national team, stated that he would have him in consideration and follow his progress. However, the manager left his post to work with a club, and the player did not receive any call-ups. Personal life Away from football, Iturriaga gained a master's degree in industrial engineering from the University of the Basque Country and became a professional in the field.

The episode is based on the short story written by Bentley Little. It details a man discovering a shocking secret about George Washington that could shatter the world's view of America forever and the murderous brotherhood sworn to keep the secret safe. Plot Mike Franks (Johnathon Schaech) discovers a strange letter hidden behind a portrait of George Washington while searching through the home of his recently deceased grandmother. The letter states, \\"I will skin your children and eat them. Upon finishing, I shall fashion utensils out of their bones.\\" with the signature \\"G. W.\\", along with a fork presumably made out of human bone. After his grandmother's funeral, her friend Samuel Madison (Myron Natwick) tries to persuade Mike to give him the letter. When Mike refuses, members of a psychotic patriots group, with wooden teeth and dressed in powdered wigs and American Revolutionary War attire begin to stalk the family and they eventually try to break into their house. They demand the letter, but are forced to leave when Mike calls the police. Mike turns to Professor Harkinson (Saul Rubinek), a trusted friend and employee of the local university, for information. Harkinson tells him about \\"the Washingtonians\\" and how history has been based on a false image designed to hide the truth, referring to Washington's cannibalism and the fact that Benjamin Franklin is a composite character based on the accomplishments of several other individuals. They are soon attacked by the Washingtonians once again and, although Harkinson manages to escape with the letter, Mike, his wife Pam (Venus Terzo) and daughter Amy (Julia Tortolano) are abducted and taken to Mount Vernon, the home of the killer President. It is here the Washingtonians' murderous and cannibalistic nature is verified, when Mike and his family are taken into a large, opulent dining room and witness a table full of Washingtonians, (including Samuel and other townspeople they had met previously), feast on a mutilated human body. The Washingtonians unveil the secret of their renowned leader. Apparently, during their stay at Valley Forge, Washington and his troops were stranded without supplies and forced to resort to cannibalism in order to survive. Washington relished the taste of human meat, having one man killed each day to satisfy him even after supplies came through. He intended to lead the country on a mission of turning everyone into cannibals much like him. However, before any of the Washingtonians can do harm to Mike and his family, Harkinson and a team of FBI agents break in and kill all of the Washingtonians. Harkinson returns the letter to Mike and asks him to expose the truth to the whole world. In the epilogue, which takes place six months later, the Franks have become vegetarians and to their shock Washington's face on the United States one-dollar bill is replaced with that of George W. Bush. Changes from the original story The Masters of Horror episode was played in a more camp style than the original short story's black humor, and the ending was changed. Rather than having Harkinson and his fellow rescuers be redcoats, police arrive with him instead and the Washingtonians are simply put down. The episode's epilogue was also an addition. Reception The film was derided as unintentionally funny and accused of delivering \\"the world's worst Bush punchline\\".

In the 1950s, he helped to establish California's first quarantine facility on the UC Davis campus to permit California growers to import foreign vines. This led to an expansion of California's wine industry as more Vitis vinifera was introduced to the area. Career In 1955, Professor of Viticulture at the University of California Harold Olmo was in Western Australia studying climatic limitations of viticulture in the Swan Valley. Olmo spent eight months in Western Australia at the invitation of the Western Australian Vine Fruits Research Trust. When he published his report in 1956, one of the recommendations put forward was that Mount Barker and the Frankland of the Great Southern area of Western Australia showed great promise for making table wines in the light traditional European style.

He was the first-ever closer in the history of the Astros' franchise. He was also a member of the Cardinals' 1967 World Series Championship team. He was nicknamed The Switchman for his ability to \\"turn out the lights\\" on opposing batters.Reed, Robert. A Six-Gun Salute: An Illustrated History of the Houston Colt .45s 1962-1964\\\\.

He split his 1951 campaign with a pair of independent minor league clubs: the Duluth Dukes of the Northern League (three games) and the Youngstown A's of the Middle Atlantic League (two innings). He joined the New York Giants organization in 1952, winning 13 decisions that year with the Kingsport Cherokees of the Appalachian League and 14 in 1955 with the Danville Leafs of the Carolina League.Hal Woodeshick (minor league statistics & history) Baseball-Reference.com He served in the United States Army during the two years between those seasons. He was selected by Detroit in the minor league draft on November 27, 1955. A 12-game winner with the Charleston Senators in 1956, he made his major league debut later that year on September 14 in a 5-1 defeat to the eventual World Series Champion New York Yankees at Briggs Stadium. He picked up the loss after surrendering four runs in three innings as the starter.New York Yankees 5, Detroit Tigers 1; Friday, September 14, 1956 (D) at Briggs Stadium Retrosheet His only other appearance with the Tigers came ten days later on September 24 in another start at home which resulted in him yielding four runs again and earning his second straight loss.

He was traded with Jay Porter to Cleveland for Hank Aguirre and Jim Hegan on February 18, 1958. Woodeshick split the 1958 campaign between the Indians and its top farm team in San Diego where he won ten contests, and began the next one with the Toronto Maple Leafs. He was dealt to the Washington Senators along with Hal Naragon for Ed Fitz Gerald on May 25, 1959. After that franchise moved west and became the Minnesota Twins, he was picked in the 1960 Major League Baseball expansion draft by the second Washington Senators on December 14, 1960. He returned to the Detroit Tigers just under six months later on June 5, 1961 in exchange for Chuck Cottier. Woodeshick was also loaned to the Charleston (WV) Marlins for part of the 1961 season. He once reflected on the nomadic nature of the early years of his baseball career, saying, \\"People talk about pressure now, but pressure was driving a wife and child across the country with no contract, a bad back, and not knowing whether you're going to have a job next year.\\" = Houston Colt .45s/Astros = Woodeshick was on the Houston Colt .45s roster for the expansion team's inaugural Opening Day in 1962. His contract had been purchased on October 12, 1961 from the Denver Bears, the Tigers' American Association affiliate at the time. General manager Paul Richards, who had previously managed the Baltimore Orioles, was impressed with several of his qualities such as his six-foot-four-inch (1.93 meters) height, work ethic and an ability to throw an effective sinker. The most important one was Woodeshick having his best performances against Richards' old ballclub. In the fifteen games he pitched versus the Orioles, he was 4-1 with a 1.80 earned run average (ERA).Hal Woodeshick (career pitching splits) Baseball-Reference.com The acquisition was a big risk because Woodeshick was prone to wildness with his pitches and had problems with his fielding. He spent most of his first Colt .45s spring training working with Richards and pitching coach Cot Deal to correct his inability to make accurate throws to the first baseman after cleanly fielding ground balls. The solution was for Woodeshick to jog toward the first baseman and lob an overhand soft toss to him.Anderson, James. \\"Hal Woodeshick: The First Legitimate Closer in Houston Colt .45s/Astros History\\", Texas Baseball Hall of Fame, January 22, 2006. Under Richards' tutelage, he improved his curveball and learned how to throw the slip pitch. Woodeshick started in 26 of his 31 appearances in 1962. In the Colt .45s' second-ever regular season contest on April 11, its first at night, he pitched eight innings and endured a one-hour rain delay in the fourth to earn a 2-0 victory over the Chicago Cubs.Houston Colt .45s 2, Chicago Cubs 0; Wednesday, April 11, 1962 (N) at Colt Stadium Retrosheet He finished the campaign with a 5-16 record due to a pair of nagging injuries. A slow-healing throat infection had left him out of playing shape at midseason. By the time he was released at year's end, his back pain was so debilitating that his wife had to drive him back to their Pennsylvania home. After two spinal taps failed to provide a cure, his problem was remedied by a chiropractor who prescribed an exercise regimen. He returned to the Colt .45s as its first-ever legitimate closer in 1963, winning eleven games with a team-leading ten saves and a 1.97 ERA. His success was based largely on having picked up the slider from Rusty Staub. Woodeshick pitched two scoreless innings in relief of Ray Culp for the National League in the 1963 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, striking out Joe Pepitone in the sixth and Bob Allison and Harmon Killebrew in the seventh.

Born in New York, New York, and raised by adoptive parents in Detroit, Michigan, Bruce graduated from Highland Park High School and attended Alma College. He was listed as tall and . Baseball career Bruce began his professional career in 1953 in the minor league system of his hometown Tigers. He won 18 games in the Class D Wisconsin State League in his first season and began a steady rise through the Detroit farm system. He missed part of 1956 and all of 1957 while serving in the United States Army, and debuted with Detroit at the tail end of 1959, working in two games. In , Bruce spent the entire season with the Tigers, appearing in 34 games (making 15 starts during the latter half of the season) and posting a 3.74 earned run average in 130 innings pitched. However, a shoulder injurySkelton, David E., \\"Bob Bruce\\". Society for American Baseball Research Biography Project suffered early in the campaign derailed Bruce as he sought to cement a place in the Tigers' starting rotation. He worked in only 44 innings for Detroit, and was briefly sent to Triple-A Denver. On December 1, 1961, he was traded to the Houston Colt .45s, a first-year expansion team, for veteran pitcher Sam \\"Toothpick\\" Jones. Bruce became a mainstay of the Houston starting rotation during the team's early years, tying Turk Farrell for the team lead in wins (with ten) in the Colt .45's inaugural 1962 season, and becoming the first Houston pitcher to win 15 games, in . On April 19, 1964, Bruce struck out three batters on nine pitches in the eighth inning of a 6‚Äì2 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers, becoming the seventh National League pitcher and the 12th pitcher in major league history to accomplish the nine-strike/three-strikeout half-inning, only one day after Sandy Koufax achieved the same feat. That season, Bruce also reached career bests in complete games (nine), shutouts (four), and earned run average (2.76, tenth in the National League). He threw the last pitch in Colt Stadium on September 27, 1964, then‚Äîon April 12, 1965‚Äîhe threw the first pitch in the history of the Astrodome, as the Opening Day starting pitcher for the renamed Astros. He was Houston's hard-luck losing pitcher that day, surrendering a two-run, third-inning home run to Dick Allen, as the visiting Philadelphia Phillies prevailed, 2‚Äì1. His last two seasons with Houston, and , were disappointing. In the former year, he lost 18 of 27 decisions while posting seven complete games and a decent 3.76 earned run average. But in 1966, his record was a poor 3‚Äì13 and his ERA rose to 5.34, a career worst, in 129 innings pitched. During the off-season, the Astros included him in a trade to the Atlanta Braves for Eddie Mathews, the future Baseball Hall of Fame third baseman then in the twilight of his career. Bruce got into only 12 games for the 1967 Braves before being sent to Triple-A Richmond, and then retired after the 1967 season. In an MLB career that encompassed all or parts of nine years, Bruce compiled a 49‚Äì71 win‚Äìloss record, with 26 complete games (in 167 starts), six shutouts and one save. In 1,122 innings pitched, he struck out 733, allowing 1,146 hits and 340 bases on balls. His career ERA was 3.85. Post-baseball After leaving baseball, Bruce became a successful real estate developer, salesman and property manager in both Michigan and Texas. He died at age 83 in Plano, Texas.

He was a leader in the movement to increase library collections of Latino literature and Spanish- language materials in the United States. He was also instrumental in efforts to train more Latino and Spanish-speaking people as professional librarians. Biography Trejo was born in Villa Vicente Guerrero, Durango, Mexico. He moved to the United States at the age of three, gaining American citizenship in 1944 during his service with the U.S. Army. He earned a B.A. in Education, University of Arizona, 1949; M.A. in Spanish Language and Literature, University of the Americas, 1951; M.A. in Library Science, Kent State University, 1953; Litt.D. (with honors), National University of Mexico, 1959. When he started his position as a Professor of Library Science at the University of Arizona in 1965, Trejo was one of only five Hispanic librarians in the nation.Yamashita, Briana: \\"Arnulfo D. Trejo, Founder of REFORMA, Dies at 79,\\" Criticas In 1971 he founded REFORMA, the National Association to Promote Library and Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish-speaking, which is today a prominent organization for Latino librarians as well as for librarians serving Latino communities. Trejo was inspired to start REFORMA after a screening of the film I Am Joaquin, based on the epic poem of the same title, by Corky Gonzalez and exploring the struggles and exploitation of Mexican Americans.G√ºere√±a, Sal: \\"A Tribute to Arnulfo D. Trejo,\\" He served as president of the organization from 1971 to 1974. In recognition of his importance to the organization, REFORMA's Librarian of the Year Award is now named after Dr. Trejo. In 1975 he founded the Graduate Library Institute for Spanish-speaking Americans (GLISA), an American Library Association-accredited master's degree program for training librarians. During the institute's four- year existence Trejo was directly involved in recruiting Latino students into the program and contributed to their education. GLISA's graduates include many Latina and Latino librarians who are present-day leaders in the field. In 1980 Trejo cofounded Hispanic Books Distributors, a Spanish language book seller aimed at increasing the availability of Spanish-language materials to libraries in the United States. Trejo Foster Foundation for Hispanic Library Education In 1992, Trejo, his sister Luisa Duenes Trejo, and his second wife, Annette M. Foster Trejo, created the Trejo Foster Foundation for Hispanic Library Education (TFF) which has sponsored national institutes for library education to serve the information needs of Latinos. The TFF was formed as a ‚Äúthink-tank‚Äù to address issues concerning library and information science education. Under the aegis of the TFF Institutes on Hispanic Library Education have engaged the faculties of library and information studies throughout the nation in planning, preparation and implementation. Dr. Trejo's astute recognition that he must ignite passion for service to the Spanish- speaking in all regions of the United States through the Institutes resulted in the first five Institutes. *I.

Dr. Trejo's message inviting librarians to the 5th TFF Institute in Wisconsin in 2001 was a clear and strong reminder that the work is far from done: : :\\"According to the U.S. News and World Report (March 19, 2001): ‚ÄúThe number of Hispanics here today is greater than the entire population of Canada.‚Äù Yet the number of Hispanic librarians is less than two thousand. This includes librarians from Puerto Rico. The dire need of Latino Librarians is a national, serious problem. : :This and related problems will be addressed at the 5th National Trejo Foster Institute of Hispanic Education. I personally wish to invite you to this event. You, meaning librarians, students and faculty in schools of library and information science as well as library assistants who are working in libraries with a large representation of Spanish-speaking patrons. : :Favor de asistir a este evento, todas aqu√©llas personas que est√©n interesadas en la tarea de incrementar el n√∫mero de bibliotecarios Latinos en este pa√≠s.

The film was produced by Monogram Pictures, and was typical of its B films churned out by the Pine-Thomas team. Along with flying scenes, the use of zany characters and slapstick efforts were juxtaposed with a spy and zombie story.Weaver 1993, pp. 36-45. Plot In 1941, a Capelis XC-12 transport aircraft flown by pilot James \\"Mac\\" McCarthy (Dick Purcell) flying between Cuba and Puerto Rico runs low on fuel and is blown off course by a storm. McCarthy, unable to pick up any radio transmissions over the Caribbean, hears by a faint radio signal. After crash-landing on a remote island, his passenger Bill Summers (John Archer) and his black manservant/valet, Jefferson Jackson (Mantan Moreland) take refuge in a mansion owned by Dr. Miklos Sangre (Henry Victor) and his wife Alyce (Patricia Stacey). The quick-witted yet easily frightened manservant soon becomes convinced the mansion is haunted by zombies, and confirms this with some of the doctor's hired help. With the help of Barbara Winslow (Joan Woodbury), the stranded group begins to find out what mysterious events are taking place in the mansion. Exploring, the group stumbles upon a voodoo ritual in the cellar. It is being conducted by the doctor, who is in reality a foreign spy, trying to acquire war intelligence from a captured US Admiral whose aircraft had crashed in a similar fashion on the island. McCarthy comes under the doctor's spell but Summers comes to his aid. Information is being transmitted to Barbara, but Summers stops the ritual. The interruption causes the zombies to turn on their master. Sangre shoots the pilot but falls into a firepit and dies. With Sangre dead, all the zombies are released from the doctor's spell.

He played college football at Ohio State University. Early years Wiley attended Monte Vista High School, where as a senior he ran for 1,901 yards and 23 touchdowns, en route to being named a high school All- America and ranking as the country's No. 2 running back prospect according to Bluechip Illustrated. He finished his high school career with 3,417 rushing yards and 38 touchdowns. He also practiced track and basketball. He accepted a football scholarship from Ohio State University. Although he never played the position before, as a true freshman he appeared in 8 games as a backup wide receiver and was also a reserve at running back in 4 games, registering 23 carries for 176 yards and 6 receptions for 194 yards. He scored touchdowns the first three times he touched the ball as a collegian, while playing against Rice University in 1996 (a 49-yard reverse run and receptions of 51 and 60 yards). As a sophomore, he had 588 rushing yards, a 5.6-yard average and 6 touchdowns. He also had a 26.6-yard average in kickoff returns, including a 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown against Bowling Green State University. He rushed for 121 yards against the University of Wyoming and had an 8-yard touchdown pass against Indiana University. As a junior, he earned the starter tailback job, rushing for 1,258 yards (second in the conference) on 198 carries for a 6.2-yard average and 10 touchdowns. He also had 26 receptions (third on the team) for 200 yards and 6 kickoffs returns for a 23.8-yard average. He had a 209-yard rushing performance (10th best in school history) in a win over the University of Missouri. The team finished 11-1 and beat Texas A&M; University in the Sugar Bowl. As a senior, he posted 183 carries for 952 rushing yards (led the team) and 10 touchdowns. He also completed all 5 of his passing attempts for 123 yards and one touchdown, while adding 14 catches (third on the team) for 153 yards and one touchdown. He was the team's all-purpose yardage leader with an average of 101.6 yards-per-game. Though he was only a two-year starter (22 starts), he finished a distinguished playing career after recording 2,951 rushing yards (509 attempts), 3,176 total offense yards, 4,194 all-purpose yards, ten 100-yard games, 56 receptions and 35 touchdowns. He also completed 10-of-11 career passing attempts for 225 yards and 2 touchdowns. Professional career Wiley was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fifth round (144th overall) of the 2000 NFL Draft. Because of his versatility, he was selected with the plan of converting him into a slot wide receiver. The experiment didn't last long and he was named the third-string running back in the latter part of the season, after the release of Chris Warren. In his second season, he was involved 30 times on third down and picked up a first down on 14 of those chances (46.7% conversion rate). He finished with 34 carries for 247 rushing yards (7.3 avg.) and 16 receptions for 99 yards and one touchdown. During his NFL career, he battled with injuries at different times. In 2003, after the Cowboys hired new head coach Bill Parcells, Wiley missed valuable preseason time with a rotator cuff injury and was waived on August 25. Personal life Since his retirement from professional football, Wiley has been active in the Ohio Democratic Party. He also has two kids, a daughter, and a son.

In a career spanning four decades, he played mostly character roles, starting with the 1941 film Naya Sansar, and went on to act in over 110 films, including memorable films such as Gol Maal (1979), Baton Baton Mein (1979) and Boot Polish (1954), for which he was awarded the 1955 Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award. Early life David graduated from the University of Mumbai with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1930. After a six-year unsuccessful struggle to land himself a job, he decided to try his luck in the Hindi film industry by becoming a professional actor. During these years of struggle, he also managed to obtain a degree in law from the Government Law College. Finally, on 15 January 1937, with the help of his close friend Nayampalli, a veteran character actor, he landed his first role in a movie. The movie was Zambo, and it was being produced and directed by Mohan Bhavnani, who was the Chief Producer of the Films Division of the Government of India.. He was born into a Indo-Israeli parents from Ashdod. Career David was actively associated with IPTA, a theatre organization, and went on to be part of many Khwaja Ahmad Abbas's films, including Palme d'Or nominee Pardesi (1957), and Shehar Aur Sapna (1963), which won the 1964 National Film Award for Best Feature Film, Munaa and Char Dil Char Raahein. Strongly associated with avuncular roles, David is best known for his portrayal of \\"John Chacha\\" Vail, p. 118 in the 1954 hit and Filmfare Award for Best Film winner and Palme d'Or nominee, Boot Polish, directed by Prakash Arora, for which he won the 1955 Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award.List of Filmfare Award Winners and Nominations, 1953-2005 The song \\"Nanhe Munne Bachche\\" from the film, picturized on him became a memorable song of that era. In his prime, in the period 1959 to 1975, David was one of the best and the most well-known anchor, compere and the host of the prominent award shows and other functions. In one of the speeches of Jawaharlal Nehru, the prime minister, said that any of the events will be surely be incomplete without David's speech. He was involved in promoting sports,Vail, p. 120 and later became India's Olympic Games representative. He was awarded the Padma Shri award in 1969 by the Government of India. Often billed as simply David or Uncle David, Cheulkar appeared in more than 110 Bollywood films in a career that exceeded four decades, many of them indeed as a kindly, avuncular character. Among his more notable performances were his roles in Boot Polish (1954), in which he played John Chacha, a kindly bootlegger who, before he is sent off to jail, takes two orphan siblings under his wing and teaches them to work for a living shining shoes, rather than to get by begging. Cheulkar received the Filmfare magazine best supporting actor prize for that role. He was also featured in Pardesi (Journey Beyond Three Seas), a 1957 Russian-Indian coproduction taking place in the 1400s; The City and the Dream (Shehar Aur Sapna, in Hindi), a naturalistic urban drama from 1963, that was nominated for Indias National Film Award as best feature, and the romantic comedy Chupke Chupke from 1975 (from minute 1 to minute 2 of clip). In the 1969 film Satyakam, Cheulkar was given the opportunity to play against type, taking the role of Rustom, a debauched drunkard who serves as a foil to the hero of the film, a family drama that takes place during the final days of British rule in India, in 1947. According to Bentsion Abraham Chewoolkar, who wrote an essay about his relation Uncle David, on the centenary of the latters birth, Cheulkar, though not religiously devout, prayed briefly each day, and always observed Yom Kippur by fasting and by visiting synagogue for the Neilah service.  Personal life  He never married.  Death  He died on 28 December 1981 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada of a heart attack at the age of 73.

The activists blocked the railroad tracks that would have brought the acid to a mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The action brought national scrutiny on the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and demonstrated the power of Indigenous rights in environmentalism. Background Copper Range Mine Company's copper mine in White Pine, Michigan, had been an employer of thousands in the Upper Peninsula until massive layoffs in the early 1990s that put the region into economic despair. In Wisconsin, several Ojibwe bands were battling to stop sulfide mining at the proposed Crandon mine with newfound political power stemming from the Walleye War. In 1995 two Bad River tribal members, Lawrence \\"Butch\\" Stone and Alan \\"Buster\\" Couture, began having dreams that an environmental disaster was coming to the Bad River Reservation. While taking part in traditional sweats, Stone and Couture, among others who would form the Anishinabe Ogichidaa activist group, began receiving messages through dreams and visions from Native American spirits and ancestors. The messages began a year before the EPA published an announcement that sulfide would be moved by rail over the reservation on Wisconsin Central Railroad tracks. In their dreams, Stone and Couture saw a train derail while crossing the Bad River Reservation, spilling a white powder into the river. The white powder caused disease and death of animals, plants and people, including the destruction of the sacred wild rice sloughs on the reservation at the delta where the Bad River meets Lake Superior. These sloughs had been the reason the Ojibwe settled in northern Wisconsin during their migration from the east coast four hundred years earlier. In that migration, the Ojibwe had, following a prophecy, followed a miigis (cowry) shell to a place where \\"food grows on water,\\" a prophecy held to be fulfilled when they reached the wild rice waters of Wisconsin. History Neither Stone nor Couture knew what the white powder in their dreams was until the EPA's announcement of the sulfide shipment. The Anishinabe Ogichidaa activists made a point of carrying out the blockade in a way that was consistent with their beliefs. They had prepared throughout the prior year with sweats and prayer. Before blockading the tracks, they and other Ogichidaa members consulted with spiritual leaders and tribal elders. On arriving at the tracks to begin the blockade, they prayed, and then laid out sacred ground in a way specified by spiritual leaders, to add strength to their actions, including a sacred fire near the tracks, singing and drum sessions on the tracks, tobacco placed in the four directions and eagle feather lances in the four directions on and near the tracks. Before the blockade Stone and Couture vowed to Gichi Manidoo (Great Spirit) that they would be willing to sacrifice their lives if need be to stop the train from going through. On July 22, 1996, the activists stopped a train bound for the copper mine as it crossed the reservation. The train was carrying tankers of sulfuric acid for use in pilot solution mining. The mine had drastically scaled back operations and laid off thousands the previous year due to its diminishing profits. Inmet, a Toronto-based corporation, hoped to inject of acid into the mine to bring out any remaining ore. This plan raised concerns among environmentalists that the acid would contaminate groundwater and nearby Lake Superior. The EPA granted permission for the experiment without requiring a hearing or an environmental impact statement. Among those astounded by this decision was Walter Bresette, a Red Cliff Ojibwe activist and Indigenous chair of the EPA'S National Environmental Justice Advisory Council. Bresette resigned his position and joined with the Native rights group Anishinabe Ogichidaa, Ojibwe for \\"Protector of the People,\\" on a new course of action.Grossman, Zolt√°n C. 2002. \\"Unlikely Alliances: Treaty Conflicts and Environmental Cooperation Between Native American and Rural White Communities,\\" p.396. Ph.D. dissertation: University of Wisconsin‚ÄîMadison. For weeks, Ogichidaa and white allies camped on the railroad tracks conducting ceremonies and protests. Initially, the focus was put on the condition of the Wisconsin Central Ltd. tracks themselves. The activists insisted they were unsafe, though the state had authorized their use provided the speed of the trains did not exceed ten miles per hour. Wisconsin Central insisted that the Ashland County sheriff arrest the protestors, but with the events taking place on the reservation and involving Native religious practices, the sheriff's office declared it a treaty issue and federal matter and therefore took no action. The protesters, in the meantime, also demanded to see the reports stating the railroad was safe to be used for hazardous materials. The United States government made a failed attempt at mediating between the two groups involved; as a result of these attempted mediations, the US government launched a full investigation of the railroad. Following the beginning of this investigation, protestors allowed two trains that did not contain sulfuric acid through to their destination. On August 19, the protest formally ended, the Ojibwe allowing all trains not containing sulfuric acid through to their destination. There were two instances when the blockade nearly turned violent. The first involved a representative of the Wisconsin Central Railroad, a \\"troubleshooter\\" who was experienced in dealing with aboriginal conflicts throughout the world using strong-arm tactics. He approached the Ashland County Sheriff's Department and offered to make their problem go away if the Department would look the other way. Sheriff's Department representatives made it clear to the troubleshooter that such tactics would not be used in Ashland County. The second crisis point occurred when the Ashland County Sheriff's Department went to the blockade site in force, ostensibly to review the situation and determine what, if anything, needed to be done, including the option of removing the protestors from the tracks. Approximately a dozen armed Sheriff's Department members went to the site. The sheriff spoke with protest leaders. While this went on, Stone pulled the undersheriff aside and advised him that there were armed men in the woods protecting the site, including tribal members with military training, and that if the Sheriff's Department tried to forcibly remove the protestors from the site, Stone might not able to prevent gunfire. The Sheriff's Department representatives left without taking action. After federal involvement, it came out that the Ojibwe were not only concerned with the safety of the tracks but with the mining project as a whole. On August 2, 1996, Justice Department mediator John Terronez arrived on the scene and began negotiations with parties involved in the dispute. During these talks, Bresette and the Ogichidaa revealed their deep concerns over the solution mining and its potential effect on Lake Superior. Furthermore, they insisted the project was illegal because the EPA had given it approval without consulting affected Indian tribes who as sovereign entities were entitled to be involved in the process. An agreement was reached with the protestors agreeing to end the blockade in exchange for an EPA inquiry into the project. In September, the EPA announced they would be holding a meeting regarding this potential mining project, and were in favor of the mining. The trains hauled the acid through the reservation and the protestors switched their focus to the mine itself. However, once the EPA looked closer, it raised enough questions that, on October 14, Inmet suspended its operations, citing the extended amount of time the EPA's Environmental Analysis would take, and the uncertain future of the mine. In the face of legal battles over treaty rights, the company withdrew its mining permit application the next spring. Following its additional research, the EPA was able to announce with certainty that the railroads in Wisconsin were up to their standards, but the sulfuric acid shipments had already been discontinued. The railroad branch remained in occasional operation until at least 2011 but was embargoed in 2012 due to structural issues on a bridge. As of 2016 the only parent line serving the branch is also out of service following a bridge collapse in a flood.

C. Williamson Gilbert & Sullivan Opera Company in Australia the 1930s and 1940s. Menzies married a D'Oyly Carte principal soprano, Elsie Griffin, but he left her repeatedly to go on extensive tours in Australia and New Zealand. Later, Menzies became a leader of the Moral Re-Armament movement in Australia and Britain, and he continued to perform on stage until 1962. Life and career Ivan Menzies was born in Bristol, England, the son of a Lake District doctor. He served on the Western Front in World War I before shattering his right arm and thigh in the Battle of the Somme on 8 August 1916.Magor, p. 9 He served in King's Own. In 2014 a love letter came to light that was sent to him, on Valentine's Day in 1916, as preparations were under way for the Battle of the Somme.

In 1923, Menzies added the role of Major Murgatroyd in Patience to his regular repertory.Stone, David. \\"J. Ivan Menzies\\". Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 27 February 2003, accessed 6 November 2010 The same year, over the protests of her family, Menzies married D'Oyly Carte soprano star Elsie Griffin. They had one daughter, Mahala.Magor, pp. 10‚Äì15 During these early seasons, Menzies understudied Henry Lytton, Leo Sheffield and other principal comedians of the company and appeared occasionally in the leading comedy roles of the Learned Judge in Trial, Major General Stanley in The Pirates of Penzance, the Lord Chancellor in Iolanthe, Jack Point in Yeomen, and the Duke of Plaza-Toro in The Gondoliers. Menzies related that \\"The first time I played the Duke of Plaza-Toro, I started by catching my spurs and falling into the canal. It was decidedly not traditional.\\"Ayre, p. 213 In the secondary touring company, Menzies became the principal comedian in 1925, playing Reginald Bunthorne in Patience, Lord Chancellor, Ko-Ko in The Mikado, Robin Oakapple in Ruddigore, Major General Stanley and the Duke of Plaza Toro. In 1927, with the closing of the secondary touring company, Menzies left D'Oyly Carte.

Williams persuaded Menzies to join the movement, and he resolved to change his life, adopting the group's so-called four absolutes: honesty, purity, unselfishness and love. He aggressively proselytized for the movement by giving lectures, when not performing onstage. When he returned for another Australian tour, he insultingly said that God had called him \\"to pioneer in a country that had never known a major spiritual awakening\\".Magor, passim In September 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, the British government ordered all theatres to close. Rupert D'Oyly Carte cancelled the company's autumn tour and terminated the contracts of his performers.

Menzies appeared as Sir Joseph, General Stanley, the Lord Chancellor, Ko-Ko, and (occasionally) the Duke of Plaza Toro, before leaving the company in February 1940. He was in Australia and New Zealand again as principal comedian in the J. C. Williamson G&S; tours in 1941, 1944, 1949, and 1951. =Later years= Later, Menzies and Griffin (who never divorced) appeared in the Moral Re-Armament musical, The Vanishing Island, in which they toured around the world from 1955 until 1957. In 1962, Griffin's singing career was ended by a throat operation; Menzies had a heart attack the same year. They spent most of their remaining years living quietly in the London suburb of Barnes, although they continued to participate in Moral Re-Armament activities.Magor, p. 106 In 1975, during the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's centennial season, Menzies was invited to participate in the final performance of Trial by Jury, in which the company's regular chorus was augmented by fourteen former stars of the company.The Savoyard, Vol. 14, No. 2, September 1975 Menzies died in Blackheath, London at the age of 89.

Synopsis Two kings, Peridor and Diamantino, were cousins and neighbors, and the fairies protected them, until Diamantino behave so badly to his wife Aglantino that they would not let him live. His daughter Serpentine was his heiress, but as she was a baby, Aglantino became regent. Peridor loved his wife, but was so thoughtless that for punishment, the fairies let his wife die; his only comfort was his son, Saphir. The fairies put a mirror into Saphir's bedroom, and it showed not his own face, but a beautiful girl. He fell in love. After a year, he saw she had a like mirror, and though he could not see the man reflected in it, he became jealous. His father had grown more grief-stricken with time, until it was feared he would die. A gorgeous bird appeared at his window one day, and he felt well again, but the bird vanished. He offered a great reward, but no one could find it. Saphir set out in quest. In the forest, while thirsty, he came on a fountain and took out a cup to drink, but a little green frog kept jumping in his cup. It told him to drink and then to talk with it, because it knew of the bird. It directed him to a castle, and told him to put a grain of sand in front of its gates. This would put everyone to sleep. He should go straight to the stable and take the horse. He obeyed until he reached the horse, when he thought it should have a harness as well, but when he laid hands on it, everyone woke. The lord took a fancy to him and let him go, and he returned to the frog. After he convinced it of his regret, it sent him back with a grain of gold, and told him to find a room and take off a maiden there, without heed to her resistance. He obeyed until she asked to put on a dress first; this woke them all, and only by the fairies' intervention was he freed. The frog sent him back with a grain of diamond and told him to find the garden, and cut off the branch with the bird he sought on it. This time he obeyed, and when he returned, he found a little rustic palace, with the maiden he had seen in the mirror. She told him that she had long admired him but never dreamed that he could see her. She told him that she had been the frog; that her name was Serpentine, and she knew nothing else of her family; and that fairies had raised her. She refused to marry him because he was a prince and she could not name her family. A fairy arrived, to tell them the truth, and bring Aglantino to them; then she carried them to Peridor's castle. The bird proved to be Constance, and Saphir and Serpentine were married. Analysis This is a standard medieval style fairy tale, complete with royalty, benevolent fairies, frogs (a symbol of disgust also used in The Frog Prince), and castles. =Gem analysis= The gem analysis points out the recurring themes of precious gems and the use of gemology and mineralogy to make points. The names reflecting peridot and sapphire are purely for effect, but serpentine is unusual as it is dark, not a gemstone or particularly valued, and it is associated with serpents. The connection may be to prime readers for the amphibian transformation, as to children both frogs and snakes are considered slimy, disgusting 'creepy crawlies'. Going up in value, sand we all know to be worthless, and gold is not a gemstone, so the diamond will obviously work (also making it that three is magic, an old belief common to fairy tales). That Serpentine's royal father's name means diamond is linking her proven royal heritage with the stone, as they are in the story, chronologically. =The \\"gorgeous bird\\"= The place of the mysterious bird, Constance, is unclear and seems to reflect another mythology or a related tale. It does not seem to fit as a fairy or a gem, but fits the magical setting. Under this lens, the tale is parallel to other European fairy tales classified as Aarne-Thompson-Uther ATU 550, \\"The Quest for the Golden Bird\\", as pointed by folklorists Johannes Bolte and Jiri Polivka.Bolte, Johannes; Pol√≠vka, Jiri.

Ford's first car was a simple frame with a gas-powered engine and four bicycle wheels mounted on it. The earliest cars were hand built, one by one, and very expensive. The peculiar machines were seen as toys for the rich. In the 1890s, the \\"horseless carriage\\" was a relatively new idea, with no one having a fixed, universal idea of what a car should look like or how it should work. Most of the first car builders were inventors, rather than businessmen, working with their imaginations and the parts they had on hand. Thus, the invention of the Quadricycle marks an important innovation as a proto- automobile that would lay the foundation for the future, with more practical designs to follow.

Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877‚Äì1925 (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.58. where the Michigan Building now stands, Ford put the finishing touches on his pure ethanol-powered motor. After more than two years of experimentation, Ford, at the age of 32, had completed his first experimental automobile. He dubbed his creation the \\"Quadricycle,\\" so named because it ran on four bicycle tires, and because of the means through which the engine drove the back wheels.Brinkley, David, Wheels for the World: Henry Ford, His Company, and a Century of Progress, (New York: Penguin Group, 2003), p.22 The success of the little vehicle led to the founding of the Henry Ford Company and then later the Ford Motor Company in 1903.The Showroom of Automotive History: 1896 Quadricycle The two cylinder engine could produce 4 horsepower.1896 Ford Quadricycle RemarkableCars.com The Quadricycle was driven by a chain.

AOL did not identify users in the report, but personally identifiable information was present in many of the queries. This allowed some users to be identified by their search queries, prominently a woman named Thelma Arnold.  Overview  On August 4, 2006, AOL Research, headed by Dr. Abdur Chowdhury, released a compressed text file on one of its websites containing twenty million search keywords for over 650,000 users over a 3-month period intended for research purposes. AOL deleted the search data on their site by August 7, but not before it had been mirrored and distributed on the Internet. AOL did not identify users in the report; however, personally identifiable information was present in many of the queries. As the queries were attributed by AOL to particular user numerically identified accounts, an individual could be identified and matched to their account and search history by such information. The New York Times was able to locate an individual from the released and anonymized search records by cross referencing them with phonebook listings. Consequently, the ethical implications of using this data for research are under debate. AOL acknowledged it was a mistake and removed the data; however, the removal was too late. The data was redistributed by others and can still be downloaded from mirror sites. In January 2007, Business 2.0 Magazine on CNNMoney ranked the release of the search data #57 in a segment called \\"101 Dumbest Moments in Business.\\" Lawsuits In September 2006, a class action lawsuit was filed against AOL in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Notable users Although the searchers were only identified by a numeric ID, some people's search results have become notable for various reasons. =Thelma Arnold= Through clues revealed in the search queries, The New York Times successfully uncovered the identities of several searchers. With her permission, they exposed user #4417749 as Thelma Arnold, a 62-year-old widow from Lilburn, Georgia. This privacy breach was widely reported, and led to the resignation of AOL's CTO, Maureen Govern, on August 21, 2006. The media quoted an insider as saying that two employees had been fired: the researcher who released the data, and his immediate supervisor, who reported to Govern.AOL executive quits after posting of search data ‚Äì International Herald Tribune =User 927= One product of the AOL scandal was the proliferation of blog entries examining the exposed data. Certain users' search logs were identified as humorous, disturbing, or dangerous. Consumer watchdog website The Consumerist posted a blog entry by editor Ben Popken identifying the anonymous user number 927AOL user #927 as having an especially bizarre and macabre search history, with some search terms relating to child pornography and zoophilia. The blog posting has since been viewed nearly 4,000 times and referenced on a number of other high- profile sites. In addition to sparking the interest of the Internet community, User 927 inspired a theatrical production, written by Katharine Clark Gray in Philadelphia. The play, also named User 927, has since been cited on several of the same blogs that originally discovered the real user's existence. As time has passed, more artistic renderings of individual user logs have appeared. A series of movies on the web site Minimovies called I Love Alaska puts voice and imagery to User 711391 which the authors have labeled as \\"an episodic documentary\\".

It blends southern Vietnamese folk songs, classical music, h√°t tu·ªìng (a classical theatre form based on Chinese opera), and modern spoken drama. History and description C·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng originated in Southern Vietnam in the early 20th century and blossomed in the 1930s as a theatre of the middle class during the country's French colonial period. C·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng is now promoted as a national theatrical form. Unlike the other folk forms, it continued to prove popular with the masses as late as the 1970s and the 1980s, although it is now in decline. Mekong Delta nostalgic for cai luong‚Äôs golden days. 21 July 2007 Beyond remedy for Cai luong. VietNamNet Bridge. 21 August 2008 C·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng can be compared to a sort of play with the added aspect of V·ªçng c·ªï. This term literally means \\"nostalgia for the past\\", it is a special type of singing with the background music often being the ƒë√†n tranh zither or the ƒë√†n ghi-ta (Vietnamized guitar). In a typical c·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng play, the actresses and actors would use a combination of regular spoken dialogue and v·ªçng c·ªï to express their thoughts and emotions. C·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng normally highlights/praises Vietnamese moral values. There are mainly two types of c·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng: c·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng tu·ªìng c·ªï (ancient) and c·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng x√£ h·ªôi (modern). Art gallery with musical instruments for C·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng C·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng x√£ h·ªôi (\\"society reformed theater\\" ÊîπËâØÁ§æÊúÉ) consists of stories about modern Vietnamese society. The plots deal with a romantic love story blended with family or social relationships. The stories also explore cultural norms, social norms, and other aspects of Vietnamese society, e.g. ƒê·ªùi C√¥ L·ª±u, T√¥ √Ånh Nguy·ªát. This type can be somehow described as tragedy, but with a happy ending. However, a few c·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng x√£ h·ªôi such as \\"Ra Gi√™ng Anh C∆∞·ªõi Em\\" are comedic and light. In C·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng tu·ªìng c·ªï, The actor/actress dresses in an old fashioned costume. The plot is based on a tale, legend or historical story of the feudal system, where kings and warriors still existed. For example, B√™n C·∫ßu D·ªát L·ª•a, L·ª•c V√¢n Ti√™n, Ti·∫øng Tr·ªëng M√™ Linh etc. Many plots come from Chinese historic or ancient legends. L∆∞∆°ng S∆°n B√°-Ch√∫c Anh ƒê√†i is based on the Chinese legend of butterfly lovers. In C·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng tu·ªìng c·ªï, H·ªì Qu·∫£ng a kind of Chinese opera may be mixed. Hence, some C·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng tu·ªìng c·ªï may be called C·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng H·ªì Qu·∫£ng, which is more like a musical. In addition to regular speech, ca c·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng, and V·ªçng c·ªï, several melodies are incorporated into the play . These melodies are reused through different plays, however the words are changed to fit the context of the plays. C·∫£i l∆∞∆°ng tu·ªìng c·ªï can be characterized by beautiful, elaborate costumes comprising beautiful and colorful dress pieces; large, beautiful glittery hairpieces; elaborate warrior armor; and elaborate warrior head pieces.

It is situated on the Karelian Isthmus northwest of St. Petersburg, approximately halfway to Vyborg. Population: In the wooded areas surrounding Roshchino there are multiple marshes and small lakes. Lintula larch forest is located some to the west from the railroad station. History Raivola was first shown on maps of Finland in the 16th century.. (in proceedings of 1999's conference, Cf below) After 1812 it was under jurisdiction of Grand Duchy of Finland being part of Russian Empire, a part of Viipuri Province. The mixed Russian-Finnish population of the area was engaged in agriculture. Around 1802 count Saltykov resettled some 609 of his subjects from Oryol Governorate to the area to meet growing manpower demands for his iron works; in addition to the iron foundry maps of mid-19th century show also sawmill. After the railroad to Helsinki was opened by czar Alexander II in 1870, Raivola was used for changing of locomotive crews. Establishment of the railroad station turned Raivola into a suburb of St. Petersburg and development of the area continued with construction of summer cottages. By the end of the century the population stood around 2,000, of which 169 were Finns. The village had shops, warehouses, two (Finnish and Russian) schools, and Russian Orthodox church of St. Nicholas with a library and medical facility. Also a hydro-electric power station and a telephone station were established. The importance of the local railway station was eclipsed by Terijoki where Finnish customs depot was established in 1911 . (Ibid) In the first quarter of the 20th century Raivola was a summer home (and after 1914 the permanent home) to the Finnish-Swedish family of the young modernist poet Edith S√∂dergran who died there in 1923. After the Russian October Revolution and independence of Finland, Raivola was recognized as part of Finnish Karelia by articles of the Treaty of Tartu in 1920, while the majority of Russian inhabitants had left. The Soviet Union gained control of Raivola following the Winter War in 1940. The Soviet government's decree of May 28, 1940 provided for establishment of collective farms and resettlement of Russians from Yaroslavl Oblast. Plans of Stalin's government also included forced population transfer of native Finns (116 people, mostly sick and elderly) . (Ibid) to Kazakhstan however were disrupted by the Nazi invasion. Finland has joined hostilities hoping to reverse losses of 1940 but as result of the war the USSR regained Raivola by Paris Peace Treaties, 1947. On May 16, 1940 Kannelyarvsky District with the administrative center in the selo of Kannelj√§rvi was established. It was a part of Leningrad Oblast. On August 22, 1945 the district center was moved from Kannelyarvi to Raivola, and the district was renamed Rayvolovsky. On October 1, 1948 the district was renamed Roshchinsky, and on January 12, 1949 all Finnish names of the localities were replaced with Russian names. In particular, Rayvola was renamed Roshchino. On July 31, 1959 Roshchino was granted urban-type settlement status. On February 1, 1963 Roshchinsky District was abolished and merged into Vyborgsky District. In 1948, the village again became a Leningrad suburb (the railroad was electrified in 1954) with seasonal swelling of population due to widespread construction of summer cottages, development of privately owned and leased garden plots, establishment of recreational facilities, and youth summer camps. Lintula Larch Forest The Lintula Larch Forest (, Korabelnaya roshcha, lit. shipbuilding timber grove, or –õ–∏–Ω–¥—É–ª–æ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –ª–∏—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∏—á–Ω–∞—è —Ä–æ—â–∞; ) had a major impact on the cultivation of larch throughout the world and is considered one of the most important cultivated forests in northern Europe.Redko, Georgi and Eino M√§lk√∂nen (2005). The Lintula Larch Forest. Scandinavian Journal of Forest Research 20.3, 252-282. It was established by order of Peter the Great to supply the Russian Navy with shipbuilding timber. Ferdinand Gabriel Fockel, a German forest expert, established the oldest stands in 1738-1750 with seedlings of European Larch (Larix decidua) from the province of Arkhangelsk. Since then the area of the forest has expanded and currently the total area of larch is 55.9 ha (23.5 ha of the 'old stands' established before 1851 still remain). A street in Roshchino Possible origins of name *Two versions explaining the origins of the name Raivola exist: one using Finnish verb raivata, which means \\"to clean\\" or \\"to grub out\\", and second deriving from the adjective raivo--\\"mad\\", possibly alluding to the riding style of Russian coachmen, settled here in time of Peter the Great. The latter version is less likely since the coach station and adjacent residences were located not in Raivola but in neighboring Kivennapa. *Name Roshchino used after 1948 is derived from \\"\\" (roshcha, meaning \\"grove\\") referring to the Lintula larch grove. Economy =Transportation= Roshchino railway station is located on the railway line between Saint Petersburg and Vyborg. There is suburban service to the Finland Station in Saint Petersburg. Roshchino is adjacent to Zelenogorsk and is thus a suburb of Saint Petersburg. It is included in the suburban road network of Saint Petersburg.

Midland S.S. was constructed in 1961 and opened its doors in September 4, 1962 under its first principal James Hamilton as Scarborough's eighth collegiate and the first composite secondary school. Aside from Cedarbrae Secondary School as the first trade-academic institution, Midland Avenue Secondary opened for students in the area who attended many secondary schools surrounding it such as King, Churchill, Porter and Thomson Collegiates. The school was officially opened on December 11, 1962. By 1965, Midland Avenue Secondary was itself renamed to Midland Avenue Collegiate Institute. The school's original facilities consisted of 30 standard classrooms, art, music, 5 science lab., library, 2 industrial arts, 2 home economics, 3 typing rooms, a 918-seated auditorium, 3 gymnasiums, cafeteria and business machines room. The sections of the original building such as the commercial and technical wing was erected in 1963, followed by the addition of 11 classrooms along with the swimming pool built in 1964http://www.metropolicyarchive.ca/wp- content/uploads/2017/04/HSS-1146450-1963D_MSBT-Minutes-1963.pdf and the library in 1974. =Decline= During the 1980s, Midland experienced declining enrollment due to demographic changes in the Toronto area. The school body had also undergone a demographic shift from an influx of new immigration to the nearby area since the early 1990s. This was accompanied and complicated by a drop in attendance from students who lived in the area, who starting in the mid-1980s chose to go other schools in the area In 1988, Midland was risking closure as hundreds of students, parents and teachers jammed the meeting in protest. Trustees were scrambling to find a place to put Scarborough Centre for Alternative Studies to that location (see below)Daly, Rita. \\"Scarborough centre for adult learning needs new home.\\" Toronto Star.

The reason given was that enrolment at Midland was declining as projections up to 1996 showed that about 740 students attended the school.Daly, Rita \\"Board backs off as hundreds protest threatened closing of high school\\" Toronto Star.

The province defunded the adult day school at Midland Avenue in 1999, causing it to stop operating. The time capsule was opened by Nadine Segal, the principal, in 2000. =Closure= When Scarborough became a part of Toronto in 1998, the Scarborough Board of Education became part of the new, but one of the largest boards on the continent, the Toronto District School Board. Changes in the new funding structure caused the creation of a short-list of 138 schools in Toronto proposed to be closed. The list was a reaction to a creation of a funding formula based on students per square footage of the school, which prompted debate over the issue rather than the actual closure of the schools. Since the physical building was large with a good state of repair, and the population was smaller, it was placed high on the list. This ultimately became justification for closing the school. The closing can be ultimately summed up due to a School Trustee who did not support the teachers and residents' wishes, a lack of civic participation, and a lack of knowledge and participation of new immigrants. According to principal Nadine Seagal, the TDSB argued that since Midland Avenue was under- utilized, with only 650 students in the campus that can hold up to 1,358 students, it should be closed. Staff and students advocated for the school to remain open.Talaga, Tanya. \\"Why us? Midland students ask ; High school can fit 1,358 students but has only 650.\\" 'Toronto Star. April 27, 1999.

The Midland Avenue C.I. attendance area was then reassigned to David and Mary Thomson Collegiate Institute, R. H. King Academy, Winston Churchill Collegiate Institute, W. A. Porter Collegiate Institute and Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute. =Since 2000= Following the closure, in 2001, Midland operated for quite a number of years as the Bond Education Group, a private school leasing the facility from the Toronto District School Board. While public tax dollars goes to education and upkeep of local schools, the public is generally unaware and not usually kept informed of what happens to public properties like school buildings, once a school is closed. While many might have thought the building was outright sold, it seems as if it was just leased to the Bond Education Group, possibly a ten-year lease. By the end of June 2010, Bond was relocated at 1500 Birchmount Rd. The Toronto District School Board reoccupied parts of building beginning in 2005, establishing South East Year Round Alternative Centre and Safe and Caring Schools Program Area C in the process with the Staff Development in the basement (later moved to Thomson Collegiate). In September 2010, the TDSB relocated Scarborough Centre for Alternative Studies, from its location at Centennial College to the building as Centennial expanded the teaching space by acquiring the latter site and Midland was originally to be the site of the new SCAS just more than 20 years prior.http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/691119/-10-8-million-budget-surplus- and-24-enrolment-growth-fuels-expansion-plans-at-centennial-college As of 2013, Midland currently leases the parts of the building to Not Your Average Day Carehttp://www.nyad.org/ and, since 2001, Olympia Swimming on the northwestern side of the building.http://www.olympianswimming.com/ Overview =Layout= Midland Avenue CI is a larger 225,191 sq. ft. facility built in a 13.2 acre land and typical of high schools built in the baby boom generation of the 1950s and 1960s. It included many modernist design features including five stairwells, a circular cafeteria that looked onto Midland Avenue, a two floor library with two seminar rooms, wide guidance area, larger atrium, and a larger auditorium with more than 928 seats in which this school boasted as one of the acoustic auditoriums in Ontario. Other features included 33 academic classrooms, four drafting rooms, two home economics rooms, one large lecture hall, four performing art rooms for music/dance/drama, two visual art rooms, five science labs, three gymnasia with the larger one that can be partitioned into two smaller gyms, swimming pool, and several tech programs consisting of hairstyling room, large multi- car automobile repair hangar/repair and carpentry/construction shops with four garage doors that most schools did not have. It also has the large athletic field as well the track and football/soccer fields with an attached hill. Portables were placed on that site for the surplus needs of students. The school is built in a hill-like structure with three floors such as the first floor and its halls shaped as a \\"C\\", the second/main floor, and the third floor also has its hallways \\"T\\"-shaped. The lockers were originally painted green and gold (save for the orange, beige, and olive green colors in the tech wing) but has since been repainted to shades of blue (ground floor), green (main floor) and teal (top floor). =Academics= Midland offered many academic resource opportunities for assistance and enrichment along with its ESL, co-op and transitional credit programs, leadership opportunities for all students, a strong music, visual arts and drama department and their excellent facilities to provide a broad based technology program. The school previously operated under the OS:IS curriculum before the OSS was issued in 1999. During its last years, the school's grade 9 program was non-semestered to allow for consolidation of basic skills. Midland Avenue had its SHSM in cosmetology. =Co-curricular Activities= The school offered many clubs and activities such as Student Administrative Council, MARS, Math League, Prefects, the Midland Avenue Athletic Council (MAAC), Peer Tutors, Band, Choir, and Drama Club. Midland was the first collegiate in Scarborough to have cricket in the 1960s. It then participated in the SSAAA and TDSSAA in basketball, baseball, softball, football, ice hockey, wrestling, track and field, cross country, gymnastics, soccer, and other sports.

Festivities and traditions Czech people celebrate Christmas every year, beginning with a dinner on December 24. The table is set for exactly how many people are going to dine, but there is also a tradition, that you should set one more place, in case a stranger arrives. - this is why everyone must stand up at the same time. The traditional dinner usually includes a potato salad and a carp (fish), but many people replace it with a chicken or pork snitzel. Easter, or \\"Velikonoce\\" (meaning \\"great nights\\"), is a very cheerful and lighthearted holiday in the Czech Republic. Red is a very commonly worn color during this time, because it symbolizes joy, health, happiness, and new life that comes with spring. Families decorate Easter eggs elaborately together. Another Easter tradition is the whipping of other's legs with the poml√°zka, which is a willow switch. Willow twigs are braided together and then are used by young boys to whip the girls' bottom usually 4x. This long-standing tradition is thought to bring health and youth to girls and women. The switch is called poml√°zka meaning \\"rejuvenator\\", implying that a female struck by a poml√°zka will become younger and prettier. 1 January is holiday New Year. After a late morning start the main meal of the day is prepared which should include pork for good luck and lentils for prosperity in the new year. It's bad luck to eat fish, your luck could swim away or poultry, your luck could fly away. January 6 is the Feast of the Three Kings. In many Czech and Slovak villages, boys dress up as the three wise men ‚ÄúKaspar, Balthazar and Melchior‚Äù. With a piece of chalk the boys write K + B + M (or K + M + B) above the doorways on houses, where people donate money for charity. This brings blessings on that home and its family for a year. The chalk letters should never be cleaned off, but only replaced the next year. This is also usually the day the Christmas tree is taken down. Food A Czech diet usually consists of much meat such as pork, beef, poultry, and many organ meats such as liver and kidneys. The meat is frequently prepared with gravy and then eaten with dumplings, cabbage or potatoes. Vegetables such as carrots, peas, and cabbage are consumed daily. They also really enjoy their sweets such as fruit dumplings, buchty (buns filled with jam or chocolate/pudding), kol√°ƒçe (small poppy seed cakes), and apple strudel. Music Music is the most popular form of art in the Czech Republic and there is even a saying, \\"Co ƒåech, to muzikant\\", which means \\"Every Czech is a musician\\". Theatre Literature Art The Czech Republic is known worldwide for their outstanding art glass and crystal. Each piece is individually made, mouth blown and decorated. Art glass collectors value glass made by master Czech glass blowers in the Bohemian region of the Czech Republic. One of the best Czech painters and decorative artists was Alphonse Mucha, mainly known for his cycle of 20 large canvases named The Slav Epic, which depicts the history of Czechs and other Slavic peoples.

Inspired by the life of Nashville guitarist Hank Garland, the movie was filmed from January 13 to February 12, 2005, in Los Angeles, California. Plot Crazy is the story of a legendary guitar player who emerged from Nashville in the 1950s. Blessed with incomparable, natural talent, Hank Garland quickly established his reputation as the finest sessions player in Nashville. Artists such as Roy Orbison, Patsy Cline, The Everly Brothers, and Elvis Presley all sought Hank‚Äôs brilliant playing for their recordings. Moving effortlessly from country, to rock-a-billy, to jazz, Hank was also quickly recognized by the likes of Dave Brubeck, Gary Burton, Joe Morello, and Joe Benjamin. The Nashville scene was a unique place in the 1950s ‚Äì dominated by a small group of executives and musicians who controlled the studios, labels and unions. Hank, in his arrogance and pursuit of musical excellence, often came into conflict with the business, social and racial culture he found both restrictive and frequently frustrating. Some people say that a near-fatal car accident, which Hank suffered, was a result of tragic response to dreams unfulfilled. Others will say that the subsequent electro- shock therapy, which was ordered by his doctors, may have contributed to ending Hank‚Äôs playing career at the age of thirty-one. Four years later his wife dies in her own car accident. Historians have questioned the accuracy some of the movie's points, noting that Garland was a member of Nashville's fabled \\"A-Team\\" of session players, with whom he socialized in the 1950s, and who rallied around him in the wake of his accident.

It is the only living member of the genus Zaedyus, and the only armadillo to hibernate. Description Pichi in Valdes Peninsula Pichis are relatively small armadillos, measuring approximately long, with a tail of about . Adults weigh anything from , and males may be slightly larger than females. The carapace varies from light yellow to near- black, and consists of heavy scapular and pelvic shields composed of rectangular osteoderms, and separated by six to eight movable bands. An additional \\"nuchal\\" band lies in front of the scapular shield, and there is also a triangular shield on top of the head, and further osteoderms along the tail. The underside of the animal has a coat of tan-coloured hair, which is thicker and longer in winter; there are also a few long hairs protruding through small holes near the posterior edge of some of the scales. Pichis have well-developed claws on all four feet. The ears are short, and the eyes dark and relatively small. Pichis have eight teeth on each side of the upper jaw, and nine on the lower. The absence of teeth on the premaxillary bone of the upper jaw is one of the features that allows them to be distinguished from other, similar, armadillos, such as the six-banded armadillo. Females have two teats, located in the chest region, and, like most armadillos, lack a true vagina, instead having a single urogenital sinus about in length. The male's penis is unusually long among mammals, being about 60% of the total body length. Pichi in the grass at Torres del Paine national park Distribution and habitat Pichis are found from central and southern Argentina (Patagonia), west to the Andean grasslands of Chile, and south to the Strait of Magellan. Within this region, it most commonly inhabits arid or semiarid steppe grasslands, but may be found in other environments if they have sandy soils suitable for burrowing. Subspecies  *Zaedyus pichiy caurinus Thomas, 1928 *Zaedyus pichiy pichiy Desmarest, 1804 Biology Pichis are omnivorous, with the largest part of their diet consisting of invertebrates such as beetles, ants, and scorpions, though they will also eat small mammals or lizards, as well as plant material and fungi. Despite living in arid environments, they are not thought to drink water in the wild. Common predators include crowned eagles, buzzard-eagles, foxes, and cougars. Pichis are the only armadillos known to hibernate. Like many hibernating animals, they build up considerable fat reserves before entering their winter burrows, where they remain from May to August. During hibernation, their body temperature drops from its normal value of about to just . In addition to true hibernation, they also enter a period of daily torpor, lasting up to four hours each night, during which they body temperature can drop to as low as . The breeding season lasts from spring to early summer, with the exact months depending on latitude. Females may be induced ovulators, and give birth to one or two young after a gestation period of 58 to 60 days, typically between October and January. The young are born with soft, pink skin with tiny osteoderms that begin to harden and turn more yellow after about two weeks. Newborn pichis weigh about , and put on an average of per day until weaning ends at about 40 days and they leave the burrow for the first time. Behaviour Pichi in Chubut Province (Argentina) Pichis are solitary and diurnal. They dig burrows in sandy soil, which they use for shelter from extremes of weather. The burrows have a dome-shaped entrance and a single passage that can reach several metres in length, before terminating in a bare, unlined, resting chamber. They do not inhabit their burrows for extended periods, digging new ones at least every few weeks, and sometimes daily. During the winter, when the weather is more extreme, the burrows may be deeper than they are in the summer, reaching as much as below ground. Pichis are solitary outside of the mating season. When threatened, they wedge themselves into their shallow burrow making it difficult for an attacker to drag them out because of their jagged scales, or else lie flat on the ground to protect their vulnerable belly. They have been reported to make both purring sounds and a loud grunt or scream. Conservation status The IUCN has rated the conservation status of Z. pichiy as near-threatened. It is hunted for subsistence and sport, despite being protected in both Argentina. The armadillo is eaten and used in local handicrafts. Cattle ranching poses a threat to its habitat. Some populations have also been impacted by an unknown disease.

(1969) is the ninth comedy album by Bill Cosby. It was his last for Warner Bros. Records. It was recorded live at Harrah's, Lake Tahoe, Nevada. Due to a musician's strike, Cosby got extra stage time at Harrah's, much of which was captured on this album. It features Cosby performing stand-up comedy on topics including women, helicopters, ants, burlesque, gambling, the toxic drug Spanish fly, and his travels to countries outside the United States. The album was released in 1969, and reached the 21st spot on the R&B; Albums chart, and was 37th on The Billboard 200 the same year. It was subsequently released in compact disc format in 2005, again in 2008, and in digital format in 2013. AllMusic gave the album three stars out of a possible five. The Colorado Springs Gazette placed it among Cosby's \\"Major Records\\". The album's 2005 re-release was favorably received by the Philadelphia Daily News which characterized it as part of the comedian's \\"glory days\\". The Deseret News called the album \\"very funny\\" and a \\"cause for celebration\\". The album received renewed attention in 2014 after numerous reports were publicized of multiple women who accused Cosby of sexual assault and rape. Many of their accounts asserted Cosby first drugged them prior to the assault. The Village Voice reported on the similarities between the stories by the women accusers and Cosby's \\"Spanish Fly\\" routine on the album where he recounted his desire to slip the drug into women's drinks. The album was not the last time Cosby had extolled the uses of the drug Spanish fly on women ‚Äî he subsequently wrote about it in his 1991 book Childhood published by Putnam, and again recounted the story in a 1994 interview with the Greensboro News & Record. Comparisons between the \\"Spanish Fly\\" story by Cosby and the asserted incidents of sexual assault were reported on by multiple publications including The Boston Globe, the International Business Times, the Chicago Sun- Times, The Washington Post, Philadelphia Daily News, and CNN. In an investigative journalism article about the sexual assault assertions by multiple women against Cosby, The Washington Post characterized the \\"Spanish Fly\\" routine as \\"particularly insensitive\\". Production Bill Cosby in 1969, the same year the album was released. =Recording= It's True! It's True! was Cosby's last album for Warner Bros. Records for twenty years. His later albums including the subsequent production 8:15 12:15 were released under Tetragrammaton Records which was managed by Cosby and associates Bruce Post Campbell, Roy Silver under Cosby's parent company CSC Corps. It was recorded live at Harrah's, Lake Tahoe, Nevada. Due to a musician's strike, Cosby got extra stage time at Harrah's, much of which was captured on this album. Bill Cosby wrote all the material for the album and was its sole performer. Lowell Frank served as engineer on the album, and Rudy Hill performed editing. It was produced by Jimmy Hilliard, and digitally mastered by Dave Schultz. Ed Thrasher contributed the cover photograph for the album and was in charge of art direction on the work. The mastering on the album was carried out with a process referred to as HAECO-CSG monaural processing, which was used for a few years during the transition from mono to stereo to create artificial stereo from mono recordings. According to AllMusic, this led to a decrease of lower frequencies and an audio image which was not well established. =Release= The recording was released in 1969 in live album format. It reached the 21st spot on the R&B; Albums chart, and was 37th on The Billboard 200 the same year. It was subsequently released in compact disc format in 2005 by label Rhino, and again in 2008 by Rhino Flashback. A digital version was jointly released in 2013 by Rhino and Warner Bros. Reception AllMusic gave the album three stars out of a possible five. In a 1990 article reflecting on Cosby's career, The Colorado Springs Gazette placed the album among the artist's \\"Major Records\\". A journalist for The Repository recounted in 2003 that the album was among his early recollections of Cosby recordings among others including I Started Out as a Child and Why Is There Air?. Upon the album's 2005 release as a compact disc, Philadelphia Daily News gave it a favorable review inviting readers to \\"Return with us now to the glory days of Bill Cosby as a standup comedian\\". The newspaper called the album \\"still very funny\\". The same year The Deseret News called the album \\"very funny\\", and noted it recounted Cosby's days filming I Spy. The article called the re- release of Cosby's work including the album a \\"cause for celebration\\". Spanish Fly Cosby's routine from the album discussing attempts to obtain the drug derived from the Spanish fly and use it on women by placing it into their drinks has been heavily discussed in the media. In a track on the album titled \\"Spanish Fly\\", Cosby discussed his desire to obtain the drug Spanish fly and use it on women by placing it into their drinks. Cosby said he first learned about the substance at age 13. He stated on the album: \\"'You know anything about Spanish Fly?' 'No, tell me about it.' 'Well there's this girl Crazy Mary, you put some in her drink man, she, 'Haaaaaaaaaaaaah'.' From then on, any time you see a girl. 'Wish I had some Spanish fly.' Go to a party, see five girls standing alone. 'Boy, if I had a whole jug of Spanish fly I'd light that corner up over there.' Haaa-ha-ha.\\"\\" Cosby further elaborated on his attempts to find Spanish fly, in his book Childhood. The book was published in 1991 by Putnam. In its review of the book The Columbus Dispatch noted Cosby's story about Spanish fly \\"ventures a bit beyond\\" childhood. Dayton Daily News wrote that Spanish fly is described in Cosby's book as a type of \\"wonder drug\\". In 1994, Greensboro News & Record reported Cosby told a story that in his youth he tried to purchase Spanish fly from a member of the military but it turned out to be cornstarch. In a 1991 interview with Larry King, Cosby again joked about usage of the drug on women. The 1969 story by Cosby recounting his quest to find Spanish fly received renewed attention in 2014 after multiple women came forward publicly to accuse him of past incidents of sexual assault and rape against them. According to accounts by the women Cosby utilized drugs to subdue them prior to the asserted acts of violation by the comedian. The \\"Spanish Fly\\" track from the album was re-discovered and publicized in 2014 by The Village Voice. Ebony described the unearthing of the audio as \\"unfortunate timing\\" given the accusations by women that Cosby drugged them prior to sexual assault. The Boston Globe wrote: \\"Cosby had an entire stand-up routine about drugging women's drinks with 'Spanish fly' back in 1969; that it got laughs then says a lot about how views can shift in 45 years.\\" The comparison between accusations by women of Cosby drugging followed by sexual assault with his \\"Spanish Fly\\" routine received additional coverage from publications including the International Business Times, the Chicago Sun- Times, The Washington Post, Philadelphia Daily News, and CNN. The Washington Post wrote with regards to the \\"Spanish Fly\\" piece: \\"in hindsight one of his riffs seems particularly insensitive.\\" Track listing All material written by Bill Cosby.

The Chilean city of Osorno (Chile) is named after this place. General information *Covers 88.6 square kilometers and has roughly 1,500 residents. *The villages of Villadiezma, Las Caba√±as de Castilla and Santillana de Campos are hamlets of Osorno la Mayor (they belong to the same municipal district). *Has easy access to the highways Autov√≠a Camino de Santiago and Autov√≠a Cantabria-Meseta, and also has a train station. Location Osorno la Mayor is located on the eastern edge of the province in a region called Tierra de Campos, 50 kilometers from the provincial capital Palencia. The town is considered a crossroad for its location on the natural path from the northern plateau to the Bay of Biscay, and from Burgos towards Le√≥n and Galicia. Local Economy Economic activity in this region has historically been based on agriculture, in particular the cultivation of grains, although this activity is now in decline. Construction, public works projects, and services are booming due to Osorna la Mayor's proximity to two highways (Burgos-Le√≥n and Palencia-Santander) that pass nearby and the rail lines that follow the same route. The municipality also has an industrial park which drives significant economic activity. Water The township is irrigated by water from the Valdavia and Boedo rivers as well as the Canal de Castilla. Lock number 15 of the north branch of the channel is located in the township. Only traces remain of the buildings that were on the site of the lock as they were demolished before it was declared a protected historical landmark. History Thanks to some artifacts that have been found on the township's land it is known that it hosted a Roman settlement primarily of a military nature. The artifacts have appeared over the years, without any systematic archaeological dig. More recently, organized excavations have found traces of human settlement that may go as far back as the Mesolithic Age. The area grew in importance starting in the Middle Ages, no doubt the result of its physical location. Today only the town hall and some elements of the municipal church such as the baptismal font and the baroque altar attest to a past with artistic or historical interest. Holiday Celebrations The most prominent holidays in Osorno la Mayor are the celebration of Our Lady of Ronte, the Pilgrimage of St. Pantale√≥n and the festivities of San Miguel de los Santos, which is held on the first weekend of July. Easter is also celebrated with fervor; the township has one of the most striking Easter celebrations in the province.

They have released two studio albums, two EPs, and a compilation. As of today, Depswa is on an indefinite hiatus and nothing is known about them for the future. History =Formation and EP releases= The beginnings of Depswa came together in 1997 with vocalist Jeremy Penick and bassist Ryan Burchfield, under their original band name \\"Carcinogen\\". With this name, the band released their first EP, named Depswa, that eventually will become the band's name. In 1999, Penick and Burchfield had moved to Los Angeles and added guitarist Dan Noonan. The band would then rename themselves as \\"Depswa\\". The band released their debut EP in 2000 titled Faithless, and by October 2001, had added drummer Gordon Heckaman into the fold. Depswa had generated some significant interest around a number of major record labels. Ultimately they decided to sign with Geffen Records. The band went to work recording their debut album with renowned producer Howard Benson. A second guitarist in James Mills also joined the band at this point. =Two Angels and a Dream (2003‚Äì2004)= Depswa released their debut album titled Two Angels and a Dream on June 3, 2003. The band was part of Ozzfest 2003, as a second stage act. Also, Their song, \\"This Time\\", was featured in EA Sports' NASCAR Thunder 2004 in two forms, the original with lyrics, and an instrumental version. \\"This Time\\" was also sampled by Krayzie Bone on the track \\"Don't Know Why\\" from the album Gemini: Good vs. Evil. As of August 13, 2003, Depswa had sold 9,060 copies of their debut album in the United States (according to Nielsen SoundScan). At this point, it was rumoured that the band had been dropped off the remaining part of the Ozzfest tour, due to Geffen withdrawing their tour support of the band. This was not completely accurate. Geffen was not in communications with the band's management and had not sent the remainder of the tour support that was needed. The band told Geffen that if they did not receive the backend support they would pull themselves off the tour. Geffen responded saying that they were going to send the funds 2 days after the band started for home. Upon returning to L.A. Depswa's attorney requested that the label let the band go to pursue other labels that might be more supportive. On December 6, 2003, guitarist James Mills departed Depswa. The band was seeking a replacement guitarist, but nobody was ever hired, and have since continued as a four-piece with Penick playing second guitar and singing. =Inactivity, second studio album, re-releases, and indefinite hiatus (2005‚Äì2011)= In January 2005, Depswa revealed via their MySpace blog that they were under way recording material for their second album. After working with a couple different producers, Depswa eventually decided to re-record much of the material along with several new songs. Currently, (May 2007) they are in the final stages of the recording process and are preparing to have the material mixed. May 13, 2007 was Gordon's last show with Depswa as their drummer. They now have their good friend Steve White (formally of Turn Of The Screw) behind the kit. Steve can also do vocals so the live shows have the harmonies similar to the studio recordings. As of April 2008 they've been working hard on mixing the tracks for their next CD and hope to be wrapped up by the end of summer 2008. On March 16, 2010 Depswa released their second studio album Distorted American Dream. In 2011, Depswa announced they will be going on an indefinite hiatus. =Compilations and rereleases (2012‚Äìpresent)= On February 17, 2015 the band released a compilation album of unreleased recordings entitled \\"Lucid Dreams - Demos, B-Sides, Covers and Rarities\\", along with a re-release of the Faithless EP and the Depswa EP (originally released, as Carcinogen). The band stated that this will be their last release as of now due to them being on an indefinite hiatus since 2011.

It is based on Richard Connell's 1924 short story \\"The Most Dangerous Game.\\" It was produced by Robert H. Bagley. Its plot follows four young adults who visit a tropical island only to become prey for a sadistic hunter. It was filmed in 1959 but not released until 1961, when it was the second film on a double feature with The Devil's Hand. Plot Two couples - Betty and Johnny (June Kenney and Robert Reed), and Jeanne and Pete (Joan Lora and Eugene Persson) - are vacationing at sea together. When the ship's captain passes out drunk, they decide to go to a nearby jungle island. As they depart, Capt. Tony (Troy Patterson) awakens and calls out, warning them not to. As they explore the island, Johnny falls into a pit. The others start pulling him out, but look up to see Dr. Balleau (Wilton Graff) and two servants. Balleau orders the servants to help get Johnny out. That night at his house, Balleau tells the couples that he moved to the island \\"after the war\\" to indulge his passion for hunting. Both couples want to leave, but Balleau says they can not because wild animals prowl the jungle. Ballaeu makes his wife Sandra (Lilyan Chauvin) show Betty and Jeanne to the guestroom, while Balleau's servant Jondor (Bobby Hall) escorts Johnny and Pete to their room. A bit later, Sandra and houseguest Dean Gerard (Walter Brooke), who are lovers, discuss Dean's latest plan for their escape. Meanwhile, Johnny and Pete go to Betty and Jeanne's room to talk about their situation. They decide to poke about the house. Betty and Johnny are stopped by Sandra and Dean, who take them back to the guestroom. Jeanne and Pete find a tunnel. They hide as a servant walks into a room. When he leaves, Jeanne and Pete go in and discover a vat of bubbling acid. They hide again when the servant returns and are horrified when he reveals a woman's body floating in an aquarium. The servant leaves again. Jeanne and Pete go back to the guestroom to tell the others what they have seen. Dean tells them his escape plan. He and Sandra will slip out of the house, steal a boat, go to the mainland and then come back with help. But as they sneak through the front gate, Balleau, toting a spear, follows. Two days pass. No one has seen Balleau or heard from Sandra and Dean. As Betty and Johnny discuss this, a servant enters the room. They hide as the servant walks through a secret door. When he comes out, they go in. There they discover Balleau and his \\"trophies\\" - the mounted bodies of people he has hunted, Sandra and Dean among them. By way of explanation, Balleau tells Betty and Johnny that he was a sniper during the war. At first he detested sniping, he says, but then began to enjoy it, and soon the enjoyment \\"turned into a lust - a lust for blood!\\" As Balleau tells both couples that he will hunt Johnny and Pete, Jondor comes in dragging Capt. Tony behind him. Balleau adds Tony to the hunt for failing to bring Balleau sufficient inmates from the \\"penal island.\\" Balleau says he will hunt only the three men. Betty and Jeanne will stay with him and now that Sandra is dead, he is \\"looking forward to getting to know [them] better ... much better.\\" Jondor locks the girls in the guestroom. Balleau says that he will carry a crossbow and only three arrows, one for each man, To make things more \\"sporting\\", he tosses Tony a pistol and says they will find ammunition in the \\"Tree of Death.\\" But they find just one bullet. Tony runs off with it, leaving Johnny and Pete to fend for themselves. When Tony attempts to shoot Balleau, the gun will not fire. Balleau has removed the firing pin. He kills Tony. After escaping from the guestroom, Betty and Jeanne enter the tunnel Pete and Jeanne had found earlier. They go into the room with vat of acid, hoping to arm themselves with knives, but a servant comes in. He and Betty tussle and Betty, the daughter of a judo expert, judo-flips the servant into the acid, where he dissolves, screaming in agony. The girls head into the jungle, looking for Johnny and Pete. Balleau and Jondor are still hunting the boys when Jondor falls into a leech-filled pond. Balleau leaves him to drown. Betty and Jeanne find Johnny and Pete. They head for Balleau's house, planning to use his rifles against him. They find rifles, but no ammunition. They are defenseless. Balleau finds the couples hiding in his trophy room. Holding them at gunpoint, he poses them in the tableau they will be in after he has killed them. Suddenly, Jondor, covered with leeches, bursts in. Jondor grips Balleau in a bear hug and, as Balleau screams, impales him on a cross, killing him.

In a review of its co-feature, The Devil's Hand, film critic Margaret Harford wrote just one succinct paragraph about Bloodlust!: \\"Wilton Graff, another veteran actor turned to villainy, plays a mad scientist in the companion feature. The title is 'Blood Lust.' which should be sufficient warning for anyone.\\" The anonymous reviewer in \\"Feature Reviews\\" in BoxOffice magazine's issue of 20 November 1961 had more to say, but nothing that was much better. He or she wrote that \\"little, if anything, is left to the individual viewer's imagination\\" in Bloodlust! and that star Graff \\"doesn't bring much conviction to the killer doctor part,\\" while \\"the four young people ... emerge as one-dimensional actors.\\" In summary, the reviewer said, \\"... this seems to let emotion-mad humans go on all out on a killing spree, and while the adventure-action audiences will find what's happening relatively engrossing, the discriminating won't be able to contain their bored feelings.\\" In a short review, British film critic Phil Hardy dismissed Bloodlust! as \\"a wretched misuse of the Richard Connell story\\" and called the Dr. Baleau character a \\"dismal pervert pursuing teenagers whose bodies he stores in glass tanks.\\" Bloodlust! could be mistaken for the similarly-titled Blood Lust, one of multiple English language titles of the 1977 West German film Moskito der Sch√§nder (literally, Mosquito the Rapist). It and the 1970 American movie Blood Mania shared a \\"combo\\" poster of both movies that was used to promote a drive-in theatre double-feature. Both films carried R-ratings in the USA, which required people under age 17 to be accompanied by a parent or an adult guardian.  Television  Bloodlust! was sold to TV in October 1963, about two years after its theatrical release, by Westhamtpon Features, a division of Desilu. It was part of a 41-film package which also included The Devil's Hand. More recently, it was shown on Mystery Science Theater 3000 on 3 September 1994, in an episode which featured the first appearance of character Pearl Forrester. On 9 January 2009 it was featured on The Schlocky Horror Picture Show and on 8 October 2010 was shown in \\"The Screaming Skull\\" episode of Cinemassacre's Monster Madness. Home video Bloodlust! has been in home release for a number of years and by at least 22 different distributors, as a single film or in sets of films. Madacy Entertainment was the first, putting the movie out on VHS and DVD in 2001. Reel Media Entertainment had a VHS tape in world-wide release in 2004, followed by Film Annex's world-wide release in all media in 2006. BAC Films distributed a DVD of the movie in France in 2006 and Elstree Entertainment released Bloodlust! on DVD in the UK in 2001.

The centre opened on 4 October 2005 and is located within the Public Access Area on the northern end of the Garden Island naval base in Sydney. The need for such a facility was first recognised in 1922, by Vice Admiral Sir William Creswell who suggested the building of a museum to permanently display the Australian Navy‚Äôs already rich and unique heritage. Since then, there have been several attempts to establish an international- standard naval museum. The origins of the RANHC date from 2001, when the then Chief of the Navy commissioned a Naval Heritage Management Study to examine in detail how the RAN's past might best be used to support the present Navy‚Äôs goals. One of the most important recommendations was the creation of a facility for the public display of the Naval Heritage Collection (NHC). Once approval for funding was received, a RANHC Project Board was formed and the project began on 24 May 2004. The NHC contains more than 250,000 individual items, and the mission of the RANHC is to display those objects of museum standard to the public, and through these displays capture something of the Australian naval experience. Exhibits ;The Professions of Navy This is a large thematic display focusing on how the Navy‚Äôs people have 'done the job' at sea over the years. Branches and categories past and present are used to explain how the naval profession has changed and developed. ;The Periscope This exhibit features a unique interactive display a fully operational submarine attack periscope has been installed to allow visitors an unusual view of Sydney Harbour. ;Naval Technology and Ordnance A specific display illustrating how the Navy has developed and applied technology to the sea- fighting environment. It includes precision instruments for navigation and gunnery, in addition to examples of naval ordnance ranging from shells and torpedoes to modern guided missiles. ;The Battle of Sydney This centres on the fin and control centre from one of the Japanese midget submarines that attacked Sydney Harbour on the night of 31 May-1 June 1942, and also includes the Boom Boat belonging to the Maritime Services Board that first raised the alarm. The display is supported by an interactive audiovisual presentation. The RAN Heritage Centre building, at the northern end of Garden Island ;In Which We Serve This is a large chronological display of items that tell the stories of famous Australian ships and their battles. Artefacts are included from the colonial era, the First and Second World Wars, the Cold War and operations in the Persian Gulf. ;Boats and Dockyards The 1913 Boatshed has been dedicated as the display gallery for artefacts related to small boats and Australian dockyards, particularly Garden Island. ;A Sailors Life For Me This main exhibition display uses the entire mezzanine level of the workshop building, and provides visitors with an introduction to a sailor‚Äôs life at sea. The display includes a mock-up of a World War II-era mess deck, as well as artefacts highlighting naval traditions and pastimes. ;The Bridge This is a mock-up of a Battle-class destroyer's open bridge, and is one of the major interactive displays in the Centre. Using original equipment from 50 years ago, the Bridge is aimed at helping visitors acquire some experience of what takes place on a warship‚Äôs bridge at sea.

Workers found the body in 1835 while excavating peat on the Haraldsk√¶r Estate. The anaerobic conditions and acids of the peat bog contributed to the body's excellent preservation. Not only was the intact skeleton found, but so were the skin and internal organs. Scientists settled disputes about the age and identity of this well preserved body in 1977, when radiocarbon dating determined conclusively that the woman's death occurred around the 5th century BCE.Archaeological Institute \\"Haraldskaer Woman: Bodies of the Bogs\\", Archaeology, Archaeological Institute of America, December 10, 1997. The Haraldsk√¶r Woman's body is on permanent display in an ornate glass- covered sarcophagus inside St. Nicolai Church in central Vejle, Denmark. Mistaken identity St. Nicolai Church in Vejle, Denmark After the discovery of the body, early theories of her identity centered on the persona of Queen Gunnhild of Norway, who lived around 900-1000 CE. Most of the bog bodies recovered indicate the victim died from a violent murder or ritualistic sacrifice. These theories are consistent with the body being put into a bog as opposed to burial in dry earth. According to the Jomsvikinga Saga, Harald Bluetooth of Denmark ordered Queen Gunnhild be drowned in a bog. Based upon the belief of her royal personage, King Frederick VI of Denmark-Norway commanded an elaborately carved sarcophagus to hold her body. This careful treatment of the Haraldsk√¶r Woman's remains explains the excellent state of conservation of the corpse; conversely, Tollund Man, a later discovery, was not properly conserved and most of the body has been lost, leaving only the head as original remains in his display. In 1842, the young Danish archaeologist J. J. A. Worsaae disputed the identification of the Haraldsk√¶r Woman with Gunnhild. A pioneer in archaeological stratigraphy, Worsaae presented evidence the Haraldsk√¶r Woman dated from the Iron Age. Later radiocarbon dating confirmed the body was not Gunnhild, but rather a woman of the early Iron Age who lived about 490 BCE. Though no one proved the Haraldsk√¶r Woman has any royal lineage, her body lies in state in a display in the north transept of Saint Nicolai Church. Details Haraldsk√¶r Estate in 1857 The body of the Haraldsk√¶r Woman Excavators found the body of the Haraldsk√¶r Woman in a supine position in an excellent state of preservation. She was naked and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her.Hvass, Lone, Dronning Gunhild - et moselig fra jernalderen, Sesam, (1998), p. 26. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down.Aldhouse-Green, Miranda, Boudica Britannia, Pearson Education, 2006 pp. 95-96. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age. In 1979, doctors at √Örhus Hospital undertook a further forensic examination of the Haraldsk√¶r Woman. By this time, the body had desiccated, shrunken, and the skin was leathery, severely wrinkled and folded. A CT-scan of the cranium more accurately determined her age to be about 40 at the time of her death. The body height now measured only , but doctors used the original 1835 descriptions to estimate she would have stood about . In 2000, Lone Hvass of the Elsinore Museum, Miranda Aldhouse-Green of Cardiff University, and the Department of Forensic Science at the University of √Örhus performed a re- examination of the Haraldsk√¶r Woman. Forensic analysis revealed stomach contents of unhusked millet and blackberries. Her neck had a faint groove as if someone applied a rope for torture or strangulation. The scientists concluded bog acids caused the swelling of the knee joint and that the woman was probably already dead before the branches pinned her down. Because of her careful placement, and since cremation was the prevailing mode of interment during that period in Jutland, the examiners guess the Haraldsk√¶r Woman was a victim of ritual sacrifice. Relation to other bog bodies The principal locations where bog bodies have been discovered are the Northern European countries of Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and especially Denmark.Lang, Karen E., Tales from the Bog, National Geographic Magazine, September (2008) The oldest of these bodies dates to about 8000 BCE, although the majority of specimens in Denmark are from the Pre-Roman Iron Age to Roman Iron Age era (about 500 BC to 400 CE).Fischer, Christian: Tollundmanden. Gaven til guderne. Mosefund fra Danmarks forhistorie. Hovedland 2007. As of 2006, more than 700 ancient bodies have been discovered in these sites,Hirst, Kris K.\\"Bog Bodies\\", Archaeology, About.Com although other estimates have placed the number in the thousands. It is difficult for scientists to ascertain a precise number because many of the bodies have been lost or destroyed.Knudsen, Anne, Moselig, Weekendavisen, Nr. 40, 5-11, Oct. 2007. Before archaeologists began actively searching for bog bodies, the bodies were discovered mostly during the routine extraction of peat, and then reburied or discarded. After the discovery that systematic conservation of Iron Age bodies was attributable to the acidic anaerobic environs, major excavations have occurred in Jutland.Hamerow, Helena, 2003. Early Medieval Settlements: The Archaeology of Rural Communities in North-West Europe 400-900, Oxford University Press, Other bog bodies recovered on the Jutland peninsula that have undergone as extensive an analysis as the Haraldsk√¶r Woman include Tollund Man, Grauballe Man, Elling Woman, Huldremose Woman and the Borremose Woman.Andersen, S., Geertinger, P., \\"Bog Bodies Investigated in the Light of Forensic Medicine\\", Journal of Danish Archaeology Vol. 3 (1984), p. 111-119. Literary references Danish author Steen Steensen Blicher, an amateur archaeologist and one of the first to visit the site, made the first literary reference to the Haraldsk√¶r Woman. In 1836, he published his novella Gravh√∏jen which was a parody about a mistaken archaeological find. However, by 1841 Blicher seemed to have changed his mind about the Haraldsk√¶r Woman's identity when he wrote the poem Dronning Gunhild, a lament for the dead queen in the bog. In 1846, the Danish playwright Jens Christian Hostrup wrote his comedy, A Sparrow Doing a Crane Dance, (En Spurv i Tranedans), in which the ghost of Queen Gunnhild gives a magical ring to a scheming tailor and makes everyone blind to his actions.Hostrup, Jens Christian, En Spurv i Tranedans, Folkecomedie i 4 akter, (1846) Hostrup's play indirectly satirized the theory that the Haraldsk√¶r Woman was Queen Gunnhild, and became the first major public endorsement of Worsaae‚Äôs hypothesis.

Written over a six-year period, the album is lyrically reflective of Nastasia's early life growing up in Los Angeles, California, and features sparse acoustic guitar compositions with prominent string arrangements. The album garnered favorable critical reviews, and its 2004 re-release helped earn Nasatasia a cult following. Composition The majority of Dogs was written over a six- year period between 1992 and 1998 when Nastasia, a Los Angeles native, relocated to New York City with a friend. Prior, she had lived in Seattle, where she taught herself to play guitar. During writing the material that would come to be featured on Dogs, Nastasia was working as a waitress, a job that made her \\"so miserable\\" she \\"spent the rest of [her] waking hours writing songs.\\" \\"Most of what's historical on this record comes from my years in Los Angeles,\\" she commented. \\"New York City has probably not had so much of an effect on what I write as it has on whether or not I write at all. I think that living somewhere else then might have been healthier for me.\\" Recording Nastasia recorded the album at Electrical Audio in Chicago under producer and engineer Steve Albini; Albini later described it as one of the albums he is the most proud of, as well as one of his personal favorites: > \\"In the process of making a record, you hear it so many times that the > charms of even the best of them can wear off through over-exposure. On rare > occasions, records I've worked on have withstood this scrutiny and ended up > being personal favorites. Nina Nastasia's 'Dogs' is a record so > simultaneously unassuming and grandiose that I can't really describe it, > except in terms that would make it (and me) sound silly. Of the couple > thousand records I've been involved with, this is one of my favourites, and > one that I'm proud to be associated with.\\" Recalling her time in the studio with Albini, Nastasia said she was unaware of his career in the music industry: Release Dogs was first released on the small independent label Socialist Records in 2000. It received a short run of compact disc pressings featuring hand-pasted photographs and hand-set type, which went out of print within the year. Through word of mouth, it continued to gain traction internationally, receiving considerable airplay in the United Kingdom‚Äî particularly on BBC Radio 1 by disc jockey John Peel who championed the album, calling it \\"astonishing.\\" This resulted in a re-issue of the album on June 7, 2004 by Touch and Go Records. Reception Gregory McIntosh of AllMusic wrote: \\"Dogs has a calming atmosphere, occasionally flirting with dissonance, and stands as a remarkable work of minimal building by repetition to support Nastasia's pitch-perfect voice. It is a rare group who can pull off such a fluid shift from composed sophistication to raw, dangerous, and sinister energy and not only continue to be engaging, but make ascending demands so confidently as to require full attention for the span of 40 minutes without interruption.\\" Upon the album's original 2000 release, the Chicago Readers Tim Midgett praised the album, writing in a review: \\"Nastasia's lyrics are artless in the best sense, and her singing is likewise uncontrived. Most of the structures are bedrock simple, though the delicate, minute-long apology \\"Dear Rose\\" and the roiling \\"Underground\\" in particular are distinctive despite their accessibility. Yet time and again, Nastasia's approach and the approach of her group transform her material into something more than merely charming.\\" Chris Dahlen of Pitchfork noted upon the album's 2004 reissue: \\"Dogs has the ease of a performance that you're catching as you sit in the shower stall. The songs here include some of the best she's written, but they're also some of the most unexpected. Without this reissue, we could have forgotten that she has an ear for big guitar riffs, or that she sounds beautiful just playing straight on an acoustic guitar. And who would have remembered that she has a sense of humor?\\" Helen Spitzer of the Canadian publication Exclaim! praised the album's instrumentation, writing: \\"The arrangements are simple and always immaculate, incorporating strings and saws and brushes, heavy with space. The singing saw is just another character in her stories, the whine of a ghostly dog following his own path, ambling through the record and leaving aching hearts in his wake.\\" Track listing Personnel Musicians *Nina Nastasiavocals, guitar *Joshua Carlebachaccordion *Stephen A.F.

He met Chaitanya at Gaya, India, whereupon Mahaprabhu requested Puri to be his guru. The latter graciously agreed and accepted Mahaprabhu as his disciple several days later, initiating him into the Gopal-mantra. Krishnadasa Kaviraja has described in Shri Chaitanya Charitamrita that: > the first sprout of the desire tree of devotion was manifested in the person > of Shri Madhavendra Puri,and that that sprout developed into a sapling in > the person of Shri Ishvar Puri.

Thereafter Shrila Ishvara Puri initiated Chaitanya Mahaprabhu with the divine Hare Krishna Mantra. =Ishvara Puri Visit to Mahaprabhu place= One morning Shrila Ishvara Puri came to where Mahaprabhu was staying. Mahaprabhu was extremely pleased to see him and after offering His obeisances He invited him to stay for lunch. Ishvara Puri replied that, \\"Being able to accept foodstuffs from Your hand is a matter of great fortune for me.\\" Mahaprabhu Himself cooked and then very carefully served His guru the Prasadam. Afterwards He smeared sandalwood paste on his body and put a garland of flowers around his neck. Thus the Supreme Lord Himself taught how one should serve his guru. Without serving the great Devotees, it is not possible to receive love of Godhead. Service to the guru is the door to devotion. On His return from Gaya, Mahaprabhu came by way of Kumarhatta, the birthplace of His guru, and began to roll on the ground in ecstasy there, as the ground became wet with His tears. Finally He collected some dust from that holy place and bound it in the corner of His upper garment, saying, \\"This dust is as dear to me as My life.\\" then he set out for Navadwipa. Thereafter Mahaprabhu accepted sannyasa and by the order of His mother came to live at Jagannath Puri. By this time Ishvara Puri had already left this world. He sent two of his disciples Shri Govinda and Kashishvara brahmacharis to serve the Lord at Nilachala.

It was taken several times by both sides; each sabotaging the others' position. Background T-Bone Hill was located north of the Jamestown Line in the west-central sector of the UN front. The southern tip of T-Bone which contained the outposts Eerie and Arsenal (), lay approximately northeast of Pork Chop Hill. Arsenal was located about northwest of Eerie. Battle =March 1952= In March 1952, Hill Eerie was the responsibility of the United States Army's 45th Infantry Division ‚Äì Company K, 179th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Captain Max Clark. On March 21, 1952, the twenty-six personnel of the third platoon, under the command of Lieutenant Omer Manley, set out to take over the outpost. Manley's men made up two rifle squads, a light-machine-gun squad and a 60-mm mortar squad. Manley sent out two patrols to establish an ambush site around the hill. That night, both patrol squads sighted enemy activity. At 23:30 the PVA attacked and a machine gun duel between the two sides ended after Captain Clark's troops on Hill 418 supported his men in the Eerie outpost with supporting machine-gun and mortar fire. The battle continued on the morning of 22 March with the PVA forces penetrating the outpost's perimeter and eventually overran Manley's men. Clark was then ordered to concentrate his artillery fire on Outpost Eerie after losing communications. At 01:30, Regimental Commander, Colonel Frederick A. Daugherty, ordered Clark to advance toward the hill and retake the hill. Clark's men searched the area and found out that, of the 26 men who had defended the outpost, 8 were dead, 4 wounded, and 2 were missing (Lieutenant Manley and Corporal Joel Ybarra). They also recovered 31 PVA dead from around the hill and captured a wounded PVA soldier. Later, Clark withdrew his troops to the Jamestown Line. =May 1952= In May 1952, the 20th Philippine Battalion Combat Team, under the command of Colonel Querobin, engaged the PVA forces at the town of Karhwagol, west of Chorwon; they were also involved in other major battles and assaults against the Chinese forces. There were numerous closely fought battles on Hill Eerie, as well as on Hills 18, 200, and 19, ('Yoke', 'Uncle' and Old Baldy), all in the T-Bone Hill area, but later the 20th were committed to the Beef Steak Hill area and the Alligator Jaws (). A series of raids were launched by the Filipinos, from 18 May, led by Lieutenant Rodolfo Maestro, killing 28 PVA and a further 23 the next day, before disengaging with the PVA while tanks and artillery continued to bombard the outpost. On 21 May 1952, Colonel Abcede ordered Major Felizardo Tanabe, the battalion's operations officer, to prepare the final assault on the PVA position after several attempts to capture the outpost. Tanabe sent the 44-man 2nd reconnaissance platoon to sabotage the position. The platoon was led by a young Filipino officer, a 1950 graduate of West Point's United States Military Academy, 2nd Lieutenant Fidel V. Ramos (future President of the Philippines). Ramos divided the assault team into four groups of snipers, riflemen, scouts and forward observers, each with a radio operator, a messenger and a medic. The platoon was reinforced by some engineer demolition specialists and an artillery observer team. They left at 04:07. The platoon crawled through rice paddies and scattered trees for two hours before it reach an irrigation ditch, about 400 meters from the top of the hill. Intelligence estimated the PVA strength to be one reinforced platoon. The United States Air Force sent seven F-86 Sabre jet fighters to pound the PVA positions with Napalm. There was also artillery support. After the bombardment, Ramos' men seized the front part of the trench network after discovering a hole in the blasted stack of barbed wire. Close-quarter fighting raged as the retreating PVA fought back but the advancing Filipinos were gaining the upper hand. The scout team, led by Corporal Juliano Palis, went into action on the right of the hill and was later joined by Lieutenant Ramos. Meanwhile, the rifle team, led by Sergeant Cipriano Drapeza, worked its way round to the left side of the hill while the sniper team, led by Second Lieutenant Yel Claveria, held the enemy's support from nearby Hill 191. By 07:28, the Filipinos had demolished the PVA bunkers and withdrawn from the top of the hill. UN tanks then resumed their bombardment of Hill Eerie. The assault had lasted for two hours, Ramos' men suffered one injury while the PVA had lost an estimated 1100 dead, 2540 wounded, whether from the supporting artillery, tanks and air strikes could not be determined. The battle was the final assault on Hill Eerie by the UN forces. The Filipino battalion was replaced by the US 2nd Battalion, 179th Infantry. =June 1952= On 16 June 1952, the 19th Philippine Battalion Combat Team, under the command of Colonel Ramon Z. Aguirre, relieved the US battalion in the T-Bone ridge sector. On 18 June the PVA forces sought to recapture the area and launched an intense artillery and mortar barrage. The Filipinos held their ground and were able to repulse the PVA attack. On 20 June the PVA launched another attack towards Hill Eerie and the rest of the T-Bone ridge area. At dawn, the PVA had advanced sufficiently to engage in hand-to-hand fighting but the Filipino troops were able to hold the position. By morning, the artillery battle continued but the UN forces successfully defended Hills Eerie and 191. As a result of the battle it was estimated that the PVA suffered 500 casualties while the Filipinos had 24. The Filipino battalion was later relieved by the US 2nd Infantry Division on 18 July 1952.

The company was purchased and operated by Rite Aid beginning in 1982, and was later bought by Melville Corporation in 1990, when some of its stores were converted to Kay-Bee Toys.  History  Circus World, originally known as Child's World, was founded in Michigan in 1964, by engineer Sidney Rubin (born 1937), who served as the company president. Rubin was once a first baseman, and also worked as an army radar instructor before working as a systems analyst for Sperry Rand during the mid-1960s. Wanting to start a business in Detroit, Rubin realized that Michigan was ranked fourth in the United States in terms of youth population under 17 years of age. Rubin chose to begin a toy store company and began securing locations, followed by financial backing. The first store opened in 1964, in Warren, Michigan. Gilbert Companies Inc. (formerly Gilbert Shoe Stores Inc.), based in Columbus, Ohio, purchased Child's World in November 1969. In 1970, the chain was renamed as Circus World. In 1971, the company relocated its corporate headquarters from Lathrup Village to Oak Park, Michigan. As of 1981, Circus World Toy Stores was based in Taylor, Michigan, and operated 127 stores located in 22 states, with 18 locations in Michigan. Stores averaged , and Rubin stated that Circus World was the largest privately owned toy-specialty chain in the United States. In 1982, Rubin sold the company to Rite Aid, which planned to finance an expansion of the toy chain, while Rubin would remain in charge of it. Circus World was purchased by the Greenman Brothers in 1985. Owners of the Playland chain of toy stores at the time, they converted them to Circus World stores. By the end of 1985, they managed to increase sales substantially through renovating stores and improving operations. Despite the apparent turnaround and record sales, however, the operational improvements envisioned by Bernard Greenman did not come quickly enough, and in 1987 Circus World had lost $3 million for the fiscal year. The next year, same-store sales had become stagnant, and the company lost another $3 million. The stores were also run in the same manner as the Rite Aid drug stores, forcing the managers to spend much more office time than was needed, and less time on the floor selling to customers and maintaining inventory. Because there were many more Circus World stores than Playland, Greenman Brothers forced all stores to adopt the more complex Circus World methods rather than the simpler Playland system. The money Greenman Brothers were forced to pay out to upgrade the Circus World stores after paying to purchase the chain, plus the money they lost liquidating unsaleable merchandise, resulted in less operating capital to purchase merchandise for the 1986 Christmas selling season. Although the chain would become profitable again by 1990, it had failed to differentiate itself from competitor Kay-Bee Toys, and Greenman management decided to sell the chain. In July 1990, Melville Corporation announced plans to purchase Circus World's 330 stores in 32 states for $95 million; the locations were to become part of Melville's Kay-Bee division. The sale was completed in August 1990, and some Circus World stores were subsequently renamed as Kay-Bee stores, while others retained the Circus World name. The Circus World continued in use as late as 1996.

The main feature of the complex is a 17,000-seat stadium for California Rodeo Salinas. Soccer, football, and rugby was also played at the main stadium before the opening of Rabobank Stadium next door. The grounds have been home to the California Rodeo Salinas since 1911. The original wood stadium structure was built in 1924 and replaced in 1996 with a stadium design by Kasavan Architects. The stadium's field is wide enough to host soccer matches along with football games, and indeed it hosted the California Jaguars of the United Soccer Leagues (then USISL) from 1995 to 1999. For several years, the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) has hosted events from their \\"minor league\\" system, such as the Touring Pro Division (formerly the Challenger Tour) and BlueDEF Tour, at the complex. The complex is also home to baseball, and softball fields. The stadium does not only host rodeo and sports events, it can be converted into a race track for auto racing, monster truck shows, and motorcycle racing.

Salinas Assembly Center View of barracks at the Salinas Assembly Center. During World War II, the Salinas Rodeo Grounds was one of the locations used as a temporary detention camp for citizens and immigrant residents of Japanese ancestry, before they were relocated to more permanent and remote facilities. One of seventeen such sites overseen by the Wartime Civilian Control Administration, the Salinas Assembly Center was built after President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing the removal and confinement of Japanese Americans living on the West Coast. The camp opened on April 27, 1942 and held a total of 3,608 people before closing two months later on July 4. Most came from the Monterey Bay area and were transferred to the Poston concentration camp, located on the Colorado River Indian Reservation in Arizona. In 1980, the Salinas Assembly Center, along with eleven other former temporary detention sites, was designated California Historical Landmark #934. A historical marker and memorial garden were dedicated on the 1984 Day of Remembrance. This location cannot be considered a National Historic Landmark due to its post-war use and land development.

Early life Born in Rush Springs, Oklahoma and raised in Texas, Knox served eight years in the Texas National Guard and attended Abilene Christian College, now Abilene Christian University, and Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls. He also began what would become a long career as a freelance writer and columnist; he started as a reporter for the Vernon Daily Record before he moved on to the Times Record News in Wichita Falls. Career As an independent writer, Knox sold several articles to gun magazines including Guns & Ammo and Guns magazine between 1964 and 1966. He formally entered the firearms journalism trade in 1966, when he became the founding editor of Gun Week, a weekly newspaper covering firearms issues of the day. The paper gave in-depth coverage to the bill that would eventually become the Gun Control Act of 1968. Knox left Gun Week in 1968, when he moved to Wolfe Publishing/as editor of Handloader Magazine and founding editor of Rifle Magazine. In 1978, Knox moved to Washington, D.C. in order to lobby against gun control measures and work for the National Rifle Association. He served four years as the executive director of the Institute for Legislative Action (ILA), the lobbying arm of the NRA. At the ILA, Knox was instrumental in convincing friendly lawmakers to introduce a reform of the 1968 Act. The bill became the Firearm Owners Protection Act, which eventually passed in 1986. From 1984 to his death, Knox was the chairman of the Firearms Coalition, an organization that he created, which lobbies against restrictive gun laws. Political activism One of the recurring themes throughout Knox's career was his uncompromising stance on gun laws and the 2nd Amendment, which he believed recognizes a pre-existing human right to self-defense. His views would lead him into many confrontations with other members of the NRA leadership and Congressional leadership. Knox publicly accused many NRA leaders of being too moderate. In 1977, Knox was among the hardliners who took control of the NRA. The same hardliners fired Knox from the NRA five years later in 1982. Over the ensuing decade, Knox used his own columns in magazines popular with NRA members like Shotgun News and Guns & Ammo to get himself and up to 10 allies elected to the NRA board in 1991. In 1997, a narrowly-divided NRA Board voted Knox out of the succession line for president of the NRA, replacing him with Charlton Heston, who was subsequently elected president of the organization. Death Knox died in 2005, aged 69, after a year-long struggle with colon cancer. His son, Jeff Knox, continues the Knox Report column, which is published in Shotgun News (now rebranded as Firearms News) and elsewhere. Another son, Chris Knox, has compiled and edited a collection of his writing, Neal Knox: The Gun Rights War.

The prize originated among patrons of Milan's Bagutta Ristorante. The writer Riccardo Bacchelli discovered the restaurant and soon he regularly gathered numerous friends who would dine there together and discuss books. They began charging fines to the person who arrived last to an appointed meal, or who failed to appear. At first the funds so collected were spent on miscellaneous items, but on 11 November 1927 the group decided to use the funds to create a literary prize. They named it after the restaurant. Other directors of the prize include Emilio Tadini, Mario Soldati and Isabella Bossi Fedrigotti.

Anthony Giddens (1991) refers to ontological security as a sense of order and continuity in regard to an individual's experiences. He argues that this is reliant on people's ability to give meaning to their lives. Meaning is found in experiencing positive and stable emotions, and by avoiding chaos and anxiety (ibid; Elias, 1985). If an event occurs that is not consistent with the meaning of an individual's life, this will threaten that individual's ontological security. Ontological security also involves having a positive view of self, the world and the future. Ontological security threatened by death Philip A. Mellor and Chris Shelling talk about this concept in regard to thanatology, arguing that when death strikes, it causes people to \\"question the meaningfulness and reality of the social frameworks in which they participate, shattering their ontological security\\"Mellor, P. A., & Shilling, C. (1993). Modernity, Self- Identity and the Sequestration of Death. Sociology, 27(3), 411‚Äì431. https://doi.org/10.1177/0038038593027003005, pg.13 Ontological security threatened by anthropogenic climate change Climate change poses a threat to people's sense of continuity in their lives. In her book, \\"Living in Denial: Climate Change, Emotions, and Everyday Life,\\" the sociologist Kari Norgaard discusses how climate change impacts the ontological security of Norwegians and leads them to deny responsibility. The previously stable climate shaped Norway's cultural heritage. For example, skiing in the winter has been a longtime tradition. The shortened ski season has disrupted their sense of continuity of the seasons. The changing climate causes people to question how things will be in the future as the warming trend continues. These disruptions to cultural norms affect people's senses of cultural and self identity. This can result in an erosion of a sense of purpose. Also as mentioned in this book, a quote from the psychiatrist Robert Lifton describes how people begin to question their sense that the world is a good place, and they become numb to the threat of a changing climate as result of a crisis of meaning in the continuity of their lives. A quote from the sociologist Ulrich Beck describes that on a societal level, pervasive exposure to risk threatens ontological security and erodes social networks. Ontological security associated with home ownership \\"It has been said that people need the confidence, continuity and trust in the world which comprise ontological security in order to lead happy and fulfilled lives, and furthermore that ontological security can be attained more through owner occupied than rented housing.\\". Ontological security in children Children are more likely to have a positive ontological security when the child's parents own their own home.Edward Scanlon, Deborah Page-Adams. Homeownership and Youth Well-Being: An Empirical Test of Asset- Based Welfare(archive), Inclusion in Asset Building: Research Policy Symposium, 2000, Center for Social Development. page 2: \\"Peter Saunders (1978; 1990) refers to this control of housing space as 'ontological security'. This increased sense of control might lead to child well-being through increased capacities to parent effectively (Green & White, 1997)\\" Reportedly, home ownership also improves parenting and allows for a future transfer of assets, thus facilitating ontological security. What is also true is in Societies such as Germany and other Northern European States where renting is stable, and well regulated, the issue of stability does not have to equate with home ownership based on mortgages. In the UK where working poor and many middle income families are under incredible financial stress, due to the increasing cost of home ownership, and of renting which is paying for the mortgages of landlords with many properties, all of which is urged by Government (social housing rents set at 80% of the market rate for private housing) as part of the ideology of 'growing the economy' which in turn creates a situation of chronic stress, that leads to a wide range of health related issues which impact children's lives adversely. The issue of ontological security, then, is to do with security of tenure, with regard to stability in a child's home life and the life of his or her parents, rather than home ownership per se. One has to be cautious in this regard to avoid co-opting the concept of ontological security for any specific economic agenda, and always be focused on the lived experience and how it plays out under the influence of Government policies and events in the material concrete reality. Furthermore, reducing the matter of a child's ontological security to the material aspect of housing ignores issues such as 'traditional' parenting practices, religiosity, unresolved parental trauma disrupting empathy-based relationships and other chronic stressors that are almost ubiquitous. Ontological security in adult learners \\"Adult educators also must secure the learners' ontological security against existential anxieties by associating learners' network and groups based on trust\\".  Ontological security in International Relations  The concept of ontological security has been applied in international relations. It has been argued that states seek to ensure their ontological security (the security of Self and self-conception), in addition to their pursuit of physical security (such as protecting the territorial integrity of the state). To ensure their ontological security, states may even jeopardize their physical security. Ontological security in world politics can be defined as the possession, on the level of the unconscious and practical consciousness, of answers to fundamental questions that all polities in some way need to address such as existence, finitude, relations with others and their auto-biography. Collective actors such as states become ontologically insecure when critical situations rupture their routines thus bringing fundamental questions to public discourse.

In the context of this strip, \\"pluggers\\" are defined as rural, blue-collar workers who live a typical working-class American lifestyle, accompanied by a mentality characteristic of the G.I. and Baby Boomer generations. In the comic, pluggers are portrayed in the form of anthropomorphic animals, most often a plump bear, dog, chicken, or rhinoceros, sometimes a kangaroo or a cat.  Publication history  Editorial cartoonist Gary Brookins took over in 1997, three years prior to creator Jeff MacNelly's death from lymphoma in 2000. Brookins retired in 2020, and his assistant Rick McKee took over, still maintaining a similar style to MacNelly's originals. Pluggers is syndicated by Tribune Content Agency in 60 newspapers, mostly in the Southern, Mid-West, Plains, and Rocky Mountain states. Characters Most episodes of the comic focus on illustrating personality traits and aspects of the lifestyles of people who are identified as pluggers, and there are no continuing storylines. Consequently, the names and occupations of the anthropomorphic animal characters are rarely mentioned. =Recurring characters= * Andy Bear is a father of three who works as a foreman and estimator at construction company. He is married to Sheila Roo. * Sheila Roo is an aerobics instructor from Australia and the wife of Andy Bear. * Carl Rhinowski, a rhinoceros construction worker. * Earl Houndstooth, a dog, married to Henrietta Beak. * Henrietta Beak, a hen, married to Earl Houndstooth who works at Costco. * Doreen, who works at Costco with Henrietta. =Past characters= * Hamilton Ivory, an elephant and Andy's technophobic employer. * Ginger, a canine caf√© owner. * Alan Litigator, a lawyer and alligator. * Moose K. MacMoose III, a wealthy, retired moose. * Dingo, a bear cub. * DeeDee Doo, a hair stylist who, being a bird, actually has no hair of her own. * Arthur Goldwyn, a salesman lion. Criticism of strip The blog Comics Curmudgeon often pokes fun at the comic and its implied populist stance,http://joshreads.com/?cat=57 on one occasion referring to it as a \\"folksy bit of lower-middle-class reactionary agitprop.\\" http://joshreads.com/?p=4641 In 1996 Dave Eggers from Salon.com criticized the strip for lionizing the working class despite being written by a committee of \\"current and former CEOs\\", and objected to \\"the self-important and vaguely jingoistic way the creators promote the cartoon\\".

The game mechanics are essentially the same as Pong or air hockey, where players continuously shoot the disc at the goal zone of the opponent attempting to score. The game can be played against the computer or in a 2 player versus. A sequel, Windjammers 2, is planned for release on Nintendo Switch and PC in 2020. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot. Players choose from one of six playable characters, each with their own unique speed and power ratings and special throws. The player maneuvers around his/her side of the court in any of the 8 cardinal directions (allowing for almost fluid movement in any direction). They must act as the defence and offence of their side, blocking the disc from entering the goal zone, and throwing the disc back to the opponent's side attempting to score. Players throw the disc back and forth (with the speed of the disc generally increasing with each throw) until one of them scores a point, which causes the disc to be reset by the referee, who throws it to the player that was scored on so that they can serve. There are yellow and pink zones with the former being worth 3 points and the latter being 5, with the zones positioning varying for each court. Also not catching the disc while it is in the air (described below) is considered a \\"Miss\\" and gives 2 points to the opponent. =Defensive play= While the opponent holds the disc the player acts defensively by trying to grab the disc and therefore stopping it from entering their goal zone. In order to stop the disc the player simply needs to make contact with it. They can walk into the disc or dive for it with a button press (which is done at almost all times due to the high speeds of the disc). Sometimes the disc may be launched into the air, due to the opponent, the net, barriers, or sometimes bouncing off the player's back, in which a target will appear on the court showing the landing spot of the disc, which can be caught by standing on said target. =Offensive play= While the player holds the disc they act offensively by trying to throw it into the goal zone of the opponent. The player can not move while holding the disc, and can not hold it for more than a few seconds. The player points with the joystick in the direction he/she wishes to throw the disc, and presses the primary button. The player can throw it either directly at the opponents goal zone or attempt to bounce the disc off the walls, or barriers (if in a court that contains them). =Winning the game= When playing against the computer the player plays one match against each character (with the next characters difficulty increasing each time) until all are defeated, thus winning the game, and when playing 2 player versus one match is played between the two players. A match consists of 3 sets that last 30 seconds by default and up to 99 seconds on the arcade version. (with the timer not stopping when a point is scored unlike most sports). A set is won by the player who has the most points at the end of 30 seconds, or if a player reaches 12 points. A tie gives a win to both players. A match is won when the player wins two sets, if players tie in both of the first two sets (giving each of them two wins) the game enters a sudden death round where the first player to score (regardless of the zone value) wins. Ports On June 22, 2010, the game was released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan. Following the bankruptcy of Data East, the intellectual rights for this game were acquired by Paon DP, a mobile company formed by some ex-Data East employees. It was delisted from the Virtual Console on December 24, 2013, making it the only delisted Neo-Geo game for the Virtual Console. A port of the game with online multiplayer support was released by DotEmu for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on August 29, 2017, with a Nintendo Switch version on October 23, 2018.https://twitter.com/Dotemu/status/1031512502708912129  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Windjammers on their May 1, 1994 issue as being the twenty-second most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as Samurai Shodown. Famitsu gave the Neo Geo version a score of 28 out of 40. Edge gave it 5 out of 10 and stated that \\"there‚Äôs nothing particularly outstanding about it\\". = Retrospective reviews = Video game website Giant Bomb began regularly playing the game on camera in 2013, eventually giving it their \\"Old Game of the Year\\" award. The same website later classified the game as a runner-up for \\"2017's Old Game of the Year\\" at the Game of the Year 2017 Awards. The game has also enjoyed a resurgence in popularity thanks to a growing competitive scene. In 2018, it appeared at the Evolution Championship Series (EVO) annual fighting game championships in Las Vegas as a side tournament.

In an effort to raise further awareness and action by the major European powers, 28 armed men and women led primarily by Papken Siuni and Armen Garo took over the bank which largely employed European personnel from Great Britain and France. Stirred largely due to the inaction of the European powers in regard to Hamidian massacres, a series of mass-pogroms and massacres of Armenians instigated by the Sultan Abdul-Hamid II in reaction to a series of rebellions by Armenians against the state. The Armenian Revolutionary Federation members saw its seizure as their best attempt to bring full attention to their plight. The Ottoman Bank, at the time, served as an important financial center for both the Empire and the countries of Europe. Armed with pistols, grenades, dynamite and hand-held bombs, the seizure of the bank lasted for 14 hours, resulting in the deaths of ten of the Armenian men and Ottoman soldiers. The Ottoman reaction to the takeover saw further massacres and pogroms of 6,000 Armenians living in Constantinople and also Hamid threatening to level the entire building itself.Bloxham, Donald. The Great Game of Genocide: Imperialism, Nationalism, and the Destruction of The Ottoman Armenians. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 53. However, intervention on part of the European diplomats in the city managed to persuade the men to give way, assigning safe passage to the survivors to France. Despite the level of violence the Turks had wrought, the takeover was reported positively in the European press, praising the men for their courage and the objectives they attempted to accomplish.Balakian, Peter. The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response. New York: HarperCollins, 2003, pp. 107‚Äì8. Nevertheless, aside from issuing a note condemning the pogroms in the city, the European powers did not act on their promises to enforce reforms in the country as future massacres of Armenians continued to take place.  Background  Contrary to Ottoman claims, the Armenians suffered from persecution and forced assimilation under Ottoman rule. The Armenians lived in their own villages and city quarters, separate from the muslims. They were subjected to heavy taxes and were downgraded as a separate group of Ottoman society, called a millet. Various Armenians who were resentful of Ottoman persecution took up arms to defend their basic rights. This infuriated the Sultan 'Abdu'l-Hamid II who viewed the small resistance as a threat to his power. In the 1890s, up to 300,000 Armenians had been massacred on the implicit orders of Sultan Hamid, massacres commonly known as the Hamidian massacres.Akcam, Taner. A Shameful Act: The Armenian Genocide and the Question of Turkish Responsibility. New York: Metropolitan Books, 2006, p. 42. Activities  Armen Garo was one of the chief planners who survived = Planning = The Armenian Revolutionary Federation sought to stop the murder of Armenians and planned the bank takeover to gain the attention and intervention of world powers. The plan to occupy the Ottoman Bank was masterminded by Papken Siuni, who would lead the operation along with his head assistant, Hrach Tiryakian. When Armen Garo accepted to take part in the act in February 1896, the arrangements to raid the bank started. From the start, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation handed out fliers to the general population of the Ottoman Empire stating that their fight was not against them but the Ottoman Empire's oppression. The decision to take over the Ottoman Bank was a strategic one as the bank held many European treasuries which would therefore attract the Europeans' attention the Armenians wanted. The men had been singled out because \\"apart from the interests of the European powers the various financial markets would also suffer heavy loss through the destruction of their property.\\" = Seizure = On Wednesday, 26 August 1896, 13:00 o'clock, 26 Armenians from the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, armed with pistols and grenades and led by Papken Siuni, attacked and occupied the Ottoman Bank of Constantinople. The men entered the great hall of the Ottoman Bank armed with revolvers, daggers and dynamite bombs. Forming in small groups, they were accosted by one of the Albanian bank guards; they shot at him, triggering a shootout between the Armenians and the rest of the bank guards.Balakian. Burning Tigris, p. 105. During the initial part of the operation, nine of the attackers, including leader Papken Siuni were shot and killed in the firefight, and his role as leader of the operation was assumed by Armen Garo. Threats were issued that if their list of political demands were not met, all hostages would be executed. They clarified that their goal was to dictate their political will. = Mob violence = The Galata Bridge linked the old and newer parts of the city across the narrow estuary winding inland from the Golden Horn. On one side cobbled streets run up from the bridge to Topkapƒ± Palace, and the government offices. On the other the bridge opens up to the Galata financial district, from which narrow streets wind up other hills to the fashionable Beyolu area and finally Taksim Square at the top. On this side of the bridge the Armenian men concentrated in the Galata, Tunnel and Tarlabasi around Beyolu.Salt, Jeremy. Imperialism, Evangelism and the Ottoman Armenians, 1878‚Äì1896. London: Frank Cass, 1993, pp. 107‚Äì108. An Ottoman mob, mainly made up of bashibazouks and softas (students from the theological seminaries), took over a hotel in the city of Constantinople and bombs and shots and missiles fairly rained upon the heads of the passersby, wounding many persons. The mob surrounding the bank extended to several villages on the Bosporus including Tepe bashi and on the Asiatic coast of the Sea of Marmara. The weapons used by the populace were clubs and knives. The ulemas and softas,\\" most of whom resided in Constantinople, rushed across the bridge towards Pera and Galata but were met by squads of cavalry who forced them back, thus confining their efforts at massacre to the Armenians in the close region.Balakian. Burning Tigris, pp. 105‚Äì6. The Ottoman soldiers cut the bridge, thus preventing the riot from growing, but behind the barricade the deadly fight between the two group progressed with but little noise. As the massacre progressed, the bombs were thrown and pistol shots discharged from houses at various points with no apparent object. At the railroad depot on Seraglio Point an officer requested that some fifteen Armenian employees of the Oriental [sic] Express be delivered to him. Different sources also contain reports of the city's Jews simultaneously aiding Armenians and taking them into the shelter of their homes, as well as of them joining the Muslim mobs and partaking in the pillaging of Armenian shops and homes.See Julia Phillips Cohen, Becoming Ottomans: Sephardi Jews and Imperial Citizenship in the Modern Era. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014, pp. 75‚Äì77. = Negotiations = Surviving members of the takeover after they arrived in Marseille. On the same day, the revolutionaries sent a letter to the European major powers demanding that the sultan promise to attend to their demands and hand over the solution of the Armenian Question to an international judge. Otherwise, on the third day, they would blow themselves and the bank up. The following manifesto was issued to the Ottoman public: After fourteen hours of occupation and repelling government attempts to retake the bank, the ambassadors of Europe, principally through the good offices of Russian consul Maxmiov, and the director of the bank, Sir Edgar Vincent (Lord of Abernon), succeeded in persuading the Armenian men to leave the bank, by promising to meet to their demands as well as grant them safe passage out of the bank.Armenian Question Armenica Sir Edgar's secretary, told that their action would alienate the European powers and cause a 'fearful massacre of Armenians' but they replied that if they died they would do so as martyrs and patriots. They were assured of a pardon and unhindered departure from the city on board Sir Edgar Vincent's private yacht. Aftermath = Massacres = Retribution against the ordinary Armenian populace in Constantinople was swift and brutal. Ottomans loyal to the government began to massacre the Armenians in Constantinople itself. Two days into the takeover, the Ottoman softas and bashibazouks, armed by the Sultan, went on a rampage and slaughtered thousands of Armenians living in the city.Balakian. Burning Tigris, pp. 108‚Äì9. According to the foreign diplomats in Constantinople, Ottoman central authorities instructed the mob \\"to start killing Armenians, irrespective of age and gender, for the duration of 48 hours.\\"Balakian. Burning Tigris, p. 109. The killings only stopped when the mob was ordered to desist from such activity by Sultan Hamid. They murdered around 6,000 ‚Äì 7,000 Armenians. Within 48 hours of the bank seizure, estimates had the dead numbering between 3,000 and 4,000, as authorities made no effort to contain the killings of Armenians and the looting of their homes and businesses. On 15 September 1896, three weeks after the bank raid, Ottoman authorities organized a massacre in the town of Egin, in the eastern province of Harput. Egin was chosen as the target because the leader of the bank raiding party, Papken Siuni, was a native of the town. According to a report by the French Ambassador, Ottoman troops killed \\"upwards of 2000 Armenians\\" in Egin, including \\"many women and children\\". A report by the British Consul at Harput, citing figures supplied by an Ottoman official, says that 1500 were killed, including 200 women and children. Of the 1500 houses located in the Armenian quarter of Egin, 980 were pillaged and burned. According to another report by the British Consul at Harput, the pretext used to attack the town's Armenian quarter was an \\"indirect order\\" from the Sultan that \\"the Armenians of Egin were set to cause trouble and that the local authorities should 'take the necessary action'\\". The same report said that there was no revolutionary movement whatever, and the victims had given no offense. A few pistols and revolvers were found in the ruins of the burnt houses. In protest against all the massacres, the representatives of the major powers addressed an insulting letter to the sultan. Dadrian describes the Egin massacre as a \\"case of collective punishment through mass murder\\". = International response = The Armenian Revolutionary Federation's goals had been partially accomplished in getting the attention of the major powers. Despite the nature of the takeover of the bank, the brutality endured by the Armenian civilian population in the wake of the incident overshadowed the incident itself, renewing Western concern for Armenian safety in the Ottoman Empire. United States President Grover Cleveland, responding to widespread support for the Armenian cause galvanized by American missionaries stationed in the Ottoman Empire, condemned \\"the rage of mad bigotry and cruel fanaticism,\\" the \\"not infrequent reports of the wanton destruction of homes and the bloody butchery of men, women, and children, made martyrs to their profession of Christian faith.\\" > I do not believe that the present sombre prospect in Turkey will be long > permitted to offend the sight of Christendom. It so mars the humane and > enlightened civilization that belongs to the close of the 19th century that > it seems hardly possible that the earnest demand of good peoples throughout > the Christian world for its corrective treatment will remain unanswered. Cleveland rejected the possibility of asserting American military force to protect Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, offering accommodation to \\"those who seek to avoid the perils which threaten them in Turkish dominions.\\"  Cultural references  An Armenian Revolutionary Song titled Papken Siuniyi Hishadagin or popularly known as Ottoman Bank is about the events of the takeover.

The highway begins along the Gulf Coast near the northeast end of the Bolivar Peninsula at SH 87 and extends to the northeast ending at US 69 and US 96\\\\. In between, the highway has major intersections with SH 65 and SH 73\\\\. The highway is located in Galveston, Chambers, and Jefferson counties and also serves the communities of Hamshire, Fannett, and Cheek. A portion of SH 124 is part of a longer coastal hurricane evacuation route. The route number was originally assigned over a portion of the current SH 16 between Fredericksburg and Comanche in Central Texas during the late 1920s. By the early 1930s, the route number was assigned along the current route south of Stowell to High Island and along the current SH 87 to Port Bolivar and eventually Galveston. By the end of the decade, the highway received its current High Island to Beaumont configuration. Route description SH 124 begins at SH 87 in High Island along the Gulf Coast near the northeastern end of the Bolivar Peninsula in Galveston County. SH 87 from this point toward Sabine Pass has been closed since 1990 due to coastal erosion. The highway proceeds to the north climbing up a salt dome where the central portion of High Island is located. Leaving town, the highway travels back downhill entering marshland where the highway enters Chambers County upon bridging the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The highway leaves the marshland and continues north with FM 1985 branching to the west and then FM 1941\\\\. Further north, the highway passes through Stowell where SH 65 branches off to the west. In Stowell and Winnie, the route is known as Gulfway Drive south of SH 73. The highway intersects FM 1406 in Winnie and then turns east along SH 73 meeting the terminus of FM 1406 on the town's eastern edge at the boundary with Jefferson County. The highway shortly branches off of SH 73 to the northeast passing through Hamshire, intersecting FM 365 at Fannett, and then passing through Cheek. The highway continues to the northeast on a course closely parallel Interstate 10 into Beaumont. FM 364 branches off to the north as the highway enters Beaumont where it as known as Fannett Road. The highway then terminates at US 69 / US 96 / US 287 in southern Beaumont. The portion of SH 124 from its south end at SH 87 to FM 1406 in Winnie is part of a longer hurricane evacuation route extending northward to US 90. History left SH 124 was originally designated along a route from Fredericksburg to Comanche passing through Llano, San Saba, and Goldthwaite on September 9, 1927. On March 19, 1930, that previous route was reassigned as part of SH 81 and is now part of SH 16, while SH 124 was designated over a new route from Port Bolivar along the current SH 87 to High Island, and then over the current SH 124 to Stowell, replacing a split of SH 125 that was designated on December 16, 1929. The route terminated in Stowell at SH 125 which then was made up of the present SH 65 between Stowell and Anahuac and the current SH 124 to Beaumont. The state highway department assumed control of the ferry service between Port Bolivar and Galveston in 1930 and resumed operations in 1934 after making extensive renovations extending SH 124 to US 75 and SH 6 in Galveston. On March 17, 1936, the portion of SH 124 from Galveston to High Island was renamed as an extension of SH 87. On September 26, 1939, SH 125 between Anahuac and Stowell was renamed as part of SH 73 and SH 124 was extended over the remainder of SH 125 including a concurrent portion of SH 73 between Stowell and Winnie to Beaumont terminating at US 90.

A drug addict and alcoholic, he had been sentenced to die on June 29, 2001, for beating his 79-year-old father and 72-year-old mother to death with a hammer. The crimes occurred on September 19, 2000, when Mink, angry with his parents because they hid his car keys to prevent him from leaving the house to buy drugs and alcohol, attacked William and Sheila Mink while they slept in their rural Montgomery County home. Enraged at being thwarted in his quest to get high, Mink beat his sleeping parents with a claw hammer until the head broke. He then battered them with cutting boards until those shattered. Finally, he repeatedly stabbed his parents with kitchen knives and strangled his mother with an electrical cord. Mink then stole his parents' credit cards and sold their belongings to purchase crack cocaine. He later confessed the brutal slayings to police. He pleaded guilty before a panel of three judges and asked for a death sentence, which the judges handed down. Under Ohio law, all death sentences are automatically reviewed by an appellate court regardless of the inmate's desire to appeal. After his conviction was upheld by the Ohio Supreme Court on direct appeal in April 2004, Mink dropped his efforts to fight his sentence. Mink spent 1,118 days (i.e., 3 years and 23 days) on death row before being executed by lethal injection ‚Äì the second- shortest time, aside from Rocky Barton, since Ohio began executing criminals in 1999.

An agar plate is first spread with bacteria, then paper disks of antibiotics are placed atop of it. The bacteria is then allowed to grow on the agar media and then observed for growth and effect of the antibiotic on it. The amount of space around every antibiotic disk indicates the lethality of that antibiotic on the bacteria in question. Highly effective antibiotics (disk C) will produce a wide ring of no bacterial growth, while an ineffective antibiotic (disk A) will show no change in the surrounding bacterial concentration at all. The effectiveness of intermediate antibiotics (disk B) can be measured using their zone of inhibition. This method is used to determine the best antibiotic to use against a new or drug-resistant pathogen. The disk diffusion test, or agar diffusion test, or Kirby-Bauer test (disc-diffusion antibiotic susceptibility test, disc-diffusion antibiotic sensitivity test, KB test), is an antibiotic susceptibility test. It uses antibiotic discs to test the extent to which bacteria are affected by those antibiotics. In this test, wafers containing antibiotics are placed on an agar plate where bacteria have been placed, and the plate is left to incubate. If an antibiotic stops the bacteria from growing or kills the bacteria, there will be an area around the wafer where the bacteria have not grown enough to be visible. This is called a zone of inhibition. The size of this zone depends on many factors, one being how effective the antibiotic is at stopping the growth of the bacterium. Another factor that will influence the size of a zone is the diffusion of the antibiotic within the agar medium and varies based on the molecular configuration of the antibiotic. Once the zone diameter is measured it must be compared to a database of zone standards to determine if the bacterium being studied is susceptible, moderately susceptible, or resistant to the antibiotic in question. A pure bacterial culture is suspended in a buffer, standardized to turbidity, and swabbed uniformly across a culture plate. A filter-paper disk impregnated with the compound to be tested is then placed on the surface of the agar. The compound diffuses from the filter paper into the agar. The concentration of the compound will be highest next to the disk and will decrease as the distance from the disk increases. If the compound is effective against bacteria at a certain concentration, no colonies will grow where the concentration in the agar is greater than or equal to the effective concentration. This is the zone of inhibition. This along with the rate of antibiotic diffusion are used to estimate the bacteria's susceptibility to that particular antibiotic. In general, larger zones correlate with smaller minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotic for that bacteria. Inhibition produced by the test is compared with that produced by known concentration of a reference compound. This information can be used to choose appropriate antibiotics to combat a particular infection.Mohanty, A. (2010): Physiochemical and antimicrobial study of polyherbal. Pharmacie globale. Vol. 4(4) 1-3. Standardization A close-up look at the results of an agar diffusion test. Inoculation is made with a broth culture diluted to match a 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard, which is roughly equivalent to 150 million cells per mL. Kirby-Bauer testing: White wafers containing antibiotics shown on plate of bacteria. Circles of poor bacterial growth surround some wafers, indicating susceptibility to the antibiotic =Preparation= All aspects of the Kirby- Bauer procedure are standardized to ensure consistent and accurate results. Because of this, a laboratory must adhere to these standards. The media used in Kirby-Bauer testing must be Mueller-Hinton agar at only 4 mm deep, poured into either 100 mm or 150 mm Petri dishes. The pH level of the agar must be between 7.2 and 7.4. =Incubation procedure= # Using an aseptic technique, place a sterile swab into the broth culture of a specific organism and then gently remove the excess liquid by gently pressing or rotating the swab against the inside of the tube. # Using the swab, streak the Mueller-Hinton agar plate to form a bacterial lawn. #* To obtain uniform growth, streak the plate with the swab in one direction, rotate the plate 90¬∞ and streak the plate again in that direction. #* Repeat this rotation 3 times. # Allow the plate to dry for approximately 5 minutes. # Use an antibiotic disc dispenser to dispense discs containing specific antibiotics onto the plate. # Using a flame-sterilized forceps, gently press each disc to the agar to ensure that the disc is attached to the agar. # Plates should be incubated overnight at an incubation temperature of 37 ¬∞C (98.6 ¬∞F).

Zone sizes are measured from the edge of the disk to the end of the clear zone. Interpretation is more complicated in mixed susceptibility populations (cf. BSAC). These are plotted as linear dimensions or squares of distances as a function of the natural logarithm of antibiotic concentration in the disks. The MIC is determined from the zero intercept of a linear regression fit through the data (cf. agardiffusion.com). The intercept itself is the logarithm of the MIC. The slope of the regression line is related to the diffusion coefficient of that particular antibiotic in the agar.

Weber described himself as a left-wing liberal. An example of his 19th-century liberal views is staunch nationalism based on classical republicanism, and that a nation with freedom for individuals is maintained by the virtues and character of its citizens. He also had a strong belief in the benefits of capitalism. Weber's assertion that capitalism had deep Christian origins was, ultimately, a political defense of the market system. His work stands in sharp contrast to socialists like Werner Sombart or RH Tawney, who argued that capitalism was fundamentally un-Christian. Nationalism Weber started his career as a German celebrity in 1894. As a result of his authoritative study of the so-called Ostflucht, he had a major influence on German policy towards the Germanisation of eastern Germany. He proposed closing the border to Polish workers from Russia and Austria-Hungary in his speech at the Fifth Evangelical Social Congress in 1894. He feared that Germany would eventually lose these eastern territories. He advocated the recolonisation of empty lands on the large estates of the Prussian Junkers by German settlers from the west, who would start small farms. The congress was mainly against Weber's demands because it supported the Prussian Junkers, but Weber influenced his friends and allies, including the pastor Friedrich Naumann, who later became an influential politician and one of the founders of the liberal Deutsche Demokratische Partei after World War I. In 1905, Weber changed his mind. He was impressed by the attitude of the Russian liberal party, which wanted to change Russian nationalism by accepting ethnic minorities as Russians. Weber wanted the Germans to absorb other ethnic groups, especially the Poles, who should have become a part of a huge German empire. Weber thought that the only way that German culture would survive was by creating an empire. Power politics was to be the basis for defending the German culture and economy and to prevent it from becoming a powerless country like Switzerland. Weber disliked the empty nationalist ideas of many German nationalists. He thought that power alone was not an acceptable goal, that politicians should stand for certain ideas but that they need a strong will to power to win. This idea of the will to power was derived from Nietzsche, who was very popular in the Germany of the 1890s. Nietzsche's conception of will to power could be interpreted both individually and culturally; Weber borrowed the cultural and communal sense as a will to power to make a collective entity (like Germany) stronger. Weber wanted Germany to strengthen its economy by creating a huge empire. He was afraid of the huge world population that would lead to German unemployment in the long run and believed that the only way to support the German workers was to create an empire. He was afraid that an end would come to economic expansion and that countries would protect their own economy with tariff barriers. He did not foresee the technological advances and the profits of international trade for the national economy in the twentieth century. Class Weber wanted to end the rule of the German nobility. He despised the red scare of the middle classes, because the middle classes let the nobility rule. In his opinion, the socialist parties were harmless, because they would turn into middle classes in due time. The nobility was only holding Germany back from becoming a major power in the world. In his opinion, which he expressed in the media and his politics, the middle classes should have united against the aristocracy. This led to a lot of dismay in right wing Germany. Weber was against the student fraternities which idolised military ranks. He wanted to stop the agrarian lobby damaging the regulations in the stock exchange. He was especially against the buying of titles and noble land by the upper bourgeoisie. Weber wanted unlimited economic growth. Not military ranks, but ability and talent should be important for one's prospects. He believed that money should be put into a company and not wasted in an unproductive piece of land. Weber feared the inefficiency of the economy in Roman Catholic, non-puritanical countries and was afraid that Germany would become like Austria: Ver√∂sterreicherung Deutschlands. The First World War Weber was against the German annexation plans during the First World War, but he was also against a dishonourable peace. He did not believe that Germany could dominate the ethnic minorities after winning the war, but that Germany should work together with German- dominated nations and make them enthusiastic about German imperialism. Weber wrote a series of newspaper articles in 1917, entitled \\"Parliament and Government in a Re-constructed Germany.\\" These articles called for democratic reforms to the 1871 constitution of the German Empire. Weber argued that Germany's political problems were essentially a problem of leadership. Otto von Bismarck had created a constitution that preserved his own power, but limited the ability of another powerful leader to succeed him, because of the limited experience of the political establishment with decision-making. In January 1919, Weber's brother was a founding member of the German Democratic Party. =Democracy and socialism= Weber advocated democracy as a means for selecting strong leaders. He viewed democracy as a form of charismatic leadership where the \\"demagogue imposes his will on the masses.\\" For this reason, the European left is often critical of Weber for, albeit unwittingly, \\"preparing the intellectual groundwork for the leadership position of Adolf Hitler.\\" His view on the Social Democratic Party was different. He thought that the Social Democrats would become liberals after a while and get rid of their revolutionary ideals. Weber wanted to make the working classes enthusiastic about Germany and German imperialism, but later on he realized that this was impossible. Later on he changed his mind and realized that the imperial expansion of Germany was not in the interest of the working classes and only strengthened the power of the German establishment. Only the middle classes could make Germany into a huge empire. Weber wanted to unify Germany and to give the German working classes co-responsibility in the German government, but not out of an ideal of equality. He was against compassion. He wanted to create responsibility. Making an end to capitalism and enlarging of the bureaucracy would only lead to more enslavement of the workers. The only possible way for salvation would be the capitalist system and the application of new techniques. Weber openly supported strikes and labour unions, while right-wing Germans were very opposed to this. Weber was very opposed to the conservatives that tried to hold back the democratic liberation of the working classes. Weber further dismayed the left when one of his students, Carl Schmitt (1888-1985), incorporated Weber's theories into a corpus of Nazi legal propaganda. Weber's personal and professional letters show considerable disgust for the anti-semitism of his day. It is doubtful that Weber would have supported the Nazis, had he lived long enough to see their doings. =Conservatism= Weber was very critical of German conservatives and the German emperor. Before the First World War, he believed that William II was a weak leader, who, with the conservatives, was destroying Germany's diplomatic position. The 1908 Daily Telegraph interview of William II, especially, was a great disappointment in his view. During the First World War, Weber was very critical of the German government. He thought that the right-wing Alldeutscher Verband and the German army leaders were making Germany lose the war. He was against the undemocratic views of the right, which alienated the working class and resulted in strikes and revolution. He was opposed to unlimited submarine warfare, which resulted in a declaration of war from the United States. Weber was afraid of too much bureaucracy. In 1912, he heard that officials of the government were working together with officials of large corporate companies. Weber wanted to create a large, left-wing, political party combining social democrats and left-wing liberals to counter the bureaucratic threat. The social democrats were willing to talk with Weber, as they were eager to lose their isolation in the German society and politics. The plan failed because very few liberals prepared to help Weber. =Ending the war= Weber was opposed to the majority of the German parliament, which was for peace negotiations, and he strongly advocated continuing the war in many newspaper articles. At the same time, the right-wing, supported by the army, was agitating against the parliament's decision. When he found that peace was requested because of the near collapse of Austria, which had been kept secret from the press, he became enraged, for the army had known about the coming collapse of Austria. Weber strongly denounced the German emperor and the German army and advocated peace in a speech at a mass meeting in Munich accompanied by a social-democratic speaker. This speech led to sympathy among socialists for Weber. Weber openly advocated resistance to the allies in 1918. He hoped that the battle would go on until the whole of Germany was occupied, and wanted to defend the eastern cities of Thorn, Danzig and Reichenberg against the Poles and the Czechs. He tried to win over the working classes who wanted to end the war and hoped for international revolution. Weber was against the revolution of 1918 because he feared that a strong right-wing reaction would follow. He tactically called himself a socialist, but the revolting workers regarded him as old-fashioned. Social democratic president Friedrich Ebert of Germany wanted him as Minister of the Interior in November 1918, but he later chose Hugo Preuss. Ebert then wanted Weber as ambassador in Vienna, but Weber's anti-government attitude in speeches made this impossible. In early 1919, he lost a possible seat in the German parliament because of his alienation from the revolution in 1918. Weber was a member of the German delegation during the peace negotiations over the Treaty of Versailles. Weber at first wanted Germany not to sign the treaty, but he feared that it would make things only worse for Germany after a while. For months, he was unsure whether or not signing was a better decision.

It opens in the early 19th century as Scacerni returns to Italy from Russia, where he had served as a soldier of Napoleon's invasion, and follows him and his family through a full century until the First World War. Scacerni owns a mill in a rural area on the river Po (hence the title). He and his descendants conduct their lives amid political turmoil, wars, economic hardship, and class conflicts. The historical, geographical and social background was painstakingly researched by Bacchelli, who created a large and comprehensive portrait of life in rural Italy in the 19th century. The language and style of this novel show that Bacchelli held Alessandro Manzoni as his model. At the same time, he created a structure that showed his attention to contemporary European novels.Giulio Ferroni (1992) Profilo storico della letteratura italiana, Einaudi scuola, Milano 1992, p. 956: \\"strutture narrative spesso acute e sottili, che mostrano una notevole attenzione alle forme del contemporaneo romanzo europeo.\\" References External links * * http://www.maat.it/livello2/fascismo-manifesto.htm * http://www.riccardobacchelli.it/ Category:1891 births Category:1985 deaths Category:People from Bologna Category:20th-century Italian novelists Category:20th-century Italian male writers Category:Viareggio Prize winners Category:Members of the Royal Academy of Italy ","title":"Riccardo Bacchelli"},{"id":"6677189","text":"Sir Robert Alexander Falla (21 July 1901 ‚Äì 23 February 1979) was a New Zealand museum administrator and ornithologist.

He was exposed to a variety of music, as his father preferred Van Cliburn, his mother had a strong taste for gospel. Berry grew up listening to an AM station from Atlanta; \\"It was on in dad's garage constantly, WQXI 79 AM,\\" Berry says. \\"They played a pretty eclectic selection, country and Top 40 in the 1970s.\\" Berry began learning the guitar in 1972 (at the age of 12), he has named influences such as James Taylor, Harry Chapin, and, his favourite, John Denver. In a 2006 interview he said: \\"prior to playing guitar, I really loved the ‚ÄúPhilly Soul Sound‚Äù like The Chi-Lites and The Stylistics.\\" Berry moved to soul, gospel and country music and began recording his own albums at home in 1979.Country singer John Berry headlines benefit concert - journal- news.net  News, sports, jobs, community information for Martinsburg - The Journal In 1981, at age 21, while riding his motorcycle, Berry was hit by a car, breaking both of his legs and his left hip. He had just lost his mother earlier that year. Doctors were afraid that he may not walk again. He spent several months in physical therapy, working to regain the use of his legs. Berry said of the incident \\"The coolest thing in the world that came out of it...all I could do is sit on my stool and play guitar. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done ever since.\\" Two years later, Berry started performing solo acoustic shows in northeast Georgia (Athens, Georgia), then expanded around the southeast, building a strong name and following. He eventually made six self-produced albums, with the last one selling over 10,000 copies. He was finally signed to Liberty Records in 1992. Berry received high praise from former President George H.W. Bush and wife Barbara when she invited him to sing for Mr. Bush's birthday party. Early In 1994, Berry began to have terrible headaches, lost his appetite and finally blacked out during a concert. He was rushed to the hospital on May 9, 1994 in Atlanta, where a cyst was found in the third ventricle of his brain. He stated: They went in with a fiber optic camera and laser, and removed it. I still suffer a little from short-term memory loss. This is a rebirth of sorts and I am into that. He uses humor when he occasionally forgets the words to a song and his wife, Robin, uses sign language to assist him. The same day he underwent brain surgery, he celebrated his first No. 1 single, \\"Your Love Amazes Me\\", from his hospital bed in Atlanta. In 1997, a year before recording his Wildest Dreams album (released in 1999), Berry again had surgery, for nodes on his vocal cords.

It has one inoperative concrete runway, RWY 05/23 with the dimensions of . There is a displaced threshold length of on both RWY 05 and RWY 23, yielding a landing distance of . However, coal-mining activity damaged the runway and it is no longer used. The parallel 770-metre grass RWY 05/23 is also closed per NOTAM until the end of 2007. This leaves the 655-metre grass RWY 07/25 as the sole working runway. History The airport was built in the 1920s, and was used for civil aviation including scheduled passenger traffic, starting in 1926 with service to Warsaw, later also to Cracow, Vienna via Brno. Ground damage due to coal-mining activity eliminated the passenger traffic, and now only the sport use remains with infrequent general aviation arrivals and departures. On the other hand, because of the long commute from the city centre to the 30 km- distant Katowice International Airport, it has been proposed to the Katowice government in 2005 that a city airport be built at Katowice-Muchowiec Airport, offloading Katowice International for general aviation as well as some smaller scheduled traffic, serving primarily the business community and STOL aircraft. Modernisation proposals Katowice (321 thousand inhabitants, 4,5 million in nearby GOP conurbation) intended to transform its inner-city airport (current runway length: 1110 metres, width: 30 metres) into a proper City-Airport (there is limited space for the enlargement of the landing strip to approx. 1500 metres) that would serve this densely populated coal basin. However, only smaller aircraft could use it, and it would serve rather domestic and business traffic. It was recently decided that building new concrete runway parallel to ul. Lotnisko (Lotnisko Street) with dimensions 850 x 25 metres is the best course of action. Further modernization would require also building new facilities, including a passenger terminal. It is unclear how the proposed improvements are to be squared with the conditions which forced the cessation of passenger traffic in the first place. As of summer 2007, work on fixing the airport has stalled because of a court fight between its resident sport airclubs (aeroclubs) over airport's real estate (nominally owned by the city, but handed over to the airclubs in perpetual lease).

The network was based in Nashville, Tennessee, in the United States, and is available in more than 50 countries. It was owned by Christian Network, Inc. (CNI). The network was broadcast on a digital subchannel of ION Television's owned and operated stations placed after Ion Plus on a station's digital channel map, usually broadcasting on the -DT4 subchannel. However, ION dropped the network from its stations on January 31, 2010.  History  The Worship Network (launched through CNI) was founded in 1992 by Lowell W. \\"Bud\\" Paxson, co-founder of HSN, who later founded the PAX TV network (now ION Television). Paxson, an evangelical Christian since 1985, wanted to \\"create an atmosphere in the home to inspire and encourage a quiet time to worship God\\"http://worship.net/history.html and from that vision, Worship was launched. Outlets for the new network increased rapidly. By 1994, there were 50 affiliate stations and Worship had just begun its first European affiliate, in Iceland, and a year later, the number had doubled to 100 affiliates and the network had launched in Asia, in the region of Taiwan. In 1996, the network began satellite broadcasting, via Sky Angel. When the PAX TV network was launched in 1998, Worship provided overnight programming, and in 2005, PAX TV and Worship struck a deal where the network would be carried on a digital subchannel of PAX TV stations 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In 2006, the network had more than 250 broadcast affiliates, and is available on every inhabited continent. In 2006, the network began producing shows in HD (high definition), although it does not broadcast in HD. In 2010, Worship was dropped from digital Ion Television owned-and-operated stations. The Worship Network ceased updating its Web site and social media in 2013. In January 2015, in a statement mourning Paxson's death, The Worship Network's parent company stated it was still operating the network and would \\"continue to do our best\\" to keep it running according to Paxson's vision. Most of the channels that had carried The Worship Network programming in overnights have since flipped to Radiant TV, an unrelated but similarly formatted network produced by WLMB.  Programming  The Worship Network's main program, called \\"Worship\\", consisted simply of Bible scriptures displayed on a nature backdrop, while contemporary Christian worship music played in the background. Interspersed among the videos and music are brief stories of faith, narrated by worship leaders. From 2005, when the network began their 24/7 digital broadcast, other forms of programming were added to this mix. Newer programs included infomercials featuring Christian products, comedy specials featuring Christian comedians, and concerts produced by Worship.  Expanded distribution  The Worship Network programming was available from several other sources apart from their 24/7 digital broadcast. The NRB Network on DirecTV played Worship during the early morning hours. Sky Angel carries a 24/7 feed of Worship on its IPTV platform. Worship provided a 24/7 live stream of its broadcast as well as much of its programming via on-demand streaming from its official website. Many of Worship's programs were available on DVD, also available at the official website.

The theatre currently faces on to Courtenay Place, the main street of Wellington's entertainment district, opposite the Reading Cinema complex. The building is number 83.McGill, D. 1998. Full Circle: The History of the St. James Theatre. Phantom House Books. .McGill, D. 2003. Wellington: A Capital Century. Transpress. . The building is classified as a \\"Category I\\" (\\"places of special or outstanding historical or cultural heritage significance or value\\") historic place by Heritage New Zealand. History The St. James has had a long history, with its success in its early years, a near demolition in the 1980s and to its return to the city's cultural light in the late 1990s. The theatre's land had been used as a church and volunteer hall prior to it being bought by the famous entertainer John Fuller on 23 December 1899. The St. James was made famous by Fuller, who had also built over 60 other theatres in New Zealand. He revamped the hall in 1903 and named it \\"His Majesty's Theatre\\", or nicknamed \\"Fuller's\\". During its use, the hall was host to pantomimes and a Cleopatra act, which involved the first and last import of snakes into New Zealand. However, opera of any kind was seldom allowed by Fuller, who usually directed any opera show to Wellington's Opera House down the road. Fuller used the old hall until November 1911, when it was eventually declared a fire hazard and demolished. Statue of Apollo, similar to the sculptures presented in the St. James. After this demolition, Fuller vowed the new theatre he was going to build would be the best in New Zealand. Fuller enlisted the help of Henry Eli White, who had already designed other theatres around the country for Fuller. White, fresh from building theatres in Timaru and Auckland, set out to plan the St. James. The St. James was the first entirely steel frame and reinforced concrete theatre in the world and plans made sure over 650 people could escape the auditorium in the event of a fire. Pillars in the auditorium were also kept at a minimum to allow perfect viewing, and seating was arranged in the arc of a circle to view the stage. The St. James was then adorned with marble pieces, carved face masks and cherubs to be placed on the ceiling and coloured glass. The plaster work was made by William Leslie Morrison, who reinforced the lime plaster with cow hair. Morrison used his grandson as a model for the plaster cherubs and modelled the full figured seen near the stage after Bacchus and Apollo. The wooden floors of the St. James were made of rimu and jarrah, along with totara for window frames and deal for doors. After the plans had been set, construction began on the theatre in March 1912. To speed progress, White himself designed two electric cranes to lift the in excess of 500 tonnes of steel. In all, the St. James cost ¬£32,000 to build and took 9 months to build. The theatre was officially opened 8pm on Boxing Day, 1912, by the Wellington Mayor, David McLaren. During the new theatre's first months, it was used primarily to play silent movies. The St. James was changed nine months later to present live performances. However, in 1930, after 17 years, it was again converted back to playing both movies and occasional live performances. This was after the St. James's lifelong opposition, the Opera House, began screening movies. After this change to the \\"talking films\\" or \\"flicks\\", on 3 May 1930, His Majesty's was closed and reopened as the St. James Theatre. Over the years, the St. James was slowly brought back to showing live performances. Many shows were performed at the venue; everything from Shakespeare, to minstrel acts to ballet. After Fuller died, the St. James passed through numerous owners. =Decline and restoration= After its enormous success over the past decades, in the 1970s, the St. James fell into decline and was effectively closed down. Shows began performing at the Opera House and newer venues such as the Michael Fowler Centre, Downstage and the restored town hall. Rumours of ghosts haunting upper seat levels didn't help the theatre's reputation either and soon the theatre was forgotten. On 7 May 1987, the St. James played its last movie, 'Wanted: Dead or Alive', to a small group. Months prior to this last showing a \\"Save the St James\\" campaign had been launched by a group including PeterHarcourt, GrantSheehan, AnnPacey, RexMcNichols, JohnSaker, They, along with family members, had lobbied, and pamphletted patrons to that end and continued in their endeavours. The site was then declared unpractical and was abandoned. The theatre was nearly demolished in the 1980s and '90s after the owners placed a destruction order on the plot. However, due to the efforts of an objecting group, the St. James was eventually spared and restored to its former glory. The alarm had been risen after a photographer, Grant Sheehan, was told by the theatre's curator that the St. James was set to be demolished by the Chase Corporation. For nearly a decade, a wrecking ball sat poised above the theatre, but it was never used after the owners were finally persuaded to save the property. The company looking to build on the site, Chase, were still angered by the result, so a trade off was made by the committee vouching for the St. James; Chase would be allowed to build a tower in Wellington exceeding current height restrictions if the committee could save the theatre. The offer was highly contested, with some companies near the new tower protesting at its aimed size. The Opera House objected to the St. James's restoration, saying that the city would not be able to sustain two theatres. In any case, the council rejected the committee's proposal to allow Chase to build higher. Chase retaliated and immediately asked the council for a demolition permit. However, the council slowed progress on getting the report so the Historic Places Trust could add the St. James to its list. The plan succeeded and a limited protection order was placed over the St. James. Now Chase could only demolish the site with consent from the Trust. Knowing that the protection order would only last for a limited time (in fact only until 31 March 1988), there was a frantic rush to get Chase to sell the building to the council so they could restore it. Fundraising events were commonplace during this time, most asking for donations towards the \\"Save the St. James fund\\". Eventually, after hard negotiations the plan to sell and restore the theatre went ahead, due to the theatre's good aspects and proximity to the city's hot-spots. Owing to the increasing number of theatre-going public, the Opera House would not be able to support the demand, especially when the Wellington Festival of the Arts arrived. The council finally agreed to allow Chase to plan its tower in Willis Street in return for $7 million to refurbish the theatre; the other option that was not taken was for the government to raise $18 million to purchase and restore the building. However, once again bad luck fell upon the deal, when the financial crash of 1987 struck most companies in New Zealand, including Chase. The building and deal was abandoned once again and time passed with no results. Chase had not secured a tenant for its new tower and the council began to doubt whether it should spend millions on a single theatre. After the finish line for the protection order over the St. James ended, Chase gave their word that the theatre would not be demolished. Eventually, Chase went into liquidation and all its properties were put up for sale. The St. James was put on the market for $7 million, double what Chase had paid for it. The council declined and over the months, the price fell dramatically as Chase saw an absence of offers. The price fell to below what even Chase had paid for the theatre. The council still declined and a massive campaign to save the theatre arose. Eventually on 22 September 1993, the council sought to buy the property and succeeded with their offer of $550,000. The council handed the St. James over to a new St. James Theatre Charitable Trust. Soon it was booked out and live performances were shown frequently. An $18.5 million restoration plan was set out in 1995. However, this was considered worth the risk, as it was estimated the theatre would bring over $3.6 million into the local economy. In 1996, the council gave a $10.7 million contribution towards the restoration plan, in addition to $2.4 million from a Wellington Community Trust grant, $3.5 million from the Lottery Board and over $1 million in donation from the public. The total of around $17.7 million allowed the St. James Trust to confirm they would start restoring the theatre. =Current situation= Restoration work finished in late 1997. Most of the theatre's aspects were modified, including the addition of \\"The Jimmy\\" a caf√© on the theatre's ground floor. \\"The Jimmy\\" was the nickname given to the St. James Theatre by technicians, thus the name was utilised. \\"The Jimmy\\" was replaced by a Mojo cafe in 2016. The St. James currently holds many shows and a large portion of the New Zealand International Arts Festival. The building also hosts the Royal New Zealand Ballet. Art shows are often held on its second floor, as well as conferences. The theatre was also fitted with an orchestra pit, which is located many stories below the stage's level. The bank operating in Australia and New Zealand, Westpac until 2007 held the naming rights to St. James, as well as other stadiums, including the Westpac Stadium, also in Wellington. A face-lift of the facade in 2007 included removing the Westpac name from the Brickwork frontage. In July 2011 Positively Wellington Venues, an integration between the Wellington Convention Centre and the St James Theatre Trust, began managing this theatre along with five other venues in the capital city. Engineering assessments in 2015, led the building to be yellow stickered, as it was measured to be 20-30 percent of the current building standards. Earthquake strengthening began in April 2018, with the building to be reopened in 2019 after 10‚Äì12 months work.https://www.pressreader.com/new-zealand/the- dominion-post/20170218/283025464401306 Paranormal happenings There have been numerous unconfirmed reports of several spirits or ghosts in the St. James Theatre. The ghost most commonly referred to in these narratives is that of Yuri, a Russian performer who supposedly fell to his death from the flies several metres above the stage. Another account, more widely accepted, says he was pushed by a female named Pasha, also a Russian performer. Witnesses claim that they have encountered Yuri playing with the lights, especially turning them all back on again once cleaners have left for the night. One projectionist claims Yuri saved his life twice. While on stage, the lights went out in the auditorium. While searching for the light switch, he was pushed backwards by what he believed was Yuri. The lights turned back on and the projectionist realised he was only inches from the orchestra pit and if he had not been pushed back, would have fallen in. The second time he says Yuri saved him was when he was on stage with his infant son. He suddenly heard a beam collapse above him. The projectionist insists he was pushed back by Yuri and that his son was \\"carried\\" through the air for about 3 metres. Other than Yuri, many other ghosts have been reported in the theatre. Accounts frequently refer to the \\"Wailing Woman\\", the ghost of an actress said to wail throughout the theatre. She was allegedly trying to make a comeback, but instead was booed off the stage, causing her to commit suicide by slitting her wrists. There are different version to where the suicide happened, with some claiming it was at her home or in her dressing room. She is also said to be the cause of many of the odd occurrences surrounding lead actresses in plays performed at the St. James; many actresses performing on stage have sprained their ankle, one fell from a ladder, one suddenly caught a cold and was hoarse for her opera part. Another ghost is that of Stan Andrews. He is often heard wheezing around the backstage corridors at night, checking on his ushers. Also, a boy's choir is said to haunt the auditorium. The choir played their last song at the St. James during World War II before sailing off on tour. Their ship was never seen again and workers at the theatre often hear their music in the stands. However, when they investigate the sound, it moves to a separate part of the seats. The reason why there is so much paranormal activity at the theatre is disputed, although there have been claims that the old choral hall was built on a cemetery or burial ground. This claim however, has never been proved. The paranormal activity of the St. James was investigated in 2005 on the New Zealand television show Ghost Hunt. The three investigators captured paranormal photographs and numerous orbs inside the building and the elevator used suddenly began to malfunction which is a common among workers moving instruments from the orchestra pit to the loading bay. The programme also featured other haunted locations around New Zealand.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives translations of \\"place of [a] crooked fishing post\\" for ≈åpononi and \\"place of cutty grass\\" for ≈åmƒÅpere. Demographics The statistical area of Waipoua Forest, which is much larger than the Opononi-≈åmƒÅpere settlement area at 278 square kilometres, stretches from the Hokianga south coast to the boundary with Kaipara District. It had a population of 1,215 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 180 people (17.4%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 96 people (8.6%) since the 2006 census. There were 504 households. There were 579 males and 633 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.91 males per female. Of the total population, 222 people (18.3%) were aged up to 15 years, 162 (13.3%) were 15 to 29, 516 (42.5%) were 30 to 64, and 318 (26.2%) were 65 or older.

Of those at least 15 years old, 123 (12.4%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 219 (22.1%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $18,800. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 270 (27.2%) people were employed full-time, 195 (19.6%) were part-time, and 72 (7.3%) were unemployed. History =European settlement= The first European settler in the ≈åmƒÅpere area was John Martin, who arrived in the Hokianga Harbour in 1827. In 1832 Martin purchased land on the flat area, along the beach at ≈åmƒÅpere. In 1838 Martin extended his land purchase to the Hokianga Harbour's South Head, where he established a signal station to guide ships crossing the challenging harbour entrance. The signal station remained in operation until 1951. In 1869, a bush licence was granted to Charles Bryers at ≈åmƒÅpere. In the mid 1870s, a liquor licence was then given to the establishment called the 'Heads'. This later became the 'Travellers Rest'. By 1876 the farm of John Martin had become the township of Pakia. It was home to a hotel, two stores, several houses and a school house. The name ≈åmƒÅpere began to be used more frequently and became ≈åmƒÅpere by residents agreement in 1874. In 1855, John Webster, who had arrived in New Zealand in 1841, bought 700 acres of rough land at Opononi and established a homestead and pastoral farm which he developed into a showplace, entertaining vice-royalty several times. He also built a wharf, gum-store and a trading store. In 1894, Webster put the house and farm on the market. The store and gum store were taken over by Alfred Sprye Andrewes who later converted the gum store into a two storey hotel. =20th century= The Opononi Post and Telephone was opened in 1892 and operated until 1989. The road between Opononi and ≈åmƒÅpere was developed in the mid 1930s leading to ribbon development. In 1959, a fire destroyed the Opononi Hotel and Opononi Store. Opononi became famous throughout New Zealand in the summer of 1955 and 1956 due to the exploits of a dolphin called Opo. =Marae= The area has three marae affiliated with the NgƒÅpuhi hap≈´ of NgƒÅti Korokoro, NgƒÅti WhƒÅrara and Te PoukƒÅ: * PƒÅkanae Marae and Maraeroa meeting house * K≈çk≈çhuia or ≈åmƒÅpere Marae and Te Whakarongotai meeting house (also affiliated with NgƒÅti Te Pou) * Waiwhatawhata or Aotea Marae and Te Kaiwaha meeting house. In October 2020, the Government committed $470,000 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade Pakanae Marae, creating 11 jobs. Education The first school was the Pakia Native School which opened in 1874 under the Native School Act. In 1912 the school was renamed Omapere. Opononi did not have a school of its own and children either went to Pakia/Omapere School, or after it opened in 1909, to Pakanae School. In 1974, the newly built Opononi Area School replaced both.

Spalding is presumed to be named after the market town of Spalding, Lincolnshire in the UK. History Prior to 1869, there were five sheep runs in the Spalding area: Bundaleer, Booborowie, Canowie, Hill River and Bungaree. From this date, the Spalding area was made available to farmers and a farming-centred community grew. On 30 July 1885, the District Council of Spalding was proclaimed; it remained until 1997, when it merged into the Northern Areas Council. In 1925 a post office was built in Spalding. Spalding was serviced by a broad gauge railway line through the Clare Valley from Adelaide from its construction in 1922 until the last train in 1978.

C. WilliamsonJames Cassius Williamson (August 26, 1844 ‚Äì July 6, 1913)G√§nzl, \\"Williamson, J[ames] C[assius]\\" was an American actor and later Australia's foremost impresario, founding J. C. Williamson Ltd. Born in Pennsylvania, Williamson moved with his family to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His father died when he was eleven years old. He acted in amateur theatricals and joined a local theatre company as a call-boy at the age of 15, soon taking roles and eventually moving to New York where he played for several years at Wallack's Theatre and then other New York theatres. In 1871, he became the leading comedian at the California Theatre in San Francisco and the next year married comedian and actress Maggie Moore. The two found success touring in Australia, and then playing in London, the U.S. and elsewhere in a comedy called Struck Oil. In 1879, Williamson obtained the right to present H.M.S. Pinafore and then other Gilbert and Sullivan operas in Australia. He soon formed his Royal Comic Opera Company. In 1881, Williamson became the lessee of the Sydney Theatre Royal, and the next year he entered into a partnership with Arthur Garner and George Musgrove, expanding to own more theatres such as the Adelaide Theatre Royal in 1886, and bringing famous actors to Australia, such as Sarah Bernhardt and H. B. Irving, and becoming known for spectacular, large-scale productions. After 1907, Williamson moved his family to Europe and, his old partners having left, he hired capable managers and changed the theatre company's name to J. C. Williamson Ltd. Williamson died in 1913, but he left a strong theatrical empire that became the largest theatrical firm in the world, with extensive film and property holdings. The company continued to produce seasons of Gilbert and Sullivan operas, operetta, musical comedy, straight plays, pantomimes and occasional musical revues, and later grand opera, ballet seasons, and concert tours by visiting celebrity singers and musicians, at the many theatres that it owned or leased throughout Australia and New Zealand. It also toured and presented shows in London and elsewhere. In 1976, the company closed and leased out its name. Life and career Williamson was born in Mercer, Pennsylvania. He was the son of a doctor, James Hezlep Williamson, and his wife Selina. About 1856, the family moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where young James appeared in amateur theatricals beginning in 1857. That year, his father died in an accident. =Early career= Maggie Moore in the 1870s In 1861, Williamson worked for the local theatre company of Messrs. Hurd and Perkins as call-boy, general assistant and scenery and props maker. There he made his official stage debut. He later recalled: \\"I used to act in amateur theatricals, and when I was sixteen I got an engagement with a company at the Milwaukee theatre. I was full of energy and enthusiasm, and did pretty well everything. My mornings were spent in learning fencing and dancing. In the afternoon I'd look after the box office, and at evening help the stage manager and take my part ‚Äì sometimes three or four parts.\\"J.C. Williamson at homepages.ihug.co.nz The next year, he joined the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Toronto, Canada and then moved on to New York where he found work as a dialect comedian and then played for several years at Wallack's Theatre. From his seven-year apprenticeship there, Williamson emerged with a thorough knowledge of acting, play production and stage management. He then played in a musical comedy at the Theatre Comique in New York under the management of W. H. Lingard. Although Williamson was not a good singer, his talent for comedy carried him.Down Under In The 19th Century at homepages.ihug.co.nz In 1871, Williamson was engaged as leading comedian at the California Theatre, in San Francisco, where he met comedian Margaret Virginia Sullivan (known as Maggie Moore) in 1872, whom he married at St. Mary's Cathedral on February 2, 1873. Later that month, they starred together in a comedy called Struck Oil in Salt Lake City, Utah. Williamson purchased the script for $100 and had it rewritten by his friend Clay M. Greene.\\"Forty- five Years of the Stage\\", Poverty Bay Herald, Vol. XXXIV, Issue 10878, 23 January 1907, p. 5 =Visiting, and then moving to, Australia= The Williamsons then visited Australia, travelling on the S.S. Mikado. In 1874, they opened a season at The Theatre Royal, Melbourne, beginning with Struck Oil, which became an instant success. Its run of 43 nights was the longest yet known in the colonial theatre. It proved equally popular around the rest of the country.Frank Van Straten, \\"J.C. Williamson\\", at Live Performance Hall of Fame What was meant to be a 12-week tour of Australia ended up lasting for fifteen months (including Struck Oil and other pieces) and netting Williamson ¬£15,000. Williamson used this money to launch his career as a theatre manager, and Maggie Moore became one of the most popular performers on the Australian stage.Bentley, Paul. \\"JC Williamson Ltd\\", The Wolanski Foundation Paper No. 5, January 2000 Poster for A Country Girl and La Mascotte, 1907 Williamson and Moore played seasons in Australia and toured extensively with several pieces, including Struck Oil, to India, the US, Europe, Britain and elsewhere. Everywhere they went, Struck Oil was a great success. When they opened the play at the Adelphi Theatre in London at Easter in 1876, The Graphic wrote, \\"Struck Oil is but a poor play; but the acting of Mr. Williamson in the part of Stofel, the Pennsylvanian Dutchman, exhibits genuine humour and pathos.\\"\\"Theatres\\", The Graphic, 22 April 1876, p. 390 Williamson and Moore later had a bitter divorce, and he tried unsuccessfully to stop her from appearing in the play, which she continued to revive throughout her career; she starred in the 1919 film version in her late 60s.Poorten, Helen M. Van Der. \\"Williamson, James Cassius (1845‚Äì1913)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 11 January 2012 In 1879, Williamson acquired a one-year exclusive right to perform H.M.S. Pinafore in Australia and New Zealand for ¬£300. They began their 1879‚Äì80 Australian season with Struck Oil and staged the first legitimate Australian production of Pinafore at the Theatre Royal, Sydney in November with great success, with the Williamsons playing Sir Joseph Porter and Josephine. In early 1880, Williamson formed his Royal Comic Opera Company. Williamson then acquired the Australian performing rights from the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company for The Pirates of Penzance for ¬£1,000 and opened that work at the Theatre Royal Sydney in 1881. Between their appearances in Gilbert and Sullivan operas, James and Maggie Williamson continued to play engagements of Struck Oil along with similar popular favourites, The Danites, Arrah-na- Pogue, The Colleen Bawn and Rip Van Winkle. =The beginning of the J. C. Williamson Ltd. theatrical empire= On September 8, 1881, Williamson became the sole lessee of the Theatre Royal, which was newly renovated, introducing modern technical facilities and lavish sets. This transaction marked the beginning of Williamson's long career as Australia's foremost theatrical manager. After a tour of New Zealand, in 1882 Williamson entered into partnership with Arthur Garner and George Musgrove. This triumvirate was often criticized for creating a monopoly, crushing the old repertory system and discouraging local actors, but it brought to Australia such artists as Dion Boucicault, as well as employing new and local talent such as Nellie Stewart and Howard Vernon. In December 1886, they opened the luxurious (New) Princess's Theatre in Melbourne with The Mikado. By 1890, Williamson had hired Henry Bracy as a leading tenor and a stage manager. Bracy subsequently directed numerous comic opera productions for Williamson, also becoming Williamson's chief advisor on casting, working for the company until 1914.\\"Music and Drama\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 3 February 1917, p. 8, accessed 21 February 2010 Musgrove left the partnership in 1890, and Williamson, Garner & Co. then had a major success when they brought Sarah Bernhardt to Australia in 1891. At the end of the year Williamson bought Garner out, but Maggie Moore left him for the actor Harry Roberts, making extensive financial claims upon him. Musgrove rejoined Williamson in 1892, and in 1896 they broke box-office records with an original Australian pantomime, Djin Djin. Williamson married Mary Alice Weir, a dancer, in 1899, and his partnership with Musgrove dissolved that year unpleasantly. Among other ventures, in 1900 Williamson leased Her Majesty's Theatre in Melbourne, and began a series of extensive renovations and expansions to the theatre that became the flagship venue for J. C. Williamson in years to come. He also leased Her Majesty's Theatre in Sydney, and in 1902 mounted the biggest production in its history, Ben Hur, at a cost of ¬£14,000. With a running time of nearly four hours, the production contained huge choral numbers, marches and a spectacular chariot race, with horses galloping on a treadmill in front of a moving backdrop. The music was composed by American Edward Stillman Kelly and remained popular for some years. A bubonic plague outbreak temporarily closed the theatre soon afterwards, and it was burnt down with huge losses. But Williamson organized a Shakespeare company at the Theatre Royal and rebuilt the theatre in 1903. The next year he entered partnership with George Tallis, his Melbourne manager, and with Gustave Ramaciotti as legal adviser. Visually sensational shows were now 'the Firm's' speciality, and the organisation had grown to employ 650 people. =Williamson's later years= Williamson in later years From 1907 Williamson reduced his managerial work and spent more time with his wife and their daughters Marjorie and Aim√©e, moving the family to France and spending most of his time in Europe. He also became involved in raising racehorses. In 1910, the company was renamed J. C. Williamson Ltd., with Ramaciotti as managing director. The company achieved outstanding successes with tours by H. B. Irving and Nellie Melba; the latter and Williamson earned ¬£46,000 profit each from her tour.\\"The Firm is dead, long live the (new) Firm\\", The Australian Woman's Weekly, 8 September 1976, p. 7 Williamson successfully opposed an application by Australian actors to form a union in 1913. In February 1913, Williamson performed in a benefit in Sydney for the widows of Captain Robert Scott's Antarctic expedition. Returning to his family in France via the United States, his heart condition worsened, and he died in Paris on 6 July. He was buried, contrary to his wishes, in the Williamson section of Oak Woods cemetery, Chicago, Illinois. He left an elaborately divided estate, valued for probate at ¬£193,010. World War I and beyond After Williamson died in 1913, his company ‚Äì at one time the largest theatrical firm in the world ‚Äì continued to operate under various managing directors. The firm began to make films and continued to present musical comedy and operetta, including the extremely successful The Maid of the Mountains (1917). In 1941, Viola Hogg Wilson, a former principal soprano with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company who had toured with the Williamson company beginning in 1940, married Frank Tait, one of the company's managing directors, later becoming an artistic director of the company.Stone, David. Viola Wilson at Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera CompanyPapers of the Tate Family ‚Äì MS 309 at nla.gov.au 1921 production In addition to operating its film company and its property and investments company, J. C. Williamson continued to produce seasons of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, seasons of operetta, musical comedy, straight plays, pantomimes and occasional musical revues, and later grand opera, ballet seasons, and concert tours by visiting celebrity singers and musicians, at the many theatres that it owned or leased throughout Australia and New Zealand until 1976, when the company closed and leased out its name. The company's activities even extended to London's West End, where it produced, among others, seasons of the musicals High Jinks (in 1916), and Mr. Cinders (1928). Williamson's Gilbert and Sullivan productions The J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company was a successor to J. C. Williamson's Royal Comic Opera Companies. The company staged touring seasons, initially in Australia, of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas from 1879 to 1963. J. C. Williamson Ltd. secured exclusive rights to stage professional productions of the Gilbert and Sullivan (G&S;) operas in Australia and New Zealand. The company continued this licensing arrangement with D'Oyly Carte family until the expiry of copyright to the operas in 1961. Initially the G&S; operas were staged by Williamson amongst the repertoire of his Royal Comic Opera Companies, where they shared the bill with seasons of Jacques Offenbach, Alfred Cellier, Charles Lecocq, Robert Planquette and others. Although repertory seasons solely devoted to G&S; had been staged at individual theatres throughout Australia from around 1885, the first specially organised G&S; tour began in 1905 and played for a year, during which time Utopia Limited received its Australian premiere at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne, on 20 January 1906. Williamsons toured the operas throughout both Australia and New Zealand in the years 1914‚Äì15, 1920‚Äì22, 1926‚Äì28, 1931‚Äì33, 1935‚Äì37, 1940‚Äì45, 1949‚Äì51 and 1956‚Äì58, with a final tour by the company in 1962‚Äì63. Williamsons also sent G&S; touring companies to South Africa between 1913 and 1933 and to India and the Far East in 1922‚Äì23, headed on this occasion by C. H. Workman. It was on the return voyage to Australia from this tour that Workman died at the age of 49. Unlike the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, the J. C. Williamson G. & S. Opera Co. was not in continuous operation but was organised specifically to tour the operas for a duration of two or more years, depending on how popular the season was with audiences, after which it was disbanded. The company would then be re-formed, after a variable interval of years, for another tour in response to perceived audience demand. During the years of the Great Depression in the early 1930s, the popularity of the G&S; company, in fact, helped to keep the firm financially viable when a number of their musical comedy productions lost money. The operas were directed and choreographed by Melbourne-based Minnie Everett. She was believed to be the only woman director of Gilbert and Sullivan at the time, and was one of the first female directors of professional theatre companies in the world. Many members of the D'Oyly Carte, or former members, were engaged for Australasian G&S; tours on the recommendation of the D'Oyly Carte management. Savoyards who toured Australia and New Zealand over the years included Frederick Federici, Frank Thornton, Alice Barnett, Leonora Braham, Courtice Pounds, Charles Kenningham, Wallace Brownlow, C. H. Workman, Frederick Hobbs, Ivan Menzies and wife Elsie Griffin, Winifred Lawson, Richard Watson, Viola Hogg Wilson (who married Frank Tait, the youngest of the five Tait brothers who were then running the Company), Evelyn Gardiner, John Dean, Marjorie Eyre and husband Leslie Rands, Richard Walker and wife Helen Roberts, and Grahame Clifford, among others. In 1925 Sydney Granville, with a number of other D'Oyly Carte principals, sailed to Australia to join the J. C. Williamson Gilbert & Sullivan Opera Company for its 1926‚Äì28 tour of Australia and New Zealand, playing the \\"heavy\\" baritone G&S; roles that he later played when he rejoined D'Oyly Carte in Britain. The G&S; operas played in Australasia during that tour were mostly re-costumed in accordance with the D'Oyly Carte designs supplied by Rupert D'Oyly Carte. In 1949, J. C. Williamson Ltd. brought Granville's wife, Anna Bethell, to Australia to direct its season of G&S; operas, which then toured throughout Australasia for the next three years. Bethel was a former contralto with D'Oyly Carte and had served as that company's stage director from 1947 to the spring of 1949. The former Savoyards who participated in the Australia tour included Menzies, Gardiner, Dean, Rands and Eyre, and Walker and Roberts. This tour also marked the farewell appearance of Menzies, who had been principal comedian with the Williamson company for all of their G&S; seasons since 1931. Recognition In 1989, Williamson was honoured, together with Nellie Stewart, on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post.$1 Australian postage stamp showing Williamson and Stewart The JC Williamson Award is a lifetime achievement award presented by Live Performance Australia (LPA) since 1998 in recognition of \\"individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to the Australian live entertainment and performing arts industry and shaped the future of our industry for the better\\", and is the highest honour of the LPA.

Al-Ghesheyan played for Al-Hilal at the time. Fahad Al-Ghesheyan is also known as the first Saudi player to play in Europe when he moved to AZ Alkmaar in the Netherlands. AZ's manager at that time was Willem van Hanegem, who previously managed Al-Hilal. He had been impressed by Al-Ghesyan back in Hilal. Al-Ghesheyan was known to be a right winger with good dribbling skills but a lack of professionalism and consistency. Al-Ghesheyan first came into the spotlight when he was part of Saudi Arabia's Asian Youth Cup qualifiers, where he guided the Saudi team to qualification. He was the main star player in the match between Saudi Arabia vs Brazil in that FIFA World Youth Cup where he was too much dominating player and singly took over the momentum of the game. Brazilians were not able to control his pace and ball-control and it was because of him that Saudi Arabia totally dominated over Brazil in the Mid-Field and many counter-attacks. Being on top of his game, he tried to break into the senior team back in 1994 but his path was blocked by a Saudi side then rich in prolific attacking players, like Majid Abdullah, Sami Al Jabir, Fahad Al Mahalel and Saeed Owairan. Being a winger, the coaches rarely gave him a chance to play. He was only introduced in the second half when Saudi were already two goals behind Sweden ‚Äì even though he managed to get the score to 2‚Äì1 while missing another close chance to make it 2‚Äì2 before Sweden finally finished the game off at 3‚Äì1. Somewhere down the line, he fell out with his club's management. To his astonishment, he was sold to Al Naser, who were Hilal's derby rivals in Riyadh. Fans could not believe that their best player had just left and joined Naser, and he was upset that after he left he only played a few games for Naser, and soon quit the game out of frustration of not being able to play for his boyhood club Hilal. He retired early when he was only 25 or 26 years old. He later moved to the Netherlands, to AZ Alkmaar for a brief spell.

The paper principally serves the communities of Haines, where it is published, and Klukwan, a Tlingit Indian village 23 miles west of Haines. The newspaper features local news and \\"Duly Noted,\\" an about-town column penned by locals in the know. Over the years these have included Doris Ward and Heather Lende (author, National Public Radio commentator, and Anchorage Daily News columnist.) The Chilkat Valley News is also one of a handful of independently owned newspapers in Alaska. The newspaper was founded in 1966 by Haines schoolteacher Ray Menaker and a student printer, Bill Hartmann. The first edition appeared January 3 without a title, instead asking readers to choose a name from a list of 18 suggested ones, including Haines Independent Grapevine and Lynn Canal Drift. Menaker sold the newspaper in the mid-1980s to Bonnie Hedrick. In 2012, Hedrick sold the paper to Tom Morphet. In June 2017, Kyle Clayton, the current editor and publisher, bought the paper from Morphet. The paper is printed in Petersburg, Alaska and published on Thursdays.

Open-circuit voltage (abbreviated as OCV or VOC ) is the difference of electrical potential between two terminals of a device when disconnected from any circuit.http://www.learnabout- electronics.org/resistors_18.php There is no external load connected. No external electric current flows between the terminals. Alternatively, the open-circuit voltage may be thought of as the voltage that must be applied to a solar cell or a battery to stop the current. It is sometimes given the symbol Voc. In network analysis this voltage is also known as the Th√©venin voltage. The open-circuit voltages of batteries and solar cells are often quoted under particular conditions (state-of-charge, illumination, temperature, etc.). The potential difference mentioned for batteries and cells is usually the open-circuit voltage. The open-circuit voltage is also known as the electromotive force (emf), which is the maximum potential difference when there is no current and the circuit is not closed. To calculate the open- circuit voltage, one can use a method similar to that below: Consider the circuit: Given Circuit If we want to find the open-circuit voltage across 5Œ© resistor. First disconnect it from the circuit: Modified Circuit Find the equivalent resistance in loop 1 and hence find the current in the loop. Use Ohm‚Äôs Law to find the potential drop across the resistance C. The resistor B does not affect the open-circuit voltage. Since no current is flowing through it, there is no potential drop across it. So we can easily ignore it. Therefore, the potential drop across the resistance C is VL. This is just an example. Many other ways can be used.

Despite its name, it is not a true finch, but rather a member of the large family Emberizidae, which also includes buntings, American sparrows, juncos and towhees. Until recently, it was generally placed in the genus Buarremon, while it occasionally has been placed in Atlapetes. This is a common bird in the undergrowth of wet mountain forests, second growth, and ravines at from 900 m to 250 m altitude. The nest, built by the female, is a large cup of plant material placed less than 2.5 m up in a shrub or small tree in dense scrub or a ravine. The typical clutch is two glossy, unmarked white or pale blue eggs, which are incubated by the female alone for 12‚Äì14 days before hatching. The chestnut-capped brushfinch is a large, robust, mainly terrestrial species, 19 cm long and weighing 45 g. It has a long slender bill and large feet and legs. The adult has a distinctive head pattern, with a yellow-edged chestnut crown and nape, black forehead and head sides, white spots in the centre and each side of the forehead, and a white throat which is often puffed up when the bird is excited. The upperparts are dark olive, with darker wings. The white central breast is separated from the white throat by a black band. The breast sides are grey, and the flanks and lower belly are olive-green. Young birds have a sooty-brown cap, sooty face and olive-brown upperparts, throat and breast. The chestnut-capped brushfinch has a thin pink call and a very high- pitched psssst. The male's song consists of a mixture of whistles and sharper notes. The chestnut-capped brushfinch feeds on insects and spiders extracted from the leaf litter with its bill, and will also pick berries and invertebrate prey from low bushes. It is seen in pairs, family parties, or with warblers and other Emberizids as part of a mixed-species feeding flock.

Overall, he only played four games for Oxford United before he signed for Barnet in 2003. He has won three caps for the England non-league team, scoring the winning goal on his debut against Italy in 2005. King was transfer listed by Barnet at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season, for which he was named player of the year, to avoid him leaving on a free transfer a year later. He was signed by Gillingham for ¬£200,000 on a three-year deal in June 2007. This fee could however rise to ¬£250,000, depending on appearances and whether Gillingham achieve promotion to the Football League Championship. He made his debut on the first day of the season against Cheltenham Town, but was on the wrong end of a 1‚Äì0 defeat. He was named Gillingham's Player of the Year for the 2008‚Äì09 season as well as being voted into the Professional Footballers' Association League Two team of the year. On 3 July 2009, King signed a new three-year contract, keeping him at the club until the summer of 2012. However, during a pre-season friendly against Bromley, King suffered an ankle injury which kept him out of the entire 2009‚Äì10 season. The injury also carried over to the beginning of the 2010‚Äì11 season. King finally returned to training on 1 November 2010 after 18 months out, with the last professional game he played in having been the 2009 Football League Two play-off Final. The return from injury for King was short lived however, after suffering a setback during training which caused the length on the sidelines to be extended for a few weeks. On 8 February 2011, King finally made his return to football after 18 months without playing after replacing Matthew Lawrence in the 25th minute in the 3‚Äì1 home win against Rotherham United. He joined Plymouth Argyle on loan for one month on 31 August 2011, and made his debut in a 2‚Äì1 defeat at Burton Albion on 3 September. He made two further appearances before the loan was extended until 7 November. King was released by Gillingham in May 2012, along with two other teammates. He agreed to sign for Inverness Caledonian Thistle in July. King was forced to retire from professional football after failing to recover from an injury sustained playing for Inverness, but signed for Isthmian League Division One North club Thurrock on 23 August 2013.

Not! is a grammatical construction in the English language used as a function word to make negative a group of words or a word. It became a sardonic catchphrase in North America and elsewhere in the 1990s. A declarative statement is made, followed by a pause, and then an emphatic \\"not!\\" adverb is postfixed. The result is a surprise negation of the original declarative statement. According to the above, the phrase, \\"He is a nice guy... not!\\" is synonymous to \\"He is not a nice guy\\".

January 1, 1784 he enrolled into the Taganrog dragoon regiment as cavalry sergeant-major (–≤–∞—Ö–º–∏—Å—Ç—Ä). In 1787, Papkov was moved to Astrakhan dragoon regiment in the rank of cadet, and in 1790 into Tiflis musketeer regiment in the rank of aide- de-camp. During Russo-Turkish War, 1787-1792, Papkov's regiment participated in an assault on Anapa under command of General-en-chef Ivan Gudovich. For Anapa Pyotr Papkov was promoted to the rank of sub-poruchik. Since April 28, 1796 Papkov was in Persia, and participated in the Persian Expedition of 1796, taking part in the siege of Derbent and other key operations of the campaign. For the Persian Expedition he was promoted to the rank of poruchik and a year later into the rank of captain.

Governor of Taganrog In 1808 he was appointed Chief Police Officer (Oberpolizeimeister) of Saint Petersburg and was awarded with an Order of St. George of 3rd degree on April 21, 1808. One of Papkov's three mansions in Taganrog.¬© TaganrogCity.Com In 1810 Papkov was appointed Governor of Taganrog.

The governorship of Papkov was at the time of the highest rivalry between the two main seaports in the South of Russia - Odessa and Taganrog. In 1812, plague epidemic started along the Black Sea shore, the ports of Odessa and Feodosiya. Governor Papkov banned all ships from entering into the Azov Sea through the Strait of Kerch, and saved the city from pestilence. Odessa's lobbyists tried to revenge and persuaded the tsar to keep the Azov Sea closed even after the epidemic was over. In 1815, the prices for wheat went up abroad, the price for wheat in Odessa was 50 rubles for a quarter (=209.91 liters), while in Taganrog it was 18. Foreign ships could not get enough wheat in Odessa and Feodosiya due to a large shortage, and this encouraged Governor Pyotr Papkov to let the ships go through the Kerch Straight into Azov Sea. Over 600 ships came to the seaport of Taganrog, and the price went up to 45 rubles/a quarter. The boom continued the following years, with a tacit approval of Alexander I of Russia who was favorably disposed towards Taganrog. The city grew feverishly and draw attention of the imperial family. It was visited in 1816 by Nikolay Pavlovich, in 1817 by Mikhail Pavlovich and in May, 1818 by Alexander I of Russia. With that in mind, all uezd's establishments were transferred to Taganrog in 1816 (until 1834). Papkov left the governor's office in 1822 and served with the military until February 3, 1833. After his resignation he settled in his estate, village Krasniy Kut of Yekaterinoslav Governorate, where he died on May 18, 1853.

The mountain belt stretches from the Low Beskids range of the Eastern Carpathians along the border of Poland with Slovakia toward the Moravian region of the Czech Republic and the Austrian Weinviertel. In the south the North Hungarian Mountains cover northern Hungary. The area of the Western Carpathians comprises about 70,000 km¬≤. The highest elevation is the Gerlachovsk√Ω ≈°t√≠t (2,655m).  Geographical definition  Most of the perimeter of the Western Carpathians is quite sharply defined by valleys. To the northwest and north they are separated from the Bohemian Massif by the Forecarpathian Lowland and the Lesser Poland Upland; to the west the Moravian Gate leads over to the Sudetes. To the south the mountain chain falls away towards the Pannonian Plain, a large plain situated between the Alps, the Dinaric Alps, and the main mass of the Eastern Carpathians.Vlad√°r, J. (Editor) 1982: Encyklop√©dia Slovenska. VI. zv√§zok T-≈Ω. Bratislava, Veda, p. 497 The boundary between the Western Carpathians and the Eastern Alps is formed by the Vienna Basin, the Hainburg Hills of the Little Carpathians at Dev√≠n Gate, and a gap carved by the Danube. To the east and northeast the mountains are bounded by the East Slovak and Sandomierz Basins, but it is less striking and passes through highland terrain that continues to the Eastern Carpathians.  Geology  Geological map of Western Carpathians The Western Carpathians are part of the northern branch of alpine orogeny, which was formed by the closure of the Tethys Ocean millions of years ago. The Western Carpathians are part of the Alpide belt. To the west they longitudinally join the Alps, but the exact boundary is hidden under the Neogene sedimentary fill of the Vienna Basin. To the east, their boundary with the Eastern Carpathians is the valley of the Horn√°d or Uzh River. The northern boundary with the East European craton and Bohemian Massif is well marked by the thrust of nappes of the Carpathian flysch belt. The southern boundary is less clear, because later postorogenetic evolution caused formation of basins, penetrating the mountain chain non- uniformly. The Western Carpathians have a complicated geological structure, that has been formed since the Paleozoic era. The oldest Paleozoic rocks experienced the first stage of deformation during the Hercynian orogeny, but younger Alpine overprint is common. Alpine orogeny affected the area in several stages from Jurassic to Neogene. During this period, parts of Tethys Ocean were subducted under the African plate and Western Carpathian blocks were thrust over the margin of the Eurasian plate. Tectonic units of the Western Carpathians are arranged in belt-like order, with the external units in the north and internal units in the south. Alpine evolution of the Western Carpathians is dominated by extension and closure of two or three oceanic domains:Pla≈°ienka, D., 2002: Origin and growth of the Western Carpathian orogenetic wedge during the mesozoic.

Congress of Carpathian-Balkan Geological Association Bratislava, September 1st - 4th 2002 Triassic-Jurassic Meliata-Halstatt Ocean, Jurassic-Cretaceous Piemont-Vahic Ocean/Zone and Cretaceous-Tertiary Valais- Magura Ocean. After a subduction of the Meliata Ocean, the Internal Western Carpathians were formed. Suturing of Vahic domain finalized thrusting in the Central Western Carpathians, and consuming the crust of Carpathian Flysch Basins caused the formation of the External West Carpathian accretionary wedge (Flysch Belt).

From late August to early October 2006, some of its followers were stationed in a tent city besides the Israeli government building, and several large demonstrations were carried out to protest against the conduct of the government before, during, and after the war. Protest in Tel Aviv calling for a state commission of inquiry over the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict (July 16, 2006), to investigate what they said were government failures. Origin of reserve soldiers' protest The protest began on August 21 after a dozen reservists who served on the southern Lebanese military front, situated their demonstration at a park besides the government building, calling for the government's resignation. The protest grew in momentum over several days, and as of August 25 it consisted of several hundred demonstrators, including the influential Movement for Quality Government. On August 24, several parents of Israel Defense Forces soldiers killed in the conflict joined the march. Over 2,000 people participated in the march on August 25. Prospects for a state commission Yaakov Hasdai, a member of the Agranat Commission, the national commission which investigated the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War, said that he \\"support[s] the call for the resignation of the top political echelon and the establishment of an inquiry commission\\" While the impact the protest had on the Israeli government remained uncertain, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in a visit to Nahariya promised to invest over 2.5 billion dollars in northern Israel and to establish a commission of inquiry ‚Äì but fell short of expressly calling it a \\"state commission\\" (legally, only a state commission has authority that can supersede the government). Olmert was expected to announce what type of commission will be formed within a short while. On August 25, the Israel Broadcasting Authority reported that a state commission of inquiry is appeared likely to be formed within several days. Olmert was set to decide whether to appoint a governmental commission of inquiry or a more substantive state commission, or some other formula by August 27. On September 9, tens of thousands participated in a demonstration calling for a state commission, which was held in Rabin Square, Tel Aviv. Among those who delivered speeches were Yossi Sarid and Moshe Arens. Much of the following efforts to establish mechanisms to investigate the war, were undertaken while the protests were active, and their responses to these attempts on the part of Olmert's government, played an important role in shaping public opinion and arguably, the eventual widening mandate of the commission which was formed. =Inspection probes= On August 28, Olmert announced that there will be no independent state or governmental commission of inquiry. Instead, two internal inspection probes were to be created, one to investigate the political echelon and another to examine the IDF, while a third investigation of the Home Front to be possibly undertaken by the state comptroller Micha Lindenstrauss (although Lindenstrauss, to the \\"amazement\\" of the PMO, said that he already has \\"the authority to investigate the war in Lebanon\\" and that he \\"report[s] only to the Knesset\\"). These were to have a far more limited mandate and narrower authority than a single commission headed by a retired judge. Olmert stated that \\"we do not have the luxury to submerge in investigating the past. Anyone honestly knows that this is not what would fix the shortcomings.\\" Haaretz noted that Olmert feared an inquiry commission could end up recommending he resigns the primeministership. The Israeli media was largely critical over the probes. Reactions from the protesters were wholly negative. The governmental and military inspection probes were to be chaired by former director of Mossad, Nahum Admoni, and former chief of staff, Amnon Lipkin- Shahak, respectively. The chairmanship of the governmental probe was originally offered to former minister of education, Amnon Rubinstein, but he refused. Israeli Defense MinisterAmir Peretz has already appointed a military inspection probe headed by Shahak, but it ceased operating after a day due to public criticisms. It appears it will be revived in its hitherto composition. The third probe to examine the Home Front was expected to be announced soon thereafter. What was decisive about Olmert's decision was that the commissions were to have limited powers of investigation, censure, and that the political, military and civilian realms were to become split. Critics argued that these inspection probes amounted to a whitewash, due to their limited authority, limited investigatory scope, their self-appointed basis, and that neither will be headed by a retired judge. On August 30, about one hundred Movement for Quality Government members protested in front of the house of the law Professor Yaakov Dror, a member of the governmental inspection probe, calling on him to refuse to participate. Dror told the protesters that he \\"respects [their] opinion, but they should respect [his]\\", and said that he is in favour of Olmert's plan. On September 11, Olmert's appointment of retired judge Eliyahu Winograd to replace Admoni (who was to remain a member, but later resigned) as chair of a governmental commission, was approved by the Attorney General Menachem Mazuz. Winograd is a well- respected former judge who headed various earlier commissions, most recently in March 2005 in an IDF Probe to review the authority of the Military Censor. The Movement for Quality Government said, \\"Olmert continues a retreat and delay battle\\" and called on Winograd to decline the appointment, stating, \\"only a state commission headed by a judge appointed by the Supreme Court is the answer.\\" The Winograd Commission, however, ended up being given a wider mandate than the earlier probe, which is said to amount to de facto state commission investigatory powers. =Labour opposition to inspection probes= These critics included, from the moderate left: the chair of Meretz-Yachad Yossi Beilin asked that no one testifies before these commissions, while the Movement for Quality Government called them \\"joke commissions\\" (in Hebrew joke is \\"bdicha\\" and inspection is \\"bdika\\", so this is a word play). From the right-national block: Likud stated \\"it was irrational that the Prime Minister appoints a commission that would investigate the Prime Minister.\\" Former National Religious Party chair Knesset member Ephraim Eitam said that \\"this an ugly move by the government to escape its responsibility.\\" From the centre- left, several Labour party ministers said they will resist the decision. Minister of Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Ophir Pines-Paz said the commissions \\"do not have clear authorities\\", while Minister without portfolio in charge of the Israel Broadcasting Authority and General Secretary of Labour, Eitan Cabel said that he would call to other Labour ministers to oppose the formula. Haaretz reports that even Minister of Defense and Labour chair Amir Peretz might be considering opposing Olmert and calling for the establishment of a state commission. On August 31, Peretz announced that he opposes Olmert's plan and is in favour of a state commission of inquiry. Despite this opposition, eventually, Labour decided to support Olmert's plan, finding the Winograd Commission worthy although still preferring a formal state commission. =Winograd Commission= On September 18, the Winograd Commission convened for the first time after having met final approval by the government the day before. On that day, Attorney General Menachem Mazuz stated that the commission does not have the authority to recommend the resignation of the Prime Minister. The next day, the Movement for Quality Government submitted a petition to the Supreme Court, seeking an injunction to disqualify the Winograd Commission. On September 20, reservists heckled Olmert during his Rosh Hashana speech. The Commission held preliminary meetings with key witnesses (many of whom were top political and military decision makers) for about a week. For the next several weeks it reviewed material while deciding on the course and direction of its investigation. On November 2, it began hearing testimonies. Criticisms of government failures The demonstrators and other critics alleged significant shortcomings on both the military (led by the Northern Command) and civilian (led by the Home Front Command) fronts. On the latter, this involves the lengthy confinement to inadequate shelters and a lack of evacuation and government-led support, especially for those most in need. On the former, this involved criticisms from the logistical to the operative level. The reserve divisions especially, complained of a lack of or deficient equipment and basic necessities. The Israeli Chief of Staff, Dan Halutz, himself involved in a scandal over the sale of his investment portfolio three hours after the war began, admitted failures. Earlier in the week, IDF Spokesperson clarified that a comment attributed to Israeli Technological and Logistics Directorate chief, Brigadier-General Avi Mizrahi, where he reportedly said that \\"if our fighters deep in Lebanese territory are left without food or water, I believe they can break into local Lebanese stores to solve that problem\\", was not made by him. On August 24, Minister of Defense Amir Peretz, called on the IDF to begin developing an anti-rocket system, potentially reviving the Nautilus Mobile Tactical High Energy Laser program which Israeli military experts such as Aluf Yitzhak Ben Yisrael had been calling for since its cancellation. Accusations of a right-national agenda The general secretary of Peace Now, Yariv Oppenheimer, accused the reservists of serving a right-national agenda. The reservists denied this charge, and in turn, pointed to Oppenheimer's affiliation with the Labour Party. There were others who argued that the protests were backed by right- national forces, but no conclusive evidence was offered to show the prevalence of any political affiliation among protesters. Reserve soldiers and Movement for Quality Government Throughout the protests' duration, the reservists and the Movement for Quality Government were divided by the extent of their demands, with the latter calling for the establishment of a state commission, while the former, joined by parents of soldiers killed in the war, also demanding the government's immediate resignation. Decline and inactivity By late September - early October, the protests increasingly dissipated, and virtually disappeared by the time the Winograd Commission began hearing testimonies on early November, it had virtually disappeared. Its impact on the manner in which post-war accountability was sought and will end up being pursued, remains arguably decisive. Following the Winograd Commission's preliminary report on April 30, 2007, on May 4, tens of thousands of protesters gathered to call on Olmert to resign. The demonstration was less seen as reservist-dirven. The reservist groups continued to criticize the government for its \\"irreparable harm\\". The chairman of Baltam, Roee Ron, stated that: > To our surprise, after the Second Lebanon War and the Winograd Report, the > government and the IDF are advancing a law against reserve duty. The > preparedness of the reserve units must be taken care of, and reserve duty > should only entail training. Plus, the harm to the soldiers' economic > situation, employment and education must be dealt with.\\" Some reservists have threatened to dodge the draft if key reforms are not implemented.

Pannell was fleeing police when he was shot; Spath was later charged and acquitted on charges of manslaughter.\\"The Teaneck Shooting Case\\", The New York Times, April 12, 1991. The case created controversy over allegations of racial profiling and police brutality.  Background & shooting  The African-American population in the Northeast corner of Teaneck grew substantially in the 1960s, accompanied by white flight triggered by the blockbusting efforts of local real estate agencies. As this de facto racial segregation increased, so did tensions between residents of the Northeast and the predominantly white Teaneck Police Department. On the evening of April 10, 1990, the Teaneck Police Department responded to a call from a resident complaining about a group of teenagers, one of whom was reported to have a gun. After an initial confrontation near the Bryant School and a subsequent chase, Pannell was shot and killed by Spath, a white Teaneck police officer. Spath said he thought Pannell had a gun and was turning to shoot him. Many witnesses said Pannell was unarmed and had been shot in the back. A fully loaded .22 caliber pistol was recovered from the jacket pocket of Pannell. The weapon had once been a starter's pistol that had been modified into a fully operable gun. The original autopsy conducted by the Bergen Medical Examiner indicated that Phillip Pannell was shot in the back with his hands down, possibly reaching for the gun and corroborating the story of the two officers on the scene.George James, \\"No Indictment in Teaneck Killing, But New State Inquiry Is Ordered\\", 'The New York Times, August 1, 1990. The New Jersey Attorney General, in a harsh rebuke of the autopsy called it \\"tainted\\" and indicated that it was so flawed that another autopsy had to be done which would introduce a correct understanding of where his hands were when he was shot in the back. The Attorney General also indicated that Bergen Medical Examiner admitted the mistakes he had made in the autopsy process. The second autopsy conducted by the State Medical Examiner proved conclusively that Phillip Pannells hands were raised at the moment that he was shot in the back. This evidence corroborated the stories of witnesses at the sceneJohn Kifner, \\"Evidence Shows Youth's Hands Up When Teaneck Officer Killed Him\\", The New York Times, August 2, 1990.  Aftermath  Protest marches, some violent, ensued, with most African Americans believing that Pannell had been killed in cold blood, and some white residents insisting that Spath had been justified in his actions. Spath was ultimately acquitted on charges of reckless manslaughter in the shooting. Some months after Spath had been cleared, he decided to retire from law enforcement. The incident was an international news event that brought Reverend Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson to the community, calls for Federal Civil Rights prosecution,Pannell Friends Call for Federal Charges Against Spath, The New York Times, February 13, 1992. and inspired the 1995 book Color Lines: The Troubled Dreams of Racial Harmony in an American Town, by Teaneck resident Mike Kelly.Beckerman, Jim. \\"Teaneck: Anatomy Of A Tragedy.

Phusion operates as Drink Four Brewing Company. Four Loko, the company's most popular beverage, debuted in the United States market in 2005 and is available in 49 states, and in 21 countries including Guatemala, Paraguay, The Bahamas, Peru, Mexico, Colombia, Bolivia, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, China, Canada and some countries in Europe. The name \\"Four\\" is derived from the original drink's content of four standard drinks. Four branded products have been the object of legal, ethical, and health concerns related to the company allegedly marketing them to underage drinkers and the danger of combining alcohol and caffeine. After the beverage was banned in several states, a product reintroduction in December 2010 removed caffeine, taurine, and guarana as ingredients, and the malt beverage is no longer marketed as an energy drink. History Phusion Projects was founded in 2005 by Chris Hunter, Jaisen Freeman and Jeff Wright after graduating from The Ohio State University. As students they were active members of the Kappa Sigma fraternity, and many of their original drink blends were created in the fraternity mansion's basement and party room. They had enjoyed caffeine mixed with alcohol, and recalled buying Thai energy drinks from a nearby Asian market to sell to other students at a markup, claiming that they were \\"importing the stuff from abroad\\". They would later describe themselves as \\"our own target market\\". In 2005, the entrepreneurial team designed a prototype \\"energy beer\\" now known as Four Loko. Marketed as a \\"premium malt beverage\\" in cherry and berry flavors, the drink contained taurine, guarana, caffeine and wormwood‚Äîthe supposed psychoactive ingredient of absinthe. After a year, the company was running low on investment and decided to drop the wormwood, focusing instead on improving the flavor and increasing the alcohol content. By 2008 the product had become popular and a variety of flavors were introduced into the US market. At the start of 2009, the beverage was becoming successful and began to be marketed overseas. In October 2010 a new flavor called Lemon Lime was first produced. Products Four Loko contains carbonated water, sugar, and natural and artificial flavoring including FD&C; Red 40. The drink is either 6%, 7%, 8%, 10%,12% or 14% alcohol by volume (ABV), depending on state regulations, and is packaged in 23.5 oz (695 mL) cans. =Current flavors= * Blue Razz * Sour Grape * Red (Swedish Fish flavor) * Black (Lime flavor) * Blaze * Frost * Fruit Punch * Gold (energy drink flavor) * Grape * Peach * Sour Apple * Strawberry Lemonade * Watermelon * Hemp * Hard Seltzer (Black Cherry) =Discontinued flavors= * Uva Berry (Grape flavor) * Blue Hurricane (Tropical flavor) * Mango * Orange * Coco Loko (Coconut flavor) * Lemonade * Lemon-Lime * Margarita * Pineapple * Cranberry Lemonade * Black Cherry In early 2011, Phusion Projects introduced its Four Loko XXX Limited Edition line, which featured a new flavor of Four Loko every few months, including: * Blueberry Lemonade * Strawberry Lemonade * Blue Raspberry * Green Apple In the summer of 2011, Phusion introduced 12 oz (350 mL) glass bottles of Four Loko, that came in packs of six and had 8% ABV as opposed to 12%. Flavors included: * Lemonade * Fruit Punch * Watermelon Bottles came in packs of six and In September 2011, Phusion introduced 16 oz (475 mL) cans of their drink in hi-cone four packs known as Four Poco Loko, with 8% ABV and included flavors: * Black cherry * Mango * Lemonade * Green apple Original formulations of both beverages were a malt liquor based, caffeinated alcoholic energy drink with added guarana and taurine. In 2008, Phusion Projects began selling their products in Canada and Europe. The European version of Four MaXed is sold in 8.3 oz (250 mL) glass bottles and aluminum cans and is spirit-based; the United States version has a malt liquor base. In 2009, Four Loko ranked fourth in sales growth among alcoholic beverages at 7-Eleven stores in the United States. On November 16, 2010, Phusion Projects issued a press release announcing that the company would be reformulating all Four brand beverages to remove caffeine, guarana, and taurine from the products. The new product was reintroduced in January 2011. On October 25, 2013, Four Loko was distributed for the first time in Puerto Rico. Four Loko kept the standard 12% alcohol but in a reduced can size of 16 oz (475 mL), and with only three flavors : * Grape * Fruit Punch * Watermelon In August 2016, Four Loko began selling in China. Secondary marketer Taobao claimed to still have for purchase the caffeinated version of the beverage. Four Loko has since seen market growth in Vietnam, Malaysia, Mongolia and Singapore. In February 2017, Four Loko announced the release of two new product lines‚Äîthe Bold Series and the Bartender Series. The Four Loko Bold Series comes in 24 oz. cans at 14% ABV, and includes the flavors: * Blaze * Frost Four Loko Bartender Series came in 16 oz. cans and containing 10% ABV, and includes the flavors: * Blue Mofo * Purple Hooter * Pink Scorpion In April 2017, Four Loko announced a line of hard liquor called Four Loko Shots that come in 750 ml bottles and are 70 proof (35% ABV). Flavors include: * Dragon‚Äôs Breath * Green Tornado * Screwball Restrictions on sale In 2009, a group of US state attorneys general began active investigations of companies which produced and sold caffeinated alcohol beverages, on the grounds that they were being inappropriately marketed to a teenage audience and that they had possible health risks (blackouts). The attorneys general were also concerned that these drinks could pose health risks by masking feelings of intoxication. In December 2008, Anheuser-Busch, manufacturer of Tilt and Bud Extra, as well as MillerCoors, manufacturer of Sparks, agreed to reformulate their drinks. In 2009, smaller companies such as Phusion fell under investigation because of their rise in market share. The drink came under major fire in 2010, as colleges and universities across the United States began to see injuries and blackouts related to the drink's misuse. The University of Rhode Island banned this product from their campus on November 5, 2010. The state of Washington banned Four Loko after nine university students aged 17 to 19 from Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Washington became ill at a house party in Roslyn, Washington. The students were hospitalized with blood alcohol levels ranging from 0.12 to 0.35 percent (a level of 0.30 percent being considered potentially lethal) and one university student almost died, according to CWU President James L. Gaudino. In October 2010, following the hospitalization of seventeen students and six visitors, Ramapo College of New Jersey banned the possession and consumption of Four Loko on its campus. As a result, Worcester State University stopped the sale of all energy drinks, and they as well as Boston College have informed their students of the risks involved in consuming Four Loko. By November 2010 dozens of other colleges and universities sent out notices informing their students to avoid the drink, while several more have placed outright bans on their campuses. The Daily Collegian, Penn State's student newspaper, reported that on November 1, 2010 the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board sent letters to all liquor stores urging distributors to discontinue the sale of the drink. The PLCB also sent letters to all Colleges and Universities warning them of the dangers of the drink. While the board has stopped short of a ban, it has asked retailers to stop selling the drink until U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) findings prove they are safe. Pennsylvania State Representative Vanessa Lowery Brown, however, seeks to introduce legislation to ban alcoholic energy drinks in the state. Several stores, including ShopRite Super Markets, Tops Markets, Price Chopper and Wegmans have voluntarily pulled the product from their shelves. Shortly after these stores did so, former Governor of New York David Paterson announced that Phusion was withdrawing the beverage from the state of New York as of November 19, 2010. On November 20, 2010, Oregon Liquor Control Commission's five citizen commissioners held an emergency meeting resulting in a 4-1 vote on the ban. The ban became effective immediately and was in effect until May 18, 2011. The ban required businesses to cease the sale of alcoholic energy drinks and pull existing items off the shelf, immediately. The sale of the restricted products during this period carried a penalty of 30 day suspension of liquor license. Utah, which has a state-run alcoholic beverage distribution system, did not allow the sale of alcoholic energy drinks. Michigan and Oklahoma have voted to ban the sale of alcohol energy drinks over health and safety concerns. Additionally, the Washington State Liquor Control Board voted to ban the sale of alcoholic energy drinks, which went into effect on November 18, 2010. The vote came as a result of the incident at Central Washington University. The New York State Liquor Authority has also banned their sale and distribution as of November 19, 2010. New York state senator Chuck Schumer and New York City councilman James Sanders Jr. approached the Obama administration to ban Four Loko across the state of New York. FDA warning On November 17, 2010 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning letter to four manufacturers of caffeinated alcohol beverages citing that the caffeine added to their malt alcoholic beverages is an ‚Äúunsafe food additive‚Äù and said that further action, including seizure of their products, may occur under federal law. It declared that beverages that combine caffeine with alcohol, such as Four Loko energy drinks, are a \\"public health concern\\" and couldn't stay on the market in their current form. The FDA also stated that concerns have been raised that caffeine can mask some of the sensory cues individuals might normally rely on to determine their level of intoxication. Warning letters were issued to each of the four companies requiring them to provide to the FDA in writing within 15 days of the specific steps the firms will be taking. The four companies that received the warning letter were: * Charge Beverages Corp.: Core High Gravity HG, Core High Gravity HG Orange, and Lemon Lime Core Spiked * New Century Brewing Co., LLC: Moonshot * Phusion Projects, LLC (doing business as Drink Four Brewing Co.): Four Loko * United Brands Company Inc.: Joose and Max Post-ban Starting weeks prior to the FDA ruling, many fans and others seeking financial gain purchased large quantities of the drink. This buying rush quickly created a black market for the drink, with many sellers charging nearly five times the drink's retail price. Four Loko appeared on Craigslist and collectible cans of the drink were being sold on eBay. In late December 2010, a reformulated version of the drink was put on shelves. The new product had exactly the same design as the original, but the caffeine, guarana, and taurine (ingredients in the original drink) had been taken out of the formula and replaced by Red 40, a food coloring agent. However, sales of the original drink continued, usually for a price of roughly $3 per 24 ounce can.

It has been managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) since 2000. The library has three public storeys. The first houses administration and the students' study room. The main circulation desk and the children's library are on the second level. The third houses the adult library, reference library and computer laboratory. History The library was opened on 16 February 1987 as part of the same complex as the Sha Tin Town Hall, Sha Tin Marriage Registry and Restaurant. It was originally managed by the Regional Council. At that time, it was called the Sha Tin Central Library () before its current name was adopted in 2000. Other adjacent buildings in the town centre include New Town Plaza, Shatin Law Courts, Royal Park Hotel, and New Town Tower. The exterior of the library was refurbished in the early 2000s as the original glass mosaic tiles, as well as the bonding holding them to the building, had deteriorated. Tiles were prone to suddenly fall, and thus posed a public safety risk. The exterior of the library was completely reclad in a reddish ceramic tile, as were the exteriors of the other buildings in the Sha Tin and Tuen Mun town hall complexes built 1986‚Äì87. The interior of the library was renovated from 2007‚Äì2008. The reading area was revamped and modernised, additional seating was provided in the students' study room, a new reading corner was built in the children's library and audiovisual equipment was enhanced. Also in 2008, a special \\"Sports and Fitness Collection\\" was set up on the third storey. It provides over 18,000 items including books, reports, journals, multimedia, and electronic material. The LCSD categorises libraries as major, district, or small. Sha Tin Public Library is the only major library in Sha Tin district, and has been assessed as falling short of the prevailing space provision standard for this type of library, as has the district library in nearby Ma On Shan. In order to address this district-wide shortcoming, a new district library was built in nearby Yuen Chau Kok, which opened in 2017.

It was first published as a series in sections between 1827 and 1838, in Edinburgh and London. Not all of the specimens illustrated in the work were collected by Audubon himself; some were sent to him by John Kirk Townsend, who had collected them on Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth's 1834 expedition with Thomas Nuttall.Mearns, B. & R. John Kirk Townsend: Collector of Audubon's Western Birds and Mammals (2007).'Narrative of a Journey Across the Rocky Mountains to the Columbia River' by John Kirk Townsend The work consists of 435 hand- coloured, life-size prints, made from engraved plates, measuring around . It includes images of five, possibly six, now-extinct birds: Carolina parakeet, passenger pigeon, Labrador duck, great auk, pinnated grouse, and, possibly, the Eskimo curlew. Art historians describe Audubon's work as being of high quality and printed with \\"artistic finesse.\\" The plant life backgrounds of some 50 of the bird studies were painted by Audubon's assistant Joseph Mason, but he is not credited for his work in the book.Burt, DeVere. \\"The Joseph Mason Project, Historic Spring Grove Cemetery and Arboretum\\" .

Audubon also authored the companion book Ornithological Biographies. Early publication history Plate 1 by John James Audubon depicting a wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo). About 1820, around the age of 35, Audubon declared his intention to paint every bird in North America. In his bird art, he mainly forsook oil paint, the medium of serious artists of the day, in favour of watercolours and pastel crayons (and occasionally pencil, charcoal, chalk, gouache, and pen and ink). As early as 1807, he developed a method of using wires and threads to hold dead birds in lifelike poses while he drew them. Conuropsis carolinensis), now extinct In 1823, Audubon went to Philadelphia and New York, looking for financial support using subscriptions to enable him to publish his artwork. He sold the copper engraving plates through on a subscription basis in North America and Europe. Those subscribed obtained five plates at a time. Each subscriber received prints of three smaller birds, a larger bird and a mid-sized bird. The prints were produced from 1827 to 1838 that cost each subscriber around $1,000.This is equivalent to $24,600 in 2015 It is thought that no more than 120 complete sets exist today. Each set consists of 435 individual plates that are based upon the original paintings. Each plate was engraved, printed, and hand colored by Robert Havell of London. While William Lizars, of Edinburgh, engraved the first ten plates, Havell actually finished some of those. Audubon often found support lacking. As a result, in 1826, he set sail for the United Kingdom with 250 of his original illustrations, looking for the financial support of subscribers and the technical abilities of engravers and printers. After exhibiting his drawings in Liverpool and Manchester, he journeyed to Edinburgh, where he met the accomplished engraver William H. Lizars. Lizars engraved up to ten of the first plates but was unable to continue the project when his colourists went on strike. In 1827, Audubon engaged the noted London animal engraver Robert Havell Jr., and his father, Robert Havell Sr. Havell Jr. oversaw the project through to its completion in 1838. Zenaida macroura (now called mourning dove). Aphelocoma coerulescens) The original edition of The Birds of America (sometimes called the Havell Edition after its printer, and sometimes called the \\"Double Elephant Folio\\", because of its size) was printed on handmade paper 39.5 inches tall by 28.5 inches wide. The principal printing technique was copperplate etching, but engraving and aquatint were also used. Colorists applied each color in assembly-line fashion (over fifty were hired for the work).Rhodes, 2004, pp. 273, 389. Audubon funded the costly printing project through a pay-as-you-go subscription. From 1826 to 1829, he travelled around the UK and to Paris, lecturing on ornithology and frontier American life in an effort to entice wealthy patrons to subscribe to the series of prints. Subscribers included the French king Charles X, the British queen Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, Lord Spencer, and, later, the Americans Daniel Webster and Henry Clay. Prints were issued in sets of five every month or two in tin cases and each set usually included one very large bird, one medium-sized bird, and three small birds. The plates were published unbound and without any text to avoid having to furnish free copies to the British legal deposit libraries. It is estimated that not more than 200 complete sets were ever compiled. An accompanying text, issued separately, was written by Audubon and the Scottish naturalist and ornithologist William MacGillivray and published in five volumes in Edinburgh between 1831 and 1839, under the title Ornithological Biography, or, An account of the habits of the birds of the United States of America. The additional cost of the five volumes of text brought the total cost of plates and text to about $1000. After the folio edition was completed, Audubon decided to produce a more affordable edition and employed a lithographer from Philadelphia named J. T. Bowen. Bowen and his team created a smaller Royal Octavo edition, which was issued to subscribers in seven volumes and completed in 1844.. Volume 1; Volume 2; Volume 3; Volume 4;Volume 5; Volume 6;Volume 7 Five more octavo editions were completed through 1877. The octavo edition used the text of the Ornithological biography but increased the number of plates to 500, separating some birds which had originally appeared together. Some new drawings were included, mostly by Audubon's youngest son John Woodhouse Audubon, though Audubon and members of Bowen's team also contributed. The Bien Edition (after chromolithography pioneer Julius Bien), was a full-sized reissue published in 1858 by Roe Lockwood in New York under the supervision of John Woodhouse Audubon. Due in part to the Civil War, the edition was never finished; only 15 parts of the 44 part series were completed. This edition consisted of 105 plates and included none of the original text. Fewer than 100 subscriptions were sold, making this edition rarer than other early editions. Audubon's practice of obtaining his subjects has been described as:\\"Audubon used what we like to call today as the barrel-of-the-shotgun method...After he killed the birds, he would use a complex system of wires and strings to position the birds. Previous artists would draw the birds in a stiff position, but Audubon was different. He drew the birds in dynamic ways, by positioning them how he would observe them in the field.\\" Public exhibitions Protonotaria citrea) in plate 3 A full 8-volume, double-elephant folio version is on public display in the Audubon Room at the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. This, the first book purchased by the University, was bought in 1839 for $970 (equivalent to $ in ), at the time an amazing sum. The entire volume of 435 plates is also available for viewing online at the websites of the University of Michigan and the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County. Since 1992, the Louisiana State University Libraries have hosted \\"Audubon Day,\\" a semi-annual public showing of all four volumes of LSU's copy of the Birds of America. The set formerly belonged to one of the original subscribers, the Duke of Northumberland, and was purchased with a grant from the Crown Zellerbach Corporation in 1964. In recent years, the event has drawn more than 200 visitors. It was profiled in a 2011 Wall Street Journal article titled \\"The Joys of Slow Looking.\\" In 2003, the University of Pittsburgh, which owns a complete collection of Birds of America that had been recently restored and preserved by the Etherington Conservation Center, mounted a major exhibition of 62 selected plates and other materials in its University Art Gallery. Following this, the university constructed an exhibit case on the ground floor of the school's Hillman Library to continuously display a rotating selection of plates to the public. Single plates have been exhibited for two weeks at a time in plate number order. In 2007, the university undertook a project to digitize every plate from Birds of America, as well as Audubon's Ornithological Biography, and, for the first time, presented the complete set for public viewing through one site on the internet. This event, called \\"Audubon day\\" was first conducted in 2011. In 2007 the book was the subject of an exhibition by the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, which owns a copy it ordered from the original subscription. To commemorate the book's record-breaking sale, the museum decided to display its copy (for which the museum eventually paid 2200 guilders‚Äîa fortune at the time‚Äîduring the years 1827‚Äì1838) until January 2011. The Buffalo & Erie County Public Library's Rare Book Room has a complete \\"Birds of America,\\" which is often on display. All of Audubon's and Mason's known extant watercolors preparatory for Birds of America are housed at the New-York Historical Society in New York City. The Stark Museum of Art in Orange, Texas, owns and exhibits John James Audubon's personal copy of Birds of America. The Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois owns a copy that previously belonged to Audubon's friend and family doctor, Dr. Benjamin Phillips. Only this copy and that owned by the Stark Museum of Art contain 13 additional plates, added late in the project to correct earlier mistakes by compositing new plates onto previous prints. The Field Museum produced and displayed an exhibit based around their copy of Birds of America in 2019-2020. In 2010 the North Carolina Museum of Art began a five-year exhibition of its restored four-volume set purchased for the state by Governor William Alexander Graham in 1846. Liverpool Central Library currently has a copy of Birds of America on display in a glass case, with its pages turned weekly, as well as being displayed through an interactive kiosk, allowing readers to view the contents close-up without damaging the original copy using an Evoke Ev5 Kiosk. One of the original books was bought by Laurance Spelman Rockefeller, who had each plate individually framed. They are all hanging throughout the public areas of the Woodstock Inn, in Woodstock, Vermont, which he built in 1969. Paisley Museum and Art Gallery, in Paisley, Scotland, has the four volume elephant folio of Birds of America. The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons in Glasgow, Scotland holds one volume which is on display in the library, together with an interactive version. Collections and archives Though individual prints are commonly available, only 120 complete sets are known to exist. One complete copy of The Birds of America exists as part of The Darlington Collection at the University of Pittsburgh. Another complete collection is housed with Meisei University in Tokyo, Japan. The Birds of America is on permanent display in Trinity College, Connecticut's Watkinson Library, and was owned by the engraver, Robert Havell. It was donated to the College in 1900 by Gurdon Wadsworth Russell, an 1834 graduate of Trinity. Toronto Public Library also holds a copy; originally a four-volume set, it was unbound to preserve the individual plates which have been digitized in the library's Digital Archive and stored in custom-made boxes in the Toronto Reference Library. Another complete copy of the prints, bound in 17 volumes, belongs to the Library of Parliament in Ottawa, Canada. Union College in Schenectady, NY possesses a complete copy that was purchased by its president Eliphalet Nott in 1844. Recent sales In March 2000, Sheikh Saud Al-Thani of Qatar purchased a copy of The Birds of America at a Christie's auction for $8.8 million, a record for any book at auction. In December 2010, The Economist magazine estimated that, adjusted for inflation, five of the ten highest prices ever paid for printed books were paid for copies of The Birds of America. Of the 120 copies known to survive, only thirteen are held in private collections. In March 2000 the Fox- Bute copy sold at Christie's, New York, for $8,802,500.BBC, 9 September 2010, World's most expensive book goes back on sale In December 2005 an unbound copy, the Providence Athenaeum Set, sold, again at Christie's, New York, for $5.6 million. On 6 December 2010, a complete copy of the first edition was sold in London at Sotheby's for ¬£7,321,250 (approximately $11.5 million) during the sale of Magnificent Books, Manuscripts and Drawings from the Collection of Frederick, Second Lord Hesketh. The winning bid was a record auction price for a printed book and was placed by London-based art dealer Michael Tollemache, who outbid three others during the auction. According to the provenance details reported by the auction house, the copy's original owner was Henry Witham of Durham, listed as subscriber 11 in Audubon's Ornithological Biography; the first volume of the set bears a presentation inscription from Witham's wife, dated 24 June 1831. Lord Hesketh had bought the copy from a descendant of Witham at a Christie's auction on 3 July 1951, paying ¬£7,000. On 20 January 2012 a complete copy of the first edition was sold by heirs of the Fourth Duke of Portland at Christie's, New York, for $7.9 million. The buyer was identified only as \\"an American collector who bid by phone.\\" The sale brought to 120 the number of copies known to have survived ‚Äì 107 in institution collections and 13 in private hands.

A priori knowledge is that which is independent from experience. Examples include mathematics,Some associationist philosophers have contended that mathematics comes from experience and is not a form of any a priori knowledge () tautologies, and deduction from pure reason.Galen Strawson has stated that an a priori argument is one in which \\"you can see that it is true just lying on your couch. You don't have to get up off your couch and go outside and examine the way things are in the physical world. You don't have to do any science.\\" () A posteriori knowledge is that which depends on empirical evidence. Examples include most fields of science and aspects of personal knowledge. Both terms appear in Euclid's Elements but were popularized by Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, one of the most influential works in the history of philosophy. Both terms are primarily used as modifiers to the noun \\"knowledge\\" (i.e. 'a priori knowledge'). A priori can also be used to modify other nouns such as 'truth'. Philosophers also may use apriority, apriorist, and aprioricity as nouns referring to the quality of being a priori. Examples The intuitive distinction between a priori and a posteriori knowledge (or justification) is best seen via examples, as below: = A priori = Consider the proposition: \\"If George V reigned at least four days, then he reigned more than three days.\\" This is something that one knows a priori, because it expresses a statement that one can derive by reason alone. = A posteriori = Compare the above with the proposition expressed by the sentence: \\"George V reigned from 1910 to 1936.\\" This is something that (if true) one must come to know a posteriori, because it expresses an empirical fact unknowable by reason alone.  Aprioricity, analyticity, and necessity  =Relation to the analytic-synthetic= Several philosophers, in reaction to Immanuel Kant, sought to explain a priori knowledge without appealing to, as Paul Boghossian explains, \\"a special faculty‚Ä¶that has never been described in satisfactory terms.\\" One theory, popular among the logical positivists of the early 20th century, is what Boghossian calls the \\"analytic explanation of the a priori.\\" The distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions was first introduced by Kant. While his original distinction was primarily drawn in terms of conceptual containment, the contemporary version of such distinction primarily involves, as American philosopher W. V. O. Quine put it, the notions of \\"true by virtue of meanings and independently of fact.\\" Analytic propositions are thought to be true in virtue of their meaning alone, while a posteriori propositions are thought to be true in virtue of their meaning and certain facts about the world. According to the analytic explanation of the a priori, all a priori knowledge is analytic; so a priori knowledge need not require a special faculty of pure intuition, since it can be accounted for simply by one's ability to understand the meaning of the proposition in question. More simply, proponents of this explanation claimed to have reduced a dubious metaphysical faculty of pure reason to a legitimate linguistic notion of analyticity. The analytic explanation of a priori knowledge has undergone several criticisms. Most notably, Quine argues that the analytic‚Äìsynthetic distinction is illegitimate: > But for all its a priori reasonableness, a boundary between analytic and > synthetic statements simply has not been drawn. That there is such a > distinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of empiricists, a > metaphysical article of faith. While the soundness of Quine's critique is highly disputed, it had a powerful effect on the project of explaining the a priori in terms of the analytic. = Relation to the necessary truths and contingent truths= The metaphysical distinction between necessary and contingent truths has also been related to a priori and a posteriori knowledge. A proposition that is necessarily true is one in which its negation is self-contradictory. Thus, it is said to be true in every possible world. For example, considering the proposition \\"all bachelors are unmarried:\\" its negation (i.e. the proposition that some bachelors are married) is incoherent due to the concept of being unmarried (or the meaning of the word \\"unmarried\\") being tied to part of the concept of being a bachelor (or part of the definition of the word \\"bachelor\\"). To the extent that contradictions are impossible, self-contradictory propositions are necessarily false as it is impossible for them to be true. The negation of a self-contradictory proposition is, therefore, supposed to be necessarily true. By contrast, a proposition that is contingently true is one in which its negation is not self-contradictory. Thus, it is said not to be true in every possible world. As Jason Baehr suggests, it seems plausible that all necessary propositions are known a priori, because \\"[s]ense experience can tell us only about the actual world and hence about what is the case; it can say nothing about what must or must not be the case.\\", ¬ß3 Following Kant, some philosophers have considered the relationship between aprioricity, analyticity, and necessity to be extremely close. According to Jerry Fodor, \\"positivism, in particular, took it for granted that a priori truths must be necessary.\\" However, since Kant, the distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions has slightly changed. Analytic propositions were largely taken to be \\"true by virtue of meanings and independently of fact,\\" while synthetic propositions were not‚Äîone must conduct some sort of empirical investigation, looking to the world, to determine the truth-value of synthetic propositions. =Aprioricity, analyticity and necessity= Aprioricity, analyticity, and necessity have since been more clearly separated from each other. American philosopher Saul Kripke (1972), for example, provides strong arguments against this position, whereby he contends that there are necessary a posteriori truths. For example, the proposition that water is H2O (if it is true): According to Kripke, this statement is both necessarily true, because water and H2O are the same thing, they are identical in every possible world, and truths of identity are logically necessary; and a posteriori, because it is known only through empirical investigation. Following such considerations of Kripke and others (see Hilary Putnam), philosophers tend to distinguish the notion of aprioricity more clearly from that of necessity and analyticity. Kripke's definitions of these terms, however, diverge in subtle ways from those of Kant. Taking these differences into account, Kripke's controversial analysis of naming as contingent and a priori would, according to Stephen Palmquist, best fit into Kant's epistemological framework by calling it \\"analytic a posteriori.\\"In this pair of articles, Stephen Palmquist demonstrates that the context often determines how a particular proposition should be classified. A proposition that is synthetic a posteriori in one context might be analytic a priori in another. () Aaron Sloman presented a brief defence of Kant's three distinctions (analytic/synthetic, apriori/empirical, and necessary/contingent), in that it did not assume \\"possible world semantics\\" for the third distinction, merely that some part of this world might have been different. The relationship between aprioricity, necessity, and analyticity is not found to be easy to discern. However, most philosophers at least seem to agree that while the various distinctions may overlap, the notions are clearly not identical: the a priori/a posteriori distinction is epistemological; the analytic/synthetic distinction is linguistic,; and the necessary/contingent distinction is metaphysical., ¬ß2-3 History =Early uses= The term a priori is Latin for 'from what comes before' (or, less literally, 'from first principles, before experience'). In contrast, the term a posteriori is Latin for 'from what comes later' (or 'after experience'). They appear in Latin translations of Euclid's Elements, a work widely considered during the early European modern period as the model for precise thinking. An early philosophical use of what might be considered a notion of a priori knowledge (though not called by that name) is Plato's theory of recollection, related in the dialogue Meno, according to which something like a priori knowledge is knowledge inherent, intrinsic in the human mind. Albert of Saxony, a 14th-century logician, wrote on both a priori and a posteriori. G. W. Leibniz introduced a distinction between a priori and a posteriori criteria for the possibility of a notion in his (1684) short treatise \\"Meditations on Knowledge, Truth, and Ideas\\". A priori and a posteriori arguments for the existence of God appear in his Monadology (1714). George Berkeley outlined the distinction in his 1710 work A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (para. XXI). =Immanuel Kant= The 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1781) advocated a blend of rationalist and empiricist theories. Kant says, \\"Although all our cognition begins with experience, it does not follow that it arises [is caused by] from experience.\\" According to Kant, a priori cognition is transcendental, or based on the form of all possible experience, while a posteriori cognition is empirical, based on the content of experience: > It is quite possible that our empirical knowledge is a compound of that > which we receive through impressions, and that which the faculty of > cognition supplies from itself sensuous impressions [sense data] giving > merely the occasion [opportunity for a cause to produce its effect]. Contrary to contemporary usages of the term, Kant believes that a priori knowledge is not entirely independent of the content of experience. Unlike the rationalists, Kant thinks that a priori cognition, in its pure form, that is without the admixture of any empirical content, is limited to the deduction of the conditions of possible experience. These a priori, or transcendental conditions, are seated in one's cognitive faculties, and are not provided by experience in general or any experience in particular (although an argument exists that a priori intuitions can be \\"triggered\\" by experience). Kant nominated and explored the possibility of a transcendental logic with which to consider the deduction of the a priori in its pure form. Space, time and causality are considered pure a priori intuitions. Kant reasoned that the pure a priori intuitions are established via his transcendental aesthetic and transcendental logic. He claimed that the human subject would not have the kind of experience that it has were these a priori forms not in some way constitutive of him as a human subject. For instance, a person would not experience the world as an orderly, rule-governed place unless time, space and causality were determinant functions in the form of perceptual faculties, i. e., there can be no experience in general without space, time or causality as particular determinants thereon. The claim is more formally known as Kant's transcendental deduction and it is the central argument of his major work, the Critique of Pure Reason. The transcendental deduction argues that time, space and causality are ideal as much as real. In consideration of a possible logic of the a priori, this most famous of Kant's deductions has made the successful attempt in the case for the fact of subjectivity, what constitutes subjectivity and what relation it holds with objectivity and the empirical. =Johann Fichte= After Kant's death, a number of philosophers saw themselves as correcting and expanding his philosophy, leading to the various forms of German Idealism. One of these philosophers was Johann Fichte. His student (and critic), Arthur Schopenhauer, accused him of rejecting the distinction between a priori and a posteriori knowledge: See also *A priori probability *Abductive reasoning *Deductive reasoning *Inductive reasoning *Relativized a priori *Tabula rasa *Transcendental empiricism *Transcendental hermeneutic phenomenology *Transcendental nominalism  References  = Notes = = Citations = = Sources =     * Further reading  .    *  External links   * * A priori / a posteriori ‚Äî in the Philosophical Dictionary online. * \\"Rationalism vs. Empiricism\\" ‚Äî an article by Peter Markie in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1 (1966), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court clarified the nonobviousness requirement in United States patent law,. set forth in 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 103.. Facts and procedural history The case was actually a set of consolidated appeals of two cases, originating in the same court and dealing with similar issues. The named petitioner, William T. Graham, had sued the John Deere Co. for patent infringement. The invention in question was a combination of old mechanical elements: a device designed to absorb shock from the shanks of chisel plows as they plow through rocky soil and thus to prevent damage to the plow. Graham sought to solve this problem by attaching the plow shanks to spring clamps, to allow them to flex freely underneath the frame of the plow. He applied for a patent on this clamp, and in 1950, obtained (referred to by the Court as the '811 patent). Shortly thereafter, he made some improvements to the clamp design by placing the hinge plate beneath the plow shank rather than above it, in order to minimize the outward motion of the shank away from the plate. He applied for a patent on this improvement, which was granted in 1953 as (referred to by the court as the '798 patent). While Graham's patent had been upheld in a previous case before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the opinion of the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri and held that the patent was invalid and that the John Deere Co. had not infringed upon it. The other two actions which were consolidated with the Graham case, (No. 37, Calmar, Inc. v. Cook Chemical Co., and No. 43, Colgate-Palmolive Co. v. Cook Chemical Co.) were both declaratory judgment actions filed contemporaneously against Cook Chemical Company. Calmar was a producer of ‚Äúhold-down‚Äù sprayers for bottles of chemicals such as insecticides, and Colgate-Palmolive was a purchaser of these sprayers. Inventor Baxter I. Scoggin, Jr. had assigned his patent for sprayer design to Cook Chemical Co. Calmar and Colgate-Palmolive sought a declaration of invalidity and non- infringement of the patent, and Cook Chemical Co. sought to maintain an action for infringement. The validity of the patent was sustained by the District Court, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed. Decision =Background as to the patent law in the U.S.= Justice Clark, writing for the majority, first briefly explained the history and policy behind U.S. patent law, beginning with the Patent Act of 1790. He explained that U.S. patent law was originated by Thomas Jefferson, who based his ideas on patent law on the utilitarian economic concern of promoting technological innovation rather than protecting inventors‚Äô moral rights to their discoveries. This was largely because Jefferson was quite suspicious of monopolies. This legal theory was embodied in the words of the Constitution itself, in the words of the Patents and Copyright Clause (Art. I, ¬ß 8, cl. 8). Thus, Jefferson intended that the limited monopoly granted by a patent was only to be permitted for those inventions which were new, useful, and furthered human knowledge, rather than for small details and obvious improvements. =The Patent Act of 1952= Prior to the Patent Act of 1952, the Congress required only novelty and utility for issuance of patent, and never created any statutory requirement of nonobviousness. However, the U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of Hotchkiss v. Greenwood,. invalidated a patent on the grounds that it involved only a substitution of materials rather than any real innovation. The Hotchkiss court effectively added the requirement of nonobviousness, and it had been left to the judiciary to determine whether the patent involved non-obvious invention. Following that case, the Supreme Court issued myriad decisions with an evolving and unpredictable standard for obviousness. It was not until the Congress enacted the Patent Act of 1952 that the test was to be given with some degree of predictability. The Patent Act of 1952 added 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 103, which effectively codified nonobviousness as a requirement to show that an idea is suitable for patent protection. The section essentially requires a comparison of the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art, to determine whether or not the subject matter of the patent as a whole would have been obvious, at the time of the invention, to a person having ordinary skill in the art. Clark held that the Congress, in passing the Act, intended to codify and clarify the common law surrounding the Patent Act by making explicit the requirement of nonobviousness. Although patentability is a matter of law, the Court held that ¬ß103 required a determination of the following questions of fact to resolve the issue of obviousness: # the scope and content of the prior art; # the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art; and # the level of ordinary skill in the art. In addition, the Court mentioned ‚Äúsecondary considerations‚Äù which could serve as evidence of nonobviousness. They include: # commercial success; # long felt but unsolved needs; and # failure of others. However, the Court also recognized that these questions would likely need to be answered on a case-by-case basis, first by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), then by the courts. =Application of the law to the facts= Clark then examined the prosecution history and prior art of both sets of patents involved in the case. In the Graham case, the '798 patent was originally rejected by the patent examiner as being insufficiently distinguished from the previous '811 patent. The only two claims which differed between the two patents were (1) the stirrup and the bolted connection of the shank to the hinge plate do not appear in '811; and (2) the position of the shank is reversed, being placed in patent '811 above the hinge plate, sandwiched between it and the upper plate. One argument which Graham raised before the court, but had not raised before the USPTO, was that in the new '798 design, the flexing of the plow shank was limited to the points between the spring clamp and the tip of the plow shank, absorbing the shock of hard objects on the ground more efficiently. The court rejected this argument and invalidated the '798 patent for two reasons: first, Graham had not raised this ‚Äúflexing‚Äù argument before the USPTO, and second, the parts in the '798 patent served the same purposes as those in the prior art. In the matters concerning Cook Chemical, Scoggin, a corporate officer at Cook, had originally based his design on Calmar's previous unpatented design, but later claimed that the integration of the sprayer and container solved the problem of external leakage during assembly and shipping of insecticide products. The district court held that Scoggin's sprayer was not obvious because even though its individual elements were not novel, nothing in the prior art would have suggested the combination of elements. After the initial rejection of his patent, Scoggin drafted claims more carefully to distinguish the prior art, limiting new claims to the use of a rib seal, rather than a washer or gasket, to maintain a seal, as well as the existence of a small space between the overcap and the sprayer. Clark held that because Scoggin narrowed his claims to meet the limitations requested by the patent examiner, Cook Chemical could not now claim broader subject matter (see Prosecution history estoppel). Clark further held that the differences between Scoggin's design and the prior art were simply too minor and non-technical to maintain the validity of Cook's patent. A companion case, United States v. Adams, was argued the same day and - in contrast to the holding in Graham v. Deere - held that non-obviousness was satisfied.

It has been practiced as far back as the Angkor period and is depicted on the bas-reliefs of certain temples. The earliest form of Khmer traditional wrestling was called Maloyuth. Maloyuth was created in 788 A.D. by Brahmin Timu. It evolved to the current form of wrestling, Cham Bab, in the 8th century. Although predominantly a male sport today, Khmer wrestling was once practiced by both sexes as female wrestlers are also displayed on the Banteay Srei temple. In Khmer wrestling, the dancing is as important as the wrestling. There is a pre-match ritual dancing before the match in which the wrestlers dance and move to the music. Matches consists of three rounds. Victory is obtained by forcing the opponent on their back. The person who is able to win two of the three rounds is the winner of the match. After each round the loser is asked if he wishes to continue with the match. The match is accompanied by the music of two drums (called skor ngey and chhmol which means female drum and male drum). Traditional matches are held during the Khmer New Year and other Cambodian on holidays. This sport used to be a means of choosing tribal and regional leaders.

The H.R. 13680 legislation was passed by the 94th Congressional session and enacted into law by the 38th President of the United States Gerald R. Ford on June 30, 1976. The Act of Congress requires international governments receiving weapons from the United States to use the armaments for legitimate self-defense. Consideration is given as to whether the exports \\"would contribute to an arms race, aid in the development of weapons of mass destruction, support international terrorism, increase the possibility of outbreak or escalation of conflict, or prejudice the development of bilateral or multilateral arms control or nonproliferation agreements or other arrangements.\\"(a)(2). The Act also places certain restrictions on American arms traders and manufacturers, prohibiting them from the sale of certain sensitive technologies to certain parties and requiring thorough documentation of such trades to trusted parties. When the President is aware of the possibility of violations of the AECA, the law requires a report to Congress on the potential violations. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducts an industry outreach program called the Project Shield America to prevent foreign adversaries, terrorists, and criminal networks from obtaining U.S. munitions and strategic technology.  History  From 1963 to 1973, 128 nations received $2.5 trillion in weapons and services, the majority from the United States. Law only required that the Secretary of State report ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù arms sales to Congress, semi-annually. In the early 1970s, legislators moved to become involved in deciding to whom arm sales could be made and under what circumstances. Concern over arms sales increased significantly in the summer of 1973, when news surfaced of a potential Nixon Administration sale of F-4 fighter-bombers to Saudi Arabia.‚ÄúCongressional Role in Arms Sales,‚Äù Congressional Quarterly, April 10, 1982, p. 798 In 1973, Norvill Jones, a staffer of the Committee of Senate Foreign Relations, tried to interest members in establishing a procedure by which Congress could review large arms sales. Finding no takers, Jones mentioned the idea to Dr. Paula Stern, then a foreign policy aide to Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, later the Chairwoman of the U.S. International Trade Commission (1984-1986). Nelson approved the idea and introduced an amendment for a one-house veto over significant arms sales. Stern and Nelson settled on a reporting \\"tripwire\\" of $25 million, the cost of a squadron of F-5E's. Nelson has credited Stern with conceiving the amendment and supplying the persistence needed to steer the attention of the Senate to arms sales. Nelson's proposed floor measure passed 44 to 43 in the Senate but a like House measure introduced by Representative Jonathan Bingham of New York was defeated. In 1974, a renewed attempt passed as the Nelson-Bingham Act of 1974. It provided that when the U.S. government offered to sell any defense article or service costing $25 million or more, the President must inform both Houses of Congress of the details, giving Congress twenty days to adopt a \\"veto\\" resolution. The Nelson-Bingham initiative worked \\"a profound transformation in arms export policy\\" and had a \\"significant impact on U.S. government policy, both on long-range planning and on several major individual sales.\\" In 1975, President Gerald Ford's arms sale to Jordan led Congress to examine how to strengthen the Nelson-Bingham Amendment. A significant number of sale notifications had been allowed to be kept classified by the executive. The time period of Congressional review had been found to be deficient and the dollar level of $25 million as a tripwire had prevented a number of smaller sales from avoiding scrutiny. Members of Congress also sought to expand the scope of their review beyond government-to- government sales. The 1976 Arms Control Act incorporated these and other changes. The scope of the act was challenged by professors and universities, who felt that restrictions placed on foreign nationals, including international students and visiting professors, were excessive. In the 1980s, Professor Bruce Lusignan of Stanford University and President C. Peter Magrath of the University of Minnesota both openly violated the arms export control act with support of their institutions. Application In the 1990s, after a report from RSA Data Security, Inc., who were in a licensing dispute with regard to use of the RSA algorithm in PGP, the Customs Service started a criminal investigation of Phil Zimmermann, for allegedly violating the Arms Export Control Act. The US Government had long regarded cryptographic software as a munition, and thus subject to arms trafficking export controls. At that time, the boundary between permitted (\\"low-strength\\") cryptography and impermissible (\\"high-strength\\") cryptography placed PGP well on the too- strong-to-export side (this boundary has since been relaxed). The investigation lasted three years, but was finally dropped without filing charges. From FY 2004 to FY 2006 there had been 283 arrests, 198 indictments, and 166 convictions based on AECA violations. In 2005 the Government Accounting Office (GAO) did a study on arms exports since 9/11. The study noted that the system itself had not been changed since 9/11 since the system was already designed to counter such threats. The study did report that the processing time for arms cases increased starting in 2003. In 2006 Boeing was fined $15 million for unlicensed foreign sales involving a gyroscopic microchip or gyrochip with military applications. In March 2007, ITT Corporation was fined for criminal violation of the act. The fines resulted from ITT's outsourcing program, in which they transferred night vision goggles and classified information about countermeasures against laser weapons, including light interference filters to engineers in Singapore, the People's Republic of China, and the United Kingdom. They were fined $100 million US dollars, although they were also given the option of spending half of that sum on research and development of new night vision technology. The United States government will assume rights to the resulting created intellectual property.https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/03/27/itt_fined_for_illegal_exports/ \\"ITT Fined for Illegal Exports\\" Tuesday March 27, The Register; Drew Cullen In January 2009, Congressman Dennis Kucinich sent a notice to Secretary of State, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, that Israel's actions in Gaza since December 27, 2008 may constitute a violation of the requirements of the AECA. The AECA requires that each nation that receives a shipment of arms from the United States must certify that the weapons are used for internal security and legitimate self- defense, and that their use does not lead to an escalation of conflict. However, the AECA does not define \\"internal security\\" or \\"legitimate self- defense.\\" Kucinich said that Israel's actions in Gaza killed nearly 600 and injured over 2,500, including innocent civilians and children in residential areas and civilian institutions like schools. Kucinich said that this may have violated the AECA because they didn't further Israel's internal security or legitimate self-defense, but increased the possibility of an outbreak or escalation of conflict. \\"Israel May Be in Violation of Arms Export Control Act\\" Tuesday January 6, Press Release; Dennis Kucinich The charges were denied by the IDF and no action has been taken under the act. In July 2009 John Reece Roth, a former University of Tennessee professor, was convicted of violating the AECA and sentenced to 48 months in prison. Roth had a United States Air Force (USAF) contract to develop plasma technology to reduce drag on airplane wings. One application was for unmanned air vehicles (drones). Roth was accused of violating the law by sharing technical (not classified) data with Chinese and Iranian graduate students, and of having technical data on his laptop during a trip to China. Roth and others said that the AECA, as applied in his case, would violate academic freedom and force professors to discriminate against students on the basis of nationality.Why the Professor Went to Prison by Daniel Golden, BusinessWeek, November 01, 2012From Ivory Tower to Iron Bars: Scientists Risk Jail Time for Violating Export Laws, by Sharon Weinberger, Wired, 17 September 2009 See also * Arms Control and Disarmament Act of 1961 * Foreign Military Sales Act of 1968 * International Traffic in Arms Regulations References External links * Text of the act * Information on Illegal Arms trade from United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement * Details from the Bureau of Industry and Security, part of the Department of Commerce * * Category:Arms control Category:Export and import control Category:United States federal criminal legislation Category:United States federal firearms legislation Category:United States foreign relations legislation Category:United States Department of Commerce Category:94th United States Congress Category:1976 in law Category:History of the United States (1964‚Äì1980) de:ECCN ","title":"Arms Export Control Act"},{"id":"6679598","text":"State Highway 125 (SH 125) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Texas maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). The highway begins at the New Mexico state line southwest of Bledsoe, and passes through Bledsoe where it turns east intersecting SH 214 before terminating at SH 114\\\\. The highway is located entirely within Cochran County, and is numerically continuous with New Mexico State Road 125 which it meets at the state line and connects the highway to Tatum, NM. The highway has brief concurrencies with SH 214 in Lehman and Farm to Market Road 1780 in Whiteface. The highway's numerical designation was previously assigned to a roadway in southeast Texas during the 1920s and 1930s. The current highway was designated in 1990 over a portion of FM 769, but FM 769 had been unofficially signed as SH 125 since the 1950s. The connection New Mexico Highway was NM 294. Route description SH 125 begins where it meets NM 125 at the New Mexico state line. The route proceeds to the northeast almost immediately intersecting from the south FM 769 which runs closely parallel to the state line on the Texas side. SH 125 continues to the northeast to Bledsoe where the route intersects FM 2182 before turning east along Third Street. The route intersects FM 595 before leaving Bledsoe and then intersects FM 1169 and FM 1779 between Bledsoe and Lehman. In Lehman, the route joins SH 214 to the south for a short distance before turning east again. Beyond Lehman, the road intersects FM 2195 before gradually turning to the southeast toward Whiteface. The route enters Whiteface along East Second Street and turns north along North Taylor Street where SH 125 joins FM 1780\\\\. On the northern edge of Whiteface, SH 125 ends at SH 114. SH 125 passes through mostly agricultural lands and oil and gas fields across the largely flat and featureless terrain of the Llano Estacado. History SH 125 was previously designated on September 7, 1927 on a route from Anahuac to Beaumont in Chambers and Jefferson counties. On December 16, 1929, another split was added from Stowell through High Island to Galveston. On March 19, 1930, the route from Stowell to Galveston was renumbered as SH 124, and SH 125 had only the original section left. The former route designation was replaced on September 26, 1939 by SH 73-T between Anahuac and Stowell and by SH 124 between Stowell and Beaumont. SH 73-T was replaced by SH 65 on November 30, 1961. The current route was originally designated as FM 769 between SH 214 in Lehman and SH 290, now SH 114 in Whiteface on November 18, 1947. That route was extended to the New Mexico state line on April 1, 1948, while also being extended southward from Whiteface to an intersection with a road that on July 14, 1949 would become FM 301 On December 17, 1952, FM 769 was extended southward along the New Mexico state line. The route was first unofficially signed as SH 125 while officially maintaining its Farm to Market designation on March 30, 1955 allowing the route to be numerically continuous with its New Mexico counterpart, which was renumbered from NM 294 to NM 125 that day. On November 2, 1955, the portion of the route from FM 301 to SH 116 as the current SH 114 was designated between 1955 and 1978 was designated as an extension to FM 1780 with FM 769 ending where it intersected FM 1780. On May 2, 1962, the designation of FM 2010 was canceled and combined with FM 769 extending the route south along the state line to FM 1077 in Yoakum County. FM 1077 was renumbered as part of US 82 on December 16, 1963. FM 1077 has since been reassigned as RM 1077 to a route in Bandera County.

Since the Middle Ages, Hamburg was an important trading center in Europe. The convenient location of the port and its independence as a city and state for centuries strengthened this position. The city was member in the medieval Hanseatic trading league and a free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire. From 1815 until 1866 Hamburg was an independent and sovereign state of the German Confederation, then the North German Confederation (1866-71), the German Empire (1871-1918) and during the period of the Weimar Republic (1918-33). In Nazi Germany Hamburg was a city- state and a Gau from 1934 until 1945. After the Second World War Hamburg was in the British Zone of Occupation and became a state in the western part of Germany in the Federal Republic of Germany (Since 1949).  Etymology  According to Ptolemy, the settlement's first name was Treva. A fortress there was named Hammaburg (burg means \\"fortress\\"). In Old High German. hamma means \\"angle\\" and hamme means \\"pastureland\\", but the meaning of hamma in this context is unknown. The angle might refer to a spit of land or to the curvature of a river. The language spoken might not have been Old High German, as Low Saxon was spoken there later. Other theories hold that the castle was named for the word of a surrounding vast forest, hammen.Verg, p. 8 Hamm as a place name occurs a number of times in Germany, but its meaning is equally uncertain. It could be related to \\"heim\\" and Hamburg could have been placed in the territory of the ancient Chamavi. However, a derivation of \\"home city\\" is perhaps too direct, as the city was named after the castle. Another theory is that Hamburg comes from ham which is Old Saxon for ‚Äú(grassy) river bank‚Äù or ‚Äúmeadow/pasture (by a river) ‚Äù.  First steps until 1189 AD  Hamburg in 1150, a 19th-century visualization. First settlers in the area would have been a hunting and gathering society in the late Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic. There are several archaeological documented records in the areas of Wellingsb√ºttel, Meiendorf and Rahlstedt from 20,000 to 8000 BC. In 4000 BC first permanent settlements are recorded in the area of Fischbeker Heide.Verg, p. 11 The culture of hunters is named Hamburg culture. In 808 AD a castle was ordered to be built by Emperor Charlemagne, as a defense against Slavic and Viking intrusions. Later Charlemagne's son Louis built this castle on the old trading path from Hedeby in the North to Magdeburg and Bardowick in 810. On 25 December 831 Ansgar was consecrated as the archbishop for the Hammaburg. Ansgar became later known as the Apostle of the North. Ebbo, Archbishop of Reims claimed to have built a baptistery in a small village in this area and this village was named after him Ebbodorp, Eppendorp or Eppendorf. In 845 Vikings came up the River Elbe and destroyed Hamburg, at that time a town of around 500 inhabitants. Two years later, Hamburg was united with Bremen as the Bishopric of Hamburg-Bremen. In 880 Hamburg was destroyed again this time by Slavic and Danish soldiers. Pope Benedict V was deposed and carried off to Hamburg in 964. He died in 965 and was buried in the St. Mary's Cathedral.Verg, p.15 In 983, the town was destroyed by King Mstivoj of the Obodrites. In 1050 Hamburg consisted of four castles, the bishopric castle also known as Bischofsturm was built around 1037 by Bezelin. The Wiedenburg was built 1043 by Adalbert. The Alsterburg was built by Duke Bernard II of Saxony in 1045 and the new castle built in 1050. After further raids by the Obodrites in 1066 the bishop Adalbert permanently moved to Bremen. In 1188 Hamburg adopted the L√ºbeck law (L√ºbsches Recht), a code of rights superseded in some areas in 1900 by the civil code of Germany (B√ºrgerliches Gesetzbuch), although it is disputed if the law in Hamburg originated from an own law.  On the way 1189-1529  Seal of 1241 (Replica) A charter in 1189 by Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor granted Hamburg the status of an Imperial Free City and tax-free access up the Lower Elbe into the North Sea, the right to fish, to cut trees and the freedom of military service.Verg, p. 16 The charter was given orally for Hamburg's backing of Frederick's crusades, and in 1265 an in all probability forged letter was presented to or by the Rath of Hamburg.Verg, p. 26 In 1190 the bishop's old city and the count's new city created a noble council (Rath). Valdemar II of Denmark raided and occupied Hamburg in 1201 and in 1214 Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor declined all claims of property northern of the river Elbe. Hamburg was controlled by Denmark. The Danish governor united the new and the old parts of Hamburg under one law, town hall and court. A series of Danish defeats culminating in the Battle of Bornh√∂ved on 22 July 1227 cemented the loss of Denmark's northern German territories and liberated Hamburg also. Hamburg submitted to Adolf IV of Holstein.Verg, p. 20 From 1230 a new fortification was built. Its layout and names can be found in 2008, e.g. Millerntor-Stadion, named after the western city gate Mildradistor or Mildertor, and the park Planten un Blomen, build on the old fortification.Verg, p. 23 In 1264 the senate of Hamburg enacted a law to protect the swans of the city. Hard punishments should be given if a swan was beaten to death, insulted, shot or eaten. A popular belief (omen) is that Hamburg will be free and hanseatic as long as swans are living on the Alster river. (Wings of freedom) On 5 August 1284 a great fire destroyed all but one residential house in Hamburg. The first description of civil, criminal and procedural law for a city in Germany in German language, the Ordeelbook (Ordeel: sentence) was written by the solicitor of the senate Jordan von Boitzenburg in 1270.Verg, p. 25 In 1350 the Black Death, one of the deadliest pandemics in human history, struck in Hamburg killing more than 6,000, half of the city's population. = Hanseatic league = Hauptkirche St. Petri date to the late 1300s Two contracts with L√ºbeck in 1241 marks the origin and core of the powerful Hanseatic League of trading cities. The first contract stated that both cities would defend their freedom and their privileges together. The second contract stated that the road between the two cities will be secured against bandits and that deported √©migr√©s would not find shelter in the other city. In 1264 the east‚Äìwest route for commerce was cobbled in Hamburg. It was the third cobbled road in northern Europe and called Steinstra√üe, which is still the name of a street in Hamburg. On 8 November 1266 a contract between Henry III and Hamburg's traders allowed them to establish a hanse in London. This was the first time in history the word hanse was mentioned for the trading guild Hanseatic League.Verg, p. 30 In May 1368 a fleet of 37 ships and 2,000 armed men, including two cogs and 200 men from Hamburg, conquered Copenhagen and razed it to the ground. Hamburg's most important export article was beer. In 1377 a new currency, the Mark, was established by the Wendischer M√ºnzverein (Wend currency association). The cities Hamburg, L√ºbeck, Luneburg, Wismar and Rostock formed this association. Three tonnes of beer cost one mark. At this time Hamburg's population was 14,000. Hamburg was the third- largest city in the Hanseatic League (after L√ºbeck and Cologne). On 21 October 1401 the pirate Klaus St√∂rtebeker was executed in Hamburg, although pirates were often thrown overboard to drown or decapitated shortly after their capture.Verg, pp. 32-37 In 1433 Simon van Utrecht defeated the pirates and conquered Emden. Bremen started a war of capturing ships against Hamburg, L√ºbeck, L√ºneburg and the Netherlands in 1438.Verg, p. 42 = First constitution = The first Reze√ü of 1410. The first constitution of Hamburg was established on 10 August 1410. A civil commotion caused a compromise (German:Reze√ü, literally meaning: withdrawal). The citizen Hein Brandt has met the duke Johannes IV of Saxe-Lauenburg, who owed Brandt money. Brandt took the duke to task and insulted him. The duke complained to the senate. The senate cited Brandt and he confessed and was arrested. This caused an uproar and citizens formed a council. At this time the senate was formed by richest citizens, not elected and the senate did not need to give account for its decisions. The situation in Hamburg was unstable because in 1408 members of the senate of L√ºbeck had found asylum in Hamburg, after they were expelled by the citizens of L√ºbeck. The formed council of the sixty (German: der Sechzigerrat) demanded to free Brandt and to enter into negotiations. The mayor Kersten Miles and the senate freed Brandt and agreed after four days of negotiations to a compromise of 20 points. Some of these points were: *Article 1. No citizen, poor or rich, is to be arrested without a hearing at the senate or a court. *Article 6. The senate is not allowed to begin a war without a hearing of the citizens. *Article 10. The senate cannot grant safe conduct for a person who owes a citizen of Hamburg. *Article 13. In case of disputes between the senate and the citizens, these disputes need to be corrected immediately and are not to be delayed by jurists. *Article 15. Disloyal public servants need to be discharged.Art. 1: Kein B√ºrger, arm oder reich, darf ohne Anh√∂rung durch Rat oder Gericht verhaftet werden. Art. 6: Es soll der Rat keinen Krieg anfangen, sondern dar√ºber erst die B√ºrger fragen. Art. 10: Der Rat darf niemendem freies Geleit zusichern, der Schulden bei Hamburger B√ºrgern hat. Art. 13: Bei Streitigkeiten zwischen Rat und B√ºrgern sind diese ohne Verzug zu bereinigen und d√ºrfen auch nicht durch Juristen verz√∂gerd werden. Art. 15: Untreue Bedienstete der Stadt sind zu entlassen. Verg, p. 39 It is the considered as the first constitution of Hamburg.Verg, p. 39  The Lutheran church law and its consequences  Hamburg by Georg Braun and Franz Hogenberg (1588) The 1573 execution of pirate Klein Henszlein and his crew, captured by a fleet from Hamburg after 13 years of active piracy in the North Sea. On 15 May 1529 the city embraced Lutheranism. The senate of Hamburg had asked Martin Luther to send his friend and colleague Johannes Bugenhagen to create a new church regularity. Bugenhagen's work created a state church for Hamburg. The service was held in Low German and the parishes elected their own pastors. There was no iconoclasm in Hamburg mostly because of Johannes Aepinus, the new pastor of St. Petri, who stated the statues of false gods and lying pictures needed to be removed from the churches instantly. He took them down and stored them, so that altarpieces by Meister Bertram and others survived, and are now in the city's museums. At the same time on 24 February, the long compromise (German: Langer Reze√ü) reorganized the political system. The senate, now 24 aldermen, held the executive and judicial authority. But without the council of the citizens, no laws could be enacted. The councils were elected by the 4 parishes. The parishes were now also administrative divisions of the city.Verg, pp. 45-46 In May 1531 the cathedral chapter closed the Catholic cathedral, it only reopened as Lutheran proto-cathedral in 1540.Jana J√ºrgs, Der Reformationsdiskurs der Stadt Hamburg: Ereignisabh√§ngiges Textsortenaufkommen und textsortenabh√§ngige Ereignisdarstellung der Reformation in Hamburg 1521-1531, Marburg an der Lahn: Tectum, 2003, p. 95. . Roman Catholics lost their citizenship and were challenged to leave the city, although remaining Catholics could practice their religion in the small chapels of the diplomatic missions of the Holy Roman Empire. Not until 1785 did the senate acknowledge a small community.Dennis S. Slaubaugh, '\\"Katholiken\\", Hamburg Lexikon, p. 266 In 1558 the Hamburg stock market was founded. In 1567 Hamburg asked a group of English traders to settle in the city. This was in conflict with the rules of the Hanseatic League, but Hamburg used the taxes to downsize the public debt. The cause of this debt was Hamburg's contribution to the Schmalkaldic War (1546-1552) between the Lutheran dukes and cities and the emperor.Verg, pp. 50-51 Modern History = 17th and 18th centuries = Hamburg in 1680 When the Senate commissioned Jan van Valckenborgh to build a second layer to the city's fortifications to protect against the Thirty Years War (1618‚Äì1648), Hamburg was also extended by the newly created \\"New Town\\" (Neustadt). Some of these street names still date from the grid system of roads he introduced.History of the area , accessed 3 November 2012 In the late 1580s, the first Sephardi Jews arrived--fleeing from Portugal--and built a Portuguese Jewish community in Hamburg. In 1610, official lists of the senate counted about 100 Jewish families. Lutheran theologians preached against them, especially the \\"schools of Satan\\"--meaning the synagogues--and in 1611 the senate had to ask the Lutheran theological faculties of Jena and Frankfort for their opinions. The faculties attested to the senate that the Jews should be tolerated in the town as strangers. The safety in person were granted; however, several assaults, often triggered by Christian homilies, against individual Jews took place. The community was not to be allowed to practise its religion publicly, but small private praying rooms were overlooked. Not until 1660 could the first small synagogue be built. In 1712/13, the plague raged in Hamburg and Altona. The latter was burned down by a trespassing Swedish army (Altona was not part of Hamburg at the time); Sweden's adversaries retaliated by burning down Wolgast in Swedish Pomerania. In 1762 the city was briefly occupied by Danish forces who were trying to raise money to fight a coming war with Russia.Dull, Jonathon R. The French Navy in the Seven Years War. University of Nebraska, 2005. p.220 = 19th century = Hamburg in 1800. Briefly annexed by Napoleon I (1810‚Äì14), Hamburg was the capital of the department Bouches-de-l'Elbe, with Amandus Augustus Abendroth as the new mayor. from Elektronische Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie Hamburg suffered severely during the Continental Blockade and Napoleon's last campaign in Germany but managed to raise two forces to fight against him, the Hamburg Citizen Militia and Hanseatic Legion. The city was besieged for over a year by Allied forces (mostly Russian, Swedish and German). Russian forces under General Bennigsen finally freed the city in 1814. In addition to stimulating German nationalism, the war had a major impact in mobilizing a civic spirit in numerous volunteer activities. Many volunteer militias and civic associations were formed, and collaborated with churches, and the press to support local and state armies, patriotic wartime mobilization, humanitarian relief and postwar commemorative practices and rituals.Katherine Aaslestad, \\"Cities and War: Modern Military Urbanism in Hamburg and Leipzig during the Napoleonic Era.\\" German History 35.3 (2017): 381-402. City state of Hamburg in 1890 Hamburg was a member of the 39-state German Confederation from 1814 to 1866 and, as the other member-states, enjoyed full sovereignty.Michael Hundt, \\"Souver√§nit√§t\\", Hamburg Lexikon, pp. 439--440 After periodic political unrest, particularly in 1848, the self-ruling city-state adopted a democratic constitution in 1860 that provided for the election of the Senate, the governing body of the city-state, by adult taxpaying males. Other innovations were the separation of powers, the separation of Church and State, freedom of the press, of assembly and association. Hamburg became a member of the North German Confederation (1866-71), the German Empire (1871-1918), while in 1888 it was one of the last two states to join the German Customs Union (along with Bremen) and was to maintain its self-ruling status during the Weimar Republic (1919‚Äì33). During the first half of the 19th century a patron goddess with Hamburg's Latin name Hammonia emerged, mostly in romantic and poetic references, and although she has no mythology to call her own, Hammonia became the symbol of the city's spirit during this time. The great fire 1842, by Peter Suhr 1842 Newspaper report of the fire 4858 medals were issued to fighters of the 1842 great fire In 1842, about a third of the city was destroyed in the \\"Great Fire\\". This fire started on the night of 4 May 1842 and was extinguished on 8 May. It destroyed three churches, the town hall, and countless other buildings. It killed 51 people, and left an estimated 20,000 homeless. Reconstruction took more than 40 years. As part of the reconstruction, the first large modern sanitation system in Europe was built in Hamburg. Hamburg's central promenade Jungfernstieg on River Alster in 1900. Hamburg experienced its fastest growth during the second half of the 19th century, when its population more than quadrupled to 800,000 as the growth of the city's Atlantic trade helped make it Europe's third-largest port. Construction of the port lead to the disappearance of several of the smaller of Hamburg's many rivers and channels, such as the Dradenau. A major outbreak of cholera in 1892 was very badly handled by the city government, which still retained an unusual degree of independence for a German city at the time. About 8,600 died in the largest German epidemic of the late 19th century, and the last major cholera epidemic in an important city in the Western world. The Hamburg water supply from the Elbe did not meet modern standards, and the authorities long continued to deny there was an epidemic, or implement the new understanding of the germ theory of disease. The Imperial government used the scandal to greatly reduce the powers of the city authorities.J. N. Hays, Epidemics and pandemics: their impacts on human history, pp. 321-326, ABC- CLIO, 2005, , , Internet Archive = 20th century = With Albert Ballin as its director the Hamburg-America Line became the world's largest transatlantic shipping company around the start of the 20th century, and Hamburg was also home to shipping companies to South America, Africa, India and East Asia. Hamburg became a cosmopolitan metropolis based on worldwide trade. Hamburg was the port for most Germans and Eastern Europeans to leave for the New World and became home to trading communities from all over the world (like a small Chinatown in Altona, Hamburg). In 1903, the world's first organised club for social and family nudism, Freilichtpark (Free-Light Park) was opened in Hamburg. It was located on a lake formed by the Alster River in the southern part of the city, adjoining a bathing beach. After World War I Germany lost her colonies and Hamburg lost many of its trade routes. =German Revolution= After the November Revolution, the Workers' and Soldiers' Councils took the city administrations under their control. They agreed to hold a free, equal and secret-ballot election on March 16, 1919. There were 6 elections in total from 1919 to 1933. In the first election, SPD and DDP agreed to form a coalition. However, populist sentiments were rising after WWI and the Great Depression, and the relatively centrist SPD quickly lost grounds. In the last election, the NSDAP got 35% of the vote and the KPD got 15% of the vote. This paves the way for the subsequent Nazi ruling. The Communist movement in Hamburg led a short-lived \\"Sparticist\\" revolt that was quickly repressed in 1919. = In Nazi Germany = After the takeover of power by the Nazi regime, administrative powers were significantly altered. The Gesetz √ºber den Neuaufbau des Reiches (Law concerning the reconstruction of the Reich) (30 January 1934) abandoned the concept of a federal republic. The political institutions of the L√§nder were practically abolished altogether, passing all powers to the central government. The German constituent states were replaced in 1935 by regional districts (German: Gau) led by Nazi Party officials who obeyed the central government's orders. On 16 May 1933 Karl Kaufmann (1900-1969) was appointed as Reichsstatthalter (imperial governor or imperial lieutenant) in Hamburg. The Hamburg Senate had resigned in March 1933 and the Hamburg Parliament elected Carl Vincent Krogmann (NSDAP) as mayor.Verg, pp:161-163 In 1938 the city boundaries were extended with the Greater Hamburg Act to incorporate Wandsbek, Harburg, Wilhelmsburg and Altona. On 1 April 1938 Constitution of Hamburg was suppressed through an Imperial Law (German: Reichsgesetz),Impirial Law of the Constitution and Administration of Hamburg the Hamburg Senate was dissolved and the position of First Mayor of Hamburg abolished. Hamburg was named Hansestadt Hamburg. During World War II Hamburg suffered a series of devastating air raids which killed 42,000 German civilians. British bombers dropped 23,000 tons of bombs, the Americans dropped 16,000 tons. As the bombings continued more and more people moved out. By May 1945 half a million people (35%) had fled.Richard Overy, The Bombers and the Bombed: Allied Air War Over Europe 1940-1945 (2014) pp 301, 304 Through this, and the new zoning guidelines of the 1960s, the inner city lost much of its architectural past. From 1938 until 1945 a concentration camp was established in the Neuengamme quarter of Hamburg, the Neuengamme concentration camp,No. 1034 in the official German list of concentration camps: some of the buildings have been preserved and as of 2008 serve as a memorial. From 1939 until 1945 more than 500,000 men, women and children -- including prisoners of war -- were forced to work at more than 900 companies, living in more than 1,200 camps all over Hamburg. Some of these camps held only 7 inmates, others were known for more than 1,500 inmates. = After the Second World War = Clearing rubble, Hamburg 1950. After the end of the Second World War until the end of the Besatzungsstatut Hamburg was a British-occupied from 1945 to 1949. Specially George Ayscough Armytage and Governor Henry V. Berry identified with the city and worked through the indirect rule, asking prospective Hamburg inhabitants to resume office in the administration.Helmut Stubbe-da Luz, \\"Britische Besatzung\\", Hamburg Lexikon, pp. 85-86 Denazification and rebuilding of the society proceeded, e.g. in Hamburg were the important trials for war crimes (Hamburg Ravensbr√ºck Trials) held at the Curio house in Rotherbaum quarter, and Radio Hamburg, a public broadcasting radio station, was established on 4 May 1945, even before the capitulation. The Iron Curtain ‚Äî only east of Hamburg ‚Äî separated the city from most of its hinterland and further reduced Hamburg's global trade. On 16 February 1962 a severe storm caused the Elbe to rise to an all-time high, inundating one fifth of Hamburg and killing more than 300 people. = In the 2000s = Floods caused by Cyclone Xaver in HafenCity on 6 December 2013 After German reunification in 1990, and the accession of some Eastern European and Baltic States into the EU in 2004, Hamburg Harbour and Hamburg have ambitions for regaining their positions as the region's largest deep-sea port for container shipping and its major commercial and trading centre. A group of radical Islamists that included students who eventually came to be key operatives in the 9/11 attacks, according to U.S. and German intelligence agencies, was called the Hamburg cell. On the 7th and 8th of July 2017 the G20 summit took place in Hamburg, accompanied by protests and riots.

WRB was formed on 1 July 2007, with Encana taking a 49% interest in Wood River and also Phillips 66's Borger refinery. Encana subsequently spun off oil sands producer Cenovus and ConocoPhillips spun off Phillips 66. In return for a 49% stake in the refinery, ConocoPhillips gained a joint interest in two Alberta oil sands (bitumen) heavy oil projects: Christina Lake (Alberta) and Foster Creek. ConocoPhillips‚Äô interest was sold to Cenovus in May 2017, leaving Cenovus the sole owner and operator of the assets.Cenovus completes acquisition of assets in Western Canada from ConocoPhillips Cenovus uses SAGD (steam-assisted gravity drainage) technology at those sites. The complex is capable of refining of crude oil per day and is the largest refinery operated by Phillips 66. Oil is supplied from the Gulf of Mexico, Canada, and domestic sources through pipelines. The facility produces of gasoline, of diesel and jet fuels, as well as other products including asphalt, propane, and chemical feedstocks. A new four-drum coker, part of Wood River Refinery's Coker and Refinery Expansion (CORE) was completed in November 2011. The new coker has a capacity of 75,000 barrels per day and is expected to expand the capacity to handle the bitumen from the Alberta oil sands by nearly 700%. The new Wood River coker's processing capacity is approximately 200,000 - 220,000 barrels per day. The CORE project took about three years to build, with a total cost of US $3.8 billion (US $1.9 billion to Cenovus), and has increased clean product yield by 5% to approximately 85%. While the expansion was undertaken specifically to handle heavy oil imported from Alberta, the refined transportation fuels products are destined for the U.S. Midwest market, including St. Louis and Chicago not Canada. An RO filtration system upgrade to treat boiler water was also completed in 2011. 3500 total feet of pipe on 800 feet of modular pipe rack was installed along movable trailers containing the filtration system. This expansion increased the amount of steam available to the refinery. Thermal cracking, stripping and power generation are some of the major processes within a refinery that use steam. Wood River Refinery was originally built by Shell in 1917. In the late 1990s, Shell and Texaco merged their downstream segments to form the Motiva (with Saudi national oil company Saudi ARAMCO) and Equilon joint ventures. During a prolonged period of low refining profit margins, Equilon sold the refinery to Tosco in 2003. Shortly thereafter, Phillips Petroleum acquired Tosco. When Conoco and Phillips merged, the refinery became an asset of ConocoPhillips. Multiple ownership of refineries is not uncommon in the United States, where many refineries (in original form) predate World War II.

History The earliest Fringe-type drama festival in Calgary was the Plan B Festival, held in 2000 at a variety of locations in both Calgary's downtown and the neighbouring community of Inglewood. The Plan B Festival arose after the 2000 Calgary Fringe Festival was cancelled due to administrative difficulties, and involved (and was organized by) many of the same artists that were originally planning on partaking in the aborted Fringe. Calgary Artist/Activist Patricia Anne Duquette, on behalf of Green Fools Physical Theatre Co., coordinated a massive community effort to rescue the festival with the additional aims of setting a precedent for future fundraising efforts. Approximately 5,000 people attended the adhoc presentations and events over the course of five days, establishing an overwhelming show of interest among Calgarians. The first official Fringe festivals in Calgary took place in 2001 and 2002, organized primarily by the Loose Moose Theatre company, and based entirely in the inner-city neighbourhood of Inglewood. These were short, three-day festivals, held the weekend after the Edmonton International Fringe Festival. However, after the completion of the 2002 festival, Loose Moose lost their lease on the Garry Theatre, and were thus unable to produce the Fringe in subsequent years. =Reestablishment= A new license to produce a Fringe in Calgary was secured from the Canadian Association of Fringe FestivalsCanadian Association of Fringe Festivals in 2005 by a new team headed by Blair Gallant and Jason Rothery, and a new Fringe was held in the summer of 2006. Many elements have changed from the earlier Fringes, including time, scope and locations. The Fringe is now a full-length 8-day Fringe: 2016 dates are Fri. July 29--Sat. Aug. 6, almost the same time as Saskatoon Fringe, and just before the Aug. 11 start of the Edmonton Fringe. In previous years when they overlapped, a number of shows were performed at both Fringes, either closing in Calgary early or opening in Edmonton late. In addition to the theatrical performances (greatly increased to 36 from the roughly dozen in the 01 and 02 Fringes), the 2006 Calgary Fringe included street performances and vendors (typical for a Fringe) as well as a film festival, visual arts displays and live music (less common). The 2006 Calgary Fringe was held at a number of venues; the festival elements, film, visual art and music were held on 17th Avenue in the Beltline district, with the theatrical performances split between the nearby Calgary Opera rehearsal hall and the more distant EPCOR Centre for the Performing Arts, located in the downtown. = Present = The festival is currently held in the Inglewood neighbourhood of Calgary. Michele Gallant is the festival Director and Producer. Compared to other fringe festivals, the Calgary Fringe is classified as a smaller festival, averaging about 30 shows a year.  Tickets  Audiences must make a one-time purchase of a Fringe Button to gain admittance to all festival events, including shows. Tickets to individual shows can then be purchased on the festival website. To gain entrance to a show, audiences must have a button for the festival and a ticket for the event. Artists receive 100% of the ticket price, minus fees.  Festival Events  = Lottery Draw = The artist draw for the Calgary Fringe happens at the beginning of December. The 2019 draw was held December 5th, at Village Brewery. It was hosted by Calgary improv group, The Kinkonauts. The event was also live-streamed on Facebook.  Venues  There are two kinds of venues in the Calgary Fringe: Lottery and BYOV (Bring Your Own Venue). Lottery venues are run by the festival and are assigned to artists drawn in the festival lottery. BYOV venues are run by artists who were not drawn in the lottery and are therefore arranging their own venue. BYOV venues that are outside the festival neighbourhood of Inglewood are sometimes also referred to as \\"satellite\\" venues. = Lottery Venues = * 2018 ** Lantern Church (2 venues: the Sanctuary and the Basement), Festival Hall, The Artpoint Gallery, Alexandra Centre = BYOV Venues = * 2018 ** Gravity Espresso & Wine Bar, Inglewood Fine Arts Gallery, Lolita‚Äôs Lounge, Lunchbox Theatre  Awards  The Calgary Fringe Festival awards the following each year: = Best of Fest Venue Series = One show per lottery venue is selected for this award. Selected shows are given an extra performance on the last Saturday of the festival. This award is determined by a special festival committee and patron feedback.

It is one of the institutes of the Max Planck Society. Organization The institute consists of five departments and several independent research institutes. =Law and Anthropology= Headed by Prof. Dr. Marie-Claire Foblets, the Department of Law and Anthropology was established in 2012 to focus on the effects of societies and cultures towards law and politics and vice versa. This department also carefully looks how scholars of this specific discipline can and should take responsibility for implications surrounding the interplay of these societal factors. =Resilience and Transformation in Eurasia= Headed by Prof. Dr. Chris Hann, the Department of Resilience and Transformation in Eurasia is concerned with the interaction of economics, politics and anthropology within Eurasia. Research sub-groups are focusing and have done studies on kinship, historical anthropology, economic anthropology, urban anthropology, culture and socialism, and citizenship. =Anthropology of Politics and Governance= Headed by Prof. Dr. Ursula Rao, the Department of Anthropology of Politics and Governance brings together a group of successful scholars undertaking research in form of in-depth case studies in Asia, Africa and Europe about the tactics, strategies, and motivations that shape political action in times of perceived crisis to study programmes and initiatives that aim to shape the future by proposing new ways of managing complexity and caring for relations in a more- than-human world. =Integration and Conflict= Headed by Prof. Dr. G√ºnther Schlee, the Department of Integration and Conflict focuses on social systems particularly based on identification and differentiation among groups. The department looks into the holistic elements that build ethnic identity through kinship, friendship, language, history, religion, and how ethnicity plays a role across social systems at individual and supra-individual levels. =Anthropology of Economic Experimentation= Headed by Prof. Dr. Biao Xiang, the Department of Anthropology of Economic Experimentation focuses on a wide range of political economy issues, including state-society relations, labour, social reproduction, and mobility governance, through the lens of migration. Management The Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology is mainly represented by the following people: Directors * Prof. Dr. Marie-Claire Foblets * Prof. Dr. Chris Hann * Prof. Dr. G√ºnther Schlee Fellow * Burkhard Schnepel Services * Bettina Mann (Research Coordinator) * Kathrin Niehuus (Head of Administration) * Anja Neuner (Head Librarian) Controversies In January 2017, the Department of Law and Anthropology has invited the controversial American activist and political scientist Norman Finkelstein as a visiting scholar. The Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology has thus been criticized for providing a platform for a controversial speaker. In a statement the Max Planck Institute said that the purpose of Finkelstein's invitation to the Institute was to engage in a dialogue with him to discuss his work within an academic context. The research institute is dedicated to basic research where controversy cannot be ruled out; controversy is a ‚Äútrait of academic work‚Äù.

Voices are provided by Mel Blanc. This is one of only two cartoons where Elmer's speech impediment is referenced in the title (without Elmer appearing), the other one is Wackiki Wabbit. It is a parody of the fairy tale \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\". It should not be confused with another parody of this story starring Bugs, Daffy and Elmer, the short Beanstalk Bunny (1955). Plot The film opens as if it is Jack and the Beanstalk, and finds Warner's famous \\"jackrabbit\\" (Bugs), already in the giant's lofty realm, chopping down gigantic carrots. It turns out they belong to a dim-witted giant. The giant is incensed at Bugs invading his \\"victory garden\\" and Bugs spends most of the rest of the film trying to elude the giant. At one point he challenges him to a duel and the giant starts pacing off into the distance and is soon over the horizon. Bugs' self-congratulations (\\"You know, I'm so smart, sometimes it almost frightens me\\") is short-lived, as the giant comes toward him from the other horizon. Finally, the giant accidentally falls from his sky-borne realm and crashes into the ground, making a huge giant-shaped hole. Instead of being dead, the hard-headed giant simply sits up, dizzy, and invokes a well-known comic catchphrase, \\"Duh, watch out for dat foist step - it's a lulu!\\".
