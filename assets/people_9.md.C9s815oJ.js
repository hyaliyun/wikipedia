Cody and his wife, Louisa, and their daughter, Orra (c. 1882) Louisa Maud Frederici (1844–1921) was the wife of William F. \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody. She married on March 6, 1866, in St. Louis, Missouri, and remained in a rocky relationship for 51 years until Cody's death in 1917. The couple had met when Cody traveled to St. Louis due to his Union Army duties at the close of the Civil War. They married soon after, the wedding taking place shortly after their interactions in 1865, with Cody taking time out from scouting and horse- driving to marry Louisa. Louisa, often referred to as \\"Lulu\\" by her husband, was a proud woman who would not simply grant Cody a divorce in 1904, which led to trial in 1905. The case was given in Louisa's favor after a judge deemed \\"incompatibility was not a grounds for divorce.\\" Louisa and Cody had four children: Arta Lucille (1866–1904), Kit Carson (1870–1876), Orra Maude (1872–1883), and Irma Louise (1883–1918). Louisa would outlive all of her children, with Arta dying shortly before the proceedings of the divorce. Louisa and the children lived separate from Cody as he traveled. Remaining in North Platte, Nebraska, Louisa purchased most of the family's property in her own name. She did this in hopes that if Cody hit a spell of bad financial luck, which he often did, she would be able to provide him with a small fortune. Detailing her life and issues with her husband, Louisa's Memories of Buffalo Bill (c. 1923) shows her devotion to her husband, regardless of his alleged relationships with actresses and women in the Wild West shows. Louisa loved to sew and often sewed her husband's and children's clothes; this was a result of her training in a convent as a young girl. Noted as always being practical, Louisa is noted by Lottie Kocken (a girl who was part of the Buffalo Bill Excursion in 1878) as being upset when Cody would send her a large bouquet of flowers because \\"she needed the money more than flowers.\\" Jessie Blackenburg Renyolds also remembered Louisa, commenting that \\"Willie just couldn't hold onto money, for he was a grand spender, and she has to fix it so he couldn't mortgage everything.\\" When Kit Carson died in 1868, that was believed to have been the final straw for Cody, who was wanting to spend his money and gain the affections of any woman but his wife. Cody filed two divorce petitions, with one newspaper claiming that the cause behind them was Louisa's \\"nagging.\\" The first filing of divorce was withdrawn due to the death of Orra Cody in 1883. The second went to trial in Cheyenne, Wyoming, in 1905, flooding headlines and tearing communities into the crossfire and demanding they pick sides. Cody and Louisa. While the divorce scandal raged on between the two in the courtroom and in the papers, Louisa continued to maintain the house and her living children. When asked to put the suit on hold temporarily in order to attend the funeral of Arta, Louisa refused, demanding that she remain married and the suit be dropped. On March 23, 1905, the district court of Sheridan did not grant Cody his divorce. Louisa then paid her real estate taxes in Lincoln County, Nebraska on 1,200 acres of land and numerous houses assessed under her name and on 700 acres that had been in Cody's name; the result was more than $600, making her one of the largest tax payers in the county. Louisa and Cody reconciled in 1910 and she often attended his Wild West shows until his death in 1917. Louisa died in 1921, and was buried with her husband on Lookout Mountain.

The collection has been published biweekly from February to December 1968. Each issue is composed of diverse art pieces, created by individual artist that were important at that period. The portfolios has a wide range of different aspects such as dada, surrealism, and pop art that includes photography, sound, drawings and writings. Six portfolios containing eleven to thirteen objects were produced in unsigned editions of 2000. SMS A Collection of Multiples 40th Anniversary Exhibition catalogue showing the complete set of all six portfolios There were 100 copies for a deluxe edition. Almost all of the 73 artists solely signed their contributions for the deluxe portfolio, while a few others chose to sign, number and/or date. Reportedly, there were also a very small handful of artists who did not sign at all. S.M.S. portfolios webseite of Smithsonian Libraries, NW, Washington DC 1968 S.M.S. portfolio history description in Worthopedia database This project has been inspired by the Fluxus movement, which encouraged diverse artists to come together as a form of a protest against galleries, not agreeing to them having the authority to determine the value of art. So by bringing artist together without any establishments, which by means, without being judged and determined, played equally in their specific art areas. Each portfolio within the issue, is a dossier about the subject of personal impressions, and the way to establish their relationship between artist’s impulse and impersonal meanings of practical reproduction. After merging them with the daily life, \\"Shit must Stop\\" shows the artist how to come to terms with forces that often drive them into the seclusion of the studio. Carter Ratcliff, “SMS: Art in Real Time,” from SMS: A Collection of Multiples. Exhibition Catalog. Published by Reinhold-Brown Gallery, NY. Oct. 1988.  Publication  = Shit Must Stop N°1 = The First edition of Shit Must Stop contains 11 different portfolios from important artists, (Irving Petlin, Su Braden, James Lee Byars, Christo, Walter de Maria, Richard Hamilton, Kaspar Koening, Julien Levy, Sol Mednick, Nancy Reitkopf, La Monte Young & Marian Zazeela). The artists scaled their project into similar format, in this edition, into a small size packet. In this case, Christo who works with large environmental collaborations, scaled down his works in order to create a small sized two dimensinal diorama. Julian Levy also contributed a list of prescriptions for faux medications, capsules for artists he determined in need of treatment. Both of these allow for the artist's voice to shine through, while still maintaining the integrity of William Copley's project. This issue reads more like a journal than the following issue that seems more interactive. = Shit Must Stop N°2 = This Second issue is more experimental with Marcel Duchamp, Nicolas Calas, Bruce Conner, Marcia Herscovitz, Alain Jacquet, Ray Johnson, Lee Lozano, Meret Oppenheim, Bernard Pfreim, George Reavevy, Clovis Trouille. The cover, designed by Marcel Duchamp, is a white folder with a playable record album attached to the front. Printed on the record itself is ESQUIVONS LES ECCHYMOSES DES ESQUIMAUX AUX MOTS EXQUIS, which roughly translates to “dodge the Eskimo bruises with exquisite words,” but functions as a sort of French tongue twister. Duchamp seems to be playfully addressing the restrictions inherent in more traditional portfolio design in order to redefine this practice. The record has aesthetic appeal, but it similarly has far greater use value than the first issue’s front cover, which was a reproduction of a painting. Another particularly provocative work in Shit Must Stop N°2 is Bruce Connor’s Legal Tender. Connor mimics the design of American currency with his stack of eighteen “dollar bills,” which seem more reminiscent of Monopoly money than American legal tender. This element allows for the whole issue to feel like a game, as if you could trade Connor’s money for something more valuable. = Shit Must Stop N°3 = Third publication is conceived by 12 artists (John Battan, Aftograf, Enrico Baj, Billy Copley, Dick Higgins, Joseph Kosuth, Ronnie Landfield, Roland Penrose, Man Ray, H.C Westermann, Hannah Weiner, Terry Riley. It contains the widest variety of objects. It features two Terry Riley cassettes, four pieces of mail from H.C. Westermann seemingly addressed to the reader, and even an original Man Ray readymade. Terry Riley, who is famously known for his innovative avant-garde musical compositions, contributed two beautifully packaged cassettes, which feel like gifts in their own right. H.C. Westermann, who is known for his playful line drawings, mailed four drawings to William Copley, who reproduced them to an exact degree in this issue. In the sealed envelopes are four proposals, with Westermann’s own notes included. Opening these letters feels as though we are receiving mail from Westermann ourselves, which seems to have been Copley’s intention by including in the issue exactly what he received from Westermann. = Shit Must Stop N°4 = Artist (Robert Stanley, Arman, Paul Bergtold, John Cage, Hollis Frampton, On Kawara, Roy Lichtenstein, Lil Picard, Domenico Rotella, Robert Watts, Princess Winifred, La Monte Young, Marian Zazeela) Each piece is laden with a conceptual mythology that can be thoroughly investigated or just taken at face value, which seems a great leap from the playful nature of the first few issues. A particularly interesting work from Shit Must Stop N°4 is Lil Picard’s burned bowtie. Each bowtie was hand burned, thus each number in the edition is slightly varied. The maroon and white polka dotted tie first appears as a joyful addition, but the burned edges seem a quite poignant dissenting argument. Other interesting works are Rotella’s prison poems, which were clandestinely written on scraps of paper during a five-month prison sentence in Rome, Italy. The tactile nature of the poems as works of art in their own right seems important for the overall impact of the piece, which elegantly replicates a minute part of Rotella’s prison experience. = Shit Must Stop N°5 = Participated artists are, Congo, William Anthony, Wall Batterton, William Copley, Edward Fitzgerald, Neil Jenny, Angus MacLise, Bruce Nauman, Yoko Ono, Mel Ramos, Robert Rohm, William Schwedler, Diane Wakoski, Lawrence Weiner Unlike the previous issues, this one doesn’t appear to be projecting a specific sensibility upon the reader, thus making it seem more disparate than the others. This seems to be best exemplified by Yoko Ono’s contribution, entitled Mend Piece for John, which instructs, “Take your favourite cup. Break it in many pieces with a hammer. Repair it with this glue and this poem.” Included is a cardboard box containing a ribbon, plastic bag, instructions, a poem, and a tube of glue. Although Ono created this piece years before the Beatles disbanded, it seems almost precognitive of the years to come. Another similarly disparate piece from this issue is the front cover, which was painted by Congo, the chimpanzee, for a study of the creative potential of apes. It has been noted that Congo was the only chimpanzee who appeared to make aesthetic decisions about his painting, and thus could be featured alongside these other artists for the issue. Like Ono’s piece, Congo’s painting seems eerily foreboding with its large red and black smears of paint. = Shit Must Stop N°6 = The last issue produced makes a valorous attempt at preserving the initial integrity of the project that includes, Richard Artschwager, Ed Bereal, Diter Rot, Betty Dodson, Ronoldo Ferri, John Giorno, Toby Mussman, Adrian Nutbeem, Claes Oldenburg, Mischa Petrov, Jean Reavey, Bernar Venet. Richard Artschwager’s cover design is a simple image of a black shape reproduced on each surface of the cover, both inside and out, with reproductions of the exact coffee stains he accidentally made when producing the original. By approving of this accident, and reproducing it for the cover, Artschwager, and Copley seem to be making an argument about the place of beauty and mistake in the contemporary art world. The rest of the pieces in this final issue seem to be playful and mischievous manifestations of this same idea, with Adrian Nutbeem’s unsolvable crossword as well as Claes Oldenburg’s Unattended Lunches. The issue also comes with an apology, which reads, “The publishers of the Letter Edged in Black Press, Inc. regretfully announce that this is the last issue of Shit Must Stop that will appear. We have appreciated your support and hope you will remember our effort with appreciation.” The vague nature of the card supports the mischievous nature of this issue’s contents, while still maintaining the sincerity of the project.

In particular, Siegfried fought in the Battle of Cedynia (Zehden), as reported in the Chronicon of Siegfried’s son Thietmar of Merseburg. Both Siegfried and Odo escaped the ensuing slaughter.

In 979, he and his brothers were appointed regents of the County of Möckerngau by Emperor Otto II. Siegfried consolidated his position as sole count in 983. Later that year, he fought with the Saxon army against the Great Slav Rising revolt against the empire.  Death  He supported the Empress Theophanu in her war against Boleslaus II in 990, and while moving against the rebellious Lutici, he fell from his horse and died on 15 March 990.

Early life Born in Richmond, Surrey, England, Crook's parents separated when he was four and he moved with his mother from London to Sussex. He grew up in Sussex, moving between foster homes, and then attended boarding school in Chichester. He joined the merchant navy at 17, and served in the Royal Air Force during World War II. Training In 1945 Crook received a grant to study at St Martin's School, London. In 1948 he enrolled at the Central School of Art, known at the time for its innovative work in textiles. Crook graduated with a degree in textile design and began tutoring at the Central School, before being employed as a lecturer. Career After completing his training Crook lived in London for 22 years, working as a freelance designer and teaching at the Central School and the Royal College of Art. He also exhibited his own work, ceramics, drawings, paintings, and tapestries. The artist once said: > Because I work in a lot of media, people can't get to grips with my work. > The point is that oneself as an artist remains consistent. My object is to > end up with something that I haven't seen before, to get an image which I > could not have imagined In 1972, aged 51, Crook decided to emigrate to New Zealand and settled in Wellington, where he spent the rest of his life. He continued making art until his death in 2011, aged 89, and was known for his diverse and prodigious output. In 1979 Crook was commissioned to produce a set of 20 banners for the Miles Warren-designed New Zealand Embassy in Washington. Hanging in the Great Hall of the embassy building the banners measure five metres by 1 metre and feature South Pacific imagery and heraldry. The banners were made by Nancye Smeaton, manager of the then-New Zealand Ballet and Opera Trust production unit. Between 1981 and 1983 Crook worked on a series of larger banners for the entrance foyer of the Michael Fowler Centre in Wellington. Crook designed and wove some of his own tapestries; others he collaborated on with other professional weavers. His suite of small tapestries 18 Maritimes for example, in the collection of The Dowse Art Museum were designed by Crook, inspired by 18 small collages made using colour photocopying techniques, and then woven over 1995–1996 by Sue Batten at the Victorian Tapestry Workshop. Crook also collaborated extensively with weaver Lesley Nicholls, producing more than 20 tapestries together. While he worked across many formats – including pastel drawings, painting, collages, paper-making and screenprinting – Crook was best-known and most recognised for his textile work. Writing in 1980 critic Neil Rowe observed: > When assessing a talent as multi-faceted as Crook's it is difficult to > single out one aspect for consideration above the others. In my opinion his > work with textiles and fabrics constitutes his most significant contribution > to contemporary art. ... In New Zealand there is no designer in this field > who is as highly qualified or as accomplished as Gordon Crook. In terms of > colour and design, his tapestries are by far the most consistently exciting > work in the medium made here. Crook received significant support from Jim Barr and James Mack, two early directors of The Dowse Art Museum in Lower Hutt, who collected and exhibited his work. Significant solo exhibitions of Crook's work include: *1993–1996 An Introduction to the world of Gordon Crook, touring throughout New Zealand *2011 Gordon Crook: 18 Maritimes, The Dowse Art Museum Publications: * Catalogue of an exhibition of tapestries and drawings based on the theme of Adam and Eve, Wellington: Galerie Legend, 1978 *Gordon Crook, Wellington: Brooker Gallery, 1993. *Biography of the mind Wellington: Page Blackie Gallery, 2013. Gordon Crook: A Life of Art In 2010 a documentary about Crook, Gordon Crook: A Life of Art, by director Clare O'Leary premiered at New Zealand's International Film Festival. The documentary traced Crook's life from his early years in foster care to his time as a London Central School of Art lecturer to his decades in Wellington and featured interviews with Crook, his friends, supporters, students and dealer representatives. The documentary also features autobiographical narrative, including poems written by Crook.

The work was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic for the soprano Dawn Upshaw and is set to the poetry of the Polish writer Czesław Miłosz. It was given its world premiere in New York City on February 23, 2006 by Upshaw and the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Robert Spano. Composition =Background= Milosz Songs was Harbison's first commissioned work for the New York Philharmonic and his fourth piece composed for the soprano Dawn Upshaw. It was also Harbison's second setting of the poetry of Czesław Miłosz, following his Flashes and Illuminations for baritone and orchestra. The score requires that the soloist be surrounded by a concertino group at the front of the stage. Harbison described its purpose in the score program notes, writing, \\"This concertino plays an important, varied role in every song. I thought of these players as satellites revolving around the path of the singer.\\" Harbison subsequently composed a reduced version of the score for voice and piano. =Structure= Milosz Songs has a duration of roughly 30 minutes and consists of a prologue, eight movements, an epilogue, and a post-epilogue. :Prologue: from Lauda :1. A Task :2. Encounter :3. You Who Wronged :4. When the Moon :5. O! :6. What Once Was Great :7. So Little :8. On Old Women :Epilogue: from Winter :Post-Epilogue: Rays of Dazzling Light =Instrumentation= The work is scored for solo soprano and a large orchestra comprising three flutes (2nd doubling piccolo; 3rd doubling alto flute), two oboes (2nd doubling cor anglais), two clarinets (2nd doubling bass clarinet), two bassoons (2nd doubling contrabassoon), two horns, two trumpets, trombone, bass trombone, timpani, three percussionists, celesta, harp, and strings. The concertino group consists of six players: all three flutes, vibraphone (percussion I), harp, and celeste. Reception Reviewing the world premiere, Anthony Tommasini praised Milosz Songs, writing, \\"[Harbison's] lucid and precisely wrought music complements Milosz's gripping words. Those who prefer the brasher kinds of contemporary music may find Mr. Harbison's score, with its audible textures and essentially tonal harmonic language, rather well mannered and soft-spoken.

It was built in 1974-1975 to provide a venue for military education, and was originally called the February 8 House of Culture. It is located on Pipha Street in the Moranbong District of Pyongyang. The classically colonnaded building is considered one of the best examples of 1970s socialist monumentality in Pyongyang, and hence in Korea, the other being the visually similar Mansudae Art Theatre. It has been the location of many historic events, from both the 6th and 7th congresses of the Korean Workers' Party, to the historic meeting of Kim Jong-il with the president of South Korea, Roh Moo-hyun, in 2007. Construction A site was cleared and actual construction on the theatre building was begun in April 1974. The building is wide across the front, deep, and rises to a height of almost . It contains two large theatres with 6,000 seats and 1,100 seats respectively with a cinema theatre of 600 seats. Its over of floor space provide for some 600 other rooms in support of the theatres. The building opened on 7 October 1975. Name The building as proposed was originally named the February 8 House of Culture after the date of the founding of the Korean People's Army (KPA). It was opened under this name and the 6th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea was held there on 10 to 14 October 1980, under this name. After the congress the building was sometimes referred to as Congress Hall; however, subsequently the name was changed to the April 25 House of Culture, the founding date of the resistance army against the Japanese,Official North Korean sources, such as , state that the Anti-Japanese People's Guerrilla Army was founded on 25 April 1932 by Kim Il Sung.

The project was initially announced in August 2004, as The Summit, and was to be constructed on the 2.17-acre site of the closed Holy Cow Casino and Brewery, located on the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas, Nevada. Trump became involved with the project in June 2005, when it was renamed. Ivana Las Vegas was to feature 945 condo units, including a $35 million penthouse. The project would have begun construction in summer 2006, with a completion date of December 2008. The property was put up for sale in December 2005, after the project had been cancelled because of rising construction costs. The property later became the site of a two-story Walgreens store. History =The Summit= The condominium high-rise project was initially announced as The Summit on August 19, 2004. The project was to be built by a company called Sahara Condominiums, with financing from Australian developers Joseph Di Mauro and Victor Altomare. Altomare had been convinced of Las Vegas' \\"developer- friendly environment\\" by Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman and city officials. The Summit was to feature 73 floors and stand 940 feet, and was to be built at a cost of $700 million. If built, the Summit would have been the tallest habitable structure in the Las Vegas Valley, and one of the tallest residential towers in the world. Di Mauro said the project would be financed by \\"internal and external funding,\\" such as revenue from other businesses that he owned. The Summit was designed by JMA Architecture Studios, and was to feature 960 condo units, with nine different floor plans to be offered. Entry- level units were expected to sell for $600,000 to $700,000. The Summit's lower-floor units would be fully furnished, and would be marketed towards people looking to buy a second home, giving owners the option to also rent out their unit when not in use. The top 16 floors would include 151 units ranging from to . A penthouse would also be featured, which Sahara Condominiums hoped to sell for over $35 million. The building was to be constructed on the of land that was currently occupied by the closed Holy Cow Casino and Brewery and a small, multi-level parking garage, both located at the northeast corner of South Las Vegas Boulevard and Sahara Avenue on the Las Vegas Strip. Di Mauro and Altomare planned to demolish both structures for the new high-rise. Di Mauro hoped to finish the permit process within three months and begin selling units by late December 2004. The Summit was expected to take approximately three years to complete. Sales offices for The Summit were set up in Asia and Australia to market the project. The project was expected to generate $1 billion in profit. By November 2004, the Summit's height had been reduced to 923 feet. Altomare said that month that the \\"Summit\\" name was only a working title, and that he would release a brand name for the project eventually. The project was approved by the city of Las Vegas in November 2004. The federal government approved the 923-foot project now with 800 condo units in January 2005. By the end of the month, Altomare was in discussions with Turner Construction to build the high-rise, which was expected to take two and a half years to finish. Altomare said at that time that the project's construction would be financed by syndicated bank loans underwritten by presales of the condo units, which were expected to begin selling in late April 2005, with starting prices at $600,000. The tower's penthouse was priced at $35 million. Altomare believed that many buyers would be from out of state and from foreign countries. Altomare also said the project's official name would be announced after an agreement was made with a well-known, high-profile woman who would be willing to attach her own name and endorse the project. =Ivana Las Vegas= By June 2005, Ivana Trump, an ex-wife of businessman Donald Trump, had partnered with Altomare on the project, now named The Ivana. At 73 floors, Ivana Trump's condominium tower would have been taller than her ex-husband's planned Trump Hotel Las Vegas. Jack Wishna, a partner in Donald Trump's condo project, was skeptical that Ivana Trump's condo tower would be better: \\"Donald is a mega-developer who is so much more than just a name on a building. Other projects may use the Ivana name but no one will ever mistake it for a Donald Trump luxury project.\\" Wishna also noted that another Ivana Trump project, located in Florida, also \\"went down the tubes.\\" At that time, the tower was to begin construction in July 2005. On the morning of July 12, 2005, while Donald Trump was breaking ground on his condo project, officials for Ivana Trump's condo project now called Ivana Las Vegas were preparing an educational sales meeting for real estate agents and brokers later that afternoon. It was believed that the events were purposely scheduled for the same day, although Luke Chadwick, director of sales for Ivana Las Vegas, said the scheduling was merely a coincidence. Approximately 1,500 agents 500 more than expected attended the sales meeting for Ivana Las Vegas, held at the Bellagio hotel and casino. Chadwick said about the event, \\"I've done hundreds of projects, and I've never seen this level of interest before.\\" Many agents were not impressed by the event, but still believed the project would eventually open, despite industry experts and Donald Trump questioning the likelihood that the project could obtain financing for construction. At that time, the Ivana Las Vegas was to feature 943 units ranging from to , with prices ranging from $800,000 to $1.7 million. On-site amenities would have included a gym, a spa, an ultra lounge, and restaurants. In addition to lending her name to the project, Ivana Trump also planned to assist in designing the interiors. Ivana Las Vegas' sales launch took place at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center on August 14, 2005. Ivana Trump attended the event, where more than 487 condo units were sold, two of which were purchased by Trump herself. With more than half of the project's planned 945 units now sold, Ivana Las Vegas passed a minimum that was required to qualify for construction financing. Advanced sales generated nearly $500 million, while Chadwick believed that the ultimate number would be over $1 billion, making it the most expensive residential building ever sold. Ivana Trump said at the event that Ivana Las Vegas \\"is for the person who appreciates privacy and has a certain style.\\" Trump said many of her buyers were entertainers, casino executives, and high rollers \\"who want privacy.\\" Trump said she was closely involved with many of the building's aspects, including the approval of floor plans and advertising, and was also currently holding meetings with architects to create color schemes for the project. The event served as the beginning of a national sales campaign that would feature Ivana Trump. Chadwick expected the project to sell its remaining condo units in the next month as marketing and advertising increased. Some local real estate analysts, as well as Donald Trump, criticized the project's viability due to its location on the northern Las Vegas Strip, where little development had occurred in recent years. It is believed that because of its location, Ivana Las Vegas would have had a tougher time selling if it had not been for Trump's name being attached to the project. Altomare believed that new projects such as the nearby Fontainebleau Resort Las Vegas would help to improve the area. Ivana Trump believed that the project's location was the best in Las Vegas because of flight patterns from McCarran International Airport, which prevented buildings taller than 40 floors from being erected on either side of Ivana Las Vegas. Ivana Trump said, \\"I will forever dominate the skyline of Las Vegas.\\" Units on the upper floors cost nearly $2,000 per square foot, which was somewhat higher in comparison to other high-rise projects. Prices for a one-bedroom unit started at $550,000, while the tower's $35 million penthouse was now expected to be , and would include nine bedrooms, a recording studio, and security measures such as retina scanners. The interiors would include stone and marble finishes. Additional amenities that were announced included a business center, a coffee shop, a pool, and a Zen garden. The closed Holy Cow Casino served as a temporary sales office for Ivana Las Vegas. The sales office was described as having the appearance of a nightclub, as it contained smoke machines, loud music, and flashing lights. Construction of Ivana Las Vegas, to be handled by Turner Construction, was scheduled to begin in summer 2006 and conclude in December 2008, at a cost of $500 million. By December 14, 2005, the property had been listed for sale at a cost of $49 million. Sales of the tower's units were suspended, with each of the buyers eligible for a refund. On December 16, 2005, Altomare said rising construction costs were responsible for the decision to put the property up for sale. Altomare also said he had a \\"very credible buyer\\" who wanted to add a hotel and casino to the project; the height of the tower would need to be reduced or additional nearby acreage would need to be acquired to accommodate parking for such plans. The property was relisted for sale in May 2007, for $50 million. At that time, Altomare was not interested in a joint venture on the property. The property sold later that year for $47 million, and a two-story Walgreens was being built on the site in 2014.

History Frederic was born in London a son of John Chapple, a mason from Devonshire, and his wife Louisa, née Brewin. Though Presbyterians, they sent their son to a Wesleyan Methodist day school, because of its good reputation. As well as reaching high academic standards he entered whole- heartedly into the religious life of the School and Church, and at age 18 was assessed first among applicants for a scholarship to Westminster Training College. He sailed through the course, consistently coming top of his class, while maintaining his Church activities – holding simultaneously the positions of poor steward, church steward, circuit steward, and Sunday school teacher and superintendent. At the end of his course he was appointed locum tenens head of the teaching schools run by the college, and in the evening studied for the London University BA at King's College and University College, Cambridge. In 1870 he was appointed to a permanent position with Westminster Wesleyan Methodist College, teaching Science and Mathematics. He completed a course at the South Kensington Science School, and was awarded a BSc. by the London University. He was convinced of the need for Biblical teaching in secular as well as Church schools; he was a founding member of the National Union of Elementary Teachers, which he represented in 1870 at a congress on the desirability of religious teaching in government schools. ;Prince Alfred College The Principal of Prince Alfred College, John Anderson Hartley, B.A., BSc (1844–1896), resigned late in 1875 after only five years as head, to take a position as Inspector-General of State Schools. Rev. Drs. Alfred Rigg (1832–1891) and James Egan Moulton (c. 1841–1909) were commissioned by the Prince Alfred College Committee to find his replacement, and after some hesitation Chapple accepted their invitation, and arrived with his family in Adelaide on 8 April 1876. He joined the Kent Town Church the next day, and occupied the same pew for the next 32 years. He reduced the high importance the school had previously placed on Classical languages – Latin and Greek – and greatly increased the stress on English, Mathematics and Sciences, but maintained the close linkage of the school with the Methodist Church. He was an attractive and forceful speaker, and impressed on his students the value of thorough preparation before mounting the platform, and clear English and careful diction when delivering a speech. Chapple placed equal importance on a healthy body – he brought to the school a new emphasis on physical fitness, and ensured the school's gymnastic and sporting equipment was kept up-to-date, and encouraged a sense of pride in the school's sporting achievements, notably in competition with St. Peter's College (\\"Reds\\" v. \\"Blues\\"). He was a strict disciplinarian but cheerful with it, and an inspiration to his students, who universally remembered their old head, nicknamed \\"Jingles\\" or \\"Conk\\", fondly. He was a keen cricketer and in the early days played for the school team. He was highly effective in raising the public profile and status of the school, and consequently its ability to raise building funds from parents as fees, and from past students as bequests. He retired in November 1914 and was of course obliged to vacate the headmaster's residence. He purchased a house on The Parade, Norwood, South Australia, which he and his wife shared with their unmarried daughter, Dr. Phoebe Chapple. He maintained an interest in a variety of spheres until he was severely injured by falling down stairs at the Adelaide YMCA, which forced him to relinquish most of his activities. He died at Norwood, and was buried in the West Terrace Cemetery. Other interests *He was invited to join the Senate of the Adelaide University in May 1877, and was its warden for 40 years. He was also for 23 years a member of the University Council. *He was President of the Collegiate Schools Association, and Vice-President of the Teachers' Guild. *He was a foundation member and a trustee of Adelaide YMCA. *He was first President of Our Boys' Institute, which office he held for five years (and was Vice-President up to the time of his death). *He was the second President of the Council of Churches, and was also one of the Methodist representatives on that body for many years. *He was a President of the South Australian Literary Societies' Union, and elected a life member of that organization *He was also connected with the Royal Society. *He loved cricket, and was also a keen tennis player, a longtime member of the Kensington club, one of Adelaide's first four tennis clubs (with Parkside, Semaphore and Glen Osmond). He did not often travel outside Australia: only in 1901, when he was a delegate to the Methodist Ecumenical Conference and 1920, when he took holidays in conjunction with a commission to represent the Council of Churches, both in Britain. He had intended another trip to visit his son Harold, an obstetric and gynaecological surgeon at Guy's Hospital, in February 1915, but the War intervened.

Nefingus was a noted benefactor of the Abbey of Saint-Aubin d'Angers. With the support of Count Geoffrey I of Anjou, he replaced its secular canons with Benedictine monks and in 970 secured the abbey the right to elect its abbot free from outside interference. In 972 as bishop he confirmed its privileges. His death is recorded in the obituary of Angers Cathedral. He was succeeded by Renaud II, who secured his election with a simoniacal payment Count Geoffrey. According to the Annales de Vendôme, this succession plan was worked out in advance while Nefingus was still living. One effect of this plan was that the see did not fall vacant and the count was unable to collect the diocesan revenues, as he otherwise would have during a vacancy.

Entre lo sagrado y lo profano se tejen rebeldías. Arte feminista latinoamericano. Ediciones desde abajo. p. 174. (in Spanish) For ten years, their activities included demonstrations, exhibitions, conferences, publication of texts, participation in media, performance, curatorship, and mail art. Bustamante wrote, “[W]e grew while we built our families, so we had a lots of fun discovering that the social and cultural reality is penetrable.”Amy Sary Carroll. \\"A Critical Regionalism: The Allegorical Performative in Madre por un día and the Rodríguez/Felipe Wedding,” e-misférica 2.2 (special issue on \\"Sexualities and Politics in the Americas\\"), November 2005.Villegas Morales, G. (2006). Los grupos de arte feminista en México. Universidad Veracruzana Digital Repository, México.  Context  The 1970s were a time of complex sociopolitical change in Mexico, beginning with the crisis incited by the Tlatelolco Massacre in 1968. In the arts, the sociopolitical situation “defined a plastic language that looks for the narrow relation between the village, the politics and the art”.Rosa, María Laura (2013). Pródigas complicidades. El grupo de arte feminista Polvo de Gallina Negra y sus vínculos con el Museo de Arte Carrillo Gil. Following the peak of the Generación de la Ruptura (The Breakaway Generation), the 1960s and 1970s saw the rise of different artistic groups who openly criticized their predecessors as \\"elitist, apolitical and mercantilist.\\" These movements, known as The Groups, explored activities like performance and non-object art, and used unconventional artistic supports (objects, photocopies) and exhibition spaces (streets, alternative galleries). In these years, the feminist movement in Mexico experienced a renaissance promoted by university students and urban women from Mexico City. The first feminist organization of this second wave was Movimiento de Acción Solidaria (MAS, 1971) with which Mónica Mayer and Ana Victoria Jiménez sympathized. Soon thereafter arose several additional groups: the National Movement of Women (MNM, 1973); the Movement of Women Liberation (1974); the Mexican Feminist Movement (MFM); and the Coalition of Feminist Women, which, in 1976, coordinated the MNM, MFM, La Revuelta and the Colectivo de Mujeres. Several artists joined these organizations \\"contributing with their creativity in demonstrations banners and with actions.\\" The rise of collaborative feminist art in the 1980s stemmed from these critical, cultural phenomena and from the feminist art course taught by Mónica Mayer at the Academy of Saint Carlos (ENAP-UNAM) from 1982-1984.Barbosa, Araceli (2008). Arte feminista en los ochenta en México, una perspectiva de género. (Feminist art in the Mexico 80s, a gender perspective) Casa Juan Pablos/UAEM. p. 100. As a consequence of these meetings, several important feminist art groups formed: * Polvo de Gallina Negra (1983-1993), the first feminist art group in Mexico, founded by Maris Bustamante and Mónica Mayer. * Tlacuilas y retrateras (1983-1984) initiated by Ruth Primes, Consuelo Almeda, Karen Lamb, Ana Victoria Jiménez, Lorraine Loaiza, Nicola Coleby, Marcela Ramírez, Isabel Restrepo, Patricia Torres, Elizabeth Valenzuela, and Mónica Mayer, whose most important visual project was La fiesta de quince años (The Party of Fifteen Years) (1984) * Bio-art (1983-1984) founded by Guadalupe García, Laïta, Rose Go Lengen, Roselle Faure, and Nunik Sauret, whose creations oscillated between painting, fashion design, performance, and recording  History, Goals, and Influences  Polvo de Gallina Negra was initiated by Maris Bustamante, Mónica Mayer, and Herminia Dosal in 1983 and was sustained by Bustamante and Mayer in subsequent years. The group focused on the intersection of art and feminism, and revolved around the constant questioning of women's roles in Mexico, the construction of the feminine image in mass media, and the criticism of violence against women and machismo culture. Prior to the group's formation, Bustamente and Mayer engaged with feminism and unconventional art practices in various ways. According to Bustamante, “Mexico is still an adverse country for women. [...] The deep class struggle we live, the racial prejudice and the oligarchic values create a social fabric where women are excluded from active roles and attacked directly simply because they are women.” In her \\"Feminist Artist Statement,\\" Mayer writes > \\"I became interested in feminism as an art student, when after a lecture on > women artists, my fellow-male students said that women were less creative > than men because we gave birth. Considering these were artists from a very > liberal, politicized, generation, I realized unless I did something about > it, no matter how good my work ever was, it would never be seen on equal > terms. After that, a group of women friends from school started meeting and > integrating these ideas to our work. > \\"In 1975 I read about The Woman’s Building in Los Angeles in a magazine and > decided to study there. I finally joined the Feminist Art Program in 1978. > In the meantime, I participated in the feminist movement in Mexico, in the > group Movimiento Feminista and in the Colectivo de Cine Feminista, which was > a feminist film collective.

Suzanne Lacy was my advisor. > \\"In 1983, back in Mexico, I formed two feminist art groups. One of them was > Polvo de Gallina Negra, with Maris Bustamante. Humor was the basis or our > work.\\" The name for Polvo de Gallina Negra (Black Hen Powder) came from a “remedy against the evil eye, which we felt we needed given that we were women, women artists, and even worse, feminist artists.” In keeping with their interweaving of social criticism, performance, and humor, the group invoked their name in feminist incantations, such as “Black Hen Powder–to protect us from the patriarchal magic which makes women disappear”. The group enacted performances, often for the media, and engaged in various social interventions. For \\"¡MADRES!\\"–a long-term set of social interventions on motherhood–Mayer and Bustamante decided to get pregnant and, in fact, gave birth to daughters three months apart. Other \\"¡MADRES!\\" performances included inviting prominent men–including a news anchor–to become a \\"Mother for a Day,\\" and a competition in which people wrote letters to their mothers “with everything you ever wanted to tell her but didn’t dare”. Through the Madres series, Polvo de Gallina Negra became seen as \\"a champion of an intertwining of the feminist (a particularized political) and the aesthetic in the Mexican 1980s.\\" Polvo de Gallina Negra faced harsh opposition from other groups, which criticized the group for stereotyping and holding radical views.

In the Church of the Latter Day Saints based in Kirtland, Ohio, Carter was one of 12 members of the first presiding high council established in 1834 by church founder Joseph Smith. Early life Carter was born in Killingworth, Connecticut, to Gideon Carter and Johanna Sims, and had moved with his family to Benson, Vermont, in the late 1700s. In 1813, he married Elizabeth (\\"Betsey\\") Kinyon in Benson. Church activity Carter was introduced to Mormonism by his brother Jared, who had been baptized into the new faith in 1831. John Carter was baptized in 1832, was ordained an elder, and proselytized with his brother on a mission in Vermont, where they established congregations in North West Bay and Bolton. In early 1833, Carter moved to Bolton, where he became a leader of the church. In September 1833, Carter moved to Jackson County, Missouri, the location that Smith had identified as the gathering place of Latter Day Saints. Later, he moved to church headquarters in Kirtland, Ohio, and became a high priest. When the presiding high council was established by Smith on February 17, 1834, Carter and his brother Jared were selected as two of its inaugural members.Doctrine and Covenants section 102 (LDS Church ed.). Three days later, Carter was appointed by Smith to serve a mission to the eastern United States with Jesse Smith. Zion's Camp and death Carter did not immediately leave on this mission, but instead volunteered to be part of Zion's Camp, an expedition of Latter Day Saints that intended to walk from Kirtland to Jackson County, Missouri, in an attempt to regain land that members of the church had been expelled from by non-Mormon settlers. The march proved difficult and there was some dissension among its participants. On June 20, 1834, after three men had contracted cholera, Smith reportedly warned the group:Joseph Smith (B. H. Roberts, ed.) History of the Church, vol. 2, ch. 7. > in consequence of the disobedience of some who had been unwilling to listen > to my words, but had rebelled, God had decreed that sickness should come > upon the camp, and if they did not repent and humble themselves before God > they should die like sheep with the rot; that I was sorry, but could not > help it. The scourge must come; repentance and humility may mitigate the > chastisement, but cannot altogether avert it. But there were some who would > not give heed to my words. Smith's record from June 24, 1834, while the camp was in Clay County, Missouri, states:Joseph Smith (B. H. Roberts, ed.) History of the Church, vol. 2, ch. 8. > This night the cholera burst forth among us, and about midnight it was > manifested in its most virulent form. Our ears were saluted with cries and > moanings and lamentations on every hand; even those on guard fell to the > earth with their guns in their hands, so sudden and powerful was the attack > of this terrible disease. At the commencement, I attempted to lay on hands > for their recovery, but I quickly learned by painful experience, that when > the great Jehovah decrees destruction upon any people, and makes known His > determination, man must not attempt to stay His hand. The moment I attempted > to rebuke the disease I was attacked, and had I not desisted in my attempt > to save the life of a brother, I would have sacrificed my own. The disease > seized upon me like the talons of a hawk, and I said to the brethren: \\"If my > work were done, you would have to put me in the ground without a coffin.\\" > ... When the cholera made its appearance, Elder John S. Carter was the first > man who stepped forward to rebuke it, and upon this, was instantly seized, > and became the first victim in the camp.

A 2010 article in Trail Runner magazine described Winter as \\"the leading expert in the field of sleep disruption, in athletes and issues related to travel.\\" He is credited with coining the term circadian advantage after studying the effects of travel on Major League Baseball teams. He studied the effect of sleep timing preference on Major League Baseball pitcher performance, and hitting performance. In 2013, his research linked the sleepiness of Major League Baseball player to a reduced career longevity. This work led to research into sleepiness as a predictor of NFL Draft value in which the sleep of 560 Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) football players and their eventual draft success was studied. To date, he has advised numerous professional athletic organizations, most notably the San Francisco Giants who publicly commented on his role with their club in 2012 and 2014.

They survive in a single manuscript copy (Oxford, Bodleian Library, Bodley 309 [8837]), the exemplar of which came from the Abbey of the Holy Trinity at Vendôme.Graham, op. cit., pp. 695–96. They are sometimes regarded as a continuation of the chronicle of Rainaud de Saint- Maurice, a canon, archdeacon and schoolmaster of the cathedral of Angers around 1040.Auguste Molinier (1902), \\"1291.

Picard et fils), p. 73. It has been proposed that Abbot Geoffrey of Vendôme introduced the chronicle of Angers into his abbey and began their continuation.Stéphane Lecouteux (2009), \\"L'abbé Geoffroy de Vendôme (1093–1132), initiateur des Annales de Vendôme?\\" Cahiers de civilisation médiévale 52 (1 [205]): 37–43. All the entries (events and obituaries) up to 1075 are written in the same hand and are so heavily reliant on the chronicle of Saint-Maurice as to be of little historical value. The continuations, extending down to the siege of Calais in 1347, are all made in contemporary hands and constitute an original and important source for local events. In the manuscript, the annals are preceded by a computus table and accompany a calendar that extends from 152 BC until AD 1421. The annals take a special interest in the counts of Anjou. Much of their information may have come from the priory of the Blessed Saviour at L'Évière, a suburb of Angers. This priory was founded by Count Geoffrey Martel in 1047 and was subject to the abbey of Vendôme. In 1177, the monks fled from Count John I of Vendôme and took refuge at L'Évière. Sometime before 1635, André Duchesne made a copy of the annals from 678 until 1257 in the library of Vendôme. This was published by Philippe Labbe in 1657. At some point the manuscript was acquired by Edward Bernard, who sold it to the Bodleian in 1698. In 1898, Rose Graham published all those entries from 881 to 1347 that had not been published by Labbe. The manuscript has thus been published in its entirety.

First published in 1966, it was her tenth novel. The novel centres on Carel Fisher, an eccentric Anglican priest who is the rector of a London church which was destroyed by bombing during World War II. Fisher denies the existence of God and the possibility of human goodness in a post-theistic world. The novel, which has elements of Gothic fiction, received mixed reviews on its publication. Plot The action takes place over the course of several winter days in London. The plot centres on Carel Fisher, an eccentric Anglican priest who has lost his faith. At the beginning of the novel, he has just been put in charge of a church that was heavily damaged by bombing in the Second World War, so that only the tower and the rectory remain standing. His twenty- four-year-old daughter, Muriel, and nineteen-year old niece Elizabeth, a semi- invalid recluse, live with him. The household also includes Pattie O'Driscoll, Carel Fisher's half-Jamaican housekeeper and former mistress, Eugene Peshkov, a Russian émigré who works as the rectory's janitor, and Eugene's son Leo, a student at a technical college. Carel Fisher performs no church functions and refuses to admit anyone to the rectory or to communicate with anyone, including his brother, Marcus, who is nominally the co-guardian of their niece Elizabeth. Marcus is the headmaster of a school, on leave in order to write a book on \\"morality in a secular age\\". Marcus twice gains entrance to the house by stealth, and on each occasion he has a harrowing conversation with his brother, who insists that there is no God, and that in any case \\"goodness is impossible for us\\". Leo Peshkov was formerly a student at Marcus's school, where his fees were paid by Marcus and his friend Norah Shadox-Brown, a retired headmistress. Leo is a charming but untrustworthy boy who repeatedly lies to his acquaintances, including Marcus, in order to extract money from them. Later he steals a treasured icon from his father and sells it. Muriel befriends Leo and forms a plan of introducing him to Elizabeth. However this plan is aborted when, on the way to Elizabeth's room, Muriel and Leo hide in an adjacent room to escape detection by Pattie, and Muriel, looking through a crack in the wall, sees her father in bed with Elizabeth. Later, Carel tells Muriel to move out of the rectory, where he intends to remain with Elizabeth. During the course of the novel Pattie and Muriel both fall in love with Eugene. Eugene asks Pattie to marry him, but she is reluctant to accept him because of her relationship with Carel, to whom she still feels bound. Eventually she agrees, but the jealous Muriel tells Eugene about the affair between Pattie and her father. Later, confronted by Pattie, Muriel tells her that Carel is having an affair with Elizabeth, whereupon Pattie reveals that Elizabeth is actually Carel's daughter rather than his niece. Just as Muriel is about to leave the rectory to stay with Norah Shadox-Brown, she goes to her father's room and finds that he has taken an overdose of pills and is dying. He has received a letter from Pattie, disclosing that both Pattie and Muriel know the truth about Carel's incestuous relationship with Elizabeth. Muriel takes no action to forestall his suicide attempt and he dies. After his death Muriel and Elizabeth go to live together in London, while Pattie goes to Africa to work in a refugee camp, and the rectory and church tower are demolished to make way for new development. Major themes The central theme of the novel is the question of how, and whether, morality is possible in a post-religious age. This is also the subject of the book that the character Marcus Fisher is writing. During the time when Murdoch was writing the novel, she was engaged as a philosopher with this and related issues, and published her own book on the subject, The Sovereignty of Good, in 1970. Other important themes are \\"the abuse of power and sexual domination\\", both embodied in Carel Fisher, who has been described as one of Murdoch's \\"most convincingly evil character(s)\\". Carel is presented as a demonic Faust-like character who has \\"rejected redemption\\" by denying the existence of both God and Good. Murdoch biographer and literary critic Peter J. Conradi notes that incest and theft, which are committed by Carel and Leo Peshkov respectively in The Time of the Angels, are used by Murdoch as \\"paradigm forms of law-breaking\\" in several of her novels.  Literary significance and reception  After the initial publication of the novel, reception was mixed. The New York Times reviewer Walter Allen, though critical of Murdoch's novels becoming \\"predictable\\", was generally positive, writing that \\"mystery is genuinely embodied; the reader's imagination is addressed, responds and is satisfied.\\" Also in the New York Times, Charles Poore, while noting Murdoch's \\"preachy passages\\" and the book's \\"gothick novel\\" aspects, described her as a \\"born storyteller\\" and The Time of the Angels as the \\"newest and best\\" of her \\"excellent melodramas\\". In The New York Review of Books Denis Donoghue described the novel as \\"elegiac\\", \\"an anthology of defeats: magic, belief, prayer, love, and now perhaps poetry itself.\\" Kirkus Reviews described the novel as a \\"mediocre work\\" partially because of her frequent novel writing, writing that the plot resembles her own earlier work and that Murdoch's \\"prose has become flabby\\". Writing in Commentary, Robert Garis noted that Murdoch had published ten novels in twelve years and similarly attributed the novel's shortcomings to her speedy production of novels. A 2011 review by the website complete review concluded that the novel was a B+, writing that it was a \\"Bizarre, fascinating, certainly very readable -- and with some interesting philosophical issues cleverly considered -- The Time of the Angels is nevertheless a somewhat unsatisfying work.\\" Critics have treated The Time of the Angels primarily as a philosophical novel. A.S. Byatt has characterized it as a \\"mythical\\" novel in which the thematic patterns and underlying structure have \\"more aesthetic power than the individual characters\\". She argues that it is \\"best read as a mannered philosophical myth, or fantasy\\" and that Murdoch's inclusion of passages of \\"emotional immediacy\\" such as her initial description of Pattie O'Driscoll's origins and early life tends to create \\"jarring effects or difficulties\\" for readers. Others have described it as a \\"gothic\\" novel, in which a sinister priest presides over a ruined church in an atmosphere of cold fog and darkness. Conradi calls it \\"a Gothic and a religious novel\\", and thus similar to Murdoch's 1963 novel The Unicorn. Jill Paton Walsh characterizes the philosophical discussions in The Time of the Angels, and particularly Marcus's book on ethics, as examples of \\"placed philosophy\\". Such passages tell the novel's readers \\"what the author thinks the discourse in the novel is about\\". According to Paton Walsh, inserting philosophical content into novels is \\"dangerous\\" because it can hinder the narrative flow. \\"Placed philosophy either sticks out a lot, and risks the reader feeling got at; or it is dissolved into the substance of fiction, and gets itself thought of fictionally\\". Philosophical readings of the novel have included an analysis of Murdoch's relation to and understanding of Heidegger and a Foucauldian reading centred on the themes of incest and patriarchal power. It has also been interpreted as an allegory about the \\"reconciliation of love and death\\".

The film had its world debut on March 13, 2015, at the South by Southwest festival and stars Adam Pally as workaholic Kevin who has a drunken one-night stand with the beautiful train-wreck Madeline, Rosa Salazar, whom he is horrified to realize is actually his boss' jilted ex-mistress. When she takes a bottle of sleeping pills, Kevin is forced to keep her awake all night, over the course of which the two begin to fall for each other. Cast * Adam Pally as Kevin * Rosa Salazar as Madeline * Rob Huebel as Peter * Tony Hale as Dr. Newman * Peter Krause as Will Campbell Production Filming for Night Owls took place over a seventeen-day stretch in March 2014. Almost all of the movie was shot according to plan with the exception of the pool scene. The weather had been very cold and the pool had no heating so the scene needed to be reworked. Director, Charles Hood, said in an interview with RogerEbert.com: \\"There's the scene in the movie where they hug in the hallway and he gets an erection. In the script, that was supposed to be happening in the pool. But we never could get the pool to be heated and we were shooting in March and it was freezing cold. Our AD told us that the actors were only allowed to be in the water for ten minutes at a time. Each time they went in the water for ten minutes, they would have to go inside and warm up for half an hour... Those are the actual rules so they don't get hypothermia. The pool scene was looming for a week.... I was living at the house during the shoot and so were Adam and Rosa. So, Adam, Rosa, [co-writer] Seth and I went into Adam's room, and the four of us talked it out. We came up with: what if they jumped in the pool and then immediately ran inside to get warm and then have that scene in the hallway. Seth and I had to run off and write it. But doing the scene in the hallway ended up working out way better. Because I think the scene in the pool would have been kind of a cliche. We've seen it before. But to have them jump in and out of the pool is so much more fun.\\" Casting The director originally had Adam Pally in mind for the role of Kevin and Hood's agent sent him the script. Pally was drawn to the film with the excitement of new challenges: \\"I really wanted the chance to play a romantic lead. In my brief career I’ve been playing a lot of best friends and goofballs and comedic sidekicks. I know I can do that, so I wanted to give this a shot. So, it was very fulfilling on that level.\\" Pally then suggested Rosa Salazar for the part of Madeline. The director had this say about how the initial casting went: \\"I know this sounds funny, but it really was one of those things that magically came to fruition. My agent knew Adam Pally, who was on our wish list for the role of Kevin. She sent him the script, and within days he came on board. He then suggested Rosa [with whom he worked on the film Search Party] and a similar thing happened. It really worked out – I think Adam’s comedic flair brought the best out of Rosa’s more dramatic background.\\" Reception Critical reception for Night Owls has been predominantly positive and the film currently holds a rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 14 reviews giving an average score of 7.9/10.

The Golden Grizzlies were led by 33rd year head coach Greg Kampe and played their home games at the Athletics Center O'rena in Rochester, Michigan as members of the Horizon League. They finished the season 25–9, 14–4 in Horizon League play to finish in a share for the Horizon League regular season championship. As the No. 1 seed, they were upset in the Quarterfinals of the Horizon League Tournament by Youngstown State. As a conference champion and No. 1 seed who failed to win their conference tournament, they received an automatic bid to the National Invitation Tournament where they defeated Clemson in the first round to advance to the second round where they lost to Richmond. Oakland made a three-point field goal in every game of the season, increasing their steak to 904 consecutive games, the ninth-longest active NCAA Division I streak. They last finished a game without a three-pointer on January 30, 1988.http://www.goldengrizzlies.com/sports/m-baskbl/recaps/031917aaf.html Off-season Would-be senior point guard Kay Felder forwent his college eligibility and entered the 2016 NBA Draft. He was drafted in the second round by the Atlanta Hawks, who traded him to the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers for cash considerations. Associate head coach Saddi Washington left Oakland to become an assistant coach for the Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team while assistant coach Dionne Phelps left to return to Arizona to be with his family. Washington and Phelps were replaced by Dan Hipsher and Cornell Mann. The Golden Grizzlies received a commitment from junior college point guard Stevie Clark. Clark transferred from Arkansas Baptist College where he played a season after being dismissed from Oklahoma State after his 2013–14 freshman year. Clark was previously a four-star recruit and was ranked the No. 68 high school senior in 2013. Oakland also received a commitment from 22-year old, United States Army veteran Isaiah Brock. Kampe recruited Brock on an overseas coaching trip. He thought Brock was athletic, but did not have a lot of basketball experience and probably would not receive much playing time. However, he thought the team could benefit from having Brock on it. Kampe offered Brock a scholarship when his service contract was over. Initially the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled Brock academically ineligible, but after the story made national news, the NCAA reconsidered and Brock was granted immediate eligibility. Former Illinois guard Kendrick Nunn transferred to Oakland after he was removed from the team after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor battery charge. Nunn will sit out the 2016–17 season due to NCAA transfer rules and has one year of eligibility remaining for 2017–18. Nunn was named to the All-Big Ten Conference freshman team and averaged 10.6 points per game in his career at Illinois. Guards Chris Gilbert and Alek Frascone both suffered anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries and will miss the season. 2016 signing class Season Second half against the Detroit Titans at Calihan Hall Oakland finished in fourth place in the 2016 Great Alaska Shootout. They lost their first game to Nevada and defeated Alaska Anchorage in the consolation bracket and UC Davis in the fourth place game. Junior guard Martez Walker was named to the all-tournament team. After their win over Robert Morris, the Golden Grizzlies improved to 9–1, their best start in Division I history. The best start in school history is 10–1 during the 1994–95 season. During a three-game, four-day stretch in December, Oakland lost at home to Northeastern on a buzzer beater and at Michigan State in back- to-back days. Two days later, then defeated Georgia at home 86–79, in the then-fifth-highest attended game in Athletics Center O'rena history. With the win over Georgia, a member of the Southeastern Conference, Oakland is 4–2 all- time against Power Five conference schools at home. In a low-scoring game against UIC, Oakland blocked a school and Horizon League record 18 shots, including one on the final possession to ensure a 58–57 win. The previous school record was 14 blocks, against Duquesne during the 2007–08 season. With the win, Oakland moved to 14–3 (4–0 in the Horizon League) and received a point in the Coaches Poll.http://www.espn.com/mens-college- basketball/rankings/_/year/2017/week/10/seasontype/2 They then lost four of the next five games and did not receive votes in any remaining polls. Oakland set the all-time O'rena attendance record with 4,123 in a 93–88 upset loss against Detroit. The loss was OU's first conference loss of the season. =Awards= Brock was named Horizon League Freshman of the Week after averaging 7.3 points and 7.3 rebounds per game during the Great Alaska Shootout. Two weeks later, he received the same award again after scoring 9 points with 5 rebounds and 5 blocked shots in a win over Robert Morris. On February 6, Brock was named both the Freshman and Player of the Week. He was the first Horizon league player to receive both awards in the same week since the league began awarding a weekly newcomer in 2012. He averaged 15 points, 14 rebounds, 3 blocks and 1.5 steals per game in wins over Youngstown State and Cleveland State. Brock was honored as a \\"Hometown Hero\\" by the National Football League's Detroit Lions during a game against the Chicago Bears.

An expert-in-residence at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, he is the co-founder of Work-Bench, an early stage enterprise technology venture fund. Early life and education Van Vuuren was born in Pretoria, South Africa. In 2003, Van Vuuren began undergraduate studies at Harvard, and graduated with a BA in economics in 2007. He earned a master's degree in design studies from the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 2012. While pursuing his postgraduate degree, Van Vuuren was awarded fellowships by the MIT Media Lab, TED and Pop Tech. He was a graduate student fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University from September 2010 through May 2012, and a scholar at the Aspen Institute in 2011. Career =Harvard Entrepreneurship= At Harvard, Van Vuuren worked closely on art and science experiments and startup projects with professor David Edwards, whom he had first encountered in 2007 as student in Edwards' \\"Idea Translation\\" class. In 2008, along with several others in the class, Van Vuuren co-developed off-grid microbial fuel cells for use in sub-Saharan Africa. The research and project was funded by private investors, the Harvard Institute for Global Health, MIT IDEAS Global Challenge, as well as a $200,000 Lighting Africa grant from the World Bank and a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Challenges Grant. In 2009, Van Vuuren worked with Edwards to establish ArtScience Labs (also known as the Laboratory at Harvard). An interdisciplinary platform for idea experimentation and exhibition in the arts and sciences, it was modeled after Le Laboratoire, an experimental art and design center in Paris. Van Vuuren served as the lab's director from its 2009 launch until 2012. =Experiment Fund= Based on the growing ecosystem of startups at Harvard, and demonstrated in part by the success of the Lab, the Experiment Fund was founded in January 2012. A seed-stage investment fund co- founded and led by Van Vuuren, it was established specifically to support student start-ups and technologies and platforms created in Cambridge (or by people educated in Cambridge). The Experiment Fund was backed by Breyer Capital, Accel Partners, Polaris Partners, Harvard University, and NEA. Patrick Chung and Harry Weller, both NEA partners, were co-founders of the fund, as were Polaris' Alan Crane, and Jim Breyer of Breyer Capital. Edwards served as an advisor. The company's early investments included Kensho, Philo (formerly Tivli), Zumper, and Rest Devices, among others. In 2014 Van Vuuren partnered with Chung to create Xfund. Focused on \\"technically gifted entrepreneurs with a liberal arts mindset,\\" Van Vuuren left the company after a high-profile dispute with Chung. Chung filed a lawsuit, and Van Vuuren countersued. The suit was settled privately in 2016. =Work-Bench Ventures= With Thomas Quinlan, the president and chief executive of RR Donnelly & Sons Company and Jonathan Lehr, a veteran of Morgan Stanley, Van Vuuren founded Work-Bench Ventures in early 2012. A New York-based enterprise technology VC fund, Work-Bench has invested in APX Labs, DialPad (formerly Switch), True Office, VTS, X.ai, and vArmour, among others.

Bosco Littorio  The area received its current name, which means lictorial wood and refers to the fasces, by the Fascist regime in the 20th century. Following the construction of the refinery in the 1950s, the local vegetation was affected by the fumes, becoming swollen and contorted. Until the 1970s, the area was used by inhabitants of Gela as a summer resort and swimming spot. It was also frequented by people carrying out illicit excavations. In 1983, archaeological excavations were carried out, which revealed the emporium and from 1992 the area became part of the state property governed by the Soprintendenza di Caltanissetta, which is based at Gela. The wooded area can be entered freely and is looked after by the . The archaeological area was opened to the public on 29 May 2009.  Archaic emporium  Excavation of the ancient emporium: traces of the holes for roof beams are visible. Area \\"A1,\\" from the 6th century BC and its doorway The Archaic Emporium,The official name is Gela, Bosco Littorio-Emporio arcaico. as it is identified by archaeologists, contains numerous structures (more than ten) which belong to a broad area extending from the port to the acropolis (the site of the ancient acropolis is the hill now known as Molino a vento) of the ancient Greek city of Gela, in an area bounded by the Gela river on the southeastern side. The buildings consist of regular square rooms. The walls survive to a height of more than 2 metres and in some cases preserve the ancient holes for the roof beams. In many cases, the layers of plaster which covered the interior walls are also preserved. In one of the structures, an entire door is preserved, including jambs and architrave. The walls were built of rough sundried mudbricks, probably mass-produced since almost all of them have the same measurements (60 x 60 x 15 cm).R. Panvini; F. Giudice, Ta Attika: veder greco a Gela: ceramiche attiche figurate dall'antica colonia, Roma 2003, p. 215 The first phase of activity in this area is datable to the time of the Greek colony's foundation in the 8th century BC. The site developed in the 6th century, until its destruction after 480 BC, probably from natural causes. The destruction might have been caused by a tsunami: traces of a traumatic event are clear from the collapsed walls of some of the houses. Over the remains of the archaic area is evidence for a final phase of life, characterised by the celebration of feasts which probably had a religious dimension. The discovery of the site occurred during work on the foundations of a communal kindergarten. As a result of the discovery, this work was interrupted and the building was built elsewhere instead. In December 1999, during some excavations carried out to the west of Bosco by Lavinia Sole under the direction of Sopraintendente Rosalbe Panvini, three terracotta altars were discovered, dating to the 480s BC and decorated with reliefs of mythological figures, the gorgon Medusa with her children Pegasus and Chrysaor under her arms on one, the goddess Eos kidnaping Thanatos on another, and a triad of female figures whose significance is unclear on the third. The altars are on display in the .R. Pavini, Les autels archaïque de Géla. Une découverte exceptionelle en Sicile.

The Muisca used music in their religious rituals, to welcome the new cacique and during harvest, sowing and the construction of the houses.  Muisca music  The music of the Muisca was produced in a magic-religious sense; music was played during religious rituals where the Muisca people gathers to worship the Sun (Sué), the Moon (Chía) and other deities.

Monotonous music of the Muisca The people could play music during events that took a full month to please their gods where they sang about the wars fought and begged the gods for victory in future wars. Everytime a war was fought, the Muisca danced and sang. Also during sowing and harvests in their agriculture, the people sang and danced continuously. While singing they removed the loose rocks of the farming fields. The sacrifices, sometimes human in character, were accompanied by music, dances and singing. Also when new caciques were installed as rulers of their territories music and dances were performed.Ocampo López, 2007, Ch.V, p.231 When the Muisca were constructing their houses (bohíos), they sang and danced and moved the wood for their houses according to the rhythm of the music.

It is the episcopal seat of the Diocese of Nola. It was granted the status of a minor basilica in March 1954. History There was probably a palaeochristian church on the site, as a chapel was founded around the tomb of Saint Felix of Nola, a martyred bishop of the region. It was reconstructed in a Gothic style in the 1370s under the patronage of Count Niccolò Orsini and was consecrated to \\"the Blessed Virgin and the Saints Felix of Nola and Paulinus\\" (Felice Martire e Paolino). The crypt has traces of the older building. It was rebuilt over the centuries, particularly in 1583, and in 1861 after a serious fire; on the last occasion it was reconstructed in a Neoclassical style. Among the artists and architects involved were Nicola Breglia, Salvatore Cepparullo and Paolo Vetri. It was completed in 1909. With the reconsecration, the relics of Saint Felix were brought back to the cathedral. In the 9th or 10th century they had been removed by the Lombards from a church in Cimitile to Benevento Cathedral, and from there in the 11th century to San Bartolomeo sull'Isola Tiberina in Rome.

Henry Theel was born on November 14, 1917, to a Finnish-Swedish family in Helsinki, but spent his youth in Oulu. The paternal side of his family can be traced back to Belgium. In the beginning singing was only a hobby for Theel, but then in 1942 he made his first recording session featuring the song \\"Syyspihlajan alla\\". In the year of 1945, Theel began to perform songs of Toivo Kärki and he had already in 1950 made over two-hundred-fifty recordings. Between 1946-1952 Theel and Kärki toured Finland and at the same time Theel's interpretation and overall performance of \\"Punainen mylly\\" became very successful. Theel continued to make recordings in the 1950s, however he was forced to take a longer break when his vocal cords were damaged. This injury prevented him from singing for some time altogether. Theel returned with his recordings in the early 1960s. The greatest successes of Theel became \\"Sellanen ol 'Viipuri\\", \\"Syysillan Tuuli\\", \\"Tangokavaljeeri\\" and \\"Rattaanpyörä\\". After this Theel made some recordings with Humppa-Veikkot. Theel continued recording until his death, and by that time he had made over five-hundred individual recordings. Theel had sung in Finnish, Swedish, Italian and Spanish. Notable songs that Theel sang in Swedish are as follows: \\"Kan du vissla Johanna?\\" (\\"Can you whistle Johanna?\\"), \\"Vintergatan\\" (\\"Milky Way\\") and \\"Min älskling\\" (\\"My darling\\"). Theel died at the age of seventy-two on December 19, 1989, in Helsinki, Uusimaa, Finland. Theel is buried beside his wife, Svea Dorothea Ahlberg (March 17, 1913 - August 25, 1970), within the Hietaniemi Cemetery in Helsinki, Finland.

The suburb was created on 8 July 2014 on land excluded from the existing suburbs of Port Augusta and Wami Kata. This followed a request from the Davenport Community Council, the organisation representing the aboriginal community residing there. It is located within the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Davenport. The names of private roads and the numbering of property within the suburb were approved by the council meeting of the City of Port Augusta held on 27 October 2014. Land in both the suburb and the adjoining suburb of Wami Kuta was associated with the Umeewarra Mission which was operated by the Open Brethren Assemblies of South Australia from 1937 to 1964 and whose main elements were a school and a home for children. In 1964, the mission came under the control of the South Australian government. At the same time, the area was renamed as the Davenport Reserve. In 1968, the administration of the reserve was transferred to the Davenport Community Council. The children’s home closed in 1995 when its superintendent retired. Land use within Davenport is residential, however planning regulations do permit the establishment of facilities for recreation, \\"small scale light industry\\" and community use which are consistent with the historical character of the community living within the suburb. Davenport includes the Wami Kata Old Folks Home, an aged care facility, and the former Umeewarra Mission building which as of 2014 was scheduled for demolition despite calls for its retention by former occupants. The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that Davenport and an adjoining part of the suburb of Port Augusta shared a population of 163 people of whom 98.1% identify as being \\"Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people.\\" Davenport is located within the federal division of Grey, the state electoral district of Stuart and the local government area of the City of Port Augusta.

The unpublished manuscript was discovered in a public library in St. Petersburg nearly two centuries later, in 1890, by Slavic studies professor Aleksander Brückner, who declared Stanisławska to be the earliest known Polish woman poet. The work was finally printed in 1935.  Biography  = Early life = Stanisławska was born in 1651 to Michal Stanisławski, a military commander and at one time the voivode of Kiev province, and Krystyna Borkowa Szyszkowska (née Niszczycka). Stanisławska was a member of the szlachta, or noble class, and her family bore the Piława coat of arms, connecting them to the powerful Potocki and Zebrzydowski families. Following the death of her mother when she was three, Stanisławska was sent to a cloister near Kraków to be educated by Dominican nuns. Her maternal great aunt, Gryzelda Dominika Zebrzydowska, was the prioress there until she died of the bubonic plague, at which point Stanisławska was placed in the guardianship of her maternal grandfather. = The \\"Aesop\\" episode = Stanisławska's young brother Piotr died in 1667, prompting her father to bring her back home. He had remarried in 1663, to Anna Potocka Kazanowska-Sluszka, and under pressure from his new wife, he arranged his daughter's marriage to Jan Kazimierz Warszycki. Warszycki had powerful connections, being the son of Stanislaw Warszycki, a senator and Castellan of Kraków, but he was also mentally disabled, physically abusive, and completely uninterested in Stanisławska sexually. In Transaction Stanisławska refers to him almost exclusively as \\"Aesop\\" for his ugly appearance, but ultimately she takes pity on him as the \\"slave\\" of his conniving and \\"tyrannical\\" father. Much of the piece recounts her misery in her marriage to Warszycki and her attempts to secure a divorce from him. Shortly before their wedding she became deathly ill, and the marriage ceremony was conducted in her home rather than in the church, as was traditional. After her father's death in 1669, Stanisławska gained ownership of the family's estate. Her great uncle John III Sobieski, who would become king of Poland in 1674, became her new guardian. With his assistance, Stanisławska repaired her relationship with her stepmother and fled to a convent, claiming sanctuary from her husband and his family. She sought an annulment in court, which was finally granted around 1670. Her stepmother's testimony, in which she claimed that she and Stanislawska's father had forced the girl into marriage against her will, was crucial in securing the annulment. = Later life and marriages = Death and Saint Roch, one of several stucco decorations in the so-called Chapel of Good Death in Tarłów, most probably commissioned by Anna Stanisławska. Once divorced, Stanisławska swiftly married a distant relative, Jan Zbigniev Oleśnicki. According to Transaction, they were happily married until Oleśnicki's death from cholera in 1675 while on a military expedition during the Second Polish–Ottoman War. In 1677 she married again, to Jan Boguslaw Zbąski. In 1683, Zbąski died from an injury he sustained at the Battle of Vienna during the Third Polish–Ottoman War. It was at this point that Stanisławska began writing Transaction. Little is known of Stanisławska's life after 1685. At some point in the 1690s, she was sued in court after leading a group of servants and villagers against the new owners of a neighboring estate, which had been seized due to unpaid debts. She donated much of her wealth to various missionary groups and to the Piarist monks at Dunajgrod, leaving her estate to the latter in her will. She died on June 2, 1701, in Kurów.  Transaction (1685)  Transaction, or a Description of the Entire Life of One Orphan Girl Through Doleful Laments Written by the Same 1685 is an autobiographical (according to the author) poem describing Stanisławska's life and three marriages between the years 1668 to 1685. It consists of 77 threnodies, or laments, each containing a varying number of eight-line stanzas. It also contains a 22-line introduction titled \\"To the Reader\\", a 12-line conclusion, \\"Conclusion – To the Reader of This Book\\", and numerous marginal glosses. It is a Polish Baroque piece, characterized by dramatism, swells of emotion, and strict form. It also reflects Stanisławska's intense Catholicism, typical to the Sarmatism movement of the period and evidence of her convent education. Stanisławska's rhymes follow an AABBCCDD format, called Chestochovian rhymes, which were very unpopular among Polish poets and thus an unusual choice. Her primary inspiration was most likely Jan Kochanowski's \\"Laments\\" (also translated as \\"Threnodies\\"), written in 1580 about the death of his two-year-old daughter. Like Kochanowski, Stanisławska personifies and addresses Fortune in her work, in addition to referencing a Christian god. She may also have drawn upon the traditions of \\"courtly theatre\\" for her narrative. Ożarska notes that while describing Stanisławska's life and the death of her three husbands, the manuscript does not mention any of the principals by name; in fact, the title page credits the authorship of the book to \\"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph\\". The names of the principals are recorded in the author's glosses. Thus Ożarska believes that the work is not meant to be autobiographical, but a depiction of 17th-century Polish culture, including \\"courtship, betrothal, wedding or funeral customs which are depicted in considerable detail\\". For reasons unknown, Transaction was never published, and was not discovered until 1890, when the manuscript was found in a St. Petersburg public library by Slavic studies professor Aleksander Brückner. Brückner declared Stanisławska to be Poland's first woman poet in his 1893 study \\"The First Polish Woman Writer and Her Rhymed Autobiography\\". Later research, however, has disproved Brückner's assertion. Even after Transaction was published in 1935, Stanisławska was surpassed in fame by her contemporaries Elżbieta Drużbacka and Antonina Niemiryczowa, both historically and in the Polish literary canon. Transaction was only able to be published after years of negotiations with St. Petersburg, which were complicated by the Russian Revolution in 1917. The work was finally sent to Poland as part of a larger exchange in 1935, and edited and published in that year by Ida Kotowa. Though Stanisławska's identity as the author was in question for a time, Kotowa included in her edition a 1699 letter written by Stanisławska, which matched the handwriting in Transaction. Stanisławska's original manuscript was either destroyed or lost during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. = Criticism = In her introduction to Transaction, Ida Kotowa heavily critiqued Stanisławska's clarity and imagination, writing that the marginal notes often had to be relied upon for the \\"true sense of a stanza\\" and that her rhymes were \\"usually … strained, and sometimes simply forced\\". Brückner agreed, repeatedly calling the poetry \\"poor\\" or even \\"terrible\\", but going on to praise Stanisławska's \\"feminine wit\\". Though later scholars were more forgiving, calling Transaction \\"a sincere and artistically valuable confession\\" as well as \\"detailed and lifelike\\", ultimately the work has been celebrated more for its social implications than for its style.Wilczek, Piotr and Chuilleanáin, Eiléan Ní, \\"Orphan Girl: A Transaction\\", back cover. It was the \\"first strictly personal woman's memoir for the readers' enlightenment and admonition\\" in the region, and one of many recently discovered \\"'other' and certainly 'forgotten' voices of the Baroque era\\".

The episode was written by co-executive producer Robbie Thompson and directed by executive consultant Robert Singer. It was first broadcast on May 4, 2016 on The CW. In the episode, after Amara unleashes another attack, Sam and Dean look through a way to stop her while the prophet Chuck Shurley returns to face her. The episode finally confirmed the theories among the series' fans that speculated that Chuck was God. The title is a reference to the phrase \\"Don't call me Shirley\\" from the movie Airplane! in a dialogue between Robert Hays and Leslie Nielsen. The episode received critical acclaim, with God's identity finally revealed and Metatron's and Chuck's chemistry praised. Plot Metatron (Curtis Armstrong) is looking for food on a dumpster when he is suddenly transported to a bar where he finds prophet Chuck Shurley (Rob Benedict). Chuck gives Metatron glasses and when he puts them on, angels begin singing and a stunned Metatron realizes the shining Chuck is God. He wants Metatron to help Him finish His autobiography, with which He's been having problems. Chuck reveals He's been traveling the world and only seems interested in His time on Earth as a human. Metatron criticizes most of the autobiography for giving no details, and God in His response unknowingly reveals that He has sympathy for Lucifer turning into a villain. Over the course of their conversation, He also mentions He likes the Winchesters and constantly brought back Castiel for them, but He is done helping them since their quest to destroy the Mark caused Amara to be released upon the world. At some point, the former angel asks Him why Dean's amulet didn't glow near Chuck, when it was said to glow brightly in the presence of God. God says He “turned it off”, and then produces the amulet and turns it on again, causing it to shine. When Metatron asks God why He created the world, He says He was lonely, and that He hoped that by creating things He could convince Amara to be better, but she just destroyed everything every single time. He then locked her away and created the universe, but after seeing all the conflict both humans and angels create, He walked away to let them sort it out for themselves. He reveals that He sees no point in fighting Amara again and would rather let her destroy the world. Meanwhile, Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean (Jensen Ackles) investigate a murder-suicide in a town called Hope Springs. Sam discovers that the murderer had black veins on his lower arms, recalling the insanity virus Amara spread shortly after her release. Deputy Jan Harris (Sonja Bennett) is exposed to a strange fog and contracts the same virus, causing her to murder her husband. Sam and Dean find her but she tries to kill them, which prompts Sheriff Macready (Tim Kelleher) to shoot her. The fog then reappears and begins to cover the entire town, causing Sam, Dean, the Sheriff and many townspeople to hide in the police station. God then shows Metatron a news report about the fog, shocking Metatron. The former angel is disgusted by God's apathy towards Amara, and tells Him that He's become a coward and that the humans are His greatest creations, because although they have many bad qualities, they never give up. In the meantime, Sam too is infected by the fog, and Dean, who remains unaffected by it, calls out to God to intervene. God meanwhile writes the final part of His autobiography, and afterwards, while an apparently moved Metatron is reading it, grabs a guitar and starts singing “Dink's Song”. In Hope Springs, Dean finds the amulet in Sam's pocket glowing brightly, and realizes that Sam has been restored and that the fog is gone. As they go outside, they find that all the townspeople have been restored to sanity, while those who had died have also been restored to life before they find Chuck helping people. With the amulet burning bright in his presence, it becomes clear of who Chuck is to the brothers and he tells them they need to talk. Reception =Viewers= The episode was watched by 1.54 million viewers with a 0.6/2 share among adults aged 18 to 49. This was an 8% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 1.67 million viewers. This means that 0.6 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 2 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. Supernatural ranked as the second most watched program on The CW in the day, behind Arrow. It also ranked as the 103rd most watched show in the week. =Critical reviews= \\"Don't Call Me Shurley\\" received critical acclaim. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.6 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"'Don't Call Me Shurley' may not have been the 'Wow!' we were waiting for, after so long, with regards to the show's big God reveal, but it made up some ground with a compelling, dominating (and often funny) story between God and Metatron and the Almighty's want/need to complete his memoirs. And Metatron's sage, and harsh, advice as an editor who wanted God to write a 'warts and all' account of his journey.\\" Sean McKenna from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.8 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"How awesome was it to see Sam, Dean and Chuck reunited once again, with the brothers realizing who their friend actually was before the 'We should probably talk' line? What a superb way to end the hour. This episode really made me want to go back and see the series from the beginning with the definitive knowledge that Chuck is God. And of course, it got me excited for what's next and wondering just how God is going to play into the final episodes of Supernatural Season 11.\\" Bridget LaMonica from Den of Geek, gave a perfect 5 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"The episode was loaded with hilarious one liners and quips from many characters, but Chuck stole the show in the first half. He even claimed he was writing a new series, titled Revolution, but didn't think it was going anywhere. Funny nod to the show by Supernatural creator Eric Kripke that was canceled in 2014. I never thought Supernatural would dare bring God to the show, but now I'm glad they have. \\" Samantha Highfill of EW wrote, \\"For Supernatural fans, tonight's episode has been years in the making. Not only did it mark the return of Chuck, but it finally solidified what many of us have assumed since the season 5 finale: Chuck is, in fact, God. And I have to say, for God's epic return, this episode did not disappoint. Rather, his return allowed for the most meta episode probably since 'Baby,' and it was so, so much fun.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman of TV.com wrote, \\"After plodding through weeks of filler, 'Don't Call Me Shurley' was the kind of major turn that Supernaturals central story needed as we enter Season 11's final episodes.

The start up introduced the world's first chat-based mobile translation technology, allowing translators to work from a smartphone as well as from their desktops. The mobile app is a peer-to-peer translation application that pairs a business or person needing translation to a translator. Stepes can match in a variety of different industry and domain fields in over 100 languages. Generally the app has four features: Document Translation, Chat and Translate, Talk and Translate and Book a Translator.  Development  Stepes was developed in conjunction with CSOFT International, a multinational localization company with headquarters in Beijing and San Francisco. Its founder, Carl Yao, is also the creator of TermWiki, a social knowledge network for industry and domain terminology in 100 languages. Now Stepes TermWiki is one network. The name \\"Stepes\\" is a reference to the Eurasian steppes, from which the majority of the world's current spoken languages originated. Stepes was launched online in early December 2015. As of January 2016, the Stepes mobile app can be downloaded from both the iOS and Android app stores. In May 2016, Stepes launched Stepes Translate, an online human translation interface that resembles Google Translate but is powered by human translators.  Basic functions  *Stepes Translate *Chat-based translation interface *Just-in-time translation *\\"Swish\\" full text preview *Translation memory *Machine translation support *Terminology management *Voice based input: dictation through speech recognition *Live speech translation and interpretation *Website translation *Book on-site interpreters *Automated project updates and billing functions *Online payment platform *Translator rating and feedback system *Customer Service *Carefully tested translators and interpreters  Chat-based translation  Chat-based translation describes the way Stepes feeds content to be translated to its translators on a smaller mobile screen. The Stepes mobile app breaks down longer documents into smaller chunks and sends them to the translator in the form of a text. Translators respond back with their translation, resulting in a back-and-forth “chat” which the Stepes app automatically compiles into a full translated document. Translators can also swipe left or right (the ‘swish’ function) to view the full translated text or the full original text. Chat-based translation allows businesses and translators to access translation regardless of time or geography. Stepes holds multiple patents in the US and in China for its chat-based translation interface, swipe left and right for context review and software.  Stepes Translate  Stepes Translate expands the capabilities of on-demand machine translation systems such as Google Translate and Bing Translator. With Stepes Translate allows businesses and individuals to obtain instant quality human translations of text directly on their smartphone or desktop PC. The platform is available 24/7. Stepes Live uses the familiar side by side interface of machine translation platforms like Google Translate. Users enter text into the source field which is translated by a human translator through the Stepes mobile app. Requesting users can see their translation progress live. For most requests, the translation is completed within minutes and appears in the target field for the requesting user to see. Mobile translation approach Mobile translation is the process for human translators to translate content directly on their mobile devices. Stepes uses only human translators (rather than machine translation) to translate content. All translations are done through a mobile phone using the Stepes mobile translation app or through Stepes' browser-based application. The free Stepes mobile app is billed as much easier to use than traditional desktop-based translation software. The result is that anyone bilingual – about half the world's population – could potentially contribute to translation from their smartphones. Currently, there are only around 250,000 professional translators but 3.65 billion bilingual people in the world. Stepes currently has a network of 60,000 translators. Language industry experts have dubbed mobile translation as the beginning of \\"Big Translation, large-scale translation efforts by people speaking two or more languages.\\" Big Translation requires leveraging existing technological tools to scale up translation capabilities to a global level that matches current communication and information generation needs.

She draws on her own background and Palestinian culture and traditions in her installations. Abboud explores memory and storytelling and oral history through the body and her use of Palestinian folklore and fairy tales. Her art frequently features the Palestinian landscape. She focuses on remembering, the impact of memory fragmentation, and how history impacts one person's current life. Abboud reinterprets fairytales in her work. She uses the well-known story of Rapunzel to explore the life of Arab women. In this series she uses pencil sketches, photos, lace, and seeds to comment on and depict the woman's normative place in society. She highlights the fact that the image of the domestic woman is relevant in many cultures.

It operated from 1929 to 1999, when merged into Bell Aliant. History IslandTel traces its history to The Telephone Company of Prince Edward Island which was founded in 1885. This company was one of several dozen private independent companies operating in fixed geographic areas in the province. This particular company was largely focused on the Charlottetown area. =20th century= In 1910 Halifax, Nova Scotia-based Maritime Telephone and Telegraph Company (MT&T;) laid a submarine telephone cable from Wood Islands, Prince Edward Island, to Pictou, Nova Scotia; it entered service on January 1, 1911. The Telephone Company of Prince Edward Island suffered severe financial hardship as a result of a fire on September 5, 1911, that destroyed a newly installed switchboard and caused heavy damage to its central office and headquarters in Charlottetown. By December 1, 1911, a controlling interest in the company was bought by MT&T;, thus establishing a partnership of shared telephone communication with Nova Scotia that endures to this day (see Area codes 902 and 782). The company was renamed The Island Telephone Company Limited under a law passed by the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island on April 29, 1929. The Island Telephone Company Ltd gradually grew through acquisitions of smaller competitors. In 1932, there were 45 privately owned telephone companies in Prince Edward Island. The last independent telephone company merged with The Island Telephone Company Ltd on May 29, 1974, with the purchase of the South New Glasgow Rural Telephone Company. In the 1980s, the company branded itself as IslandTel. In 1998, the company was renamed Island Telecom Inc to reflect the growing diversity of its business areas. Merger In 1999 the shareholders of Island Telecom Inc voted to merge with the other Stentor Alliance companies in Atlantic Canada (NBTel, MT&T;, and NewTel Communications) to form Aliant Telecom Inc. / Télécommunications Aliant Inc.

He authored 16 plays, including the City of Wine series, a seven-play cycle which \\"traces the rise and fall of the ancient city of Thebes, from its founding by Cadmus and Harmonia to its demise at the siege of Troy.\\"  Life  Dickens was born in 1959 in British Columbia and raised in Ontario. His father was a teacher who taught in boarding schools. For 10 years, he worked in architecture. He was the director for the Kensington Youth Theatre and Employment Skills program in Toronto, using theatre as a training tool for street youth. Dickens lives in Kingston and has three children.  Playwriting career  In 1994, Dickens turned to playwriting from acting when he developed advanced glaucoma. He was commissioned to write a new version of Seneca's Oedipus. After writing the piece and winning a Dora Award, Dickens wanted to further explore the story of Jocasta, Oedipus's mother. He then became fascinated by \\"the aftermath of Oedipus's downfall.\\" After six years, Dickens had expanded Oedipus to become a trilogy and decided to \\"dramatize the entire history of Thebes.\\" In total, the series took 15 years to write. To support himself during this time, Dickens taught public speaking to politicians and worked in construction, injuring his hand in an accident. In May 2009, Dickens's seven-play cycle, City of Wine, debuted at Toronto's Theatre Passe Muraille. The play involved 233 student actors, 172 professional actors, and 110 theatre artists and was produced by Nightswimming, an independent theatre company. In its entirety, the play's running time is 12 hours.

As a method of mobilization, it relies on information communication technologies (ICT), particularly the Internet as a tool to promote all kinds of ideological projects or to form social movements. Bimber based his theory on the idea that \\"the processes of group-oriented politics will show less coherence and less correspondence with established private and public institutional structures\\".  Concept  Accelerated pluralism operates within a landscape typified by an acceleration of the existing tendencies of liberal democratic politics towards a contest of groups, which coalesce according to narrowly defined interests. The theory views these groups as not interested in politics except for the issue they are concerned about. Due to information communication technologies, the incorporation of groups into the networked whole was made easier and simpler so that coordination and autonomy are enhanced while access to sources of information is facilitated. These lead to the creation of new forms of direct action. It also result to a fragmented and more fluid system with diminished institutional coherence. The concept is related to other representational models such as Michael Schudson's \\"monitorial citizen\\" and Stephen Coleman's direct representational model. As a method of group formation, accelerated pluralism is unique because through the use of the Internet people are able to congregate in virtual public sphere and decide which form of action to take. According to the Center for Democracy and Technology's Daniel Weitzner, the Internet facilitates a “one-to-one interaction…between citizens and government” something that is missing in today's politics. Accelerated pluralism played a major role in the mobilization efforts of the Arab Spring, Occupy and Black Lives Matter social movements by allowing the participants to congregate cheaply and quickly. ICTs in combination with accelerated pluralism played a major role in the \\"ignition of social protest, the cascade of inspiring images and stories\\" in social movements. Bimber, however, noted that accelerated pluralism may not always lead to positive development since it could drive radical dissent.

Political career MacGregor stood as an SNP candidate in the North Lanarkshire Council election in 2012 and was elected as one of four councillors for the Coatbridge North and Glenboig ward. In August 2015 MacGregor was selected by the SNP as their local candidate to contest the Coatbridge and Chryston constituency at the 2016 Scottish Parliament election. In an acrimonious internal selection process, party members chose MacGregor ahead of five other candidates. A small minority of branch members then unsuccessfully attempted to have MacGregor de-selected as a candidate. In February 2016 the Coatbridge and Chryston Branch was suspended entirely by the SNP, until the election had passed. Branch members later went as far as to plan a silent protest at the 2016 SNP party conference held in Glasgow in March. In a secret recording of one meeting, MacGregor was heard stating that the internal fighting was making him \\"physically sick\\". During the campaign MacGregor was branded as 'no show', a name initially coined by journalist Tom Gordon in reference to him not attending a hustings.

He is the founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of Neptune, co-founder and CEO of Fonus, and co-founder of Globle. Born and raised in Montreal, Canada, Tian dropped out of pre-university college at the age of 17 to start Neptune, and, as of late 2017, has raised around $7 million from private investors as well as a total of more than $2 million from crowdfunding sources alone. Tian is a 2015 Thiel Fellow, having been awarded $100,000 by PayPal co-founder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel through the Thiel Foundation, and was named one of the top 30 Quebecers under 30 by Les Affaires in 2014.  Early life  Tian was born to Chinese Canadian parents in Montreal, Quebec, in 1994. He was raised in Brossard, Quebec, a suburb of Montreal, and attended secondary school at Jean de la Mennais College, a French-speaking school in La Prairie, Quebec. Tian is fluent in English, French, and Mandarin. Tian is also a classically-trained pianist, having won first place in piano performance at the Canadian Music Competition in 2008 at age 13.  Career  Tian started Neptune, a wearable technology company, in January 2013, while he was 17 and still studying at Marianopolis College, in Westmount, Quebec. Before building a prototype or incorporating the company, Tian posted some conceptual drawings of a smartwatch, the Neptune Pine, on the internet and issued a press release announcing the product's launch. He received more than 20,000 orders for the device in a few weeks. Following the interest in his conceptual drawings, Tian dropped out of school and travelled to China to meet with manufacturers to have the device developed. In November 2013, he launched a crowdfunding campaign to finance the product's development. Within 27 hours, the campaign surpassed its funding goal of $100,000, and went on to raise more than $800,000 in 30 days. The Pine was prominently featured in the 2017 film The Fate of the Furious, the CBS TV series Extant produced by Steven Spielberg and starring Halle Berry, as well as the music video for the song Smartphones by Trey Songz. The device received mixed reviews from the press, with many criticizing its large size and functionality. In November 2015, Tian was invited by the Mayor of Montreal Denis Coderre to attend the 2015 Montreal Trade Mission to China as one of the city's representatives. In November of 2019, Tian announced the launch of Fonus. Fonus claims to be a global mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), offering data and phone service through the standard GSM network for a fixed fee. Controversies Tian raised US$1.15 million dollars for the Neptune Suite (a suite of products including a smart watch and tablet) in 2015, estimating the products would be ready for shipping in April 2016. However, by December 2019, Tian still had not shipped the product to the company's backers, leading ZDNet to claim the company had \\"jilted\\" backers. Tian claims that the project ultimately needed more money in order to be realized, and that the money he had raised was not sufficient to complete development of the product. More recently, the legitimacy of Tian's latest project, Fonus, has also been called into question. After a Canadian entrepreneur and software developer, Darryl Wright, expressed doubts about his purchase of the Fonus SIM card and requested a refund, Tian declined, stating \\"Nah, you're not getting it. [...]\\", writing several profane statements to the customer. In December 2019, it was reported that Fonus had misled its customers about a business relationship with Telus, a leading telecommunications provider in Canada. Telus issued a statement saying they had \\"no known relationship\\" with the company and that they had requested Fonus to remove their name from the Fonus website. On January 21, 2020, Tian tweeted to media outlets National Post, MobileSyrup, and iPhoneinCanada saying, \\"If you guys keep painting us [Fonus] in bad light, especially after we've shown proof of our service working, I will bring all of you to court. All three (3) of you. One (1) more negative article and that's it. I'm calling it.\\"  References  Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Businesspeople from Montreal Category:Canadian businesspeople Category:Thiel fellows ","title":"Simon Tian"},{"id":"50442192","text":"Daniel Guy Johnson (born 3 September 1977) is a Scottish Labour Party politician who has served as Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Edinburgh Southern since 2016.  Early life  Johnson was born on 3 September 1977. He was educated at Bonaly Primary School and privately at Stewart's Melville College. He joined the Labour Party at the age of 17. Johnson graduated from the University of St Andrews in philosophy and from the University of Strathclyde in management. His first job after leaving university was working as a constituency caseworker for Edinburgh South's MP Nigel Griffiths. He later went on to work as a management consultant for Accenture.https://uk.linkedin.com/in/daniel-johnson-00652122 Prior to entering politics, Johnson became managing director of the Paper Tiger and Studio One group of shops. The group became the first independent retailer in Edinburgh to become an accredited Living Wage employer in 2015.  Political career  In January 2014, Johnson was selected by party members as a candidate for Edinburgh Southern prior to the upcoming Scottish Parliament election. He was elected to the Scottish Parliament in May 2016, gaining the seat from the Scottish National Party. He became shadow education minister for Scottish Labour in May 2016. In December 2017, Johnson was promoted to the Shadow Cabinet as Justice Spokesperson. He resigned on 28 May 2019, the day after it was confirmed Scottish Labour had finished fifth in Scotland in the European Parliament elections and lost both its Scottish MEPs. He criticised the Labour Party's \\"direction and leadership\\" and noted Labour had finished sixth in Edinburgh. He challenged the party's Brexit policies, stating in his resignation letter he thought Labour should endorse a second referendum and campaign for remaining in the European Union. He is currently deputy convener of the Education and Skills Committee. = Leadership question = In September 2020, Daniel Johnson called for Richard Leonard to resign as Scottish Labour leader, saying \\"Continuing like this will be disastrous for our party and is why I no longer have confidence in Richard Leonard’s leadership.\\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-msp-breaks-ranks-to- demand-richard-leonards-departure-95vvwlqgh = Protection of Workers (Retail and Age-Restricted Sales) (Scotland) Bill = In 2018, Johnson lodged a private member's bill which aimed to protect workers selling age restricted products. The Bill aimed to address increasing violence and abuse that shopworkers faced, often triggered by Challenge 21 and the refusal to sell restricted products. Johnson argued that as retail workers are personally liable for upholding the law on age-restricted products - with individual retail workers, rather than businesses, at risk of being fined up to £5000 - it was necessary to bring in legislation that would protect the workers carrying out the role. The Bill would make it a statutory offence to obstruct someone upholding statutory age-restrictions; the precedent for this Private Member's Bill can be seen in other legislation such as the Emergency Workers (Obstruction) Act 2006, which makes assault towards emergency workers a statutory offence. The aim of the bill was to originally cover retail workers, but has been expanded to cover a vast range of employment practices that include the sale of age-restricted products, such as in hospitality and in the voluntary sector. https://www.parliament.scot/S5MembersBills/Consultation_Document_20180117_FINAL.pdf On the 18th of September 2020, the Scottish Government indicated that they would be supporting the progress of the bill throughout parliament, a significant win for Johnson.https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/retail- workers-set-win-protection-snp-back-new-bill-2977170 The Bill passed through Stage 1 on the 24th September 2020 https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/msps-back-legal-protection- shop-22737800  Personal life  Johnson resides in the constituency with his wife, Jackie, and two daughters. Johnson revealed to Scottish Parliament that he had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) later in life at the age of 35. He is believed to be the only politician in any UK parliament to be diagnosed with the condition at this time.

Based on the novel by Lisa Klein, the film follows the story of Hamlet from Ophelia's perspective. It stars Daisy Ridley in the title role, alongside Naomi Watts, Clive Owen, George MacKay, Tom Felton and Devon Terrell. The film premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival, and had a limited theatrical run on June 28, 2019, followed by a VOD release on July 2, 2019 by IFC Films. Critical reception was mixed, though Ridley's performance received acclaim. Plot In the castle of Elsinore, Denmark, the wilful and free-spirited Ophelia (Daisy Ridley) is Queen Gertrude's (Naomi Watts) favourite lady-in-waiting, though she is ridiculed by the other ladies for her lack of nobility. Her father Polonius (Dominic Mafham) serves as chief councillor to King Hamlet (Nathaniel Parker). Upon his return from Wittenberg, Prince Hamlet (George MacKay) soon begins courting Ophelia, but their blossoming romance is cut short when Hamlet returns to Wittenberg to continue his studies. At the same time Hamlet's uncle Claudius (Clive Owen) begins to seduce Gertrude. Later, Gertrude charges Ophelia with retrieving a tonic from a healer named Mechtild (Also played by Watts) who lives deep in the forest. While preparing the queen's chambers for the night, she witnesses the king and queen in a heated argument. Ophelia pursues the distraught Gertrude up to the castle parapets where she encounters what appears to be a ghost. The next day the king is found dead, presumably from a venomous snake bite. Claudius takes the throne as his successor and marries Gertrude. Hamlet returns to Elsinore in a rage, having heard the news from Polonius, and begins to suspect foul play. He resumes his romance with Ophelia, which the court begins to notice. Ophelia's brother Laertes (Tom Felton) cautions her to be wary of his advances, before leaving for France. At the advice of his trusted friend Horatio (Devon Terrell), Ophelia meets Hamlet at the parapets where he confides in her his suspicions about his mother's infidelity. The next day while on another errand for the queen, Ophelia encounters the same spectral figure from the parapets. Mechtild is revealed to be not only Gertrude's sister but also Claudius's former lover, who brought her to ruin after he accused her of witchcraft when she miscarried their illegitimate son. Mechtild was able to escape persecution by faking her death by drinking a venom that gives the illusion of death. Later on, Hamlet meets Ophelia in the chapel and the couple make plans to marry in secret. While attending to the queen early the next morning, Ophelia discovers the spectral figure that she encountered earlier is actually Claudius. She finds Mechtild's venom in his cloak and realises he was responsible for King Hamlet's death. When he learns of their secret marriage, Claudius decides to use her to spy on Hamlet. Ophelia warns him of her discovery and he tells her to leave Elsinore for the convent where she'll be safe from Claudius. Polonius deduces that Hamlet is mad, but Claudius isn't convinced and instructs him to have Ophelia married off. That night Hamlet enlists actors to perform a spectacle that depicts his father's murder. Claudius bursts into a rage, confirming Hamlet's suspicions but Ophelia is able to stop him from drawing his sword on his uncle. Gertrude accuses her of turning Hamlet against her and dismisses her. Polonius attempts to plead with Gertrude on his daughter's behalf but he is killed by Hamlet who mistook him for Claudius. Ophelia is left further devastated when Horatio tells her that Hamlet has been banished to England along with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Meanwhile, Laertes returns from France demanding justice for his father's death. While being prepared for her wedding, Ophelia gets into a fight with one of the queen's ladies who tells her that Claudius ordered Hamlet's murder, but her hopes are suddenly lifted when Horatio tells her that he is still alive. While attempting to escape the castle she is cornered by Claudius. Ophelia calls him out for his mistreatment of Mechtild and he has her locked up, but she escapes and feigns madness. During her act, she tells Horatio to take her body from the grave. Claudius orders her to be arrested but Gertrude shows her mercy, believing her to be truly insane. The guards pursue her to the lake where she drinks Mechtild's venom and seemingly drowns. Horatio has seen through her request and recovers her body from the grave just as she wakes up, but she is weakened from consuming too much of the venom. While accompanying her through the forest, they come across Norwegian soldiers on their way to Elsinore. Horatio wishes her well before he leaves to warn the court while Ophelia seeks out Mechtild for an antidote. When confronted about her role in the king's murder, Mechtild explains that while she had no part in it she admits she couldn't deny Claudius as she still harboured feelings for him, but agrees that he should pay for his crimes when realising he was the first one to said witchcraft when her baby dies. While Ophelia rests, she goes to offer her help to the invading Norwegians. Ophelia awakes to find a stunned and remorseful Gertrude, who tells her that Laertes has challenged Hamlet to a duel. Ophelia forgives her, and with Gertrude's help she is able to sneak back into the castle unrecognised. Claudius meanwhile has anointed Laertes’ sword with poison. Hamlet is overjoyed to see his beloved is alive and well. Ophelia pleads with him to leave with her but he is still consumed by the desire for vengeance, but promises he will follow her to the convent. Ophelia sadly bids him goodbye and leaves Elsinore for good. Both Hamlet and Laertes are killed when they are wounded by his poisoned sword. Enraged and grief-stricken, Gertrude grabs Hamlet's sword and kills Claudius, just as the Norwegians storm the castle, accompanied by Mechtild. Gertrude poisons herself with Claudius's venom and she dies in her sister's arms. The film closes with Ophelia living peacefully in exile with her and Hamlet's daughter.

The band formed in 2005 and is based in both Cairo, Egypt and Vancouver, Canada. They have been noted for mixing heavy metal with traditional and pre-colonial Egyptian melodies and instrumentation. Career Massive Scar Era formed in Alexandria in 2005, and their Egyptian fans often call them Mascara for short. The original members were singer/guitarist Cherine Amr, singer/violinist Nancy Mounir, and drummer Suzie. The band immediately gained attention for its all-female membership. Suzie soon departed and the band has since experienced many lineup changes, with several men included, though Amr and Mounir have remained with the band throughout its history. Their lyrics often address both political and feminist topics. Dylan Wijdenes-Charles is currently the bassist. Amr had become interested in Western heavy metal in the late 1990s, when the genre became popular in Egypt even though the police were known to round up fans for harsh questioning. Amr formed Massive Scar Era with classically-trained violinist Mounir. They released their debut EP Reincarnation in 2006. The band immediately gained notice for its female membership, often with criticism from family members and religious authorities; these struggles were mentioned in the internationally-released book Heavy Metal Islam by Mark Levine in 2008. The band has also faced difficulty in finding gigs and record distributors in their home region due to popular disdain for aggressive music. The Reincarnation EP gained international recognition, and the band was invited to play the Sweden Rock Festival in 2009. In 2010 they were featured in the Egyptian film Microphone, covering Alexandria's arts and music scene. Starting in 2011 the band began to play at European summer music festivals regularly. In 2013 Massive Scar Era was featured in the film Before the Spring, After the Fall, which depicted the participation of Egypt's rock musicians in that country's 2011 revolution. Cherine Amr moved to Vancouver, Canada in 2015 to escape her home country's criticism and harassment toward her music. The most recent Massive Scar Era release is the EP Color Blind in 2018. In 2020, Cherine Amr adopted the name Cheen and released the folk-oriented solo single \\"Esmi\\".

Since 17 February 2020, Forbes has served as the Cabinet Secretary for Finance in the Scottish Government. Early life and education Forbes was born in Dingwall in Ross and Cromarty in northern Scotland. Growing up, she spent three years in India, then was taught in a Scottish Gaelic school. She returned to India at the age of 10 and lived there until she was 15, with her father involved in providing healthcare to people who could not afford it. She returned to Glasgow, Scotland and finished her schooling at Dingwall Academy. She read history at Selwyn College, Cambridge, graduating with a BA in 2011, then studied at the University of Edinburgh, gaining an MSc in Diaspora and Migration History in 2013. After two years of working for Dave Thompson MSP, she became a chartered accountant in 2013, then worked for Barclays for two years. Political career In August 2015, Forbes was selected from an all-women shortlist by local SNP members as their candidate for the Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch constituency held by Dave Thompson who would not be standing at the next election. She was part of an SNP campaign to address the gender pay gap around employment in the Highlands. She was elected in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election. She was Convener of the Scottish Parliament's Cross-Party Group on Gaelic, until November 2018 when she had been promoted to a ministerial post in the Scottish Government. She has spoken in favour of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage status as a possible way to protect the language. In March 2018, she delivered an entire speech to the Parliament in Gaelic during a plenary debate on the language. A member of the Free Church of Scotland, Forbes called on the Government to let children practice religious belief in school without mockery. In May 2018, she said \\"I wanted to note that pupils should be allowed to explore, develop and understand the diversity of religious faith in Scotland because if they can understand it in school you will hope that as they go through the rest of their life they will be tolerant of people who believe that things are different to them.\\" On 27 June 2018, she was appointed to the Scottish Government as Minister for Public Finance and Digital Economy, as part of a wider reshuffle announced by First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon. On 6 February 2020, she became the first woman to deliver the Scottish Budget upon Derek Mackay's resignation as Cabinet Secretary for Finance, Economy and Fair Work. Prior to this, no woman had delivered a Budget in either the Scottish Parliament or Westminster, although they have in the Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies. On 17 February, she was appointed Cabinet Secretary for Finance—the first woman to hold the post.

The highway connects Westminster and Anderson. Route description SC 24 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 76 (US 76) and US 123 (East Main Street) in Westminster, within Oconee County, where the roadway continues as Oak Street. It travels to the southwest and immediately curves to the southeast before leaving the city limits. The highway passes by Pleasant Hill Cemetery and travels through rural areas of the county. Then, it has an intersection with SC 11\\\\. The highway continues traveling through rural areas of the county and has an intersection with SC 182 in Oakway. During a short east-northeast section, there is a very brief concurrency with SC 59\\\\. The highway passes by Hays Cemetery. SC 24 enters Anderson County and almost immediately has an interchange with Interstate 85 (I-85) which includes an intersection with SC 243 at its northern terminus. It crosses over part of Lake Hartwell on an unnamed bridge. A short distance later, it begins a concurrency with SC 187 at the Portman Shoals Intersection. The two highways cross over another part of the lake on the Calvin Wesley Belcher Bridge. It then enters West Gate, where SC 187 leaves the concurrency. SC 24 travels along the southern city limits of Centerville and passes just north of Anderson Regional Airport. In West Anderson, the highway passes Lakeside Middle School and intersects SC 28\\\\. About later, it enters the city limits of Anderson. Just under later, it meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with US 29 Business (US 29 Bus.)/US 76/US 178/SC 28 Bus./SC 81 (Murray Avenue). History The first SC 24 was an original state highway, which operated as a spur from SC 12 in Hibernia, to Ninety Six. By 1926, SC 24 was extended southeast on new primary routing through Pelion to SC 6 in North. In 1928, SC 24 was extended south, from North, to SC 64 in Olar. In 1929, SC 24 was extended west, in concurrency with US 25 to Hodges, then replacing SC 25 to Donalds, and SC 15 to SC 2 in Clemson. That same year, SC 24 was rerouted to avoid Ninety Six, with its former route becoming SC 246. By 1930, SC 24 was rerouted at North, replacing SC 6 to Orangeburg then in concurrency with SC 2, through Bowman and Rosinville, to US 78\\\\. In 1931, SC 24 was extended west along SC 2, through Seneca and Walhalla, then solo through Mountain Rest to the Georgia state line; SC 24 reached its longest at approximately . In 1933, US 178 replaced SC 24 between Anderson and US 78; SC 24 remained west of Anderson to Georgia. In 1938, SC 24 was renumbered as part of SC 28\\\\. The second and current SC 24 was established in 1938 as a renumbering of SC 18, between Westminster and Anderson.

Political career  Wells became involved in politics during the 2014 Scottish Independence referendum by joining the Better Together campaign and stood as the Scottish Conservative candidate in Glasgow North East in the 2015 general election, finishing third with 4.7% of the vote. She also unsuccessfully contested the Glasgow Provan constituency at the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, finishing third with 8.6% of the vote, but was elected via the Glasgow regional list. Shortly after her election, Wells was made Scottish Conservative Spokesperson for Welfare Reform and Equalities. She sits on the Equal Opportunities Committee of the Scottish Parliament. In late 2018, Wells was banned from Holyrood for leaking an embargoed committee report to the press. After a complaint was made that the MSP had \\"sought political advantage\\" by speaking out about prisoner voting before a report had been published, the parliament's standards committee unanimously ruled that Wells had breached the code of conduct for MSPs.

He had the titles of a vizier and was therefore the highest official at the royal court, second only to the king. Werbauba is only known from the reliefs found in the mortuary temple of king Sahure at Abusir. In a relief, he is shown behind the king, the first in a row of officials. The whole scene is a representation of a royal hunt, which is now heavily damaged. Werbauba is depicted in the lowest register as the first person. Only his name and three titles are preserved: the one of the curtain, official (z3b) and vizier. This title combination is typical for an Old Kingdom vizier.

The work was jointly commissioned by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, the St. Louis Symphony, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, and Orquestra Sinfônica do Estado de São Paulo Foundation. It was given its world premiere in Sydney, Australia on August 22, 2013 by the saxophonist Timothy McAllister and Sydney Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Adams. Composition =Background= The Saxophone Concerto was Adams's first composition following his three-hour oratorio The Gospel According to the Other Mary. Adams, whose father played alto saxophone in swing bands during the 1930s, has cited his early exposure to such jazz saxophonists as John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy, and Wayne Shorter as inspiration for the piece. The composer described the work's style in the score program notes, writing, \\"While the concerto is not meant to sound jazzy per se, its jazz influences lie only slightly below the surface.\\" Noting the relative scarcity of saxophone concertos in the classical repertoire, Adams further remarked: Thus, Adams stipulated that the concerto be played in the jazz style of saxophone performance, as opposed to the classical \\"French\\" style of playing typically heard in such pieces as Maurice Ravel's Boléro and Darius Milhaud's La création du monde. The saxophonist Timothy McAllister became acquainted with the composer after performing saxophone parts in Adams's Nixon in China and City Noir. McAllister later suggested the possibility of performing a new work by Adams, to which the saxophonist recalled, \\"...we were having dinners and lunches out at New World Symphony (in Miami Beach, Florida); I believe it was March of 2011. We were walking to dinner one night and he said, 'I think I should write you a piece.' I worked hard to contain my elation at the mere suggestion.\\" McAllister continued, \\"I let it go, and over a year went by, and -- you know how it is with people, you kind of fall in and out of touch. I just kind of stayed on his radar as I kept doing 'City Noir,' and then in February of 2012 I received an e-mail out of the blue from him, saying that he'd finished 'The Gospel According to the Other Mary,' and he was thinking about the next project and he'd like to do a saxophone concerto in Sydney, and asked if I was free.\\" McAllister later described the concerto as \\"some of the hardest music I've ever played,\\" adding, \\"It's traditional in a way that's incredibly challenging.\\" =Structure= The Saxophone Concerto has a duration of roughly 30 minutes and is composed in two parts: #Animato: tranquillo, suave #Molto vivo: a hard, driving pulse =Instrumentation= The work is scored for alto saxophone and an orchestra comprising piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, English horn (doubling 3rd oboe), two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, three horns, two trumpets, harp, piano, celesta, and strings. Reception Reviewing the world premiere, Harriet Cunningham of The Sydney Morning Herald highly praised the Saxophone Concerto, writing, \\"Adams has thrown down the gauntlet with a solo line which demands speed, flexibility, musicality and, above all, stamina to keep going with barely a bar's rest. McAllister delivered, punching out the 'nervous bebop' sound (Adams' description) with manic intensity, like a Charlie Parker or Stan Getz solo sustained across 30 minutes.\\" She continued, \\"But the most beautiful moments were all Adams, from the brain-addling cross-rhythms of the final movement to the delicate interplay between solo saxophone and clarinet.\\" The work was also lauded by Charles T. Downey of The Classical Review, who observed, \\"Adams pushes the soloist to the edge with dizzying scales and disjunct leaping passages, often bouncing off the orchestra in syncopated or otherwise disorienting rhythmic patterns. [...] All in all, Adam's Saxophone Concerto is a worthy addition to a small but growing repertory for this instrument.\\" Alexandra Gardner of NewMusicBox added, \\"One of my favorite parts is the very opening of the piece, which sounds as if McAllister is pulling an entire orchestra out of the ground with his instrument alone.\\" Conversely, Andrew Clements of The Guardian called the piece \\"another note-spinning exercise in nostalgia\\" and wrote, \\"the solo part is expertly written for brilliant Timothy McAllister, and the music has the infectious, irresistible energy the composer generates so convincingly. But it never does anything you wouldn't expect, or reveals anything deeper beneath its shiny surfaces.\\" Hannah Nepil of the Financial Times similarly said the piece \\"doesn't have enough to say.\\" She added: Recording A recording of the work, performed McAllister and the St. Louis Symphony under the conductor David Robertson, was released through Nonesuch Records on May 6, 2014. The disk also features Adams's 2009 symphony City Noir. The album later won the 2015 Grammy Award for Best Orchestral Performance.

Formerly the seat of the Bishops of Sarsina, since 1986 it has been a co-cathedral of the Diocese of Cesena- Sarsina. History This church likely dates to the 10th century, when a Romanesque structure in brick was begun. The lunette above the entrance portal has a modern mosaic depicting Saint Vicinius wearing a bishop's mitre and holding a chain. The façade remains unfinished. The interior nave is generally austere. Chapels added to the lateral aisles, include a chapel (1693) dedicated to the Virgin of the Rosary with a 17th-century altarpiece with 14 small paintings depicting the Mysteries of the Rosary. On the left nave is also the chapel of the Sacrament (1555), with a Renaissance-style altar. The presbytery held entrance to a crypt. The main altar has a 10th-century bas- relief depicting Christ enthroned with St Gabriel and St Michael. Among the paintings here are a Visitation by Michele Valbonesi; and Annuciation (18th century) by Mattia de Mare; and finally an 18th-century Madonna and Child with Santa Lucia and the Souls of Purgatory by unknown hands. Near the apse is a canvas depicting the Mass of San Gregorio Magno attributed to Carlo Cignani. Opening to the nave on the right is the chapel of San Vicinio with elaborate stucco decoration patronized by the bishop Paolo Calbetti in 1755. The altar houses the relics of the saint, while the chains are in the tabernacle. The altarpiece is a Madonna and Child with San Vicinio Crowned by Ippolito Scarsella, also called il Scarsellino.

It is located in the hills above Zuma Beach. Originally a ranch property with a bungalow owned by actress Margo, it was leased by The Band in the 1970s and converted to a recording studio by Rob Fraboni to the precise specifications of Bob Dylan and The Band. Interviews of The Band featured in Martin Scorsese's documentary The Last Waltz were filmed at Shangri-La. The property was purchased by Rick Rubin in 2011. Rubin and Shangri-La were the subject of a four-part documentary series, Shangri-La, which aired on Showtime in 2019. History Shangri-La Ranch. In 1958, Mexican-American actress Margo bought a 1.73 acre property in the hills above Zuma Beach. A ranch house was built and the site was named Shangri-La Ranch. Margo starred in the film adaptation of James Hilton's 1933 classic novel Lost Horizon, where the fabled paradise \\"Shangri-La\\" originated from. The property was an upscale bordello for the 1950s Hollywood elite and a filming site for the TV show Mister Ed in the 1960s. In 1974, the ranch property was leased by Canadian-American roots rock band The Band. The master bedroom was converted to a recording studio by record producer and audio engineer Rob Fraboni and in-house tech Ed Anderson according to the precise specifications of Bob Dylan and The Band. The Band built it while taking time off after concluding the Bob Dylan and the Band 1974 Tour. Drummer Levon Helm later described Shangri-La as \\"a clubhouse and studio where we and our friends could record albums and cross-pollinate one another's music.\\" They kept the name \\"Shangri-La\\" because to them \\"Malibu felt like a paradise after years of gray Catskill winters\\" in upstate New York. The house came with a Naugahyde bar and bedrooms with mirrored walls, from Shangri-La's time as a bordello. Shangri-La was a functioning studio by the end of 1974, with Larry Samuels working as studio manager. The Band's Robbie Robertson, Garth Hudson and Rick Danko were living in houses near Shangri-La and were becoming involved in other outside projects. Levon Helm lived between Woodstock, New York and Los Angeles, and used a bedroom at Shangri-La when he was in Malibu. Richard Manuel lived at Shangri-La for a year, living in a bungalow down toward Zuma Beach that was converted from the stable of Bamboo Harvester from Mister Ed. Manuel was heavily drinking Grand Marnier liqeur while living at Shangri-La. Richard Manuel of The Band lived at Shangri-La for a year, residing in a beach bungalow converted from the Mister Ed horse stable. In 1976, Rob Fraboni teamed up with partners and purchased the house for $195,000, turning it into a semi-commercial studio. Shangri-La was a state-of-the-art 24-track studio, equipped with the latest synthesizers. The 24-track console allowed The Band keyboardist Garth Hudson to record multiple layers of keyboards on several tracks on their sixth studio album, Northern Lights – Southern Cross. A number of albums were recorded under Fraboni's management, including Renée Geyer's So Lucky (1981), Bonnie Raitt's Green Light (1982), and Eric Clapton's No Reason to Cry (1976). Clapton spent nearly three months at Shangri-La, hanging out and recording with The Band, Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Ringo Starr, Pete Townshend, Joe Cocker, Billy Preston, Ronnie Wood, and Georgie Fame. Bob Dylan lived outside in a tent in the garden during Clapton's time at Shangri-La. Clapton formed a close friendship with Richard Manuel while at Shangri-La. Garth Hudson recorded overdubs at Shangri-La for Van Morrison's tenth studio album, Wavelength (1978). In 1985, Rob Fraboni left Shangri-La to serve as Vice President of Island Records. The studio's usage decreased dramatically after Fraboni's exit. In the late 1990s, Blaine \\"Beej\\" Chaney of the Minneapolis new wave punk band The Suburbs purchased the property for $2,125,000 million. Over the next few years, he invested an additional $2 million into the studio and, with the help of producers Jim Niper and Pete Strobl, loaded it with the premium vintage audio equipment that is still in use today including the centerpiece API 32 BUS console. Immediately following these renovations, Chaney invited Mark Knopfler to record there where he went on to make his acclaimed album, Shangri-La. Also in 2003, they worked with Ethan Johns and Angelo Petraglia to record the debut album by Kings of Leon, Youth and Young Manhood. In 2006, musician and producer Eric Lynn was invited to become Shangri-La's house engineer and studio manager. Chaney oversaw continued interest in the studio with a number of notable albums being recorded at Shangri-La, including Weezer's self-titled 2008 album, and Metallica's Death Magnetic. Following his divorce from Sarah Macmillan, a Cargill family heiress, Chaney took a more hands off role in the studio. In 2009, he invited his friend and fellow musician and producer, Jake Coyle, to manage the day-to-day operations at Shangri-La, allowing Eric Lynn to focus entirely on running recording sessions day to day. Coyle facilitated increased interest and stability at Shangri-La during a tumultuous time for recording studios around LA, many of which permanently closed between 2009 and 2011. Shangri-La was now officially experiencing a renaissance with Rick Rubin continuing to rent the property for the majority of his projects including the Gossip's Music For Men, Adele's 21, Kid Rock's Born Free, and The Red Hot Chili Pepper's I'm With You. In 2011 following, personal changes in Chaney's life, the studio and property were listed for $4.1 million. Within weeks the price tag was cut drastically to $3,195,000. Rick Rubin purchased Shangri-La for $2 million in August 2011. Numerous artists have since recorded at Shangri-La under Rubin's ownership, including Adele, Ed Sheeran, Eminem and Kanye West. Shangri-La survived the 2018 Woolsey Fire, but Rubin's two nearby homes were lost to the fire. Property and recording spaces Shangri-La consists of four bedrooms, three bathrooms and two primary recording studios. The main studio has an API console built in the early 1970s as well as wide range of outboard gear including Urei 1176s, LA-2As, Neve 1064s, 1073s, and two Fairchild 670s. In addition, there are a series of vintage microphones including Neumann U47s, U67s and U87s. The other recording space, a building called \\"The Chapel\\", also uses U87 microphones but has a console from Muscle Shoals Sound Studio which was formerly in Rubin's The Mansion. The property also includes Bob Dylan's former tour bus, which is parked permanently and has been repurposed as a recording space. Showtime documentary series The studio and its owner Rick Rubin were the subject of the four-part documentary television series Shangri-La, which aired on Showtime in 2019. A \\"work-in- progress\\" cut of the docuseries was screened at the 2019 SXSW Festival. The first two episodes were directed by Morgan Neville, while the last two were directed by Jeff Malmberg.

It runs parallel to the real life story of Sichel, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2011. The fictional story of Anna Seashell, played by Lili Taylor, is of a woman who is given the same diagnosis. The documentary follows Alex as she uses narrative film to show her journey through terminal illness as it surrounds her and her families life.  Plot  A Woman Like Me is a documentary about co-director Alex Sichel's navigation through having terminal breast cancer and how it has inspired her to try and embrace death as mentioned in Buddhist philosophy. The film is composed of home videos, one on one sit downs with Alex's family; husband, parents, sisters, doctors, and healers. Although a documentary, half of the movie shows Alex's current film project about Anna, a woman with the same diagnosis as Alex except she looks at the glass as half full. The film within the film recounts private conversations between Alex and her husband, Alex's dreams, and the alter-self, Anna, who is moving forward to face her fear of death. Sichel believes that making a movie about herself living with breast cancer can help her heal and accept what is happening to her. The documentary side of the film shows Alex's doctor visits, the types of medications she is taking, and the alternative medicine healing practices she does with healers and shamans. Alex's family, although glad Alex is taking medicine from the \\"real\\" doctors, believe healers and the Buddhist philosophy of \\"going joyfully towards death\\" are not helpful and is just \\"magical thinking\\". Alex later learns that the tumor has grown larger so, she takes the opportunity to go to Greece and learn more about her family's history. The last scene of the film shows that Alex has lived another winter and is once again at the Buddhist silent retreat that she attends yearly. She mentions how her daughter's birthday is coming up so she needs to look forward with positive thoughts.

A two-wheeler insurance policy is provided by any of the authorized insurance companies registered under the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India (IRDAI).  Policy and benefits The law binds anyone riding a two-wheeler with an insurance policy covering the owner of the vehicle against any unanticipated situations or accidents or the vehicle against damage. The vehicle is protected against any damage caused due to natural disasters such as storms, floods, landslides, earthquakes, and so on. In addition, it also covers against the damage caused by the theft, fire, accidents, riot, and explosion.  Types  The motor insurance policy is generally categorized into ‘act only’ and ‘comprehensive’ policies. The former covers the death, physical injuries, or any damage to the property of the third party, the latter includes the coverage for the damage caused due to the external forces in addition to the third party damages. However, the damage by external forces includes damages caused by fire, burglary, lightning, earthquake, cyclone, flood, terrorist acts, landslide, and so on.

J. Abramss Bad Robot Productions. It is the third installment in the Cloverfield franchise, following Cloverfield (2008) and 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016). The film stars Daniel Brühl, Elizabeth Debicki, Aksel Hennie, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Chris O'Dowd, John Ortiz, David Oyelowo, and Zhang Ziyi, and follows an international group of astronauts aboard a space station who, after using a particle accelerator to try to solve Earth's energy crisis, must find a way home when the planet seemingly vanishes. The film was based on God Particle, a spec script from Oren Uziel which had the main plot of the space station crew, but was unconnected to Cloverfield. The script was acquired by Paramount Pictures and Bad Robot in 2012. It had been initially planned as part of Paramount's low-budget InSurge distribution label, but following the folding of that label, its production was expanded as a Paramount-distributed film. Only during production did Abrams decide to link the film to Cloverfield, adapting Uziel's screenplay and adding scenes to establish the connection, after the same approach was used to alter 10 Cloverfield Lane from its original script, The Cellar. Abrams saw the particle accelerator accident as a cinematic means for future events to cause changes in the past, narratively linking the Cloverfield franchise together. Once announced as a yet-to-be-named Cloverfield film in late 2016, the film's release was delayed several times. A surprise trailer aired during Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018, advertising the film's final title and its release on Netflix, which had purchased rights for the film from Paramount. The release occurred immediately after the game. While the unique marketing tactics were praised, the film itself received generally negative reviews from critics, with many considering it the weakest of the Cloverfield films.  Plot  In 2028, Earth is suffering from a global energy crisis. The space agencies of the world prepare to test the Shepard particle accelerator aboard the orbiting Cloverfield Station, which would provide Earth with infinite energy, while conspiracy theorists fear it will create the \\"Cloverfield Paradox\\", opening portals to parallel universes allowing their horrors to threaten Earth. Among the crew is Ava Hamilton, a British engineer who frets about leaving her husband Michael potentially for years, as their relationship struggles since the loss of their children to a house fire. The crew is rounded out by American commander Kiel, German physicist Ernst Schmidt, Brazilian medical doctor Monk Acosta, Irish engineer Mundy, Russian engineer Volkov, and Chinese engineer Tam. After about two years of unsuccessful attempts to activate Shepard, the crew achieves a seemingly stable beam, but it overloads and creates a power surge on the station. After restoring basic power, they find Earth has vanished from view, and the gyroscope that aids in the station's navigation is missing. As the crew works on repairs, strange events begin to occur, including the discovery (and subsequent rescue) of an unfamiliar woman called Mina Jensen fused with wires inside a wall. Volkov's eyeballs begin moving of their own accord; he begins conversing with his own reflection in a mirror and is compelled to craft a gun using an on-board 3D printer. He uses the gun to threaten the crew, but as he does so he convulses and dies, and the station's worm colony bursts out of him. Jensen tells Hamilton not to trust Schmidt, who Jensen claims to be a spy sent by the German government to keep Shepard shut down. Mundy's arm gets pulled into a solid wall and is severed clean off, without bleeding or pain. They find the arm roaming of its own volition. When they recognize it is trying to write something, it instructs them to \\"cut Volkov open\\". Once they do, they find the missing gyroscope. They finally locate Earth and begin restoring their communications, but transmissions state the station was destroyed and fell to Earth two days prior. The crew determine the particle beam overload has activated the Cloverfield Paradox, and in doing so, moved the station to a parallel universe in which Jensen replaced Tam as the station's engineer, Schmidt is a spy, and Hamilton, (though still working on the mission), has remained on Earth, where her children are still alive. Believing the Paradox can be reversed and they can return to their own universe if they reactivate the Shepard, the crew sets out to make repairs. Tam is trapped in a chamber that floods with water, which then explodes, freezing the water and Tam. Meanwhile, Hamilton decides to return to parallel Earth with Jensen in order to prevent the fire that killed her children. As they prepare, Mundy is killed in an explosion caused by a strange magnetic field, destabilizing part of the Shepard and threatening to tear the whole station apart. Kiel sacrifices himself to save the station, leaving Hamilton in charge. On Earth, Michael has woken up to discover a wave of destruction ravaging the planet, witnessing the silhouette of a giant monster in the distance. On his way to offer assistance at the local hospital, he stops to help a young girl named Molly at a dockyard. After learning the hospital was destroyed, he takes her to the underground shelter of a friend and tends to her wounds. With Shepard ready to activate again, Hamilton prepares to leave with Jensen, but Jensen suddenly knocks her out. Jensen kills Monk with Volkov's gun, wounds Schmidt, and insists the station must stay in her universe to keep Shepard there. Regaining consciousness, Hamilton uses the gun to shoot out a window, ejecting Jensen into space. Hamilton decides to return to their universe with Schmidt and makes a recording for her alternate universe self, giving her the plans for Shepard and stressing the importance of her family. Hamilton and Schmidt reverse the universe shift and use Tam's modifications to finally make Shepard work. After reporting in, the two eject themselves in an evacuation capsule towards Earth. Michael learns from mission control of the station's reappearance and his wife's return to Earth, but he lambasts them for not warning her not to return to Earth in light of the ongoing situation. As the capsule re-enters the Earth's atmosphere, a giant monster bursts through turbulent clouds, letting out a loud roar as the screen cuts to black.

Suzanne Cryer, who appeared as Leslie in 10 Cloverfield Lane, also appears in a brief cameo role as a newscaster who interviews Stambler. Simon Pegg and Greg Grunberg, both of whom have frequently worked with Abrams on other films and television series, provide vocal cameos as Radio Voice and Joe, respectively. Oyelowo and Logue previously portrayed Kiel and Stambler in the film's ARG campaign.  Production  = Pre-production = The film was announced in November 2012, under the title God Particle, based on a script by Oren Uziel and to be directed by Julius Onah. With J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot Productions as the production studio, it was set to be released under Paramount's InSurge label, limiting the film's budget to $5–10 million. At this stage, the film was established to take place on a space station in Earth's orbit and a resulting incident that causes the crew to find Earth has gone missing. Uziel said that his script had been a spec script he wrote about one year after finishing up a similar spec script for Shimmer Lake. The pick- up of the film occurred around the same time that Paramount and Bad Robot bought the rights to the spec script The Cellar by Josh Campbell and Matt Stuecken, which ultimately was reworked during production to become 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016), adding in elements to tie that script to the first Cloverfield film; however, when Uziel wrote his screenplay for God Particle it had not been attached to Cloverfield. When Bad Robot acquired the script, J. J. Abrams had already put some thought for how it could fit into Cloverfield but had not come up with a way prior to filming. Abrams liked that with the script, \\"how something in the future could be an origin for something in the past\\" to establish origin stories for the other Cloverfield works. Abrams said that the script had \\"the DNA\\" that made it a potential Cloverfield film, and was looking for it to be a spiritual sequel to the original. In March 2015, Paramount decided to close the InSurge label; The Cellar had been moved under the main Paramount label, but God Particles fate was unclear. By February 2016, Paramount confirmed it would release the film under its own label, with a planned February 2017 release date. = Casting = In March 2016, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and David Oyelowo were confirmed to be cast in the film. In April, Variety reported that John Krasinski was in early talks to join the film to play one of the astronauts, but had a possible conflict due to a commitment with a television series. In May, Elizabeth Debicki, Daniel Brühl, Chris O'Dowd, Zhang Ziyi, John Ortiz, and Aksel Hennie were announced as members of the cast. Cinematographer Dan Mindel was confirmed to join the film from his résumé. = Filming = The film was shot in Los Angeles, California, where it received tax credits under the state's film incentive program. While filming in Los Angeles, the project was shot under the titles of God Particle and Clean Pass. Filming began on June 10, 2016 and wrapped on September 23, 2016. According to Uziel, it was during production that he came to learn that the film was being connected to Cloverfield, requiring him to rewrite a few scenes for additional shooting. Uziel speculated that the decision to connect to Cloverfield was due to the difficulty in marketing a stand-alone science- fiction film at the time, and felt the connection between the films was more of an anthology series similar to The Twilight Zone, with each movie dealing with how people with complex relations deal with an other-worldly dilemma. The scenes set on Earth were added during production only after they found test audiences wanted to know what was happening on Earth during events on the space station. The final shot of the monster, similar to the creature Clover seen in the first Cloverfield movie, was a shot that the production team came to recognize as a further way to link the films. Among some of the film's Easter eggs includes a figurine of a \\"Slusho!\\" mascot aboard the station; the drink brand had been featured in Cloverfields viral marketing. = Post- production = The visual effects were provided by Atomic Fiction and supervised by Ryan Tudhope, Russell Earl, Jason Snell, Stefano Trivelli and Pauline Duvall with the help of Industrial Light & Magic and Base FX.  Release  Shortly after filming in October 2016, The Wrap learned from insiders of the connection of God Particle to Cloverfield, though neither Paramount nor Bad Robot commented on this discovery. However, by December 2016, Paramount affirmed the film's connection; the title God Particle had been dropped in favor of listing the film as \\"2017 Cloverfield movie\\". Alongside the renaming, Paramount reslotted the film's release from February 2017 to October 2017, to give more time for post-production. The film suffered two additional delays. In July 2017, it was announced the release had been delayed another three months to February 2018. In January 2018, the release was moved for a third time, to April 20, 2018. The reason for these latter delays was not given. In mid-January 2018, the Cloverfield alternative reality game (ARG), which had been used for both of the previous films, was relaunched, and provided some hints how this film would be tied to the other two. In late January 2018, The Hollywood Reporter stated that Netflix was interested in picking up the film from Paramount, following a similar deal the streaming service had worked out for the film Annihilation. According to the Reporter, Paramount's chairman Jim Gianopulos felt the film's budget (which had ballooned to over $40 million from an initial $5 million) was too large for the film to be profitable with a traditional theatrical release and that it still needed work done, and \\"while Abrams expressed an intent to get down to business in post-production, it was too little, too late\\". In March 2018, Paramount's COO Andrew Gumpert affirmed that Paramount, after reviewing the finished film with Abrams, had doubted the commercial viability of a theatrical release, and that \\"there was an ability for us to be fiscally prudent and monetize\\" by selling the rights to Netflix, exposing the film to a much larger audience. Following the film's release, The Hollywood Reporter stated that Netflix paid more than for the rights, with negotiations starting in late December 2017 and completed by mid January 2018; this offer made the film immediately profitable to Paramount. The studio retains China and home entertainment release rights. According insiders speaking to The Wrap, Paramount executives believed handing off the release to Netflix was an easy way to get instant return on the film, and the surprise reveal and release a good way to keep in line with the mystique of the franchise. This said, they clarified that they still have intentions of having theatrical releases for future films in the series. Around this time, speculation of the film being named Cloverfield Station arose, though this was not confirmed by Paramount. Further speculation circulated in Hollywood sources that work on the film was actually complete and that its first trailer would be revealed soon; 10 Cloverfield Lane had a similar surprise trailer. The events of the preceding month culminated on February 4, 2018, where, during a surprise advertisement during Super Bowl LII, Netflix announced it had acquired the premiere rights for the film, now titled The Cloverfield Paradox, which would be available on the service immediately after the game. The actors themselves were not aware of this arrangement until the day of the Super Bowl and were told of the title, the advertisement, and the release that day during a morning conference call. =Home media= On November 28, 2018, Paramount announced that the film would be receiving a DVD and Blu-ray release on February 5, 2019. Critical reception On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 21% based on 148 reviews, with an average rating of 4.53/10. The site's critical consensus states: \\"Brilliant casting is overshadowed by a muddled mix of genres and storylines that scratch more heads than sci-fi itches in The Cloverfield Paradox.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on reviews from 27 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews.\\" John DeFire of The Hollywood Reporter called the film a \\"trainwreck of a sci-fi flick bent on extending a franchise that should have died a peaceful death almost exactly one decade ago.\\" Writing for Deadline Hollywood Dino-Ray Ramos said, \\"The Super Bowl trailer for Paradox gave the impression the movie would reveal the origin of the monster that appeared in the 2008 movie and was later on hinted at in the critically acclaimed 2016 follow-up — but it barely did that. Instead, it stalls the franchise as a pastiche of sci-fi cinema veiled in clever marketing.\\" Cinemablend gave it a positive review, granting it 4 of 5 stars; the review noted that the ensemble cast \\"helps keep the wheels in motion, with a perpetual motion that never lets up\\", and that Ava's storyline provides a \\"human anchor\\" for the film's narrative. While the film received negative reviews, the marketing approach of announcing the film during the Super Bowl and premiering it hours later was seen as a novel move by Netflix. IGN noted that this strategy could only work for a film in an established franchise, whereas most new films would need a significant marketing period to draw in viewers. Even knowing that the film might be a critical flop, Netflix would have been able to grab attention due to hype from the Super Bowl, and attention that the Cloverfield series had already had. According to Nielsen ratings based on subscription video on demand, nearly 785,000 viewers watched The Cloverfield Paradox on the night of Super Bowl LII; by three days, over 2.8 million had watched it, and 5 million after a week. These ratings were not as strong as Netflix's Bright, released 6 weeks earlier, which had 11 million viewers within 3 days. The film did not significantly draw viewers from the episode of This is Us on NBC after the Super Bowl game, which had been extensively marketed ahead of the night, and which drew 27 million that evening.

Career Losing his mother two months after his birth, Redl spent most of his childhood and youth in Vienna. Redl got in touch with the progressive educational methods of the Austrian Wandervogel and decided to study philosophy. After taking his doctorate on the epistemological principles of Kant's ethics, Redl trained as a psychoanalyst under the influence of August Aichhorn and Anna Freud. During the decade that followed he completed training in psychoanalysis at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Institute. His dual focus on the education and socialization of children, and on psychoanalytic models of understanding personality development and of the treatment of children, helped specialize his work throughout his career. In 1936 he moved to the United States where he was invited by the Rockefeller Foundation to participate in a project about adolescence.Marc Rothballer, Kinder, die hassen, und Psychoanalytiker, die erziehen: zu Leben und Werk Fritz Redls (1902-1988) in: jugendhilfe 2 (2019), p. 122-123 His first two publications (1933-34, in German) - on learning difficulties and exam phobias - were followed by an influential article on 'Group Formation and Leadership' published in Psychiatry in 1942.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (1946) p. 180, 202 and 646 There he explored the role of what he called the 'central person' in group dynamics, singling out ten main types of central figures, ranging from the hero or the tyrant, to the good influence or the bad example.H. Brunning, Psychoanalytic Perspectives on a Turbulent World (2010) p. 190 His interest in group dynamics extended into his work with disturbed children, where he developed the concept of the Life Space Interview, as a means of crisis intervention in the life of the troubled child.The Life Space Interview To help disturbed troubled youth, he suggested the importance of creating a life space that would nurture and inspire positive relationships. He proposed that this be done by structured, engaging activities and by the use of language. Redl also explored the role of behavioral contagion in promoting regression in children,C.

Police chief Douglas Raymer, the \\"fool\\" of the title, tries to discover the identity of his late wife's lover. His only clue is a garage door opener, which he uses on various houses to see whose door will open. Donald \\"Sully\\" Sullivan has recently come into money but must now come to grips with his declining health. Both men get involved in a drama regarding the return of Roy Purdy, a wife abuser whose existence threatens Sully's ex- lover, Ruth. Additionally, Raymer works cases involving a crumbling building, a dissolving cemetery, and the illegal smuggling of dangerous snakes. All the while, Raymer navigates his possibly romantic feelings for Charice, one of his officers. Critical reception In a review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin called the novel \\"delightful\\". Reviewing it for The Wall Street Journal, Jennifer Maloney said it was \\"a madcap romp, weaving mystery, suspense and comedy in a race to the final pages.\\". In the Star Tribune, Kevin Canfield called it \\"a decidedly bittersweet affair, a sequel that proves both entertaining and elegiac\\".

It is a product which is protected under the GI registration and is made throughout the Indian state of Manipur and is woven by women. The fabric is transparent, has many designs on its body, and is popularly worn by women of Manipur for marriage ceremonies and other festive occasions. Geographical indication The fabric has been registered for protection under the Geographical indication of the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. It was registered as Wangkhei Phee under the Geographical Indications Act 1999 of the Government of India, with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks under Class – 25 – Clothing vide application number 372 dated 19 December 2011, and also for Moirang Phee (GI no.373) and Shaphee Lanphee (GI no.371), which are all woven by women of Manipur. The Government of Manipur was expected to register 5,000 weavers in respect of Wangkhei Phee within six months from the date of GI registration as per decision of the Consultative Committee meeting. History The fabric was originally made in muslin cloth for use by the Royal family of Manipur. The weavers were then stationed at the Wangkhei Colony, close to the palace but is now made at many places in Manipur. Product details The Wangkhei Phee is made with very fine white cotton yarn with a closely woven texture. The interlacing of cotton weft and warp is woven by women, in series and widely spaced from each other, that makes the fabric \\"fully transparent\\". Patches are incorporated by weaving with standard designs; the designs are called Kheiroithek, ThangjingTangkhai, KabokChaiba, and several others, and all have Moirang Phee design on both of its longitudinal borders. Known as a \\"luxurious\\" cloth, it is a popular attire used by women during marriage ceremonies and festivals. The fibre used for making the yarn is derived from \\"Lashing\\" (Cotton ball) and \\"Kabrang\\" (Mulberry cocoon). It is also extracted from the bark of the tree species locally known as \\"Santhak\\" (Urtica sp.). The local fibre is spun into threads and then dyed using the extracts of plants, bark, leaves, and flowers. The dyed yarn is subject to sizing through the application of a rice-based starch, following by stretching with the help of a bamboo stick, and then wound onto the bobbins and pirns. The type of yarn in the fabric used is fine cotton. The thread in the warp has counts of 80S and 100S cotton while the weft has thread of count 2/80S. The extra weft used is of 2/80S mercerized. The weaving process involves two methods based on use of shuttles: fly shuttle loom and throw shuttle loom. In the first type it is made as a complete fabric in a single piece. In the second method, the fabric is made in two pieces and then joined by stitching to make it a full fabric. Additional motifs are woven in by hand. The fabric is \\"porous, airy, see-through and thin\\", making it suitable for luxury items for women such as chadors and saris, and skirts and school uniforms for girls. Following the GI registration of the fabric, an inspection agency has been constituted for quality control of the product made by weavers.

She has been Chairman of Jilla Panchayat in Amethi/Sultanpur district and has been elected Thrice as a Member of the Legislative Assembly for the Amethi Vidhan Sabha constituency in the Legislative Assembly of Uttar Pradesh. She was minister of state in the Government of Uttar Pradesh. Currently she is President of Delhi Capital Badminton Association working towards building international champions for Delhi state She is married to Sanjay Sinh, a Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) politician from Amethi who is close to the Nehru- Gandhi family and a descendant, by adoption, of the former royal family of Amethi.  Early life  Ameeta Sinh born on 4 October 1962. She became a national champion in the sport of badminton during the 1970s. In 1984, she married another national champion, Syed Modi, whom she then partnered in a successful badminton career. Their marriage ended when Syed Modi was shot dead in 1988. While they were discharged of all charges, the CBI alleged that Ameeta and Sanjay were in a relationship, although Sanjay was still married at that time. The coup his first wife, Garima. A legal challenge to that divorce resulted in it being set aside in 1998 by the Supreme Court of India, although the couple still claim that they are legally wed. Aside from the three children whom he fathered with Garima, Sanjay has legally adopted Ameeta's daughter. Her daughter was born two months prior to the death of Syed Modi. Sinh graduated from Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Avadh University , Faizabad, in 2003 and was awarded a PhD in sociology by the same institution in 2011. Ameeta Sinh has been a party to a public battle over an inheritance that has seen Sanjay and Garima making rival claims. Sanjay was adopted by the king of Amethi, Rananjay Singh, as his heir prior to the abolition of all royal privileges in India and as such he inherited the former royal estates. In 1989, he had removed Garima from the palace but in 2014 she and her children took up residence at another palace in Amethi, called Bhupati Bhawan, and refused to move. Local people gathered to support her, claiming that she, rather than Ameeta, was the real queen.  Political career  Sinh was Chairman of Jilla Panchayat of Amethi/Sultanpur district between August 2000 and February 2002. She won the Amethi Vidhan Sabha seat as a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate in the 2002 Uttar Pradesh state assembly elections, and again in the 2007 elections, this time as an INC candidate. Her husband had also been a BJP politician at the time of the 2002 elections, having begun his career with the INC, moved to the Janata Dal party and then to the BJP. He had returned to the INC in 2003. She was minister for technical education. In 2012, Singh stood as an INC candidate in the Amethi constituency during the state legislative assembly elections of that year. She lost to Gayatri Prajapati of the Samajwadi Party. She contested the Sultanpur Lok Sabha constituency as an INC candidate for a seat in the Parliament of India in 2014 but finished third, with the winner being Varun Gandhi of the BJP. In the 2017 Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly elections, Sinh contested the Amethi constituency as an INC candidate and had Garima Singh as one of her opponents, standing for the BJP. The BJP hoped to win the seat by exploiting local sympathy for Garima, who is a relative of V. P. Singh, a former Prime Minister of India. Both women named Sanjay Singh as their spouse in their election affidavits, and it was Garima who won the contest. BJP spokespeople claimed the result was indeed one based on elector's feelings about the long-running family drama.

Among the many derogatory names she was called by royalist sympathisers, that of Parliament Joan is one by which she is also commonly known. Background and Civil War activities Nothing is known of Alkin until 1645; because of comments of her age made later in life, her date of birth is taken to be around 1600. She was the wife of Francis Alkin, a spy for the Parliamentarians who was hanged early in the English Civil War by royalist forces for his activities. She was the mother of three children. In 1645 Alkin was employed by the Earl of Essex and Sir William Waller, to be a spy for the Parliamentarians. She received a similar commission from Sir Thomas Fairfax two years later. Parliamentary records show that in 1645 she received payment from the Committee for the Advance of Money for uncovering the activities of George Mynnes, a Surrey-based iron merchant, who was supplying metal to the royalist forces. In the seventeenth century, daily news was published in newsbooks which tended to be small eight-page publications, the forerunners of newspapers. They were usually sold on the street by what the historian Bob Clarke describes as \\"semi-destitute female hawkers, known as Mercury Women\\". Those publications supporting the royalist cause were closed down and the publishers prosecuted; Alkin became involved in uncovering those behind the publication. In 1648 the royalist newsbooks the Mercurius Melancholicus and the Parliament Kite both referred to her attempts to uncover them, and the following year the Mercurius Pragmaticus called her an \\"old Bitch\\" who could \\"smell out a Loyall-hearted man as soon as the best Blood-hound in the Army\\". Although Alkin acted as one of the newsbook sellers, between 1650 and 1651 she published several short-lived newsbooks, including The Impartial Scout, The Moderne Intelligencer, Mercurius Anglicus (formerly a royalist title which she appropriated) and Mercurius Scoticus, or, The Royal Messenger. Clarke believes Alkin may have used formerly royalist titles, or royalist-sounding names to win the confidence of royalist sympathisers, and get them to reveal the location of illicit printers. The historian Marcus Nevitt disagrees, and argues that Alkin was \\"reappropriating Royalist titles for Parliamentarian consumption\\". In total she produced ten notebook issues of differing titles. One of those she uncovered was William Dugard, who ran four presses at the Merchant Taylors' School in London; Dugard was imprisoned in February 1650. The following year she was paid £10 for discovering the printers of Edward Hall's work Manus testium lingua testium, and received further recompense from the Committee for the Advance of Money for other, unknown services. Post Civil War In 1653, during the First Anglo-Dutch War, Alkin assisted Daniel Whistler in setting up a network of casualty reception stations in Portsmouth, Harwich and East Anglia. The stations treated both English and Dutch casualties. Alkin made financial claims from the state for her nursing, some of which were paid, although a petition of 1654 refers to her severe illness. The same letter stated that she had had to sell many of her possessions, including her bed. A petition for financial relief from May 1655 is the last recorded note on her, and it is presumed that she died soon afterwards.

Development The Fabrique Nationale Minimi (designated XM249), Heckler & Koch HK23 (designated XM262), and a heavy-barreled version of the M16 (designated the XM106) were used as a control group. They were supposed to be used to figure out a baseline for the SAW contenders, which were the experimental group. They were already eliminated from consideration because they were chambered for the 5.56mm NATO cartridge. The XM235 they designed was merely a prototype and Rodman Laboratories didn't have the facilities or expertise to copy and mass produce it. When the XM235 was selected for the 5.56mm SAW trials, Maremont Corporation and Ford Aerospace and Communication bid on the rights to make an improved model rechambered in 5.56mm designated the XM238. Ammunition The XM235 was chambered for the experimental 6×45mm SAW cartridge. It had a 105-grain [6.8 gram] projectile and had a muzzle velocity of 2450 feet / second [747 meters / second]. The cartridge was intermediate in size between the 5.56×45mm NATO and 7.62×51mm NATO rounds and was considered essential for the SAW concept. The current 5.56×45mm NATO tracer round was not effective in daylight conditions beyond 800 meters, the proposed effective range for the hypothetical SAW system. The difficulty of standardizing and supplying a third cartridge, as well as the political bramble the US would have to clamber through to force its approval on their NATO allies, led to the dropping of the requirement that the SAW be chambered in 6mm. The next round of testing (1979-1980) would use weapons chambered for the 5.56mm NATO round. Rodman Laboratories The facility was part of the Rock Island Arsenal campus. It was named for Lt.-Col. Thomas Jackson Rodman, who helped found Rock Island Arsenal in 1865 and was its commander until his death in 1871. The team that worked on the XM235 was headed by Curtis D. Johnson.

Dahlem was a leading official of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and, after 1945, of East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED). By the early 1950s he had become well known and popular with many comrades in the higher reaches of the SED (party) and was seen by some as a possible rival to the country's leader, Walter Ulbricht: he was stripped of his functions in 1953. He was formally rehabilitated in 1956, however. He sat as a Communist member of the German Reichstag between 1928 and 1933. and, except for a few years following his fall from grace, as an SED member of the East German Volkskammer (People's Chamber) between 1947 and 1976. Of more significance in terms of the East German power structures, he was also a member of the ruling party's Central Committee from 1946 till 1953, and again from 1957 till his retirement in 1974. Life =Provenance and early years= Franz Dahlem was born into a Roman Catholic family in Rohrbach-lès-Bitche, a small town in Alsace- Lorraine, then part of the German Empire (now in France), in the hills to the southeast of Saarbrücken. His father, Jacques Pierre Dahlem, was a railway worker. After attending middle school in Château-Salins he went on to senior school at Sarreguemines, where his school career was curtailed due to lack of money. He was also a member of the Catholic Youth League at Sarreguemines between 1908 and 1911. He undertook a traineeship as an export salesman in Saarbrücken and / or Cologne between 1911 and 1913. In 1913 he joined the SPD (Social Democratic Party / Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands), remaining a member of it till 1917. =War= Despite his opposition to the war he served in the army between 1914 and 1918. However, when the SPD split in 1917, primarily over the issue of party support for continuing its support for the government line over the war, Dahlem chose the breakaway USPD (Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany / Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands). It was also in 1917 that he was wounded while serving on the Eastern Front. After being transferred to Macedonia he developed malaria which led to several periods in hospital. =Revolution= During the post-war year of revolutions Dahlem joined the workers' and soldiers' council, initially in Allenstein (East Prussia) and subsequently in Cologne, participating in support of implementation of the slogan \\"All power to the councils\\" (\\"Alle Macht den Räten!\\"). He also co-founded and became the editor of \\"Sozialistische Republik\\", a USPD newspaper in which he powerfully advocated the party's membership of the Comintern and a party merger with the new Communist Party of Germany. He also served, between 1919 and 1923, as a Cologne city councillor. In 1919 Franz Dahlem married Käthe Weber (1899-1974) who shared in his political beliefs and activism. =Politics in a democracy= In December 1920 Dahlem took part in the \\"unification party conference\\" at which the left wing of the USPD merged with the German Communist Party to form what was briefly known as the VKPD (Vereinigte Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands / Unified German Communist Party). Here, together with Philipp Fries and Henriette Ackermann, he was elected to the local party leadership of the Middle Rhine region. He also briefly represented Middle Rhine nationally on the party central committee. In 1921 he surrendered his editorship of the \\"Sozialistische Republik\\", but during 1921/22 he briefly edited the Berlin-based \\"Internationalen Presse-Korrespondenz\\". When the French army occupied the occupied the Ruhr region in January 1923 Dahlem helped to organise \\"resistance to French and German imperialism\\". He was sent by the German Communist leadership to Paris in order to coordinate with the French Communists against the common enemy. From 1923 Dahlem was working in the Organisation Department of the Party Central Committee. He was particularly effective in the application of \\"Leninist principles\\" to party organisation. In 1927 he himself joined the Central Committee, becoming a member of its Politburo just two years later. Dahlem also participated in the legislative processes of the newly democratised state, sitting as a Communist member in the Prussian \\"Landtag\\" (regional legislative assembly) between 1921 and 1924 and as a Communist Member of the national Reichstag (parliament), representing the Potsdam electoral district, between 1928 and 1933. Recurring fragmentation was a feature of left-wing politics in general and of the German Communist Party in particular during the 1920s. One reason Dahlem was sent to Berlin in 1921 to edit the \\"Internationalen Presse-Korrespondenz\\" was to enforce his separation from Central Committee members in his Rhineland home patch at a time when he was opposing the party leadership. Areas of contention included both the party's attitude to the competing factions of Soviet communism during the Russian Civil War and the practical issue of how fast to progress the party's revolutionary objectives following what was seen as the failure of the German Revolution of 1918–1919. After 1923, with Zinoviev sidelined in Moscow and Stalin's control becoming more absolute, there was no longer any question of the German Communists having to choose between competing versions of Soviet communism, and the German Communist Party became more focused domestically. During a further period of internal fragmentation at the end of the 1920s, Dahlem was closely aligned with the strategy of the party leader Ernst Thälmann, which was variously seen either as a determined policy to unite the working class behind the Communist Party in order to resist the rising tide of Naziism or else as an aggressive and sustained assault on the centre-left Social Democratic Party which created a bitter division on the political left through which the Nazis found their path to power. It was at Thälmann's suggestion that in November 1930 Dahklem took over the leadership of the Revolutionary Trades Union Opposition (Revolutionäre Gewerkschafts Opposition). He retained this function till he was replaced by Fritz Schulte in June 1932. =Régime change and exile= The Nazis took power in January 1933 and lost little time in converting the German state into a one-party dictatorship. Party political activity (unless in support of the Nazi party) became illegal. The eleventh party conference, attended by the Communist Party leadership, took place on 7 February 1933 at the Sporthaus Ziegenhals, a restaurant in the countryside just outside Berlin on its southern side. Dahlem was one of approximately 40 party leaders who attended. The meeting later achieved iconic status as the last meeting of the German Communist Party until after 1945, and in 1953 the restaurant itself had been taken over and converted into a memorial centre. By that time many of those who had met in February 1933 had been killed or died in concentration camps. Under instructions from the party leadership, Dahlem himself fled to Paris, together with Wilhelm Pieck und Wilhelm Florin, in May 1933. The French capital quickly became the de facto headquarters of the German Communist Party in exile, and Dahlem's own membership of the Party Central Committee was confirmed in 1935, following internal party ructions during the early 1930s. In 1939 he was back in the party politburo. Franz Dahlem was back in Berlin, secretly and illegally, between February and July 1934, undertaking \\"political work\\". Much of his activity was involved in trying to build and strengthen an international \\"people's front\\" opposition to the rising tide of fascism in Germany. In July 1935 he travelled to Brussels where he took part in the 7th World Congress of the Comintern. In 1934 he had taken French citizenship, which he would retain till 1941. In 1936, after he had been undertaking \\"party work\\" in Prague for some months, he was stripped of his German citizenship. By 1937 the Spanish Civil War was becoming, for adherents of both sides, the fulcrum of the struggle between fascism and communism. Between 1936 and 1938 Dahlem was in charge of the Central Political Commission of the International Brigades in Spain. In 1938/39 he took over as leader of the Central Committee secretariat of the German Communist Party in its Paris exile, in succession to Walter Ulbricht whose by this time, when not in Spain, was spending most of his time not in Paris but in Moscow. Dahlem took the lead in preparing for and running the German Communist Party conference in Bern, which took place in February 1939, just over half a year before the launch of a more generalised war across Europe. =More war= The German army invaded Poland and the French government responded immediately by declaring war on Germany in September 1939. For most people in Paris it would be another eight months before the fighting fully impacted daily life, but refugees from race based and political persecution in Nazi Germany were affected sooner than most. In September 1939 Franz Dahlem was one of thousands who were arrested. He was placed in the concentration camp at Le Vernet in the southwest of the country. He immediately communicated to the French Prime Minister, Édouard Daladier, offering the services of the German Communists to the French army and calling for close cooperation against the Nazis, but the offer was countermanded by the party leadership in Moscow. Meanwhile, Käthe, who had accompanied her husband in Paris, relocated to Toulouse where, living illegally under the false name \\"Cathérine Dallerey\\", she acted as treasurer for the local branch of the German Communist branch in exile between 1940 and 1944. It is known that she had contacts with the French Communist Party in the area and that she was in touch with party comrades interned at Le Vernet. In 1941, while still at Le Vernet, Franz Dahlen took Soviet citizenship. During the first part of 1941 a large group of German Communist veterans of the Spanish Civil War were liberated by members of the French Resistance from the camp at Le Vernet, where security was poor. Dahlem was not one of those freed in this break-out, however, and the Gestapo ordered the local government to hand him over immediately. In October 1941 he was one of approximately twenty German prisoners removed to a secret prison at Castres by the SS and handed over to the Gestapo. He was transferred to Berlin in August 1942, and spent the next eight months in the Gestapo headquarters bunker there. After this he was transferred to the concentration camp at Mauthausen. According to one source he survived his internment at Mauthausen only because of the solidarity shown to him by fellow veterans of the Civil War in Spain. Because of his Comintern involvement and his participation in the Spanish Civil War Dahlen had a high profile internationally at this time. In Great Britain, early in 1942, a petition was signed by 350 people including 98 members of the House of Commons and 40 members of the House of Lords, calling for the release of Franz Dahlen, Luigi Longo and other opponents of the Nazi regime imprisoned at Castres.Jonny Granzow: Der Ausbruch der Spanienkämpfer aus dem Geheimgefängnis: Eine historische Reportage. edition bodoni, 2012, , p. 62 =Soviet occupation zone= The Red army liberated Dahlem from Mauthausen on 7 May 1945, and he was taken to Moscow. Here he awaited the call from the German Communist Party which came through on 11 June. He arrived back in Germany on 1 July 1945 with Wilhelm Pieck, returning to the region surrounding Berlin which, until October 1949, was administered as the Soviet occupation zone. Between 1945 and 1953 he played a key role in creating the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), a separated Soviet sponsored German state with its political, economic and social institutions modeled on those of the Soviet Union itself. The soviet- styled one-party government was achieved through the creation of the Socialist Unity Party (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands / SED) which was formally launched in April 1946 as the product of a contentious merger, within the Soviet zone, of the two leftwing-labour parties, the Communist Party and the centre-left Social Democratic Party. By the time the new state was launched, formally in October 1949, the former Social Democrats had been removed from positions of influence and the SED (party) had become a Soviet inspired communist party by another name. Unlike the Nazi regime which had ended in 1945, the new state would achieve one-party government not by banning alternative political parties but by controlling them, using a Bloc Party structure, the notorious \\"single-list\\" voting system, and predetermined fixed quotas of seats in the legislature occupied by approved representatives of their parties. Dahlem played at leading role in the creation of the new party, and the establishment of the Bloc Party structure Between 1946 and 1953 he served as a member of the SED party executive and its powerful Central Committee. He was also leader of the new party's \\"West Commission\\": it is believed in some quarters that the Soviets had originally intended to impose the political structure created in the Soviet occupation zone across the three western occupation zones. This never happened, but his leadership of the West Commission made Dahlem the de facto leader of the Communist Party in what would become, in May 1949, the German Federal Republic (West Germany). His work gave him an extensive network of contacts within the party, and his widespread popularity led to talk of a rivalry with Walter Ulbricht, the Party Central Committee General Secretary (after 1953 \\"First Secretary\\"). =German Democratic Republic= Stalin died in March 1953, which was followed by a power struggle in Moscow which resonated powerfully in East Berlin. In both capitals there was talk of a lessening of the \\"hardline Stalinism\\" of recent years, while harsh treatment of the civil population and the perception of a growing disparity between austerity levels in East and West Germany led to the East German uprising of June 1953. The uprising was suppressed with the help of Soviet troops, and was followed by a period of heightened nervousness within the party leadership which in turn proved the trigger for a purge from the party leadership of senior party officers seen as possible threats to the power base of Walter Ulbricht. Back in 1950 Dahlem had already attracted the attention of the \\"Central Party Control Commission\\" (\\"Zentrale Parteikontrollkommission\\" / ZPKK) in the context of the Paul Merker affair. (Paul Merker was another popular figure in the upper echelons of the party who had posed a threat to Ulbricht's power base.) The ZPKK had shown a particular interest Dahlem's contacts with the (by now increasingly mistrusted) Soviet spy, Noel Field, whom Dahlem had helped to obtain a Czechoslovak residency permit back in 1949. Barely two months after Stalin's death, in December 1952 Dahlem received a powerful rebuke from the party for \\"kaderpolitischer Fehler\\" (loosely: cadre political errors). A renewal of party interest in Noel Field may have been triggered by the Slánský show trial in Prague at the end of 1952. Half a year later, on 15 May 1953, the Party Central Committee stripped Dahlem of all his functions, citing \\"political blindness in respect of the activities of imperialist agents\\" (which seems to have been another reference to Noel Field). There was fevered talk of a Zionist conspiracy and Ulbricht pressed Moscow to give the go ahead to set up a show trial for Franz Dahlem along with one for Paul Merker. Dahlem refused to co-operate in a process of self-criticism, and accordingly the ZPKK dug back into his past in some detail. , the head of the commission, was critical above all of the attitude Dahlem had displayed in Paris back in 1939, which seems to be a reference to his offer to the French government of military support on behalf of the German communists in French exile. His wife spoke up in his defence, in June 1953 accusing Hermann Matern of lying. In the end Dahlem was spared a show trial, which one source attributes to the lessening of political savagery sometimes characterised as the Khrushchev Thaw, though Ulbricht nevertheless had his way in respect of Paul Merker whose show trial took place on 29/30 March 1955 and ended with the pronouncement of an eight-year prison sentence. In the end Merker was released and rehabilitated in 1957. Dahlem's return to grace began in 1955, though he was never again powerful enough to be seen as a threat to Walter Ulbricht. In 1955 he was given a junior post in the department for higher education, and a couple of years later he was promoted to the rank of a junior minister in the department. His formal rehabilitation took place in July 1956. January 1957 saw him co-opted back into the Party Central Committee. In 1957 he also became a member of the influential National Research Council. Under the Soviet style East German Constitution, power in the country resided unambiguously with the ruling party: the power of the National Parliament (Volksammer) was correspondingly subordinated. The stark inferiority of the parliament was in some respects obscured because senior members of the Party Central Committee also sat as members of the Volkskammer. Franz Dahlem was a member of the Volkskammer (and of the People's Congress which was its precursor) from its inauguration in 1947 till his exclusion in 1953. He formally handed in his mandate on 3 February 1954. He returned to the Volkskammer in 1963, now remaining a member of it till 1976.

He ran in the legislative elections of 2001 and won a seat in the Legislative Yuan. Liao was the Taiwan Solidarity Union's caucus whip throughout most of his time in office. His expulsion from the TSU, announced in October 2007 and confirmed in November, for refusing to support the party's policies, led four other party members to defect. Shortly after Liao's expulsion the TSU ran ads in the United Daily News suggesting that Liao should join the Democratic Progressive Party. Later that month, Liao and a couple other defectors launched reelection bids under the DPP banner. A group of women's rights organizations opposed Liao's candidacy, and his 2008 campaign was unsuccessful. Though he was reported to be leading the race six days before polls opened, Liao lost to Huang Chih-hsiung by 5.49% of votes. Liao stood for election again in 2012, but did not win. He was elected to the New Taipei City Council in 2014. Controversy In 2010, the Taipei District Court found Liao not guilty of taking bribes from the Taiwan Dental Association. In September 2011, the Taiwan High Court heard an appeal of the case and sentenced him to seven years and three months imprisonment, as well as a suspension of civil rights for three years.

Career  Carpezat was the son of lemonade makers Claude François Carpezat and Jacqueline Caniou. After considering a career in the fine and decorative arts (e.g., Sabre d'honneur designed with Henry Hayez, 1857; the sculpture Enfants sur un bouc, Trouville, 1866), Carpezat studied with the famous scenic designer Charles-Antoine Cambon, whose speciality in architecture sets he inherited. In 1875, Carpezat set up a professional association with fellow scenographer (Joseph-)Antoine Lavastre in order to take over Cambon's workshop at the latter's death. Together, Carpezat and Lavastre would design some of the defining Parisian productions – or parts thereof, as was customary – of the late 1870s and early 1880s: the world premieres of Delibes' Lakmé (1883), Gounod's Polyeucte (1878) and Le tribut de Zamora (1881), Massenet's Le Roi de Lahore (1877), Saint-Saëns' Henri VIII (1883), Verdi's Aida (Opéra premiere, 1880), and Verne's Michel Strogoff (theatrical adaptation, 1880). The duo also designed a number of revival productions for the Parisian Opéra the scenery of which had perished in the fire of the Salle Le Peletier (1873) – examples include Meyerbeer's Robert le Diable (1876), L'Africaine (1877) and Le prophète (1883). Also by Carpezat and Lavastre l'aîné were the interior decorations of the Opera-Comique's second Salle Favart (1879). Upon Lavastre's death, in 1883, Carpezat briefly joined hands with Lavastre's younger brother, Jean-Baptiste, to design the premieres of a.o. Bruneau's Le rêve (1891), Massenet's Esclarmonde (1889) and Le mage (1891), and Saint-Saëns' Ascanio (1890). Carpezat worked independently from Lavastre's death (1891) onwards. Named the latter's successor as the Opéra's chef du service des décorations, Carpezat contributed to an immense number of stagings at the Palais Garnier: Gluck's Armide (revival, 1905), Gounod's Sapho (new production, 1884) and Faust (complete redesign, 1908), Leroux' Astarté (premiere, 1901), Massenet's Le Cid (world premiere, 1885) and Thaïs (world premiere, 1894), Rameau's Hippolyte et Aricie (modern premiere, 1908), Reyer's Salammbô (Parisian premiere, 1892), Rossini's Guillaume Tell (new production, 1899), Saint-Saëns' Samson et Dalila (Parisian premiere, 1892) and Henri VIII (new production, 1909), Verdi's Otello (Parisian premiere, 1894), and Wagner's Die Walküre (Parisian premiere, as La Valkyrie, 1893), Tannhäuser (new production, 1895) and Götterdämmerung (Opéra premiere, as Le crépuscule des dieux, 1908). In addition, Carpezat became a household name at the Comédie- Française (Sardou's Thermidor, 1891), Théâtre du Châtelet, Gaîté (Massenet's Hérodiade, 1903), Opéra-Comique (Delibes' Lakmé, 1898; Gounod's Mireille, 1901; Lalo's Le Roi d'Ys, 1888; Massenet's Manon, 1884 and 1898, Cendrillon, 1899 and Werther, 1903), Théâtre des Nations, Porte Saint-Martin (Sardou's Fédora, 1882 and Théodora, 1884, both starring Sarah Bernhardt; Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac, 1897), and Variétés. Carpezat also accepted commissions abroad, for instance from Madrid's Zarzuela and Belém's Theatro da Paz. Carpezat received a diplôme d'honneur at the Exposition Universelle of 1878. He was awarded a grand prix and named Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur at the Exposition Universelle of 1889. He sat in the commission organizing the conference L'art théâtral at the Exposition Universelle of 1900. Numerous scenic designers of note were taught by Carpezat at his workshop at 50 Boulevard de la Villette: Ambroise Belluot, Léon Bouchet, François Carpezat (his son and successor), Demoget, Albert Dubosq, Oleguer Junyent i Sans, Lucien Jusseaume, Olivier Maréchal, Mouveau, Eugène Martial Simas and Victor Lamorte. Carpezat died at the age of 79, reportedly \\"aged, sad and discouraged due to no longer having any commissions from the larger theatres\\".Adrien Bernheim, ‘Un grand décorateur’, Le Figaro, 4 March 1912. He was interred in his family tomb at Montparnasse Cemetery.  Style  Carpezat's set for Hugo's Les Burgraves (1902), Act III. Photograph by Henri Mairet in Le théâtre. As Le Gaulois wrote in 1912, Carpezat “faisait de la peinture qui avait de la tendance à l’impressionnisme ; il procédait par larges coups de brosses, à grands traits ...”Tout-Paris, ‘Les peintres décorateurs de théâtres : à propos de la mort de M. Carpezat’, Le Gaulois, 29 February 1912. Posterity has been less kind to the man and, by extension, the last generation of Parisian romantic scenographers. In 1975, Donald Oenslager noted that, > In practicing their craft, they [Carpezat and contemporary scenic artists] > carried on the established formulas and procedures of earlier ateliers. But > they became powerful leaders who, perhaps without realizing it, initiated > the industrialization of the scenic artists’ profession. The traditional > old-time atelier became a business house. … With the growing pressures of > expansion, something had gone out of the individual scenic artist such as > Carpezat. He had lost himself in imitating former innovations, and in his > expanding workshop, while satisfying the demand for popular illusionist > techniques, he fell into the trap of scenic cliché and pictorial > pastiche.Donald Oenslager, Stage Design: Four Centuries of Scenic Invention > (New York, NY: Viking Press, 1975), 180. While Carpezat continued older traditions and techniques that he and his predecessors had been accumulating since the pioneering works of Pierre-Luc- Charles Ciceri – who had taught Carpezat's own master, Cambon – he made an idiosyncratic contribution to the art of scenic painting. For instance, while Cambon had mainly used greyish tones, Carpezat painted his scenery in crisp, luminous colors that benefited from electric lighting and catered to the taste of the Belle Époque, and more particularly to contemporary vogues such as the art nouveau (think of Alphonse Mucha), period furniture, and Beaux-Arts architecture. In addition, Carpezat was second to none in conjuring up the illusion of solid, protruding volumes from painted flats. Less interested in depicting historicist ornaments than his colleagues (e.g., Amable), he sought to amplify the dramatic potential of each setting by focusing on perspective as a carrier of dramatic appeal. Quite significant in this respect are the changing proportional relationships between actor and painted surroundings Carpeza applied throughout his oeuvre.  Preserved works  Carpezat's preserved stage curtain of the Theatro da Paz in Belém (Brazil), 1889. Because Carpezat worked mainly on an independent, commercial basis, relatively few of his original set designs and scale-models have come down to us. For instance, all maquettes by Carpezat for the Théâtre de l'Opéra are preserved at the Bibliothèque-Musée de l'Opéra; by contrast, virtually no materials testify to Carpezat's rich activity at other venues in and outside France. Still, numerous photographs of Carpezat's works are available in illustrated periodicals such as Le théâtre, L'Art du théâtre, and Comœdia illustré, while a large-scale artifact of Carpezat's oeuvre survives in the guise of a painted act drop at the Theatro da Paz in Belém.

Produced by keyboardist Jordan Fish and vocalist Oliver Sykes, it was featured as the opening track on the band's 2015 fifth studio album That's the Spirit. Although it was not released as a single, the song reached number 87 on the UK Singles Chart and number four on the UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart. Composition and lyrics \\"Doomed\\" was the first song written for That's the Spirit, although it was the last to be completed. Speaking to Loudwire, vocalist Oliver Sykes stated that he found it difficult to write the vocals for the track due to its slow pace and \\"stoner rock vibe\\", which he claimed made it \\"the most different song\\" the band had ever written up to that point. The main hook, \\"I think we're doomed\\", is sung in soft falsetto to produce a feeling of contrast with the negative tone of the lyric. This juxtaposition is also reflected in the differing styles of the song's sections, with the verses being \\"real claustrophobic and kinda stressful and hectic\\" and the choruses being \\"big, spacious, loose, open and relaxed\\", according to keyboardist Jordan Fish. Sykes expanded on the idea of contrast in the song, which he revealed was originally intended to reflect different stages of the experience of using recreational drugs. Lyrically, \\"Doomed\\" represents the main theme of the album of \\"finding light out of the dark and the contrast between the two\\", as well as the concept of nihilism. Elaborating on this in a track-by-track commentary for Spotify, Sykes revealed that the song is \\"about how most of the time my life feels like this unmanageable monster that I can't keep at bay\\", with the first half representing the \\"self-destructive, nihilistic side\\" of him and the second outlining him \\"getting a second chance\\". It was always intended to be the first song on the album, in order to portray to listeners the change in style from the band's previous releases. TeamRock's Eleanor Goodman claimed that the song \\"sets the tone for the rest of the album, with sweeping dynamics framing lyrics about death and darkness\\", as well as proposing that the line \\"So come rain on my parade\\" related to the umbrella artwork used in promotional campaigns for the record. In a Reddit AMA (\\"Ask Me Anything\\"), keyboardist Jordan Fish revealed that \\"Doomed\\" was his favourite song on That's the Spirit. Promotion and release The first preview of \\"Doomed\\" was released on 28 August 2015 in the form of a 30-second teaser trailer, alongside another for the song \\"Follow You\\". It was featured as the opening track on the band's fifth studio album That's the Spirit, released on 11 September 2015, and was performed as the opening song on the majority of shows on the album's promotional tour. On 22 April 2016, \\"Doomed\\" was performed as the opening song of the band's set at the Royal Albert Hall with the Parallax Orchestra. Thomas Doyle of Rock Sound dubbed the performance \\"a swooning, enveloping rendition\\", claiming that it set high expectations for the set. Gigwise's Amy Maxwell praised it as \\"an exceptional way to open the show\\". A live video of the song's Royal Albert Hall performance was released in promotion of the album on 24 October 2016. Critical reception Media response to \\"Doomed\\" was generally positive. Gigwise's Amy Gravelle hailed the song as \\"an epic introduction to the album\\", praising the presence of synthesizers as well as Sykes's vocal delivery. Tom Bryant of Alternative Press also praised the song's vocals, writing that \\"The ambient, dubby squelches of \\"Doomed\\" create nervous tension ... Then, quite from nowhere, [Sykes] finds a gorgeous melody, hitting a sweet-spot falsetto that tingles the spine\\". Rock Sound writer Andy Biddulph identified the album's \\"delicate opener\\" as evidence that the band were \\"bursting with fresh ideas and executing them to perfection\\". Many commentators saw \\"Doomed\\" as one of the biggest departures from Bring Me the Horizon's previous work. Biddulph described the song as \\"unlike anything [the band] have attempted before\\", while DIY magazine's Sarah Jamieson claimed that, in addition to \\"Follow You\\", it sees the band \\"stepping further out of their comfort zone than ever before\\". On the other hand, Gravelle claimed that \\"Doomed\\" was the song on That's the Spirit which was most similar to the material on 2013's Sempiternal. Commercial performance Following the release of That's the Spirit, \\"Doomed\\" entered the UK Singles Chart at number 87, the highest position of the seven non-single tracks from the album to chart. In the same week, the song also entered the UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart at number 4, surpassed only by the three singles previously released from That's the Spirit – \\"Throne\\", \\"Happy Song\\" and \\"Drown\\". \\"Doomed\\" remained in the top 40 until almost the end of the year. In the United States, it peaked at number 41 on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart.

May the Red Rose Live Alway is a song written and composed by Stephen Foster in 1850. This song is written in the style of a parlor ballad – a genre of popular song at the time intended to be performed at a slow tempo and to communicate a sentimental quality. Description Stephen Foster's \\"Ah! May the Red Rose Live Alway!\\" is different from Foster's minstrel songs of the same period. This song is an example of a parlor ballad. This ballad may have roots in the Anglo-Scots-Irish song tradition. Foster's \\"Ah! May the Red Rose Live Alway!\\" is similar to Irish musician Thomas Moore's \\"The Last Rose of Summer\\". Ah May the Red Rose Live Alway The song begins with a piano introduction. The first vocal line of \\"Ah! May the Red Rose Live Alway!\\" begins on a high note that is held with a fermata. Music historians have postulated that this may give the setting an image of stalling the passage of time. Foster has placed additional fermatas throughout the song, possibly with similar effects in mind. Also of interest is Foster's use of the marking ad lib in several places in the song. This flexibility allotted to the singer is atypical from Foster's usual preference of precise, literally exact note for note, interpretations. Thus, the ad lib designation was scarcely used by Foster and can, in fact, be found in only two of the composer's previous songs: \\"Mary Loves the Flowers\\" (1850) and \\"Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair\\" (1854). Foster may have anticipated that the publication of his parlor songs helped to improve his notoriety, but the ballads did not generate the hoped- for income when compared to his minstrel songs. Foster recorded that \\"Ah! May the Red Rose Live Alway!\\" had earned $8.12 in royalties over a seven-year period in his ledger. As a result, Foster concentrated more on minstrel songs, which returned ten times more than parlor songs. Foster did return to writing parlor songs in 1860, most notably \\"Beautiful Dreamer,\\" published in 1864 just after the composer's death. Lyrics Ah! may the red rose live alway, To smile upon earth and sky! Why should the beautiful ever weep? Why should the beautiful die? Lending a charm to every ray That falls on her cheeks of light, Giving the zephyr kiss for kiss, And nursing the dew-drop bright -- Ah! may the red rose live alway, To smile upon earth and sky! Why should the beautiful ever weep? Why should the beautiful die?'' Long may the daisies dance the field, Frolicking far and near! Why should the innocent hide their heads? Why should the innocent fear? Spreading their petals in mute delight When morn in its radiance breaks, Keeping a floral festival Till the night-loving primrose wakes -- Spreading their petals in mute delight When morn in its radiance breaks, Keeping a floral festival Till the night-loving primrose wakes. Lulled be the dirge in the cypress bough, That tells of departed flowers! Ah! that the butterfly's gilded wing Fluttered in evergreen bowers! Sad is my heart for the blighted plants -- Its pleasures are aye as brief -- They bloom at the young year's joyful call, And fade with the autumn leaf: Ah! may the red rose live alway, To smile upon earth and sky! Why should the beautiful ever weep? Why should the beautiful die?

A popular application is in beverage production, wherein the food grade chemical propylene glycol is used.  Cooling in Brewing and Other Applications  Glycol chillers are a specific kind of refrigeration system, often used to cool a variety of liquids, including alcohol and other beverages. Using a chiller allows producers to lower the temperature of the product dramatically over a short period of time, depending on the production needs. Propylene glycol plays a significant role in the application of a glycol chiller. For cooling in brewing, there are few processes where decreasing or maintaining temperature are important - like crash cooling a beer after fermentation, or keeping a steady temperature during fermentation (which generates heat), or cooling the wort after an initial boiling process.The Brewers Association's Guide to Starting Your Own Brewery by Dick Kentwell  Glycol chillers in operation  A chiller is essentially a refrigerator that includes a compressor, evaporator, condenser and a metering device. An additional buffer tank is used with the chilling unit to provide additional system capacity to prevent excessive cycling, unexpected temperature fluctuations, and erratic system operation. Propylene glycol, a food-grade antifreeze, is typically used when consumable products are involved. Before using glycol in the brewing process, check that propylene glycol is of USP grade to ensure it is recommended for food use.

The CSE was withdrawn at the same time as the GCE Ordinary Level exam. History The GCE exam had been introduced in 1951. The Beloe Committee met from 1958-60. Rev Robert Beloe CBE was the Chief Education Officer of Surrey from 1940-59, beginning when only 35. He had created the system of grammar schools in Surrey in the late 1940s. He had created many bilateral schools in Surrey in the 1950s, which were effectively comprehensive schools; this was to reduce the cost of building brand new grammar schools, and made the implementation of the comprehensive system in Surrey, in the 1970s, more straightforward than other local education authorities. He was appointed CBE in the 1960 New Year Honours. The report was published in July 1960 by a committee of the Secondary Schools Examinations Council - the Committee on Secondary School Examinations other than the G.C.E., appointed in July 1958.Times January 4, 1961, page 4 Robert Beloe died on 26 April 1984.Times Obituary 30 April 1984, page 14 The report was overseen by the Ministry of Education. At the time, many of those at secondary schools left at age 15 - currently Year Ten. It would not be until 1973 that the school leaving age rose to 16, now known as Year Eleven. The CSE would be mainly, though not exclusively, aimed at people at secondary modern schools, or the early comprehensive schools. The new CSE exam would give secondary modern schools an incentive to have fifth forms - for those who voluntarily wanted to stay at school beyond the school leaving age; this would help prove that education futures were not always narrowly defined by the eleven-plus exam. The report may have had direct consequences for the idea of comprehensive schools; before the CSE, there was no widely recognized exam for most people who had not gained a place at grammar school. =Contents= The report, with scope for education in secondary schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, recommended that a new examination be introduced with a different emphasis from that of the highly-academic GCE O level, which required rigorous knowledge of subjects. 20% of those at 16 took the GCE exam, and the CSE would cover the next 20%. The exam was to be a different kind of exam to the GCE, and not simply a watered-down GCE. The exam would be set mainly by teachers, sitting on 20 regional bodies. =Implementation of the GCSE= Although the GCSE, introduced in 1986 with first examinations in 1988, covered much, if not most, of the ground of the previous CSE, the GCSE has not adequately replaced the rigour of what the former O-level offered. The Beloe Report therefore would eventually lead the way largely to what became the GCSE. The 1978 Waddell Report had advocated a common examination, prepared by Sir James Waddell, which hoped that the new common exam would be first sat by 1985.

Early life  Waters grew up in Brynamman in the Aman Valley. His father was a coal miner who was made redundant and his mother was a hair dresser. He has stated he did not grow up in a political or \\"militant\\" family but remembered his father, who was supportive of a ballot rather than industrial action at the time, going on strike. He studied at Amman Valley Comprehensive School and while at school wrote a piece for Wales on Sunday about his fellow students asking whether they were planning on staying in their community. He found many were keen to leave. He has criticised those who told him at 15 that \\"if you want to get on, you have to get out\\".  Education  Waters grew up with an interest in current affairs and kept scrap books of newspapers. He was in a class of three studying politics in school, and later was the only student in the class. He went to study at University of Wales, Aberystwyth. He joined the Labour Party in 1994 upon starting his studies and went on to the University's Parliamentary Placement Scheme where he worked in Westminster. Upon graduating he took a year out to work for his local MP Alan Williams during the 1997 general election. This was followed by an internship in the United States House of Representatives as an ESU Capitol Hill Scholar for a summer.  Career  After graduating Waters received multiple job offers: from the PPS to the Secretary of State for Wales Nick Ainger, from Peter Hain MP, and from Ron Davies MP. He went on to work as the Political Secretary to Davies in August 1998 as part of the leadership campaign between him and Rhodri Morgan. Davies' campaign famously ended after his \\"moment of madness\\" in 1998. In 2001 Waters joined the ITV Wales political unit where he reported as a lobby correspondent and presented the weekly politics programme Waterfront, becoming chief political correspondent. He stated he moved out of the industry after he lost interest in learning short hand and did not see it as a job \\"for a grown up\\". He chaired the Governing body of the highly regarded Barry Island Primary School for over seven years. In 2007 he became Director of the green transport organisation, Sustrans Cymru. He was Vice- Chair of the successful 2011 Yes for Wales campaign, leading on communications for the campaign after being appointed to the cross-party steering committee by the First Minister. Waters joined sustainable cycling charity Sustrans Cymru in January 2007. He led a campaign involving his organisation Sustrans Cymru, the BMA, and the NAHT, who wrote a joint letter arguing for an independent commission to review whether the National Assembly for Wales was underfunded. This campaign formed the groundwork for the Holtham Commission. In 2013, he was appointed the director of the Welsh independent think-tank, the Institute of Welsh Affairs. Upon joining the organisation he found it to be \\"nearly bankrupt\\" with tired staff and three months of funding left, and described his time in the role as highly fundraising-orientated. He left the role in 2016 in order to campaign to become the Senedd Member for Llanelli, a race which he won with a majority of 382. In December 2018 he became Deputy Minister for Transport.https://twitter.com/WalesPolitics/status/1073255284666261504  Political views  = Transport = He vehemently opposed the M4 Relief Road which he viewed as failing to improve transport within Wales. He was critical of the decision taken by the UK Government under Theresa May to remove the tolls on the Severn crossings, stating it would \\"lead to six million more vehicles a year\\" on the roads, and that Westminster were \\"unleashing\\" extra traffic to try to incentivise the construction of the M4 Relief Road. He is instead involved in Government projects including the South Wales Metro and improving bus services which make up the majority of public transport ridership in Wales. = Foundational economy = Waters has been a proponent of the concept of the foundational economy. The concept was developed by the University of Manchester's Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change. Bowman and Froud et al describe the theory as focussing on health education and welfare, as well as \\"mundane activities like utilities, retail and food processing which produce necessary everyday goods and services which are used by everybody regardless of income or social status.\\" It \\"focuses on how the sheltered sectors of the economy can be reorganised in ways that generate welfare gains and diffuse prosperity\\" after years of UK policies which its authors state failed to create competition and markets and instead focussed on job creation and GDP growth alone. Waters support for alternative economic thinking has produced eye catching headlines, after his comments in June 2019 that stated the Government has \\"pretended we know what we're doing on the economy\\" for 20 years. His speech stated that \\"all the orthodox tools we can think of at growing the economy in the conventional way\\" have only produced static GDP over 20 years across the UK. Plaid Cymru stated the comments were \\"remarkable\\", while the Welsh Conservatives described them as \\"deeply concerning\\", however the First Minister Mark Drakeford defended Waters by saying he was right to reject the old ways of thinking especially as Wales faces \\"the global shifts of increased mechanisation, automation and of course, Brexit.\\"  Personal life  He has two children and resides in the Llanelli area References * External links *Profile at the National Assembly for Wales website *Llanelli Star - National Assembly campaign launch (archived version) Category:Wales AMs 2016–2021 Category:Living people Category:Labour Co-operative Members of Senedd Cymru – Welsh Parliament Category:1976 births Category:Welsh-speaking politicians ","title":"Lee Waters"},{"id":"50444157","title":"2nd Justice and Development Party Ordinary Congress"},{"id":"50444189","text":"Odites aethiopicus is a moth in the family Depressariidae.

The base was established on a ridgeline 4 km west of Da Nang Air Base. History HAWK missiles on Hill 327 in 1965 On 7 February 1965, following the Attack on Camp Holloway, US President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered retaliatory airstrikes against North Vietnam and the deployment of HAWK missiles to South Vietnam to defend against any attacks by the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF). The USMC 1st LAAM Battalion based on Okinawa was ordered to deploy to Da Nang. Arriving by C-130 on 8 April, by 9 April the HAWKs were operational at Da Nang AB. On 8 March 1965, the 9th Marine Regiment made an amphibious landing at Red Beach north of Da Nang while the 1st Battalion 3rd Marines landed at Da Nang AB marking the first deployment of US combat troops to South Vietnam. The 9th Marine Expeditionary Brigade (9th MEB) were tasked with defending Da Nang AB, while overall responsibility for defending the Da Nang area remained with the ARVN. In late March the 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines occupied the Hill 327 ridgeline and Battery B, 1st LAAM Battalion was moved to Hill 327 from the southwest of Da Nang AB. In July 1965 the Marines began construction of a 3rd Marine Division command post on the Hill 327 ridgeline, the main bunker was long and deep and capable of withstanding a direct hit from a 120mm mortar. During the Tet Offensive, together with other attacks on US and ARVN facilities in the Da Nang area, at 02:30 on 30 January the Vietcong launched a sapper attack on the 1st Marine Division subsector Bravo command post on Hill 200, 1km north of the main command post, killing 4 Marines and wounding 7. On 23 February 1969 as part of the Tet 1969 attacks, the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) launched sapper attacks on the northern slope of Hill 327 and on the 2nd Battalion 7th Marines position northwest of the Hill, both attacks were beaten back with 18 Marines killed and 80 wounded while the PAVN lost 75 killed or captured. In July 1969 the 1st LAAM Battalion ceased operations and redeployed to the US. On 18 March 1970 the 1st Marine Regiment moved its command post from Hill 55 to Camp Perdue. On 10 August the 1st Battalion 5th Marines assumed responsibility for the defense of Division Ridge. In September the 5th Marine Regiment moved its headquarters from Division Ridge to the area between Landing Zone Baldy and Firebase Ross. On 24 March 1971 the 2nd Battalion 1st Marines assumed responsibility for the defense of Division Ridge. In late April as part of the general drawdown of U.S. forces, the 23rd Infantry Division took over the Marines tactical area of responsibility and the 196th Infantry Brigade occupied the Marine positions on Division Ridge. The base remains in use by the PAVN as Trường Bắn 327, with a large military cemetery adjacent to it.

In May 2019 she joined the newly formed Brexit Party group in the Senedd. She later became independent again after disagreements with the party on its newly adopted anti-devolution policy. She joined the Independent Alliance for Reform group in October 2020.

She also said that she was a victim of misogyny claiming that she was once told to \\"shut up\\" at a meeting. UKIP Group Leader Gareth Bennett admitted that she was told this by a participant, but that \\"it had nothing to do with her gender\\". UKIP Wales Leader Neil Hamilton called on Jones to resign her regional list seat and allow another UKIP member to become an AM, which she refused to do. Party Leader Gerard Batten described her statement as \\"politically correct twaddle to disguise the fact that Mrs Jones is politically ineffective...\\" =Joins the Brexit Party= On 15 May 2019, Jones along with three other Assembly Members joined the Brexit Party. =Leaves Brexit Party to sit as an independent= On 18 August 2020, Jones released a statement stating that she had quit the Brexit Party's Welsh Parliament Group to sit as an Independent member due to its newly adopted anti-devolution stance. On 4 September she announced that she would stand in the 2021 Senedd election as an independent candidate for the Bridgend constituency. In mid October 2020 she formed a new group in the Senedd, the Independent Alliance for Reform, together with fellow MSs David Rowlands and Mandy Jones. Controversy In 2004, while working as a prison officer at HM Prison Parc, Jones opened a sexual discrimination case against the prison. It was alleged that a colleague of Jones had spread rumours that she had worked as a lap dancer prior to her employment at the prison and that a campaign of intimidation was set against her to force her out. Jones subsequently lost her case. In May 2018 it was revealed that Jones had failed to declare the employment of husband Alun Williams in her office on her register of interests. Jones described it as \\"an oversight\\" that would be corrected. In June 2018 Jones was taken to court by former UKIP Chief of Staff Robin Hunter- Clarke for the wrongful termination of his contract. The judge ruled that she could not grant interim relief because it was unclear who Mr Hunter-Clarke's employer was at the time of the sacking. Court proceedings are set to recommence in August 2018.

He is known for his early work on digital physics, originally coined by Kantor as information mechanics which described \\"previously thought dissimilar phenomena, such as the fine structure constant (on the scale of the very small) and cosmological red shift (on the scale of the very large)\\". Greg Bear cited Kantor's Information Mechanics as an inspiration for his 1990 novel Heads. A Reddit editor named delverofsecrets created an Internet hoax involving an apparently chance meeting of Kantor and hundreds of Reddit followers at 6½ Avenue in Manhattan on July 12, 2012; the crowd was eventually dispersed by the New York Police Department. Inventions In addition to his efforts in digital physics Kantor holds numerous patents. The later patents deal with several classes of inventions: Rotary Inertial Thermodynamics; dynamic transport of waste fluids in rivers; and a fiber-optic device for persons with macular degeneration. Another invention, never patented, was a File Content Signature utility that was used by electronic bulletin board operators to identify duplicates. X-ray Telescope However, the invention with potentially greatest impact at present is his earliest work on \\"Glancing- incidence radiation focusing device having a plurality of members with tension-polished reflecting surfaces.\\" This patent, available at Google patents clearly shows the concentric glancing incidence design for X-ray collection. Kantor's innovation, the use of surface tension to achieve a super-smooth reflecting surface is at the heart of the proposed NASA Lynx Observatory, which describes the same physical process as \\"grazing incidence.\\". Kantor's work, part of his doctoral project at Columbia University, was supported in part by government funding. It was done prior to the Bayh-Dole act, and Columbia did not seek any patent rights. Subsequent to his patents, designs for a NASA project were developed later by Lockheed Corporation, asserting government use rights to apply the invention. Whether the Lynx observatory will be implemented remains an open question. Death Kantor died May 15, 2020.

On 10 August 2018 he was elected the leader of UKIP in the Senedd. On 7 November 2019, he quit UKIP to become an independent politician. On 24 June 2020, he joined Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party.  Early life  Bennett was born in Cardiff on 1 December 1968. He was educated at Llandaff City Primary School and Radyr Comprehensive School. He studied sociology at Middlesex Polytechnic but left halfway through the course, returning to Cardiff to study journalism at the Cardiff Institute of Higher Education, which lead to a post with the Carmarthen Journal. Political career Bennett joined UKIP in 2014. He campaigned in the 2014 European election, and was agent for UKIP candidate Brian Morris in Cardiff West at the 2015 general election. When Bennett was selected to contest the South Wales Central electoral region, he was criticised for blaming rubbish problems in Cardiff on students and Eastern European immigrants and was nicknamed the 'Donald Trump of Wales'. This led to senior UKIP figures including leader Nigel Farage and immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe publicly distancing themselves from Bennett. A petition containing the names of 16 other UKIP Assembly candidates opposing Bennett's candidacy was presented to the party's National Executive Committee, which upheld his candidacy. He was elected to National Assembly for Wales as member for South Wales Central in 2016. In the UKIP Assembly group, Bennett backed Neil Hamilton for leader over Nathan Gill. After Hamilton became leader of the group, Bennett was appointed as UKIP Assembly spokesman for Local Government, Housing and Sport. In April 2017, Bennett was appointed as UKIP's Business Manager in the Assembly. In the same month, the Assembly's Equalities Committee, of which Bennett was a member, published a report about refugees. Bennett brought out his own report, in which he complained that the proposals would encourage more refugees to come to Wales. In December 2017, Bennett was banned from speaking in the Chamber of the Welsh Assembly for a year by Presiding Officer Elin Jones. The ban came after Bennett claimed that making the process to change legal gender easier would lead society to implode. Bennett refused to apologise or withdraw his remarks, and was barred. In January 2018, Bennett made a partial apology in which he stated that he would accept the authority of the Presiding Officer, and he was allowed to resume his speaking duties without withdrawing his previous remarks. In February 2018, Bennett led UKIP's opposition to plans to expand the Welsh Assembly's membership. Bennett claimed almost £10,000 in expenses to set up an office which never opened. In July 2018, it was announced that there would be a ballot of UKIP party members in Wales to decide the position of UKIP Leader in Wales. The three candidates who announced that they were running for the post were former Assembly Group Leader Neil Hamilton, who had just been ousted from the role; Caroline Jones, who had ousted him; and Gareth Bennett. Bennett's main policy planks included his campaign to abolish the Welsh Assembly, and his opposition to the Welsh Government's Welsh language policies. He won the UKIP Wales leadership election in August 2018, with 269 votes. In August 2018, Bennett was criticised by First Minister Carwyn Jones and other Assembly members for supporting Boris Johnson's remarks about the Muslim veil. On 3 June 2019, Bennett announced that he would be running in the 2019 UK Independence Party leadership election after Gerard Batten stood down as leader. Bennett has claimed that he would take UKIP forward with 'bold policy ideas', after Gerard Batten's one-year term came to an end. Bennett published his 2019 UKIP Leadership Election Manifesto on his website, which includes policies such as 'National ID Cards' ,'UKIP Party Democracy', 'National Volunteer Force', 'Regular Referenda', 'Freedom of Speech', 'Regulating Mosques', 'Scrap Foreign Aid' and 'Abolishing Politicians'. On 11 July, Bennett announced that he would withdraw his leadership bid in order to promote Ben Walker's campaign. On 7 November 2019, he quit UKIP to become an independent politician.

Foundation The Beberibe Cliffs Natural Monument was instituted on 3 June 2004 by Ceará governor Lúcio Alcântara. At the same ceremony he signed the decree creating the Mata Fresca Private Ecological Reserve. The natural monument, of major environmental and tourist interest, is visited by about 400 people per day. The decree turned it into a fully protected area so that only eco-tourism and research would be allowed, and that only with permission from the responsible agency. Local youth were to be employed as guides, and explanatory signs installed. Location The natural monument is in the municipality of Beberibe on the east coast of the state of Ceará, between the Morro Branco and Fontes beaches. It has an area of and a perimeter of . The objective of the reserve is to protect the cliffs against the environmental impacts that had occurred earlier. Other cliffs in the region are unprotected and are occupied by hotels and vacation houses. Cliffs The cliffs in the area run along the coast for about where the Barreiras tableland reaches the coast. They are formed of sand-clay sediments from the Tertiary or Quaternary ages, with fine to medium grains, and with colors ranging from white to yellow to red. They are evolving as the sea acts on their bases and wind and rain erodes their upper parts. They are cut by gullies formed by the main streams that flow down to the sea. One famous structure is the Gruta da Mãe D’água (Cave of the Water Mother) on the Fontes beach, outside the protected area. This has been created by wave action on the cliffs, and is much visited by people. It has been degraded by the visitors, and is at risk of collapse. Implementation of the protected area does not appear to have had a significant effect in slowing down degradation of the cliffs. It has therefore been proposed to implement a buffer zone, or to implement a larger Environmental Protection Area around the cliffs including the Morro Branco and Fontes beaches so as to better manage the site.

Description and history The Jackson House stands on the south side of Waldoboro Road (SR 32), just south of its junction with Maine State Route 126, in the village center of Jefferson. The property has shoreline on Damariscotta Lake to the south. It is a 3-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof and clapboard siding. It is oriented with its main facade facing west, with a 2-1/2 story gambreled ell extending to the east. The main facade is symmetrical, with five bays. The central bay is in a projecting element that has a gambrel dormer with a Palladian window, and a band of three sash windows above the main entrance. The entrance is sheltered by a projecting flat-roof portico, supported by groups of smooth Doric columns. A similar portico adorns the north side of the house, and the side elevations have Palladian windows in the third level. The house was built in 1903-05 for Dr. Fred W. Jackson, a Jefferson native who met with business and professional success in Providence, Rhode Island, and married into a wealthy family. The house was designed by Samuel Patch of Waltham, Massachusetts, and is the largest and most architecturally sophisticated residence in the rural community.

Life Kohn (also Kohne ; Cohne ; Coun ; Coni) was born in Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) and received his first musical instruction on the violin with his father and then later with a violinist called Zachow. In 1750, Kohn moved to Berlin where he was employed as a violinist in the Hofkapelle of Karl Friedrich, Margrave of Brandenburg- Schwedt. During this time, he studied composition with Christoph Schaffrath, harpsichordist and chamber musician of Princess Anna Amalia of Prussia. In 1760, he joined the royal Hofkapelle in Berlin where he remained until his retirement in 1798. He died a few years later in 1801 or 1802. Kohn's surviving works, most featuring violin, demonstrate his considerable skill on that instrument. His compositional style is highly representative of that which prevailed in Berlin during the second half of the 18th century featuring elements of the Empfindsamer Stil and the galante style. In his Sonatas for violin, Kohn makes use of a surprising range of expressive techniques including the use of a mute, pizzicato, detailed dynamic and articulation marks, and very specific tempo indications. It also seems that Kohn was employed in Berlin as a music copyist. His handwriting can be seen in a number of manuscripts of works by Johann Gottlieb Janitsch, Johann Gottlieb Graun, Francesco Geminiani, Jiří Antonín Benda and Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach held in the archive of the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin. Remarkably, his manuscripts of works by Jean-Marie Leclair, C.P.E. Bach and Graun have also been found in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.

In this, the ship is intended to replace a pair of existing vessels, and . The vessel is named after broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough. Background In 2014, the UK Government announced funding for the construction of a new polar research vessel for the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) to replace a pair of existing ships. This new ship was intended not only to be fully equipped with the latest instrumentation for the purposes of carrying out research in polar regions, for which it would have an improved icebreaking capability and greater endurance over the existing polar research vessel, but also to serve as a logistic support vessel for BAS teams in inshore locations. BAS contracted Houlder Ltd to undertake the basic design in which suggestions for the final configuration of the new ship were taken. Following the consultation period, in 2015, Rolls-Royce Holdings was selected to execute the detailed design and Cammell Laird in Birkenhead was selected as the preferred bidder to construct the ship. The ship cost £200m. General characteristics The ship is about long, with a beam of about . The draught is about with a planned cruising speed of with a range of at that speed. She is capable of carrying a helicopter and has a capacity for approximately of cargo. Accommodation is provided for 30 crew and 60 research staff. Sir David Attenborough has a twin- shaft hybrid diesel-electric propulsion system.

The power plant, which can run with different configurations depending on the mission and operating conditions, produces electricity to power four asynchronous electric motors driving two 5-bladed controllable pitch propeller. This gives Sir David Attenborough a maximum speed of in open water and ability to break up to thick level ice at a speed of . At an economical cruising speed of , she has an operating range of . For manoeuvring and dynamic positioning, the vessel has four Tees White Gill thrusters with Teignbridge Propellers 60 inch 4 blade Rotor’s, two in the bow and two in the stern. The vessel has been strengthened according to the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) Unified Requirements for Polar Class Ships. Her ice class, Polar Class 4, is intended for year-round operation in thick first-year ice which may include old ice inclusions. However, her propulsion system is only rated for Polar Class 5 which is intended for medium first-year ice.Unified Requirements for Polar Class ships . International Association of Classification Societies (IACS), April 2016. Construction The hull of RRS Sir David Attenborough just before her launch The first steel for the construction of the ship was cut in July 2016. The keel laying ceremony for the ship, yard number 1390, took place on 17 October 2016. The ship was constructed by combining individually fabricated blocks, much like the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers. The majority of the blocks were manufactured by Cammell Laird at Birkenhead, but due to a tight schedule, the stern of the ship (named 'Block 10') was fabricated at the A&P; Group on the River Tyne. The section was transported to Merseyside on a barge in August 2017. The stern section was loaded onto the barge by heavy lifting company ALE, using self-propelled modular trailers (SPMT). The same procedure in reverse was then used to get the hull segment on to the slipway at Birkenhead. The hull of Sir David Attenborough was named by her namesake and launched on 14 July 2018. She was moved into a wet dock for the addition of her superstructure and fitting out. The ship was originally scheduled to be completed by October 2018. The official naming ceremony took place on 26 September 2019. A bottle of champagne was smashed across the ship's bow by Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge at Cammell Laird's shipyard in Birkenhead. Sir David Attenborough was present at the ceremony. Poet Laureate Simon Armitage wrote a poem \\"Ark\\" to celebrate the naming ceremony. Attenborough was also present at commissioning, stating \\"This astonishing ship... will find the science with which to deal with the problems that are facing the world today and will increasingly do so tomorrow.\\" Service Sir David Attenborough was originally planned to enter service in late 2020, but in January 2020 Sky News reported that her delivery was at risk of delay, and that BAS planned to keep James Ross Clark in service for another year past her intended retirement. In August, Sir David Attenborough made a brief trip to the Liverpool Cruise Terminal before returning to Cammell Laird for final fitting out ahead of sea trials scheduled for late in the year. Sir David Attenborough began her sea trials on 21 October 2020. She is scheduled to make her maiden voyage to Antartica in late 2021. Naming poll In March 2016, the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) announced that members of the public were being asked to suggest names for the ship. Names previously used would not be eligible, but otherwise it was open to suggestions. The NERC stated that they would have the final say, and that the most popular name in the poll would not necessarily be the one used. Former BBC Radio Jersey presenter James Hand jokingly suggested RRS \\"Boaty McBoatface\\". This quickly became the most popular choice and was the runaway winner when the poll closed, with 124,109 votes. The name has been described as a homage to \\"Hooty McOwlface\\", an owl named through an \\"Adopt-A-Bird\\" program in 2012 that became popular on the internet. On 6 May 2016, British science minister Jo Johnson announced that the choice had been made to name the ship after naturalist Sir David Attenborough, but that Boaty McBoatface would be the name of one of David Attenborough remotely controlled submersibles. A petition calling for Sir David Attenborough to change his name to Sir Boaty McBoatface \\"in the interest of democracy and humour\\" soon received over 3,800 signatures. In response to the poll, the Science and Technology Committee, a select committee of the House of Lords, announced that they were to review the process by which the ship was named. NERC chief executive Professor Duncan Wingham and NERC head of communications Julia Maddock faced the committee on 10 May. Professor James Wilsdon, an outreach director at Sheffield University, told MPs that he voted for Boaty McBoatface. Despite the controversy, NERC directors felt that their poll was a successful initiative in that it generated a lot of publicity regarding their organisation and research mission among the lay public. Other leading choices in the poll were Poppy-Mai, in honour of a toddler with incurable cancer, and Henry Worsley, for a British army officer who died in 2016 while attempting to complete the first solo and unaided crossing of the Antarctic. Spanish internet trolls promoted the choice Blas de Lezo, a Spanish admiral who gave a humiliating defeat to the British Royal Navy in 1741. The organisers removed the option, which gathered more than 38,000 votes. =Influence on popular culture= Trainy McTrainface at Gothenburg Central Station in 2019 On 12 May 2016, Google released a natural language parser named Parsey McParseface in reference to the boat naming contest, as part of their open-source SyntaxNet neural network framework. On 22 March 2016 the 0729 South West Trains Portsmouth to Waterloo service was playfully named Trainy McTrainface, and in July 2017 the same name was chosen in an online poll for a new train on the Stockholm-Gothenburg line. In May 2017, the Hunstanton Sea Life Sanctuary in the UK announced that the first Humboldt penguin chick to hatch in more than a decade had been named Fluffy McFluffyface by the sanctuary staff. In November 2017, Sydney Ferries allowed the public to name its fleet of Emerald-class ferries for use in Sydney Harbour, Australia through a naming competition. The most popular name was Boaty McBoatface but, as it had already been taken, New South Wales Transport Minister picked Ferry McFerryface out of his personal preference instead. After the Maritime Union of Australia refused to crew the vessel in protest at the name, it entered service named Emerald 6 with a Ferry McFerryface sticker below the bridge, and in January 2018, following revelations that the name wasn't a public vote winner but selected by the minister, it was renamed May Gibbs.Ferry McFerryface wasn't public pick for new ferry name until Andrew Constance's captain's pick Daily Telegraph 30 January 2018 References Category:David Attenborough Category:Icebreakers of the United Kingdom Category:Research vessels of the United Kingdom Category:British Antarctic Survey Category:2018 ships Category:Ships built in Merseyside ","title":"RRS Sir David Attenborough"},{"id":"50444780","text":"Acacia semitrullata is a shrub of the genus Acacia and the subgenus Phyllodineae that is endemic to south western Australia.

In Canada, it is presently known only from dunes along the shore of Lake Huron in Lambton County, Ontario. In the United States, it is known from Carolina Beach State Park, New Hanover County, North Carolina. It is expected that the species occurs in suitable habitats up and down the Atlantic seaboard. The forewings are glossy gunmetal gray (brick red in specimens from the Atlantic coast) with numerous black scales, the costal and posterior margins red. The darker gray antemedial and postmedial lines are evenly concave from the costa to vein CuA2, where both lines turn slightly toward the outer margin. The subterminal line is slightly lighter gray than the ground color, scalloped between the veins below vein M3. Between veins M3 and R5, the line is evenly convex, terminating closest to outer margin on vein R5 and then bending inward toward the costa. Black scales occur along the anterior margin of the subterminal line, forming a distinct black spot in cell M5. These black scales gradually fade between vein M5 and the costa and below vein M1. The outer margin has a series of black dots between the veins and the orbicular and reniform (kidney- shaped) spots are poorly demarcated by thin gray lines.

He is a former member of Quasar and Fastway.  Life and career  Steve Clarke was born in Twickenham on 20 November 1959 to parents Eric and Sally Clarke. Steve started playing drums aged four under tuition from his uncle, Jeff Whetstone and father Eric Clarke. Subsequently, he joined the Boys' Brigade where he developed his rudimentary and marching techniques. Aged 21, Steve worked as a tech for drummer Billy Cobham. He organised and played in an improvised gig at the Hamborough Tavern in Southall, with guitarists Steve Topping, Richard Chapman and bass guitarist Nick Stephens. The cassette recording of the jam was released on CD retrospectively (18 years later) in 1999 under the name Volume 33 Riot at The Hanborough Tavern. From 1979-1980 Clarke had a brief stint in the progressive rock band Quasar alongside guitarist John Clark, who left to join Bruford. Also in the 80's, Steve worked closely with Jeff Pain a.k.a. 'Dicken' from UK band Mr Big, recording a number of songs which would not see the light of day for a few years to come. Steve also recorded drums on the album 'Rainbow Bridge'. = Network = In 1986 Steve formed the group 'Network' with guitarist Tim Crowther keyboard player Pete Jacobsen bassists Paul Rogers and Laurence Cottle and trumpet player Ted Emmett, augmented by the likes of Steve Topping, David Cross from King Crimson and Hugh Hopper of Soft Machine. The band would go on to make four albums and a best of compilation entitled \\"View From The Bar\\". The album Corroded Path, recorded in 1989 was described by Bradley Smith in the Billboard Guide To Progressive Music as follows: \\"Corroded Path is a minor treasure of UK fusion, directly picking up where groups like Brand X and Bruford left off. Eight tracks follow the friendlier and melodic paths of fusion, with a swinging smoothness that isn't earth shattering but is easy to like. The accent here is on concise, jazzy arrangements, with Crowther's restrained guitar soloing recalling some of the best of Allan Holdsworth and Al Di Meola. Imagine Bill Bruford's Earthworks band electrified and you get the sound of Network. Emmett's Miles Davis-like solos are superb, particularly when he is more up-front as on \\"Obsessive Behaviour\\". Occasionally the funky bass lines and piano breaks resemble Return to Forever, and Clarke's big drum sound vividly recalls Bill Bruford and Phil Collins-era Brand X. The sound quality is good throughout, with production values ideal for an analog recording like this. Like Chad Wickerman's The View in the United States, Network's Corroded Path successfully continues the most attractive band dynamics of the jazz-rock fusion form.\\" Steve wrote and produced the landmark album entitled \\"LNC\\", which was recorded in 1996 with guitarist Keith More, and Steve Topping guest solos on one track notably joined by keyboard legend Jan Hammer. This took Steve's music to a larger worldwide audience including playing concerts in the USA. As a result of playing in New York, the 1998 collaboration with guitarist Larry Coryell followed as a step forward to showcase Steve's compositions. The tracks featured Pete Jacobsen on keyboards and Wolfgang Schmid on guitar, plus Jack Bruce on bass and vocals on a cover of the Hendrix classic Manic Depression. Entitled \\"Highly Committed Media Players\\" it would become Steve's most well known album to date. He followed this by recording the album \\"Solo Drums\\" in May 2000. One of the pieces featured a tribute to an early mentor and friend of his father and uncle, Phil Seaman. Steve was then inducted as a fellow of the British Library for his services to progressive music. During this period, in 1993 Steve hooked up with his good friend Zak Starkey and formed a band 'Spin Out' that featured Zak on guitar, Gary Roberts on bass, Gary Nuttall on guitar and Steve Barnard a.k.a. 'Smiley' on occasional drums/guitar. For several years, Steve ran a multi-track audio and video recording complex and 2013 saw him write, play on and produce a new album featuring famous trumpeter Randy Brecker. = Fastway = In 1987 Steve joined the heavy rock/Metal band Fastway led by Fast Eddie Clarke formerly of Motörhead. Steve played on the album 'On Target' and fulfilled live duties. In 1989 Clarke hooked up with Tank, led by Algy Ward whilst also working with bassist Gerry McAvoy. Clarke and Ward joined Judge Trev Thoms for the Necropolis- \\"End Of The Line\\" album featuring Bill Liesegang, ex Motörhead guitarist Würzel Burston and Steve was re-united with Fast Eddie Clarke and John Clarke. Steve also appeared on two all star albums for Japanese Polydor Records that would see him recording with Don Airey and Scott Gorham. = Tank & Atomgod = Steve also joined UK heavy rock band Atomgods (who became Atomgod) on their release 'History Re-Written' through GWR records in 1991, which also featured film/TV producer Lee Phillips on keyboards, Trev Thoms(HAWKWIND), Bill Leisegang(Nina Hagen, Jack Bruce). Atomgod led Steve to become the house drummer at GWR records, playing with Huw Lloyd Langton and notably TANK, where he fulfilled live duties. = Leader Of Down = Steve is currently active as the drummer of Leader Of Down, the last band of Würzel, and bassist Tim Atkinson. Their debut album \\"Cascade Into Chaos\\" is set to be released later in 2016 and features some of the last recordings by the late Lemmy, along with Phil Campbell andEddie Clarke who died January 10, 2018 after a battle with Pneumonia.

This burial chamber is partially collapsed with the massive capstone resting on the ground at one end. The remains of fifty-six people who were buried here have been found during excavations. Burial chamber Pant-y-Saer Burial Chamber is located on a scrubby hilltop site near Benllech in the parish of Llanfair Mathafarn Eithaf. The capstone is large, measuring about in length and breadth, with a thickness of ; it has partially collapsed and rests with one end on the ground and the other end supported by two upright stones, one on the north side and the other on the south. These have rather rounded tops which may be why the capstone slid off. The chamber was originally covered with a cairn or mound, of which traces remain. Excavations show that the cairn was walled at the front and may have been extended for some way at the back. There is a curved forecourt adjoining the northern upright, and the placement of an offering pot at the far side of this suggest that this was the main front of the structure. Investigations of the site in 1875 unearthed the remains of two people and these were removed. Further investigation in 1912 revealed a lower level to the chamber, in which were the remains of 54 people of all sexes and ages, including nine new-born babies. The bodies would not have all fitted in the chamber at one time, so it seems likely that the grave was repeatedly reopened to accommodate more bodies.

His siblings are : * stepbrother Mahmud of Pahang, Raja Bendahara (4 February 1868) Reign During his reign, Pahang immersed in much political changes. The British government introduced legislation and innovation in the state machinery to make the Malay states 'modern' in political and economic practices. These activities resulted from the constitutional events in the reign of Sultan Ahmad al-Muadzam Shah, namely the creation of the Federated Malay States in 1896 and the establishment of the Federal Council in 1909. A lot of heat was generated against the effectiveness of the Rulers' participation in the Federal Council is in the reign of Sultan Abdullah. The Sultan was irked to find the increasingly Kuala Lumpur was calling in the tune, even in the affairs which he thought had nothing to do with the Federated Malay States, but only Pahang. However, he toed the line because he was dependent to a certain extent on the adequate collective funds of the Federated Malay States, Pahang stood to benefit from the wealth of Perak and Selangor. The Sultan was mollified somewhat when during the governorship of Sir Laurence Guillemard there was intense activity to decentralise powers from the centre at Kuala Lumpur back to the individual States comprising the Federated Malay States. But he did not see the scheme materialise. Neither did his successor because the move was still going on when the Japanese invaded Malaya. Among other reform initiated during Abdullah's reign was the abolishment of a modified form of the corvée system commonly practised in Pahang. Beginning 1919, substantial Malay reservation areas were opened to ensure that land remained available to local Malays. The Sultanate Lands Enactment was promulgated in 1919, vesting certain areas in the Sultan and giving him the right to regulate the leasing and occupation of those areas. The year 1930 marked the creation of the title Tengku Mahkota ('crown prince') along with other new Malay titles, and the framing of agnatic rules of succession. In 1932, at the age of twenty, Tengku Abu Bakar, son and heir of Abdullah was installed as the Tengku Mahkota of Pahang, the first time a prince ever had this title conferred upon. Personal life Abdullah married first to a woman known as Che' Endut. His second wife was Che Kalsum binti Tun Abdullah, daughter of a Terengganuan nobleman Tun Abdullah bin Tun Abdul Rauf of Pulau Duyung, who later was made the Sultanah Pahang ('high consort'). His first son from this marriage was Abu Bakar, who later succeeded as the next Sultan. Abdullah's third marriage was with Cik Wan Chantik binti Wan Muhammad Amin, daughter of a Pattani nobleman Wan Muhammad Amin. From all these marriages, he had issue in total, ten sons and seven daughters. Death and succession By 1931, Abdullah's health began to fail, yet he still managed to attend the Durbar held in August that year. He died the following year, at the Istana Kuning, Pekan on 22 June 1932 and buried at the Royal Cemetery, Kuala Pahang. He was succeeded by his second son, Tengku Mahkota Abu Bakar.

Description and history The Colonial Theater stands near the northern end of Water Street, Augusta's principal commercial downtown thoroughfare. It stands on the east side of the street, just south of the junction with Commercial Street, with the Kennebec River at its rear. It is a large rectangular two-story masonry building, constructed out of brick, with a flat roof and a concrete foundation. Its main facade is seven bays wide, divided into five sections separated by brick piers. The outer sections have secondary exits on the ground floor, while the center section has three bays, each of which has a main entrance on the ground level. The upper level bays have sash windows with granite sills, with all but the outer bays also having keystones above. The center three bays are topped by a decorative parapet.

NRHP nomination for Colonial Theater; available by request from the Maine Historic Preservation Commission The theater was built in 1913 to a design by Harry S. Coombs, then one of the state's leading architects. It is the last of downtown Augusta's theaters to stand, and is unusual in the downtown for its Beaux Arts and Georgian Revival features, along with features that hint at the later Art Deco style. The building was extensively damaged by fire in 1926, and rebuilt, making modest alterations that accentuated the emerging Art Deco features. The theater's early history included the showing of silent movies with live orchestral accompaniment; the stage was eventually extended over the orchestra pit. It was the site that premiered silent films produced by Maine native Holman Francis Day (now apparently lost). It had a nominal seating capacity of about 1200. It was one of two theaters built on Water Street; the other burned down in 1983.

UDAS participated and, or created various numbers of projects and activities supported by local, republican and state government, as well as USAID, EU and Norwegian Embassy in Sarajevo. The organization covers the entire area of the Republic of Srpska through five regional associations in Banja Luka, Doboj, Bijeljina, Istocno Sarajevo and Trebinje. It has around 4500 members, mostly victims of the mines and cluster munitions in BiH. The leaders of the UDAS are the survivors themselves. UDAS is a member of KOMA coaliction(Coalition for marginalized groups) and ICBL-CMC coaliction. = Mission and values = :Guided by philanthropy, values of UDAS are premised on the belief that those with disabilities are entitled to lives of opportunity, independence and dignity. Moreover, society as a whole benefits when population with disability is included and empowered. UDAS mission is to promotes and protects the human rights of people with disabilities and actively supports their full inclusion and participation in the community throughout their lifetimes. UDAS vision is to create a prosperous society, society without barriers and prejudices (ableism) in which everybody has equal rights and equal opportunities. = Brief history = :In the aftermath of Yugoslav wars, disabled population in Bosnia and Herzegovina found themselves seriously disadvantaged. People with disabilities with serious lack of governmental support, faced poverty and social exclusion, unequal access to health services, prejudices and discrimination. In order to meet the basic needs of amputees (civilian and military) and other people with disability, UDAS is founded in 2002. by mostly landmine victims. In the beginning, UDAS had a lot of educational support from former local non-governmental organization ‘Landmine Survivors Initiatives’ (LSI). The organization began as 'The Association of Amputees UDAS Srpske' but later became 'The Organization of Amputees UDAS of Republic of Srpska'. In 2006 due to gained achievements and support given to persons with disabilities Government of Republic of Srpska declared Udas as an organisation of public interest.  Land mine situation  During the 1992–95 Bosnian war, an estimated two million landmines were planted. Majority of locations of the landmines were not thoroughly mapped out and documented. This lack of documentation has complicated the demining process. Beside that, Bosnia’s mountainous and densely forested territory pose a major impediment to the demining process, as the best mechanical methods for demining only work on flat land. Thus, the demining process has largely been done by hand, an assuredly slow and laborious undertaking As a result of it Bosnia and Herzegovina is still one of the most mine contaminated countries in South Easter Europe region. Current size of mine suspected area in BiH covers 1,165 km2 or 2.3% of the total country size, with 1,417 affected communities, directly impacting the safety of about 538,500 people, or about 15% of the total country population. Cluster munition suspect area is 8.76 km2. An estimated 120,000 mines remain, according to the Bosnia and Herzegovina Mine Action Centre(BHMAC). For the period 1992–2013, BHMAC recorded a total of 8,319 mine/UXO casualties: 1,833 killed, 6,039 survivors, and 447 unknown. In many cases, one or more limbs had to be amputated. Than number keeps growing every year. Ten people were involved in land mine accidents in January 2014 alone, including a ten-year-old boy who died in an explosion. In May 2014, BiH was severely affected by the worst Balkan flood in over a century. Almost one third of Bosnia is affected by floods with houses, roads and railway lines being submerged in the north eastern part of the country. One million people – approximately a quarter of the population – have been affected by the floods. Around of 70 percent of the flood-affected zones were in areas contaminated by mines. Bosnian authorities reported that the floods had moved mines, cluster munitions, and unexploded ordnance (UXO), and had damaged minefield fencing and signs. At an ammunition depot in Orašje, some 250 tons of ammunition were reported as being under water on 25 May 2014. Landmine Survivors Initiatives reported that more than 3,000 mine survivors were living in the flood-affected region.  Inclusion  The UDAS is constantly working to improve the quality of life of persons with disabilities. UDAS actively organizes and participate in a range of innovative projects and activities together with organizations that focus on inclusion of people with disabilities. These activities projects cover community life, healthcare, employment, legislation, art and healthy lifestyle. = Health and social welfare = In cooperation with Institute for physical medicine and rehabilitation “Dr Miroslav Zotović”, UDAS provides an individual and group peer to support people with disabilities, organizes educational seminars on topic of healthcare and social welfare, psychological counseling for disabled war veterans, amputees and mine victims. All activities are led by professional associates, doctors and specialists. Also, in co-operation with Family Medicine Service, UDAS offers referrals for CBR centers. = Financial inclusion = Landmine contamination in B&H; has a significant impact on its economy. In particular branch of tourism, hunting and fishing, agriculture, animal husbandry as well as a safe use of natural resources. As a result of post-war unprosperous economy, persons with disabilities on average as a group experience worse socioeconomic situation, having to face at the same time with unemployment and prejudges especially about their employment. People with disabilities in BiH live below the poverty threshold. As a result of it persons with disabilities are usually been perceived as charity case. In order to fight poverty, main economic strategy of UDAS is to increase the income of persons with disabilities, through improvement of employment and self-employment opportunities. To do so, UDAS in co-operation with relevant foundations and/or institutions provides support in Informal sector to people with disabilities to start up or expand small businesses (primarily in breach of livestock and agriculture), which will be run by themselves or their families. Beside that, UDAS organised various educational and business seminars, workshops, and consulting. = Legislation and public advocacy= When it comes to various sectors of public policy, disability is an often misunderstood and stigmatized condition. For that reason, UDAS's leadership takes particular interest in implementation of advocacy, social policies and legislation for persons with disabilities. As a disability right organisation, UDAS in co-operation with Ministries and Services worked on drafting, improvement, practical implementation and adjustment of existing laws and regulations with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Outcome of combine actions was on the creation of the Soldiers’ Rights Act, Pension and Disability Insurance Act and Social Protection Act.UDAS as well, mounted activities to train individuals with disabilities about their new rights. UDAS offers to persons with disability a legal support in terms of legal counseling, references and writing acts to relevant institutions. = Culture = Through cultural activities, primarily through disability arts UDAS want to create a network of local and regional artists to highlight the barriers faced by persons with disabilities and promote the creative potential of artists on the local, national and regional level. UDAS organizes various cultural and creative projects and activities for persons with and without disabilities, such as: drawing school and painting for children, workshop in creative writing, graphic workshops, art colonies, individual and collective exhibitions of art works, where priority is given to persons with disabilities. All activity have a clear psycho therapeutic aspect. Main cultural activity is doing art and handcraft. The organization has art gallery ‘Udas', that is unique gallery in the Southeast Europe because it provides an opportunity for young students of the Academy of Fine Arts, aspiring artists and artists with and without disabilities to showcase their artwork, free of charge. Beside gallery, UDAS owns graphic workshop. Art Gallery 'Udas' is only place in Bosnia and Herzegovina where persons with disability have opportunity showcase their art work. Within the gallery UDAS shows documentaries and movies that are associated directly or indirectly with the present time and situation in society, free of charge. Projections is led by dramaturge, who after the presentation with participants and discuss and analyze the theme the movie. = Sport = Since a healthful lifestyles is one of most important segments of rehabilitation, the UDAS encourages and supports persons with disabilities (primary amputees) to participation in sport activities, to develop confidence, independence and general health. In keeping with that UDAS financially supports The Shooting Club of amputees ‘Borac’ Banja Luka through projects and individuals through one-off aid, so amputees could participate in disabled sports. Beside that UDAS regularly organizes sections in chess, badminton and table tennis. All sports sections are led by persons who are trained to work with disabled people.

(GUS) is a private limited company registered in the Netherlands. As a corporate group, it owns and operates several private for-profit colleges and universities in the UK, Canada, Israel and Europe, as well as other brands and companies in the education sector, such as the e-learning provider InterActive. GUS was founded in its present form and name in 2013 by Aaron Etingen, who serves as chairman, CEO and majority stockholder. History The London School of Business and Finance (LSBF), the forerunner of GUS, was founded in 2003 by Russian-born British entrepreneur Aaron Etingen (also known as Arkady Etingen). This was expanded to several UK for-profit educational institutions known collectively as the LSBF Group, all owned by Etingen and including the London College of Contemporary Arts (LCCA) and the LSBF School of English. After the market reforms of post-secondary education introduced by UK higher education minister David Willetts in 2011, the LSBF group rapidly expanded its student numbers. Etingen added St Patrick's College, London to his portfolio when his company Interactive World Wide Limited purchased the college in 2012. Following a restructuring of his holdings in late 2012, Etingen established Global University Systems in 2013. Its UK business model at the time was heavily dependent on access to government-funded loans to cover students' tuition fees. GUS was incorporated in the Netherlands as a Besloten vennootschap (or BV) and in turn became the owner of the LSBF Group institutions and St Patrick's College through Dutch holding companies. According to John Morgan writing in Times Higher Education, the Dutch \\"BV\\" structure (equivalent to a private limited liability company) does not require company accounts to be made publicly available and has a favourable tax regime compared to the UK. This led to further calls in 2017 for scrutiny of Dutch-incorporated private colleges and universities in the UK. GUS's expansion continued over the next three years with the acquisition of the German business school GISMA in 2013, University Canada West in 2014, and the UK's University of Law in 2015. All three were in financial difficulty at the time of their acquisition. Concerns about the standards at both St Patrick's College and LSBF led to the UK government suspending their Tier 4 licences in 2015. Following the suspensions, Global University Systems announced plans for a two-year restructuring process of the group's UK holdings to begin in mid-2016. According to John Cox, former director of organisational development at GUS, the plan involved LSBF and its LCCA division coming under a new vocational entity offering only diploma courses, short courses and corporate training products. The vocational courses delivered by St Patrick's College and the Birmingham-based Finance Business Training would also come under this division. The University of Law was to become the sole provider of academic qualifications and professional qualifications, including the master's degrees previously offered by the LSBF Group. However, as of 2019 LSBF was still offering master's degrees awarded by the International Telematic University and Geneva Business School. There were no programmes provided or validated by the University of Law. Between 2016 and 2018 GUS acquired further for-profit education institutions and companies, including the UK-based Arden University from Capella Education; IBAT College Dublin; the Israeli test-preparation company HighQ; and Laureate Germany with its subsidiary institutions. Global University Systems was awarded the title of 'Private Education Group of the Year' by Education Investor Awards 2019. Education Investor Awards 2019 (4 December 2019) \\"Winners 2019\\". Retrieved 6 December 2019. Marketing As of 2018, GUS was recruiting students for its universities and colleges from over 175 countries through a network of approximately 1,100 independent education agents and 500 staff in its own marketing, sales and business development departments.

Built in the 1820s, it is a well-preserved example of the period, executed in stone. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history The Sudbury School No. 3 stands a short way south of the village center of Sudbury, at the northwest corner of Routes 30 and 73. It is a single-story stone and brick structure, with a gabled roof. The main facade faces east toward Route 30, and houses an arched recess, lined and faced in brick. The building entrance is on the interior right side of the recess, while a matching doorway to the left (which led to a cloakroom, later converted to hold a furnace) has been filled in. The recessed archway was once flanked by small sash windows; one of these openings has been filled with stone, while the other has a modern sash window. The gable section of the facade includes a stone bearing the date 1829; it, and the stonework at the top of the gable suggest that the roof was raised after the building's initial construction. An entablature extends along the eaves of the side walls, with short returns on the ends. The building interior is reflective of early 20th-century renovations. The school's construction date is uncertain. The town has documentation that a school was standing at this site in 1821, but it is not known if this was that building, or if it was built in 1829, the date given on the gable stone. Its massing and arrangement of windows are fairly typical for Vermont's 19th century district schools, although the use of stone is somewhat unusual, as is the entry vestibule, a clear adaptation to Vermont's sometimes harsh winter conditions.

A sugar refinery occupied part of the site from 1681, rebuilt by Conrad Finzel I in 1846 to become one of the largest sugar refineries in England. Known as Finzel's Sugar Refinery, it operated until 1881. Georges Bristol Brewery, founded in 1788, grew to occupy most of the site by the mid 20th century, when it was the largest brewery in southwest England. Known after 1961 as the Courage Brewery, it operated until 1999. The site also includes the former Tramway Generating Station, a Grade II* listed building built in 1899 which operated as the power station for Bristol Tramways until 1941. Development plans were approved in 2006, but work was halted in 2011 due to financial issues with the developer, HDG Mansur, following the 2008 recession and the site was subsequently put on the market in 2013, after the company went into receivership. The development was revived when the developer, Cubex, bought the site in 2014. History =Sugar refinery= The original Counterslip Sugar House was founded in 1681, in the northeast part of the site. German-born Conrad Finzel I (1793–1859) acquired the refinery in 1839. After it burnt down in 1846 he rebuilt it, at a cost of £250,000. Finzel's Sugar Refinery, one of the largest in England, employed over 700 workers. After Finzel's death in 1859, his family including Conrad Finzel II (1818–1903) kept Finzel & Sons going until 1877. A group of local businessmen briefly took over the refinery, but finally closed ‌it in 1881. =Brewery= Brewing originated at the western end of the site, where in 1788 the Porter Brewery on Bath Street was acquired by a consortium which became the Philip George Bristol Porter and Beer Company. In 1796 the company built a pale ale brewery next to the porter one. In 1861 the company became Georges and Company, and became a public company in 1888. By the early 20th century the Georges Bristol Brewery employed around 170 workers. In 1919 and 1924 more land along Bath Street and Counterslip Street was acquired and by 1933 the brewery developed into a complex, the largest brewery in south west England. After absorbing its local rivals, the company became the dominant brewer in Bristol, but in 1961 it was taken over by Courage, Barclay & Simonds and was renamed Courage (Western). After Courage itself subsequently passed through various owners, the brewery was closed in October 1991 by Scottish & Newcastle. =Generating station= The generating station in 2015 The generating station is at the eastern end of the site, next to St Philip's Bridge. It was built in 1899 for the Bristol Tramways and Carriage Company by the architect William Curtis Green. The eventual demise of Bristol's tramways came on Good Friday 1941 during the Bristol Blitz, when bombs falling on St Philip's Bridge cut the power to the whole tramway system. The generating station was subsequently converted into offices. It is a Grade II* listed building. Development A view of the development in 2015 The £250 million development includes a new footbridge over the Floating Harbour, 168 bed hotel, 420 apartments, offices, shops, restaurants and bars. The previous design for a footbridge had a different alignment and had planning permission given as part of the original Finzels Reach development. A new design by Bristol-based Architects The Bush Consultancy was submitted by Finzels Reach Property LLP for a 4.5m wide curved pedestrian and cycle bridge. The proposals were approved in March 2015 despite many objections due to the obstruction of the waterway from people using the harbour and will link Castle Park to Finzels Reach when it is completed in 2017. The bridge will have a height difference of between the Castle Park end and the Finzels Reach site and is long. In November 2014, a deal was signed between Cubex and Palmer Capital with Premier Inn for a 168 bedroom hotel located in the southern part of the site. In May 2016, planning consent was granted by Bristol City Council for an 11-storey apartment block located in Hawkins Lane and another apartment building located on the north east corner of the site along the Floating Harbour. The two buildings will contain 194 one and two bedroom apartments and will be the final phase of residential development on the site. Willmott Dixon was appointed in late 2016 by Cubex to build the final residential development for the Finzels Reach site with construction starting in February 2017. =Bridgewater House= Completed in 2013, Bridgewater House is an Grade A BREEAM excellent rated office building located in the southern part of the Finzels Reach site. As of Spring 2016, the office building is let to Barclays Wealth and BDO. =Aurora= In September 2015, planning permission was given by Bristol City Council to build a seven-storey Grade A office building designed by Bristol-based Architects The Bush Consultancy. In late 2015, Willmott Dixon was announced as the preferred bidder to construct the Aurora office building and construction is expected to start in 2016 and completed by late 2017. =Generator Building= The Generator Building is a redevelopment of the former Tramways Generating Station into of office accommodation. Work is expected to start in 2018. These plans supersede the original ones to create 30 studio flats, under the name Generator House. = Castle Bridge = Castle Bridge In March 2016, Bristol City Council approved plans for an S-shaped footbridge over the Floating Harbour, linking the development to Castle Park, despite its design obstructing navigation in the harbour and concerns it would be visually intrusive. The bridge cost £2.7 million and was opened on 6 April 2017. Castle Bridge is one of the primary pedestrian routes set out by the City Council as part of their wider assessment of access to the city centre. It is said to complete an attractive 'walkway from Temple Mead to Castle Park and the retail areas of Cabot Circus' however it does not run in that direction and would require a 400m diversion from that route. It has marginally improved access to the popular ferry services on the north of the Floating Harbour for pedestrians coming from the south-west. Its unusually sinuous shape was designed to allow the minimum gradient on the bridge between either side of the Floating Harbour. Made from a series of unique curved steel sections, it is topped with timber decking, sculptured cladding and feature lighting. The 91 metre Castle Bridge adds an entirely new dimension to the Finzels Reach project, providing easy access to the north of the Floating Harbour. It twists its way gracefully across the historic waterway, landing in Castle Park from where Cabot Circus and the MetroBus route are a short walk away.

Education held an important role in Iranian society, especially as the nation began a period of modernization under the authority of Reza Shah Pahlavi in the early 20th century when the number of women's schools began to grow. By mid-century, legal reforms granting women the right to vote and raising the minimum age for marriage offered more opportunities for women to pursue education outside the home. After periods of imposed restrictions, women's educational attainment continued its rise through the Islamification of education following the Iranian Revolution of 1979, peaking in the years following radical changes in the curriculum and composition of classrooms. By 1989, women dominated the entrance examinations for college attendance. Women's participation in education has not slowed despite efforts to impose restrictions on the increasingly female-dominated educational sphere. The changes in women's education have split into increased usage and dominance of the opportunities available to women, and the imposition of strict requirements governing their role in education, including gender-segregated classes, Islamic dress, and the channeling of women into \\"feminine\\" majors that prevent the pursuit of certain careers.  History of education for women in Iran  The nature of education for Iranian women changed significantly from the period leading up to the Iranian Revolution when compared to the imposition of restrictions following it. Despite the various obstacles for women entering an educational setting, they manage to comprise the majority of college attendees and outperform their male peers on university admissions tests as well as in graduation rates. = Pre-Iranian Revolution = At the beginning of the 20th century education for women expanded slowly, with enrollment of female students in the 1922 academic year totaling just over 7200 students compared with 35,000 of their male peers. In 1935, women first experienced the secularization of Iran's educational system when the University of Tehran was established. As the nation's secularization created demand for professionally trained students, women were encouraged to attend schools. Education became a social norm and a marker of achievement in Iranian society. On the eve of the Iranian Revolution, in 1976–77, 40 percent of secondary school enrollment was female. These numbers largely reflect the upper echelon of Iranian society, as women who were a part of an ethnic minority or from rural areas of Iran were largely excluded from these educational reforms. = Education from Iranian Revolution, 1979-1989 = The Iranian Revolution of March 1979 ushered in a period of conservative leadership that altered the role and conception of the new model female in Iranian society. The period was characterized by the retraction of previously passed laws reforming women's status in the home, and the institution in its place of family and civil law based in notions of patriarchy. The newly enacted Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran stated the importance of women's economic and social well-being, yet did not guarantee the right to educational opportunities. Instead, the new regime of religious authority cracked down on women's participation in education, barring coeducation. Immediately following the Revolution, universities and many high schools were shut down, not to be reopened for another 3 years. During this time many female faculty were excused from their positions and many women lost their jobs. This included all female judges as well as women who held positions of authority in the government. Upon reopening of schools and under the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini, educational curriculum was altered to reflect a new focus on Islamic values. Women were depicted wearing a veil in textbooks, appearing in social studies books as managers of the home and offering guidance on Islam and schoolwork. Men were depicted as providers for the family's needs. Some women did appear in pursuit of farming or factory work, working in hospitals and in schools in these textbooks, mostly in conformity with a gender stereotype of feminine work. alt=Women sitting for the Konkur, the university entrance exam Textbooks and curriculum remained uniform across genders, though the Ministry of Education's \\"Study of Professions\\" textbooks differentiated between \\"male\\" and \\"female\\" specializations and were distributed according to gender. In 1982, gender stereotyped work was institutionalized by the Ministry of Education's introduction of KAr va Danesh, an experiential cooperative day in which students were excused from school to work in various occupations. For females, these experiences consisted of workshops focused on topics such as nutrition, child rearing, cooking, and health. Course restrictions in higher education also began under the authority of Religious leader Khomeini, in which men and women were each barred from studying certain majors. Women were excluded from studying veterinary science, animal husbandry, geology, and natural resources, while men were precluded from subjects such as fashion design, obstetrics, and mid-wifery. Of 108 mathematics and computer science majors, women were only permitted to study 43. The government also established quotas for certain specializations, capping the number of women who could pursue specified majors to ensure against the domination of women in these subjects. To comply with the segregation of sexes in schooling and employment, the segregation of subjects led to the founding of a women's only medical school so that female patients could seek treatment from a female physician. Out of fear that single women may be corrupted by external society, state scholarships to study abroad were also restricted, offered to male students and married women only. The \\"Sponsorship for Foreign Students Act\\" additionally required that married women who received the scholarship be accompanied by their husbands. Beginning in 1980, female faculty and students were directed to wear Islamic dress by the Ministry of Education. The institution of veiling throughout Iran in 1981 extended the compulsion to women beginning at 6 years of age. At this time many schools limited teachers to instruct only same-gendered students. = Khomeini to Khatami, 1989-2005 = In 1989, the First Economic, Social, and Cultural Development Plan of the Islamic Republic of Iran, 1989–1993, offered improvement in women's educational opportunities and involvement in social and economic life as key targets for the incoming administration. Following the death of Khomeini in 1989, President Rafsanjani began a process of scaling back restrictions on women's education. Hurdles to education still existed, with the majority of Iranian women married by the age of 19 at the start of the 1990s. The situation was more dire for rural female students, with half of female Iranians living outside urban areas remaining uneducated. Progress began to be made toward alleviating some of these restrictions in the 1990s. Quotas restricting the number of women who could study particular fields were eliminated while the Women's Cultural and Social Council, an institution headed by Iranian women who held influential positions in Iran, began studying the effects continued restrictions had on the Iranian economy. This led to a lifting of all remaining quotas or bans on studying particular fields, completed in 1993. By the 1990s many of the restrictions imposed on majors were also lifted, offering women more opportunities to pursue a degree in fields such as veterinary science that were banned under the Khomeini government. More women beyond the few, urban elite that initially enrolled in higher education began to attend school under its Islamic form, no longer hesitant about sending their children to institutions taught by men. Educational opportunities continued through the rule of Mohammad Khatami, who served as President of Iran from 1997 to 2005. Khatami viewed the home as the proper setting for an Iranian woman, yet did not seek to exclude her from participation in the public sphere. Noting the increasing dominance of women in higher education, Khatami stated that though the increase was concerning, he did not wish to create obstacles in order to reduce this participation. Khatami called for an opening of majors and specialities for women in universities and an end to the quota system. At the beginning of Khatami's presidency, over 95 percent girls in Iran attended elementary school. In 1997–98, 38.2 percent of Iranian women enrolled in higher education. This number rose to 47.2 percent by 2000. As female enrollment in schooling continued to climb, the segregation of the sexes in academic specialization continued to persist through the end of the 1990s. In the 1998–99 academic year, males dominated enrollment in math-physics and technical fields with 58 and 71 percent of the enrolled class of secondary school students. Women disproportionately comprised the humanities and experimental sciences field with 61 percent enrollment. Gender specialization continued through university level where the fields of basic sciences, medical sciences, and arts were studied by a majority of women, and agriculture and veterinary science, engineering, and humanities were pursued mostly by men. Overall, however, the decade was characterized by a three-fold increase in female enrollment in higher education. At the turn of the 21st century the government continued to scale back restrictions. By 2000, the government supported the establishment of a Women's Studies course to be offered for graduate level study of topics including women's rights. A 2001 report on women's status in Iran published by his office emphasized the goal of improving educational materials for women to reflect their modern role in society, including the counseling of high school students toward specializations that were traditionally dominated by men. In 2001, the government also authorized the use of the \\"Sponsorship for Foreign Students Act\\" supplement for single women to study abroad, a change from the former restriction. Single women could avail themselves of the funds to pursue higher education in foreign institutions, with the consent of their fathers. 2001 is also the year that female enrollment in university-level education exceeded that of men, showing their continued dominance of education. The statistics of the Khatami presidency show the slow rise of female participation in education. In 2002, women dominated the results of its national college entrance examination, comprising 62 percent of passing students. Women pursuing teaching positions in higher education also made gains during this period, holding nearly half of all assistant professorships at universities, nearly double that held a decade before. The number of women accepted into tenured-track and full-time professorships in 2001–02 remained low at 17.3 percent as it was not nearly as proportionate to the number of educated women in Iranian society. = Ahmadinejad Era, 2005-2013 = Many of the reforms achieved earlier in Rasfanjani and Khatami's presidencies were eroded with the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2005. In 2006, the average woman in Iran attended school for nine years. At the start of his presidency in 2007–08, women's gains in education permeated every level, composing 44 percent of students pursuing associate degrees, 55 percent of bachelor's degree students, 43 percent of master's degree students, and a high 58 percent of students pursuing a professional doctorate. Women also dominated 6 of the 7 academic fields offered at university level, save for engineering, comprising the majority of students studying veterinary sciences, basic sciences, human sciences, medical sciences, agriculture and the arts. With the former rise of participation by women in education and the reduction of artificially created obstacles to their success in pursuing studies, conservative forces in the Iranian government became alarmed at the erosion of traditional notions of women's role in the home and the competition in the labor market with educated men for whom work outside the home was essential. The government took action, with Ahmadinejad appointing a religious cleric as the chancellor of the secular Tehran University in November 2005. In 2006, the Ministry of Health and Education imposed a quota system on particular majors and specialities and restricted enrollment of women to universities located in their hometowns. It also instituted the gender segregation of higher education. The response from students to what was perceived as the attempt to turn secular universities into religious institutions were protests demanding the preservation of civil liberties, such as the freedom of speech. Conservative politicians demanded, in turn, a crackdown on the \\"westernization\\" of secular education and an imposition of Islamic philosophy. The Supreme Leader's spokesman for higher education, Hojatoleslam Mohammadian, and the Minister of Science and Higher Education, Mohammad Mehdi Zahedi, both called for the Islamization of universities, while Mohammadian also stated his opposition to women pursuing certain studies in higher education. In 2009 Ahmadinejad's pursuit of the further de-feminization of education led to the establishment of the \\"Special Council for the Development and Promotion of Humanities.\\" Iran's Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution oversaw this effort, in which seven appointees were responsible for infusing humanities discipline with Islamic principles.  2010-11 Restrictions  In 2010, Iran again adopted a quota system to limit the number of women able to enter university education. Iran imposed restrictions on a dozen social studies courses, including women's studies and human rights, on the grounds that \\"The content of the current courses in the 12 subjects is not in harmony with religious fundamentals and they are based on Western schools of thought.\\" In 2011, universities began to announce new restrictions on entry to female students. Whereas previously students who scored highest on the previously gender-neutral university entrance exam, the Konkur, were placed in the best university programs across the country, universities now barred females from enrollment in over 70 specializations. The practical result was to concentrate more women in local universities closer to their homes, and farther from the urban, more secular universities they were otherwise qualified to attend. = January 2011 Allameh Tabatabai University announcement = In January 2011, the president of Allameh Tabatabai University in Tehran, Sadreddin Shariati, announced that subjects with large numbers of students would be split by gender. Prior to this, university libraries and canteens were already segregated. It was claimed that the Iranian public had already been requesting gender segregation in education in some highly religious areas and in the capital; also, such segregation was said to already be in progress in a number of other Iranian universities. Senior cleric Hojatoleslam Mohammad Mohamadian pushed for segregated classes in 2006, and again in 2009; other governmental requests to allow segregation date back over 15 years.  August 2012 course ban  On 20 August 2012, an announcement was made by Iran's Ministry of Science, Research and Technology that 36 universities in Iran would be cutting 77 fields of study from the female curriculum, making them male-only fields. The fields chosen include most sciences and engineering, among others. The curriculum change was set to be implemented for the 2013 school year and the fields of study limitations for women have been added to the university \\"leaflets\\". Universities like the Oil Industry University have completely barred women from attending, citing the \\"lack of employer demand\\". The announcement came soon after the release of statistics showing that women were graduating in far higher numbers than men from Iranian universities and were scoring overall better than men, especially in the sciences. This reasoning was echoed by Isfahan University, which stated that from those that obtained mining engineering degrees \\"98 percent of female graduates ended up jobless\\". The disciplines related to agriculture were also regarded as \\"unfit\\" for female students. Therefore, as a consequence of this move, women may not become engineers, nuclear physicists, archaeologists, business graduates and computer scientists in Iran. They are also banned from attending the departments of English literature, translation and hotel management. Another reason given was that because of a shortage of available female dormitories, attendance had to be lowered. A comparison was made, however, to the fact that nursing was made a female-only degree in the same announcement. The possibility of fields of study restrictions was first reported by the Mehr News Agency on 6 August 2012. The news followed the release of the year's entrance exam scores, showing that 60 percent of university attendees are women, along with test scores of the past few years showing women largely outperforming men. This included 52 percent of university graduates and 68 percent of science degree graduates being women. These results have caused concern among the senior clerics of the country, who became worried about the \\"social side-effects of rising educational standards among women, including declining birth and marriage rates\\". Amnesty International reported that in April 2012, university security personnel at the Roudehen Branch of Islamic Azad University beat female students who were not complying with hijab (Islamic dress) standards. They also claimed reports of quotas restricting women's admission to specific university programs (\\"designed to reduce women’s access to specific fields of study\\") implemented by the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology. Such restrictions on women's educational choices were said to violate the prohibition on discrimination and Iran's obligations under international law. = Responses = Seyed Abolfazl Hassani, a senior Iranian education official, stated in defense of the announcement that, \\"Some fields are not very suitable for women’s nature, such as agricultural machinery or mining, partly because of the hard work involved in them.\\" The policy change was criticized by some Iranian parliamentarians, such as Mohammad-Mehdi Zahedi, head of the Iranian parliament's education and research committee. However, Kamran Daneshjoo, the science and higher education minister, gave a \\"guarded response\\" to the news, saying that the universities would have to state a reason, but also supported the change by explaining that \\"90 percent of degrees remain open to both sexes and that single-gender courses were needed to create 'balance'.\\" Zahedi said in response that Daneshjoo is \\"expected to present himself to parliament to explain this policy\\". Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi wrote to the United Nations in protest of the restrictions, stating that the Iranian government is \\"trying to limit the active presence of women in society\\". She has asked for the issue to be added to \\"Iran's human rights dossier\\". The letter was then forwarded to UN special rapporteur for Iran Ahmad Shaheed and to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navanethem Pillay. Ebadi also added that the purpose of this policy change is to reduce the number of female university attendees to below 50 percent, down from the current 65 percent. On 22 September 2012, Human Rights Watch urged Iran to reverse the new policy, claiming that such restrictions are a violation of the international right to education for everyone without discrimination. = Rouhani Era, 2013-Present = When Hassan Rouhani took control of the presidency in 2013, there was hope that he would usher in a radical shift in Iranian society toward equal women's rights. Hopes that he would scale back quota use and institute more lenient reforms have not been fully realized, with the UN Special Rapporteur noting in a 2015 report that significant discrimination against women still persists in the political and economic spheres, overshadowing the gains made in education. The Special Rapporteur also noted that despite 14 recommendations made to alleviate the obstacles currently preventing equal gender attainment in the educational sphere, the Rouhani government rejected consideration of all of them. While the vast majority of Iranian students who attend secondary school do not go on to study at a university, 42 percent of women who take the university entrance exams continue on to higher education, compared to 29 percent of males. The state of literacy and educational attainment among ethnic minority females is also poor when compared to urban, non-minority peers, as they are not forced to attend school and often enter marriage at an early age. The dual nature of female participation in education is not yet reflected in their role in the economy, where 20–25 percent of educated women are able to find work.  Alternative Schooling Options for Women in Iran  = Adult Literacy Programs = In addition to formal education, women in Iran may enroll in literacy programs. These programs target women, offering basic training in simple math, reading, and writing. In the 1990s, women composed over two-thirds of enrollees in these programs. This may have contributed to the steep rise in female literacy rates in Iran in the 1990s, which increased twenty-percent from 1987 to 1997. = Religious Schools = Religious schools have also become an educational option for Iranian women, and the rise in the institution of \\"female seminaries\\" to 280 as of 2010 shows their increasing use as an academic pursuit. The popularity stems from the infusion of religion into Iran post- revolution, when Ayatollah Khomeini called for the establishment of Jami‘at al-Zahra in 1984, the first female seminary in Iran. The institution, a consolidation of smaller religious schools, offers enrollees the chance to earn anything from high school diplomas to doctoral degrees. Women must apply to enroll in the institutions, where only 7,000 women were accepted from a field of over 25,000 applicants in the 2010 academic year. Seminaries have served as an alternative to higher education when female applicants are denied admission, either as a result of academic success or the quota system employed by public universities. = Other schooling = Newly married Iranian women must attend government-mandated family planning classes. Information on health and birth control use is included in these programs.  Role of Education in Iran  Though education has been dominated in many fields by females, especially at the university level, it has not enabled women to enter the work force in comparative numbers. Aside from having an empowering aspect for women, some scholars note increased schooling has yet to result in paid employment increases or roles in authoritative positions of employment. While female participation in the paid economy was shown to increase by a third after the Iranian Revolution, the seemingly optimistic figure was attributed more so to the continued employment of women already in the labor force rather than an increase in newly graduated women successfully entering it. Whereas 23.5 million men held paid positions in the Iranian economy in 2006, for instance, merely 3.5 million Iranian women obtained similar positions, or 20 percent of the labor force pool. The increase in educational opportunities has also not correlated with an increase in the number of educated women entering decision-making positions in government or the private economy. Women are largely absent from high-level full-time professorship positions or as heads of institutions of higher educations, a reality made more difficult by the low enrollment rate of women at the master's and specialized doctorate levels of education that are necessary for positions in university-level positions. Some scholars have argued that education has contributed to female self- empowerment, giving women a task to achieve that is outside the home even if it does lead to viable employment. Survey evidence indicates that young educated Iranian women view education as important or very important to a female in Iranian society, more so than other members of Iranian society. More of these educated youth also believe, more so than their non-educated and older female compatriots, that their daughters should marry following attendance of an institution of higher education. The education of Iranian women has correspondingly led to a delayed entry into marriage, with non- educated females more than half as likely to be married by the time they turn 22 years old than educated peers. Education is also shown to contribute to the delayed start of having a family, with the majority of educated women having their first child by the age of 24, 4 years later than non-educated women in Iran.

Location The Frade e a Freira (Friar and Nun) is an unusual rock formation located in the south of the state of Espírito Santo. The protected area includes about and contains characteristic fragments of Atlantic Forest. It covers parts of the municipalities of Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, Itapemirim and Vargem Alta. It lies to the north of the road between Cachoeiro de Itapemirim and Rio Novo do Sul. The rock is in altitude, and may be climbed by visitors. History On 12 June 1986 the formation was given a Natural Cultural Heritage designation by the state, and on 6 September 2007 it was made a Natural Monument by state decree 1917-R. It became part of the Central Atlantic Forest Ecological Corridor, created in 2002. As of 2012 there was no evidence of any state effort to protect the monument, such as a gatehouse or guides. In 2015 it was found that 150 native trees had been cut down near the monument and the profitable parts removed. It was not clear whether they were within the protected area. Name The name comes from a legend that a monk and a nun, who were working together in an attempt to convert the Indians to Christianity, fell in love with each other. They were forbidden to consummate their love by the church and by their own beliefs, although their feelings became deeper every day. For their sacrifice God transformed their passion into stone, where it is immortalized and admired by everyone who passes through the region.

As an otologic surgeon and otolaryngologist, he specializes in treatment of ear disorders. In his research, he has focused on imaging the brains of jazz artists as they improvise in the fMRI. He has worked under the assumption that improvisation is important to creativity more generally, and creativity is vital to basic problem-solving, evolution, and survival.Mary Carole McCauley, \\"Hopkins Scientist Finds Link Between Neurobiology of Music, Language,\\" The Baltimore Sun, March 4, 2013.  Academic background  Limb teaches at UCSF, where he is the Francis A. Sooy Professor of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, and the Chief of the Division of Otology, Neurotology and Skull Base Surgery at UCSF. In addition, he holds a joint faculty appointment in the Department of Neurological Surgery and is the Director of the Douglas Grant Cochlear Implant Center.“Charles Limb, MD“ Otolyrangology  Head and Neck Surgery, UCSF. He earned his bachelor's degree at Harvard University, where he directed a jazz band. Later he attended the Yale University School of Medicine, where he played jazz in New Haven restaurants. After graduating from medical school in 1996, he completed a surgical internship in General Surgery, a residency in Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, and a subspecialty fellowship in Neurotology at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. He also completed one postdoctoral research fellowship at the Center for Hearing Sciences at Johns Hopkins with Dr. David Ryugo, where he investigated the development of the auditory brainstem, and a second at the National Institutes of Health, where he used fMRI devices to image brain activity when jazz musicians improvise music. He joined the faculty of Johns Hopkins Hospital in 2003, where he remained until 2015, as Associate Professor of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery. During this time, he was also a Faculty Member at the Peabody Conservatory of Music and the Johns Hopkins University School of Education, as well as Scientific Advisor to the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra.“Charles Limb, MD“ Otolyrangology  Head and Neck Surgery, UCSF.  Research  Limb has stated that he wants to know what went on in John Coltrane’s head when he improvised masterpieces on the saxophone.Alicia Anstead, “Charles J. Limb: Inner Sparks.” Scientific American, December 2013, pp. 36-39. He has researched creativity with jazz musicians because they can improvise on cue, even in the laboratory conditions of an fMRI.Malinda McPherson and Charles J. Limb, “Difficulties in the Neuroscience of Creativity: Jazz Improvisation and the Scientific Method.” Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 2013, pp. 1-4. In several experiments, he has captured moving pictures of their brain activity as they create. In one, he found that improvising musicians showed: 1) deactivation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which among other functions acts as a kind of self-censor, and 2) greater activation of the medial prefrontal cortex, which connects to a brain system called the “default network.” The default network is associated with introspective tasks such as retrieving personal memories and daydreaming.Charles J. Limb and Allen R. Braun, “Neural Substrates of Spontaneous Musical Performance: An fMRI Study of Jazz Improvisation.” PLoS ONE, vol. 3, issue 2, February 2008. It has to do with one’s sense of self. In another experiment, he and his team demonstrated that when two jazz musicians are “trading fours,” that is, having an interactive musical conversation, they utilize brain areas important in linguistic grammar and syntax. The finding suggests that these regions process auditory communication generally, rather than just for spoken language.Gabriel F. Donnay, Summer K. Rankin, Monica Lopez-Gonzalez, Patpong Jiradejvong, and Charles J. Limb, “Neural Substrates of Interactive Musical Improvisation: An fMRI Study of ‘Trading Fours’ in Jazz.” PLoS ONE, vol. 9, issue 2, February 2014. Limb also investigated the relation of emotion to creativity. He asked jazz musicians in the fMRI to improvise music they felt corresponded to the emotions in photos of a sad, neutral, and happy woman. He found that when musicians responded to happy photos, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex deactivated much more than in the other conditions. The study also asked why we feel pleasure in sad music, and found that while musicians showed more frontal deactivation and deeper flow states when responding to the happy photos, the creation of sad music elicited a stronger visceral experience and greater activity in the brain's reward centers.Malinda J. McPherson, Frederick S. Barrett, Monica Lopez-Gonzalez, Patpong Jiradejvong, and Charles J. Limb, ”Emotional Intent Modulates the Neural Substrates Of Creativity: An fMRI Study of Emotionally Targeted Improvisation in Jazz Musicians.” Nature, January 4, 2016, pp. 1-14. In addition, he has researched music perception in deaf individuals with cochlear implants. As a temporal bone surgeon, he places these devices in patients, and the implants let them hear speech well, but they have trouble perceiving elements of music such as harmony and timbre, as well as performing higher integration. He has recommended training programs and technological innovation to overcome this deficit. Limb has also examined the creativity of composers such as Beethoven and Smetana, who became deaf as adults yet continued to write great music, and he has written about the fact that Thomas Edison invented the phonograph despite his loss of hearing.Nick Zagorski, “The Science of Improv,“ Peabody Magazine, Fall 2008.  Publications and editorships  Limb is the former Editor-in-Chief of Trends in Hearing (then called Trends in Amplification), the only journal focused on hearing aids and other auditory amplification devices, and an Editorial Board Member of the journals Otology & Neurotology and Music and Medicine. He has authored over 75 manuscripts, including magazine articles.  Speeches  He has given two TED talks. In the first, “Your Brain on Improv,” he showed how during jazz improvisation the brain deactivates the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and activates the medial prefrontal cortex. In the second, “Building the Musical Muscle,” he described restoring music perception in the deaf and focused on the challenges faced by cochlear implant users when trying to process music. He has also been a featured panelist at the Sundance Film Festival, and he has spoken about his work internationally in Europe, Asia, Australia, and Canada. = Other media appearances = Among the media outlets and organizations that have featured his work are the New York Times, CNN, PBS, National Geographic, Scientific American, the BBC, the Smithsonian Institution, National Public Radio, the Library of Congress, the American Museum of Natural History, the Kennedy Center, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, and the Canadian Broadcasting Company.“Charles Limb, MD“ Otolyrangology  Head and Neck Surgery, UCSF.

The Malka is its northwest tributary and the Sunzha River is inside the great bend of the Terek The Kuban drains the northwest Caucasus rivers into the Sea of Azov. The Laba is the fourth river from the left. The North Caucasus Line was a line of Russian forts and Cossack settlements along the north side of the Caucasus Mountains. Originating in the mid 16th century with a few free Cossacks near the Caspian Sea, from the mid 18th century the line was pushed west and used as a base to conquer the mountains to the south and to populate the steppes to the north. Background = Geography= The Cossack settlements were determined by three roughly parallel lines. The first was the line between the Caucasus foothills and the lowlands. The second was the line between forest and steppe. It is difficult to trace this line since much of the forest has been cleared for agriculture. What is clear is that a belt of forest-steppe extended north of the foothills onto the plain. The third, and most important, line was marked by three, and later five, rivers. In the east the Terek River catches the rivers that flow north from the Caucasus and drains them into the Caspian. In the west the Kuban River drains the Caucasus rivers west into the Sea of Azov. In the center the Malka River catches the mountain rivers and itself flows east into the Terek. The Terek, Malka and Kuban made a natural military line. Later two other rivers became important. The Terek first flows north, turns somewhat west and makes a great bend before flowing east. Inside this bend the Sunzha River flows northeast into the Terek and catches most of the mountain rivers. Once the Terek was controlled it became the next military line. In the west the Kuban also flows north before swinging west. Inside this curve the north-flowing Laba River was the next military line. In the east along the Terek the soil is poor and rainfall low. Dense peasant settlement only became possible when the line was pushed west to the Stavropol highland in the center in the late 18th century. Around 1500 Russia was just beginning to push south from its heartland in Muscovy. Everything south to the Black Sea and Caucasus was controlled by the Nogai nomads. In 1556 Russia moved down the Volga and captured Astrakhan at the north end of the Caspian sea. South of the Terek along the Caspian Sea the land was controlled by various khanates nominally subject to Persia. The northernmost was what later became the Shamkhalate of Tarki. =Who were the Caucasus Cossacks?= native dress: papakha, cherkeska with gazerei and kinzhal Cossacks lived all along the southern Russian frontier. They were originally runaway serfs and adventurers who went to the frontier to live a free life. They were gradually brought under government control by being hired as mercenaries. By the later period the Cossack was basically a fighting farmer who supported himself but was available for military call-up. Their usual duties were guarding villages against raiders, protecting convoys, especially along the Georgian Military Road and serving as auxiliaries to the regular army. Most seem to have been of non-Russian ancestry. Since runaways and adventurers are mostly male, their wives, and therefore mothers and grandmothers were usually local. Cossack villages attracted locals who were slowly absorbed into the Cossack community. Georgians and Armenians moved to the north side of the mountains and some became Cossacks. In 1829 vagrants (brodyagi) were rounded up and made to work in Cossack villages for three years, after which they might become Cossacks. Although they normally had to be Orthodox, a number of Cossacks, including officers, were Muslim. They adopted local dress and economic methods. Horses and weapons were often bought from the mountaineers. In 1828 Cossacks were forbidden to approach peasants working in the fields because they could not be distinguished from native raiders. There was a good bit of raiding between Cossacks and natives. The local people also raided each other, but we do not hear of Cossacks raiding other Cossacks. When they were not raiding each other there was a good deal of economic and personal interaction. Especially in the early period there were many free Cossacks of whom the government knew little. In 1744 the Greben Cossacks had 450 men, but could round up 1500 more if they were paid. Free Cossacks usually appear in the records as “criminal fugitive Cossacks” when they engaged in raiding or piracy. Before the Russian state began a serious attempt at conquest in the early 19th century the Caucasus Cossacks were almost another local tribe. History =c 1550-1711: Early Settlements= Free Cossacks were living on the lower Terek by the first half of the 16th century. The usual dates are 1520 and 1563, but the matter is very obscure.This is moved off to a footnote since the sources are contradictory. Barrett (page 3) prefers 1563 citing a 1963 Russian source. :Ru:Терские казаки says that in that year voivode Pleshcheev led 500 streltsy to the Terek, apparently from Astrakhan. Another story is that they came from Ryazan in 1520 when that principality was annexed by Moscow. Terek Cossacks says that the 1520 people settled at the mouth of the Aktash River and associates them with the Greben Cossacks. The source for 1520 is not clear. Further, the Aktash probably dried up before reaching the Terek and therefore did not have a mouth. James Forsyth ('The Caucasus', 2013, page 220) says \\"it is unknown when...\\" and gives up. A tale collected in 1728 claimed that Andrei Shadrin (Cossack) went south to found Endirey while his companion went north to become Yermak, the conqueror of Siberia. 18th and 19th century travelers collected other tales which need not be repeated To the west of the Terek Cossacks lived the Greben Cossacks.They are usually placed on the east-west Terek Ridge (‘greben’) located south of the Terek west of the mouth of the Sunzha. Another story (Barrett, page 14) has them coming from the village of Grebna on the Don, which is hard to locate. By 1774 they were east of the mouth of the Sunzha and west of Kizliar (Tsutsiev, Map 4) They were first formally distinguished in 1736. Before that date a distinction between Greben and Terek Cossacks is questionable. Since the whole point of being a free Cossack was to be out of the reach of the government there are few records. The few records we have from this period usually relate to raiding or warfare. Early forts: In 1556 Russia occupied Astrakhan at the head of the Caspian Sea and began interacting with Kabardia in the center of the north Caucasus. In 1567 Sunzha Ostrog (1567-1579) was built at the mouth of the Sunzha at the east end of Kabardian territory. It was too far advanced, moved several times, abandoned under Turkish pressure in 1571, rebuilt in 1578 and abandoned the following year. In 1588 Tersky Gorod (1588-1722) Tersky Gorod is Barrett's preferred term and is used here for clarity. Other writers call it Tersky Gorodok, Tersk, Terki and Terka and some confuse it with Tarki in Dagestan. :RU:Терский город says that Tersky Gorod was the original name of Sunzha Ostrog. It was moved several times and its sites have probably been washed away. There was a place called Tyumen nearby which was washed away before Tersky Gorod was built. It is possible that terms like Tersky Gorod and Terki meant something like \\"our main fort on the Terek\\" without regard to where it was located in any given year. Walter Richmond, (Northwest Caucasus, 2008) seems to use Tersk in this way. was founded in the Terek delta. In 1623 it had 500 Cosascks on the government payroll. By the late 17th century it is said to have had a population of 20,000,Barrett, page 20, sic mostly non-Russian. In 1708 it was burned by “Kuban Tatars.” It was abandoned in 1722. In 1635 Sunzha Ostrog (1635-1653) was restored. In 1653 Persia forced its abandonment (the so-called Russo-Persian War (1651-1653)). Early Wars: Russian relations with Kabardia were more diplomatic than military. In 1560, four years after the capture of Astrakhan, Cheremisinov attacked Tarki, burned it and withdrew. In 1594 Prince Khvorostinin led 5000 Terek, Astrakhan and Yaik Cossacks south to attack Tarki and was soundly defeated. In 1604-05 Ivan Buturlin attacked Tarki and was defeated. In the last two cases the Dagestanis allowed the Russians to take the town, surrounded and harassed them and attacked when they were forced to retreat. The first war was requested by the Kabardians and the last two by the Georgian kings who did nothing to help. In 1605 the rebel Illya Muromets was on the Terek. In 1614 some Terek Cossacks helped attack Ivan Zarutsky at Astrakhan. In the 1680s 1500 Don Cossack Old Believers settled on the Kuma River. =1711 - 1763: the Russian state gains control of the Cossacks= Around 1711 the Greben Cossacks moved to a more defensible position on the north bank of the Terek. In 1717 some 500 of them participated in Prince Alexander Bekovich-Cherkassky's campaign against the Khanate of Khiva in Central Asia. Only two came back. In 1720 the Greben Cossacks were placed under the governor of Astrakhan and in the following year, under the Russian War College (). In 1722 the Russian Emperor Peter the Great tried to conquer the west side of the Caspian Sea. The entire garrison of Tersky Gorod was moved 130 miles south to Svyatoy Krest (Holy Cross) Fort (1722-1736) on the lower Sulak River. Tersky Gorod was abandoned and only the Greben Cossacks remained on the Terek. In 1723-24 1000 families of Don Cossacks were moved to the Sulak and its Agrakhan branch, forming the Agrakhan Cossack Host. Svyatoy Krest was too far advanced and even more unhealthy than the lower Terek. When it was abandoned in 1735-36 only 200 of its garrison had survived to be moved to the new fort at Kizlyar. The Cossacks who moved back north became the Terek-Semeinoe Host (between the Greben Cossacks and Kizlyar) and the Terek- Kizlyar Host Tsutsiev, Map 4 for 1774, has the Nizovoye Cossacks at the same place as Barrett's Terek-Kizlyar Host, so the two names may mean the same or official names may have changed, reflecting some kind of reorganization. Tsutsiev does not recognize the Terek Semeinoye Host and has the Greben Cossacks extending from the mouth of the Sunzha to Kizlyar. (east of Kizlyar on the lower Terek). The Terek-Kizlyar Host had the worst land and less than 200 men on active duty. About a third of them were converted natives. The Terek-Semeinoe Host had about 450 men for most of the period and was mostly descended from Don Cossacks. They were merged with the Greben Cossacks in 1745 and separated again in 1755. Kizlyar (1735–present) was founded on the Terek when Svyatoy Krest was abandoned and remained the largest Russian town in the Caucasus until Stavropol surpassed it in the early 19th-century. In 1773 Kizlyar had a garrison of 1277 and a civilian and Cossack population of 4197. Only 8% of the population was Russian. The town had three Orthodox churches, one monastery, four mosques and one Armenian church. = 1763-1864: Westward expansion, massive peasant colonization and war in the mountains= By the mid 18th century there were only 1,162 active-duty Cossacks in the north Caucasus. By 1851 there were 86,538. Westward expansion was associated with the annexation of Georgia south of the mountains. In 1769 Totleben crossed the mountains to fight the Turks. In 1783 eastern Georgia became a Russian protectorate and in 1800 it was annexed. Since the only good road south was through Darial Pass the Russians now had to hold what became the Georgian Military Highway. Mozdok (1763–present) at the north end of the highway was founded in 1763. In 1770 it became a fortress independent of Kizliar. It quickly attracted a large native population, many of whom were fugitive serfs from the mountains. In 1765 the Mozdok Mountain Command was formed from converted natives. They were used mostly for convoy duty along the Military Highway. Ossets were encouraged to settle along the highway and efforts were made to re-convert them (many had formerly been Christians). There was a gap of about 65 miles between Mozdok and the westernmost Greben Cossacks. From 1770 to 1799 this area was settled by Don and Volga Cossacks. Vladikavkaz at the north end of the pass was founded in 1784. It was partly abandoned at the time of Sheikh Mansur and was reestablished in 1803. In 1777 Russia began building a line of forts between Mozdok and Azov. In that year Stavropol and Georgievsk were founded along this line. (Georgievsk was the seat of the Caucasus Governorate from 1802 to 1822.) In the same year the Volga regiment was formed from Volga Cossacks on the eastern part of this line. Each new fort became a magnet for both legal and illegal settlers. 68000 peasants were settled in 1781-84 and 68000 more by the end of the century. Far to the west, in 1708, the Nekrasov Cossacks settled on the Kuban. They were refugees from the Bulavin Rebellion and lived in Crimean-Nogai territory. They seem to have gradually broken up and merged with other groups. In 1783, the same year that Georgia became a Russian vassal, Russia annexed the Khanate of Crimea and thereby inherited its claim over the Nogai nomads. In 1787 the Black Sea Cossack Host was given the land between Azov and the Kuban. By 1794 25000 people had settled along the Kuban. Krasnodar was founded in 1794. The Kuban line became the base for the Russo-Circassian War. The line was pushed west to the Laba River. In the center the line was pushed south from the Terek to the Sunzha. Grozny was founded in 1818. In 1824 general Aleksey Yermolov created the Mountain Cossack regiment between the Volga and Mozdok regiments. These new \\"Cossacks\\" were created by decree, the government declaring that various Cossacks, state peasants and natives were now Cossacks. During the Murid War Chechens were driven north or south of the two rivers. The Sunzha Regiment was founded in 1845. During the Russo-Circassian War (until 1864) in the west and the Murid War (1830-1859) in the east, the line was the northern base for the conquest of the mountains. When the fighting ended the Cossacks were no longer needed for local fighting, but they remained and remain a rather distinct community. A proper account of peasant settlement north of the line on the Black Sea-Caspian Steppe would require census figures which do not seem to exist.

As of late 2017, the company has raised around $6 million from private investors as well as a total of more than $2 million from crowdfunding sources alone. Neptune's first product, the Neptune Pine, was first announced in 2013 through a Kickstarter campaign, which proceeded to raise more than $800,000 in 30 days. The device started shipping to backers in August 2014, and eventually became widely available through Best Buy and Amazon, generating around $5 million in total retail sales. The Pine was prominently featured in the 2017 film The Fate of the Furious, the CBS TV series Extant produced by Steven Spielberg and starring Halle Berry, as well as the music video for the song Smartphones by Trey Songz.  History  Neptune was started by Simon Tian in January 2013. Before even building a prototype or incorporating a company, Tian posted some conceptual drawings of a smartwatch, the Neptune Pine, on a website he built using Weebly, issued a press release though PRWeb announcing the product, and proceeded to receive more than 20,000 orders for the device in a few weeks. Tian then dropped out of school and traveled to China to meet with contract manufacturers to have the device developed. In November 2013, he launched a crowdfunding campaign for the Pine on Kickstarter. Within 27 hours, the campaign reached its funding goal of $100,000, and ultimately went on to raise more than $800,000 in 30 days. The device started shipping by August 2014, and eventually became widely available through Best Buy and Amazon, generating around $5 million in total retail sales for the company. It was prominently featured in the 2017 film The Fate of the Furious, the CBS TV series Extant produced by Steven Spielberg and starring Halle Berry, and the music video for Smartphones by Trey Songz. The Pine has gotten mixed reviews from the press, generally praising its extensive set of features, while criticizing its large size. In March 2015, Neptune announced the Neptune Suite through an Indiegogo campaign, raising $1.2 million in a month. Christopher Mims of the Wall Street Journal described the Suite as \\"a literal interpretation of the fact that a smartwatch, smartphone and tablet are all just different size windows on the same set of apps and services.\\" Daniel Cooper of Engadget commented on the ambitious nature of the product vision, writing, \\"Technology is all about big ideas, and this one from Simon Tian will probably need its own aircraft hangar.\\" Cliff Kuang of Wired called the Suite \\"a taste of what computing should be in 2025\\", and the Verge wrote, \\"the idea of putting all the brains and power of mobile computing into something attached to your body instead of in a pocket or bag is wildly attractive.\\" In 2017, Steve Mann, the inventor of the world's first general purpose wearable computer as well as high-dynamic-range imaging (HDR), joined the company as a Chief Scientist. He is commonly referred to as the \\"father of wearable computing\\" by the mainstream press. As of 2018, Neptune is still actively developing the product and aim to release the suite in Q2 2019.

Biography Edmunds was born on 25 April 1813 in Carmarthen and was the daughter of William and Mary Jones. She was raised in a Calvinistic Methodist family and had one brother J. W. Jones. She was educated at a boarding school and also received an education from her home where she acquired a large knowledge of the scriptures. Edmunds was also an avid reader of edifying books and was proficient in Welsh hymnology. She kept diaries in the English language over the next 20 years where she recorded her religious emotions and prayers. Edmunds' extensive knowledge of the language was shown through hymns she had written. Most of the extracts were stern and self- critical. She sought to promote education in Wales, during a period when people were unaware of its importance. She became an Sunday school teacher and throughout her life, was an active and faithful supporter of literary and temperance societies. Edmunds had wanted to work in education from an early age and succeeded in gaining admission to the British and Foreign School Society's Training College in London in March 1847. She was appointed as a teacher at the Society School in Ruthin in October 1847. Edmunds was transferred to Bangor where she started the British School at Garth in January 1849. The following year she married John Edmunds (1815–1886) who was the headteacher of a nearby school. They had two sons. During her time in Bangor, she established a competitive examination that would occur every six weeks between the boys' and girls' schools. Fraternising between pupils of the two schools was discouraged, and unlike the commissioners of the report Treachery of the Blue Books, Edmunds had a strong opinion that the male was as much to be blamed as the female. Edmunds died on 22 March 1858. Her memoirs were published by John Edmunds and J. W. Jones after her death which included an essay. Edmunds was apparently considered an early example of a feminist.

He is known for first hypothesizing and demonstrating the existence of disease-specific circulating nucleic acids as well as first developing techniques for the detection of tumor-related characteristics of circulating DNA and RNA in plasma and serum, or liquid biopsies as this field is now known. Early work Circulating nucleic acids in Plants and Animals In the mid 1960s, Stroun along with colleague, Philip Anker, (also in the Department of Plant Physiology at the University of Geneva) began to study the phenomenon of neoplasms in plants. Building on early grafting studies in plants as well as work by other researchers that demonstrated the transfer of genetic material between bacteria, they hypothesized that a similar phenomenon might occur between bacterial cells and plants. Their research in the late 1960s demonstrated that this process did indeed exist and led them to study whether a similar mechanism occurred in higher-order species, where Stroun published further research showing transfer of genetic material from bacteria to frogs. In an article published in Science, November 10, 1972, bacterial RNA was demonstrated in frog brain cells after a bacterial peritoneal infection. In the April 1973 issue of the Journal of Bacteriology, Stroun showed transcription of spontaneously released bacterial DNA was found to be incorporated into cellular nuclei of frog auricles. In one particular experiment published in the same article, Stroun and his group extracted the auricles of frog hearts and dipped them for several hours in a suspension of bacteria. Afterward, they found a high percentage of RNA-DNA hybridization between bacterial DNA extracted from bacteria of the same species as that used in the experiment and titrated DNA extracted from the auricles which had been dipped in the bacterial suspension. The experiment demonstrated that bacterial DNA had been absorbed by the animal cells. Stroun dubbed this phenomenon has trancession. Extension to humans and cancer Building on their work and taking notice of the work of Henry G. Kunkel, whose group made the association of higher levels of circulating DNA and lupus, Stroun started studying whether circulating DNA could be associated with malignancies such as cancers in humans. In a 1977 issue of International Review of Cytology, Volume 51, Anker and Stroun wrote that when foreign DNA is transcribed into a cell of a different organism, \\"this general biological event is related to the uptake by cells of spontaneously released bacterial DNA, thus suggesting the existence of circulating DNA. In view of the malignant transformations obtained with DNA, the oncogenic (cancer-causing) role of circulating DNA is postulated.\\"1977 issue of International Review of Cytology, Volume 51, Anker and Stroun. In the late 1970s, building on the discovery of circulating DNA in human blood by Mandel and Metais,Mandel P, Métais P: Les acides nucléiques du plasma sanguin chez l'Homme. CR Acad Sci Paris 142: 241–243, 1948. Leon and his collaborators developed a radioimmunoassay for measuring nanogram quantities of nucleic acids in serum. This technique enabled them to observe that cancer patients tended to possess a greater quantity of circulating DNA in serum (on average) than their healthy counterparts. This led Stroun to explore if other methods could be developed to not only detect the overall abundance of nucleic acids in patients with disease (and specifically cancer) but to also detect the disease-specific components of such circulating nucleic acids themselves. Unlike bacterial transformations in plants and animal cells involving clear transfer of separately identifiable nucleic acids, it was not clear how malignancy in cancer arose, although there were many competing theories. Stroun’s postulate that neoplastic malignancy was associated with the presence of tumor specific nucleic acids, led to extensive research by his group of circulating nucleic acids in cancer patients in the late 1980s. Detection of circulating tumor nucleic acids in human cancer patients In the late 1980s and early 1990s cancer researchers such as Bert Vogelstein began demonstrating the association of tumor-specific mutations in certain human cancers, such as RAS mutations in colorectal cancers.Hirai H, Kobayashi Y, Mano H, Hagiwara K, Maru Y, Omine M, Mizoguchi H, Nishida J, Takaku F: A point mutation at codon 13 of the N-ras oncogene in myelodysplastic syndrome\\" Nature 327: 430–432, 1987 Stroun took notice and realized that newly available PCR technologies could be used to possibly detect such RAS mutations in circulation. In fact, his group was one of the first to demonstrate successful detection of such tumor-specific DNA in the circulation of cancer patients.Vasioukhin V, Stroun M, Maurice P, Lyautey J, Lederrey C, Anker P: K-Ras point mutations in the Blood plasma DNA of Patients with colorectal tumors. In: Verna R, Shamoo A (eds) Biotechnology Today, Challenges of Modern Medicine, Ares-Serono Symposia Publications, 1994, Vol 5, pp 141–150. Stroun was also the first to demonstrate the successful detection of alterations beyond point mutations in plasma, such as microsatellite alterations, gene expression changes and copy-number alterations. Circulating Nucleic Acids in Plasma and Serum Congress The early work of Stroun and Anker spurred intense investigation into the relationship of circulating nucleic acids and human conditions, such as disease, trauma, and pregnancy. For example, Lo demonstrated that fetal-specific nucleic acids could be detected in maternal peripheral blood in the late 1990s. As such, the pair organized the first global symposium dedicated to circulating nucleic acid research in 1999 held in Menthon, France. The conference was named CNAPS (Circulating Nucleic Acids in Plasma and Serum) and is held every other year to this day. In fact, the 2015 conference organizers’ welcome address begins, “When our forerunners and field-founders Philippe Anker and Maurice Stroun organized the first event in 1999 in Menthon, France, none of us attendees could have imagined that Circulating Nucleic Acids would be a game changer” Later years In later years, Stroun promoted the development and validation through large clinical studies of cancer diagnostics based on circulating nucleic acid detection. Stroun and Anker would later set up a company, OncoXL, in Geneva to commercialize a cancer diagnostic test, or liquid biopsy, as it later become known, based on the fruits of their multiple decades of research into circulating nucleic acids. In 2005, Stroun’s semi-forgotten pioneering work in circulating nucleic acids was later acknowledged in a compilation of scientists that gave rise to various groundbreaking fields. Maurice Stroun currently serves as an advisor to Guardant Health, a company that has commercialized a comprehensive liquid biopsy based on circulating DNA in peripheral blood.

The film is a co- production between Spain, Morocco, France and Qatar. It was screened in the International Critics' Week section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival where it won the Nespresso Grand Prize. The film shares some footage with Ben Rivers's The Sky Trembles and the Earth is Afraid and the Two Eyes Are Not Brothers and an installation by Artangel that accompanied it: Rivers's film portrays a high-handed Western film-maker working in North Africa, and uses footage of the making of Mimosas.Jonathan Romney, ' Mimosas': Cannes Review', Screen Daily (16 May, 2016), www.screendaily.com/reviews/mimosas-cannes- review/5104037.article.Daniel Kasman, 'Discussing \\"Mimosas\\" with Oliver Laxe', Notebook (13 September 2016), https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/discussing- mimosas-with-oliver-laxe. In the assessment of Jonathan Romney, 'this is partly a consummate figures-in-a-landscape study, with characters – and their accompanying mules – often merging into the vastness of a varied, but usually profoundly inhospitable landscape. But the cast makes striking use of non- professionals, and Laxe has an unerring eye for faces that tell a story.'Jonathan Romney, ' Mimosas': Cannes Review', Screen Daily (16 May, 2016) Summary The film is divided into three sections, named after different prayer positions from the Islamic rakat. Its pace is meditative, with little dialogue or music. It seems to portray two different worlds, implicitly of different temporalities: one characterised by modern dress, battered cars, electricity pylons, and urban life ('perhaps present-day Skoura');Jay Kuehner, 'Mimosas (Oliver Laxe, Spain/Morocco/Qatar/France)', Cinema Scope, 67 (2016) and one characterised by traditional clothing, travel by foot and mules, camp fires and wilderness. In the modern setting, Shakib is characterised as a young, abstracted man, noted for his knowledge of spirituality, who appears to be a mechanic. He is chosen by his boss to ensure a sheikh's successful journey look after one Ahmed, and driven into the desert, towards the Atlas Mountains. In the other setting, a small caravan led by an aged sheikh is travelling towards the ancient (and now ruined) city of Sijilmasa. He seeks to reach his family so that he can die among his loved ones. With the caravan are two wanderers, Ahmed and Saïd, who are initially hoping to rob the caravan. Despite the misgivings of his companions, the sheikh insists on travelling through the mountains in order to shorten their journey. However, he dies in the mountains. For payment, Ahmed and Saïd offer to take his body for inhumation in Sijilmasa while the rest of the caravan turn back. It is at this point that Shakib appears and joins them. Ahmed secretly frees the mule carrying the sheikh's body, hoping to spare himself the journey, but Shakib insists they find it, and gradually the group develops a growing commitment to their purpose. Finding the mule with two more odd travellers, the elderly Mohammed and his mute daughter Ikram, they proceed, and Shakib tries to coax Ahmed into finding inner leadership skills. They enter bandit country, are attacked, and Mohammed is killed. Shakib struggles in his role as spiritual mentor, more than once telling Ahmed 'If you do well, I will do better!' Later, Ahmed tries to abandon the journey, and while the group is fragmented, Saïd and Ikram are attacked: Saïd is killed and Ikram abducted. At this point the film flits increasingly between its two temporalities: it appears that in the modern setting, Ahmed is a junkie, and conceivably that events are in his imagination. Shakib, now mounted and armed with a sword, takes Ahmed on a mission to rescue Ikram, whom we see being tortured to death. The film ends with the two men charging into the bandit camp.

Kurdistan Freedom Party (PAK) and Komalah expressed their support to the Kurdish cause of PDKI as well, with both clashing with Iranian security forces in 2016 and 2017 respectively. In parallel, a leftist Iranian Kurdish rebel group PJAK resumed military activities against Iran in 2016, following a long period of stalemate. The 2016 clashes came following a background of what PDKI described as \\"growing discontent in Rojhelat\\". The commander of the PAK military wing described their engagement and declaration of hostilities against the Iranian government were due to the fact that \\"the situation in eastern Kurdistan (Iranian Kurdistan) has become unbearable, especially with the daily arbitrary executions against the Kurds [in Iran]\\". Background Iran has a significant 8 million strong Kurdish minority, concentrated in the West of the country, many of whom are Sunni. The Kurds spread across the Iranian provinces of West Azerbaijan, Kurdistan, Kermanshah and Ilam. Kurdish separatism is a theme in several Middle Eastern nations, and Kurdish movements have engaged in conflicts also in Syria (Kurds in Syria), Iraq (Kurds in Iraq), and Turkey (Kurds in Turkey) to promote national ambitions. The PDKI had announced the \\"restart [of] armed resistance against the Islamic Republic of Iran\\" on 25 February. The PDKI explained that their return to arms was due to \\"growing discontent in Rojhelat\\". According to Al-Monitor analysis, since March 2015, the PDKI has dispatched several teams of its fighters and political cadets into Iranian Kurdistan. The PDKI announced in March 2016 that it was giving up a two-decade ceasefire with the Iranian government and returning its guerrilla fighters to Iran, but vowed not to initiate hostilities unless attacked. In September 2016, PDKI released a statement that their return to militancy was also motivated by Iran's nuclear deal. Commander of the PAK military wing described their engagement and declaration of hostilities against Iranian government due to the fact that \\"the situation in eastern Kurdistan (Iranian Kurdistan) has become unbearable, especially with the daily arbitrary executions against the Kurds\\". Timeline =2016= On 19 April 2016, PAK's armed Peshmerga units, named Kurdistan Freedom Eagles for East Kurdistan (HAK-R), attacked Iranian government security forces in Sanandaj during annual Army Day Parade of Iran, claiming to have resumed the armed Kurdish national struggle. On 4 May 2016, the PDKI Peshmerga engaged the Iranian security forces in Sardasht area, killing 8-10 soldiers of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. Following the clash, the PDKI announced in its Twitter account that \\"A Peshmerga code of Resistance has been released in Eastern Kurdistan: \\"Lions Hunt, Hyenas Eat the Dead\\"\\". There were reports about the involvement of the Iranian air force in targeting the fighting positions of the rebel group, according to Kurdish sources. On the following day Hussein Yazdanpana, the commander of the military wing of the Kurdistan Freedom Party (PAK) in Iran, told Asharq Alawsat that their force will soon resume military operations against the Iranian government forces, \\"Iran is at the doorstep of a wide-scale armed uprising … that will include all its cities\\". On 20 May 2016, Kurdish groups reported an Iranian military build-up along the Iraqi border, constructing new military forts along its borders with the Kurdistan Region and deploying extra troops to the area. Nine new forts have been built along the border, according to the Kurdish groups. On 20 May, Authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran executed five Kurdish rights activists in the northwestern Urmia city. The Kurdish rights activists Naji Kiwan, Ali Kurdian, Haidar Ramini, Nadir Muhamadi and Ruhman Rashidi were arrested several days earlier on charges of \\"conspiring against the Islamic Republic of Iran\\". On 13 June 2016, it was reported that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps ambushed and killed five members of the PJAK in the country's northwest. The statement of Iran also said that the militants whom the IRGC killed, had assassinated two members of Iran's paramilitary Basiji militia in May 2016, in the border- city of Sardasht, along with an engineer who was working for the IRGC on \\"development projects\\" in border areas. The clash between IRGC and PJAK came after many months of cessation of hostilities between the sides and without explicit announcement of PJAK concerning the Kurdish militant movements' activity since April 2016. On 16 June 2016, 6 IRGC security members including their commander were reportedly killed by Kurdish insurgents of the PDKI in Shno area according to statement of Rostam Jahangiri - head of the PDKI political and military commission. Iranian media reported 8 Kurdish insurgents dead in the event. Iranian artillery fire was reported in the area in the aftermath of the clash and Iranian reinforcements were dispatched into the area. In the aftermath of two day clashes in Shno, the PDKI reported 6 of their members killed, claiming to bring down more than 20 IRGC members and wounded 17. Iranian official statement acknowledged 3 Iranian security members and \\"12 terrorists\\". On 25 June, Iran reported killing 5 Kurdish separatists in West Iran, including \\"two leaders\\". Following a series of continuous engagements and Iranian shellings on PDKI positions in the area, by 27 June both sides claimed dozens of fatalities, but without reliable figures according to Iranian IRNA agency. The same day it was reported that 5 Iraqi Kurdistan civilians in the Soran district were wounded following Iranian shelling of the area. On 28 June, it was reported by Iranian state agencies that 11 Kurdish rebels of the PDKI along with 3 IRGC soldiers were killed in the vicinity of Iran-Iraq border; it was not clear whether cited death toll of Kurdish rebels included the 5 reported two days earlier. The PDKI said several of its fighters and 20 Iranian soldiers were killed in the incidents. According to Kurdish human rights activists in Iranian Kurdistan, Iranian security forces killed two civilians, who were working as porters, overnight on 27 June in Alan area of Sardasht city, West Azerbaijan province of Iran, on the border between Iran and Kurdistan Region. Two militants of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran (PDKI) were killed in clashes with the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) in Sawlawa on 5 July according to PDKI statement. Iranian-government affiliated Fars News Agency also reported the event, claiming the militants were linked with the larger group, 11 of whom were killed a week earlier. According to Iranian state media, on 10 July, an Iranian MP the representative of the county of Eslamabad-e Gharb escaped an assassination attempt in Western Iran. Iranian sources linked the event to PJAK activity in the area. The assassination attempt was reportedly made by 4 militants, during which the governor of Eslamabad-e Gharb and the director general of the fisheries of Kermanshah and other passengers of the vehicle sustained injuries, while the driver and head of the Veterinary Department of Dalahou county were killed in the shooting. According to Al-Arabiya report, the gunmen could not be identified. On 10 August 2016, it was reported that heavy shelling was executed by the IRGC, targeting Iraqi Kurdistan borderline villages. The intense shelling area was at the Sidekan district of Erbil, prompting evacuation of four villages. No deaths were reported at the incident. The attack came two days after IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari visited the Kurdistan and Azerbaijan regions of Iran. On 7 September 2016, according to KDP-I statement, at least 2 KDP-I members were killed in an ambush by Iranian border guards near Sardasht. Iranian state media reported of 8 Kurdish insurgent fatalities. Alater report by Tehran Times claimed 10 militants killed. Reportedly on 16–17 September Iranian security forces arrested 4 Kurdish militants near Marivan. No official statement was issued by Iran in this regard. On 17 September 2016, according to Iraqi Kurdistan media, Iran shelled Kurdistan Region areas adjacent to the Iranian northeastern border, targeting Barbzinan area in Sidakan in the Soran district of Erbil province. The PDKI claimed that Iranian shellings killed an Iranian Kurdish porter and injured another. Reportedly, 70 Iraqi Kurdish families were displaced as a result of the shelling. According to an anonymous report, 2 Iranian security forces were killed on 18 September in the Barimergan area of Piranshahr. One PDKI Peshmerga member was reported by the party to die of his wounds several days after the shellings and clashes. On 20 September 2016, Iraqi Kurdish media reported of 2 IRGC killed in West Azerbaijan province. According to PDKI, on 24 September, their militants launched an offensive on the IRGC \\"major security center\\" at Piranshahr, North-West Iran, claiming to kill \\"more than 30 IRGC members\\" and wounding \\"dozens more\\". According to PDKI's member Sipan Majidi, the attack began with mortar bombardment. The alleged operation was claimed to be a retaliation for Iranian authorities' crackdown on Kurdish activists in western Iran. No announcement was made in regard to this incident by any Iranian authority. Iranian news agencies reported of arresting 4 members and supporters of the PDKI in Marivan, West Iran. On 4 October 2016, Iranian Tasnim news agency reported of an incident in Kurdish-majority area in West Iran, in which 12 militants were killed and 3 IRGC members wounded. PJAK later confirmed the report on armed incident, in which it said several members of the East Kurdistan Defense Forces of PJAK were killed near the Salasbajani town in Kermanshah. On 11 October, PJAK confirmed 12 fatalities from their ranks and published their pictures. On 13 October 2016, PJAK claimed of three cross-border attacks against Iranian security forces and \\"affiliated mercenaries\\", allegedly killing 26-32 Iranian personnel and losing 1 militant. The attacks were claimed to be a revenge for the IRGC ambush on 4 October, where 12 PJAK members were killed. The IRGC commander in Kurdistan province confirmed the outpost had been attacked but said the attackers had failed in their mission. He did not mention any casualties and said YRK members had fled the area. The other attacks have not been confirmed by the IRGC, nor have they been reported on in the Iranian press. On 15 October 2016, PDKI claimed to have killed 8 Iranian security forces in clashes on the previous day in Northwestern Iran. In December a double bombing took place in Koya in Iraqi Kurdistan, targeting the offices of the KDP-I politburo and resulting in seven killed. The incident was described by Iraqi Kurdistan as an \\"act of terror\\", while KDP-I blamed Iranian authorities for the bombings. =2017= On 19 March, it was reported that 2 IRGC soldiers were killed by the Zagros Eagles militant group, while another attack in Meriwan caused severe injuries to another IRGC member. The PDKI confirmed the clashes, but claimed that Zagros Eagles are an independent organization. On 21 March 2017, six Kurdish Iranian opposition armed groups, considered illegal by the Iranian government, convened to coordinate their military actions. Those included Komalah, PDKI, KDP Iran branch and three more organizations. In May 2017, Komalah party moved from support to mobilization of its troops along the Iranian Kurdistan border, aiming to resume armed struggle against the Islamic Republic. On 23 May, a clash near Turkish–Iranian border between PKK and Iranian security forces produced 3 casualties to PKK according to their own statement. According to Fars News Agency on 28 May, Iranian border guards commander Qassem Rezayee said that Iranians \\"consider Turkey responsible, and the country should account for this act.\\" Turkish media accused the PJAK in that attack (stating it is as offshoot of PKK), claiming the rebels killed 2 Iranian guards and wounded 7. In late June 2017, a clash between Iranian security and Komalah party militants resulted in the death of 3 Komalah Peshmerga. In early July 2017, subsequent Iranian bombardments on Komala positions resulted in 2 Komala militants and 1 Iraqi Kurdistani civilian wounded, in line with depopulation of three Kurdish villages in Iraqi Kurdistan. In July 2017, Iran reported of border clash in which IRGC forces killed three \\"terrorists\\", wounded four others and detained one in a clash, while a Guard member was killed and another wounded in the evening of 20 July clash. In early September 2017, large protests erupted in Kurdish cities in West Iran following the killing of two Kurdish men by Iranian security forces at the border. These protests were met with tear gas and gunfire, with hundreds arrested. Following the September 2017 Iraqi Kurdistan Independence Referendum, hundreds of thousands of Iranian Kurds gathered throughout the Kurdish cities of Iran to celebrate the event in support of the event. The crackdown by Iranian security was however prompt, with anti-riot forces and tanks being sent into Kurdish cities and over 700 civilians detained. On 3 November, eight Iranian border guards and a \\"large number of terrorists\\" were killed in a clash between Iranian security and PJAK militants according to Iranian sources. Later Iranian report indicated that among the killed Iranians - 5 were border guards and 3 were civil employees. According to the Iranian semi-official Fars News agency, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Monday (4 December 2017) that an Iranian border guard was killed and four others were injured in Maku, Iran, near the border with Turkey. Turkey claimed the attack was conducted by forces from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Daily Sabah also blamed the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK), the Iranian wing of the PKK. \\"The survivors sought help from the Turkish side and the injured were airlifted to hospitals here,\\" reported Daily Sabah. \\"A soldier succumbed to his wounds at the hospital.\\" The Turkish media agency reported the injured included \\"engineers working on an irrigation project\\" and \\"soldiers were providing security.\\" In early December 2017, 3 Kurdish smugglers were reported killed by Iranian security in Urmia Province according to Kurdish Hawar News, while another Kurdish smuggler was wounded in another incident in the Kaiman Bahurman village; In Zanjan province a Kurdish trader from Suqis was \\"seriously wounded,\\" according to Hawar News. =2018= In early January the IRGC issued announcement on the death of three members of the force, after insurgent attack; the PDKI peshmerga claimed on the other hand of inflicting 6 fatalities on the IRGC during a clash in West Iran. In early March, two PDKI commanders were assassinated in Iraqi Kurdistan, with the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence accused by pro-PDKI sources of being behind the attacks. In July, militants blew up an ammunition dump and killed eleven Iranian border guards stationed at an Iran–Iraq border post in Marivan County. Several militants were killed in return. On 12 August, it was reported that 20 people were killed in heavy clashes between the IRGC and the PDKI. Reportedly, the IRGC claimed of killing 10 Kurdish militants, not specifying its own casualties. PDKI claimed that its armed guerrillas killed 12 IRGC troops, also not specifying their own casualties. On 7 September, the IRGC claimed killing 6 Kurdish militants at the vicinity of the Iraqi border, allegedly belonging to an organization responsible for the July attack. On 8 September, the Iranian IRGC forces performed a missile attack on Kurdish party headquarters of PDKI and KDP-I in Iraqi Kurdistan, killing at least 11 people, wounding 50 more. The weapons used were reportedly Fateh 110-bs with a 300 km range. Iraqi Foreign Ministry issued a statement criticizing Iran’s attack, as harming Iraq's sovereignty. =2019= On 17 March 2019, one Iranian border guard was killed in clashes near the border with the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Another such incident happened on 15 March 2019 as well, but no casualties from this incident have been reported yet. It is not yet confirmed whether the perpetrators were Kurdish groups. On 2 May 2019, the PAK accused the Federal Government of Iraq of handing over one of its former fighters to Iran. In early July, Iran announced killing 5 militants in the Iranian Kurdistan border region with Iraq, while losing 1 IRGC dead. The incident came as a retaliation for the killing of 3 IRGC members in Piranshahr on July 9, 2019. On 12 July 2019, the Iranian Kurdish Kurdistan Freedom Party (PAK) announced that they had captured an alleged Iranian agent. =2020= On 5 May 2020, an IRGC commander was killed along with two other IRGC soldiers in Kurdistan Province by \\"anti-revolutionary elements\\". On 29 May 2020, three Iranian border guards were killed in clashes with \\"bandits\\" during a patrol near Sardasht, West Azerbaijan Province. On 16 June 2020, the Iranian military began shelling Kurdish militants in northern Iraq, joining Turkey's Operations Claw-Eagle and Claw-Tiger. On 23 June 2020, clashes between security forces and Kurdish militant groups in the village of Kuran, near the capital city of West Azerbaijan Province, left three IRGC soldiers dead. Belligerents The Kurdish separatist movements of PAK and KDPI were the first to initiate insurgency in the first half of 2016. In October 2016, PJAK separately announced to resume its militant activities, which have largely been postponed since 2011 unilateral cease fire. On 23 October 2016, the leader of Komala party Abdullah Muhtadi called the movements of East Kurdistan to form a joint front in order to \\"merge their separate enclaves is necessary in order to face their common enemy—Iran\\". Komalah officially announced initiation of militant activity in June 2017. On behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the security forces involved in fighting include the Revolutionary Guards units, the Basij and the Islamic Republic of Iran Border Guard Command. Foreign involvement Amidst of Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict, Iranian authorities blame Saudi intelligence agency for supporting the unrest however Saudi officials deny involvement. According to a Stratfor analysis, PAK and KDPI have appealed directly to Riyadh in their calls for funding and \\"countries with a vested interest in exacerbating Iran's domestic problems—such as Saudi Arabia may agree to help the Kurds\\". Saudi Arabia may have been providing financial support to all three Kurdish insurgent groups through its consulate in the Iraqi Kurdistan, which is newly opened.

Many types of programs have been implemented with the goal of reducing recidivism and have been found to be effective for this purpose. Consideration for the conditions of the communities formerly incarcerated individuals are re-entering, which are often disadvantaged, is a fundamental part of successful re-entry. A 2006 study done by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation statistically evaluated the effectiveness of prisoner reentry programs on the criteria scale of working, not working, promising, and unknown. Findings classify employment-oriented programs as working, drug rehabilitation programs as working, educational programs as promising, and halfway house programs as working. A 2015 article from the New York Times Magazine commented, \\"It wasn’t until the mid-2000s that this looming 'prisoner re-entry crisis' became a fixation of sociologists and policy makers, generating a torrent of research, government programs, task forces, nonprofit initiatives and conferences now known as the 're-entry movement'.\\"  Resources for prisoner re-entry programs  In the past few decades, correctional institutions have seen a shift, with prisoners serving indeterminate sentences and release being assessed by parole boards, to offenders being released from prison after serving determinate sentences. Although, those released are not receiving sufficient preparation for returning to their communities due to limited in-prison and post-release reentry programs; this inadequate structure for re-entry directly influences the possibility of recidivism, also referred to as the \\"revolving door.\\" United States spending for corrections is approximately $80 billion a year, with re-entry receiving the least amount of fiscal attention relative to other parts of the criminal justice system process. From 2001 to 2004, the United States' federal government allocated over $100 million for reentry programs. Without increased, resources for this target area proportional to that spent on control-oriented aspects of incarceration, the issue that remains is the expansion of access and participation for inmates. While the area of reentry program development is still growing, assessments demonstrate their efficacy for transitioning ex-offenders back into society and reducing recidivism. The potential for well-resourced reentry program has yet to be realized, but public policy and criminal justice scholars believe this to be a deserving area for funding to be re-allocated and prioritized.  Kinds of re-entry programs  = Employment = With approximately 2 million people incarcerated, the prison population constitutes a large portion of the U.S. labor force. An essential argument for putting prisoners to work is in-prison productivity translating to preparation for entering the workforce post- release. Prison labor is cost-effective for tax payers, allows prisoners to contribute to their families from inside through the generation of income, and can be a form of restorative justice for victims. Poor resources and a prison infrastructure unfit for large-scale labor serve as barriers for establishing effective employment re-entry programs in-prison and post-release, which would include making livable wages, vocational training, education, and skill development accessible to the U.S. prison population. Current funding levels only have the capacity to provide a small percentage of prisoners the opportunity to engage in \\"commercially rewarding work.\\" The \\"Returning Home Study\\" conducted by the Urban Institute from 2001 to 2006 found that ex- prisoners who worked before imprisonment, and those who find employment soon after release, are less likely to be re-incarcerated within a year of release. The same study found that releasing prisoners to parole supervision both reduces the likelihood that they will engage in substance use and makes it easier for them to find employment after release.  Programs assisting ex- offenders to find employment  * The Safer Foundation * Project RIO (Re- Integration of Offenders) * The Corrections Clearinghouse * The Center for Employment Opportunities * = Housing = In a study from New Zealand, the ability to secure stable housing was found to reduce the likeliness of recidivism by 20 percent. Housing providers struggle to make housing available to ex-offenders because of safety concerns and failure to accommodate to the specific needs of formerly individuals without guaranteed income or access to social welfare support. In New York City, \\"more than 54 percent of people released from prison moved straight into the city's shelter system in 2017.\\" Across the country, initiatives are being made to assist ex-offenders find housing. * In Alameda County, California, homeowners are partnering with formerly incarcerated individuals and allowing them to rent. At Impact Justice, ex-offenders are paired with homeowners for housing and guidance for reintegration. * In Delaware, a commission was created to increase access and support for Delaware state inmates to secure housing and employment. * In Washington state, the Tacoma Housing Authority is offering housing assistance for ex-offender, at-risk college students. * In Seattle and Washington D.C., landlords are no longer allowed to screen for felony convictions on rental applications. = Healthcare = Other reentry programs focus on improving health among ex-prisoners, which tends to be significantly worse than that of people who have never been imprisoned.  Re-entry for women prisoners  Women prisoners and formerly incarcerated women are advocating for the need for gender-specific re-entry programs in-prison and post-release, specifically focused on healthcare, substance abuse, mental illness, and family reunification. For women prisoners concerned about family reunification post- release, comes with challenges of securing housing and employment, necessary for meeting child welfare requirements. In cases where these requirements cannot be met, women ex-offenders claim to benefit from rehabilitative counseling to deal with the strain incarceration has on the relationship between mothers and children.  Juvenile Re-entry  Juveniles in the justice system often require different treatment and consideration than their adult counterparts. While there is constantly ongoing debate about the ways in which juvenile punishment should be given (whether it should be the same level of severity or differ in approach), often in the form of policy and moral debate, one of the most common methods of responding to juvenile offense is placing juveniles in re-entry programs. Juvenile Reentry is a culmination of services, often presented in the form of programs, that help to reintegrate displaced juveniles back into the community. These programs are often designed to discourage juvenile delinquency and prevent such crimes from happening again. Juvenile Re-entry programs involve many stages with each stage playing its own role in helping the juvenile to reform. There is the entry phase, placement phase, transitional phase, and community-based aftercare phase. Each of these stages involves varying degrees of supervision over the juvenile while the delinquent is given safer surroundings and taught valuable lessons and ways of life that ultimately will help them to be a more valuable and safe addition to the community.

The will was the subject of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court case Harvard College v. Amory, which led to the Prudent man rule; left a bequest to Massachusetts General Hospital which led to McLean Hospital being named after him; and established the McLean Professor of Ancient and Modern History, a professorship at Harvard University.  Biography  John McLean was born in 1761. The exact date is unknown. His birthplace was likely Milton, Massachusetts where his mother's parents had settled.Cullen, James Bernard, The Story of the Irish in Boston: Together with Biographical Sketches of Representative Men and Noted Women 189 (1889). However, the Milton record of births does not list John McLean's birth in the town.Milton Records: Births, Marriages and Deaths 1662-1843 (1900). John McLean. an only child, attended the Milton public schools. On October 15, 1795 he bought a house for $8,000 on the Franklin Street Crescent that had been designed by Charles Bulfinch.Place, Charles A., Charles Bulfinch, Architect and Citizen 64 (1968). On February 14, 1796, at King's Chapel, Boston, he married Ann Amory, one of the eleven children of John Amory. McLean was a merchant, who partnered with Isaac Davenport. He worked from offices on Long Wharf while ingraining himself in Boston society, becoming a member of the Massachusetts (Boston) Chapter of the Masonic Society,The Universal Masonic Library, A Republication, in Thirty Volumes, of all the Standard Publications in Masonry, vol. IV 155 (1855). and one of the original shareholders of the Manufacturers' and Mechanics' Bank in 1814 and the City Bank of Boston in 1822.Davis, William Thomas, Professional and Industrial History of Suffolk County Massachusetts vol. II 246 and 256 (1894). It appears that McLean led a boom and bust merchant's life, his fortunes hitting a low at the end of the eighteenth century. Between December 1799 and January 1800, eight ships whose insurance was in part underwritten by him were taken by French privateers.Committee on Claims, French Spoliations: A Condensed Report of the Findings of the Court of Claims in Each Case Named in the Proposed Amendment by Senator Lodge to H.R. 19115 (1912). Some accounts state that McLean went bankrupt; others that he almost went bankrupt, but was saved financially by the arrival of a ship thought lost.Bator, Thomas E. and Seely, Heidi A., The Boston Trustee: The Lives, Laws & Legacy of a Vital Institution 21 (2015). McLean continued his business interests and it is said that he made $100,000 in a single speculation on molasses at the time of the War of 1812. In 1823, the year of his death, John McLean placed mile markersMilestones In and Near Boston six through ten out from Boston to his birthplace, Milton, Massachusetts. His business partner, Isaac Davenport, completed the work after McLean's death and had McLean's name inscribed on the stones. As of 2016, the stones still exist.Verified by Thomas E. Bator April 2016. John McLean died a wealthy and well-regarded man on October 23, 1823, leaving an estate of $228,120. His reputation at his death had matured to the point that it was said after his passing, \\"Mr. McLean was a truly noble specimen of a Boston Merchant.\\"Bowditch, Nathaniel I., A History of the Massachusetts General Hospital 64 (1872).  Legacy  Mile marker placed by McLeanMcLean's will contained an important flaw when it was originally written. The will dated August 13, 1821 was drafted and was witnessed by Lemuel Shaw. It did not contain a residuary clause to dispose of the rest of the estate after the specific bequests. This oversight was corrected in a codicil dated September 18, 1822, one year before McLean’s death, leaving everything not specifically disposed of to the Massachusetts General Hospital. The will is transcribed in its entirely at Bator, Thomas E. and Seely, Heidi A., The Boston Trustee: The Lives, Laws & Legacy of a Vital Institution 21 (2015). The Trust established for his wife, Ann, and Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard College was subject to two Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court cases, including the famous Harvard College v. Amory Case. The history of the Massachusetts General Hospital states that the residuary gift by McLean proved to be over $90,000.Bowditch, Nathaniel I., A History of the Massachusetts General Hospital 67 (1872). The bequest and residue from McLean was by far the largest amount that was given to the Hospital prior to 1851; it is listed in the Hospital’s records as being valued at $119,858.20. The Massachusetts General Hospital Board of Trustees gave Ann McLean a bed at the Hospital free for life. Next, the Hospital Board commissioned Gilbert Stuart to paint a portrait of McLean (A second portrait was commissioned for Ann McLean which is now owned by Harvard University). Finally, the Hospital considered renaming the Hospital in McLean’s name. In the end, McLean’s name was given to the Massachusetts General Hospital insane asylum, now known as McLean Hospital. Ironically, the Asylum’s administrative building was housed in a house designed by the same Charles Bulfinch who had designed the Franklin Crescent house that McLean bought in 1795. Nathaniel I. Bowditch, the son of Nathaniel Bowditch and historian of the Hospital, reported: “On the other hand the corporate name remained unchanged, many sons and daughters of Massachusetts have since contributed to it as a State institution, what perhaps they would have hesitated to bestow, if it had born the name of a private founder.”Bowditch, Nathaniel I., A History of the Massachusetts General Hospital 77 (1872). John McLean, his wife Ann, his parents, Hugh and Agnes McLean, and her brother/trustee, Francis, are buried in a tomb at the Milton Cemetery in Milton, Massachusetts. The tomb was deconstructed by the cemetery for safety reasons and the graves are now marked by the lintel which reads \\"F. Amory, A.D. 1842\\" and the original tombstone: THE TOMB OF JOHN MCLEAN HUGH McLEAN, died December, 1799, aged 75 years. AGNES McLEAN, died March, 1821, aged 82 years.

AAMC alleged collusion to prevent American trainee doctors from negotiating for better working conditions. The working conditions of medical residents often involved 80- to 100-hour workweeks. The suit had some early success, but failed when the U.S. Congress enacted a statute exempting matching programs from federal antitrust laws. Background Every year, American medical students and graduates participate along with foreign-trained physicians in a national matching plan to obtain a position in an accredited resident training program. Applicants and programs that participate in the matching plan submit rank-ordered preferences for training. A mathematical algorithm is used to place an applicant in a preferred program that also prefers the applicant. The National Resident Matching Program, also referred to as \\"The Match\\", is one of several national matching plans in the United States. Lawsuit The suit was launched on behalf of all current and former medical residents against defendants that oversaw and participated in the matching process as well as institutions that employed medical residents. The three physicians who launched the suit alleged that the NRMP Matching program was an anti-competitive practice, claiming that: * fourth-year medical students were required to apply to the Match, and had no opportunity to negotiate their terms of employment with teaching hospitals (if they did not apply, they could not enter a residency accredited by the ACGME, and hence could not become certified as physicians by an ABMS- recognized board, meaning that they cannot practice their specialty) * the defendants limited the number of residency positions available in U.S. teaching hospitals * the defendants placed \\"substantial obstacles to the ability of a resident to transfer employment from one employer to another during the period of a residency\\" * the ACGME encouraged or required participation in the Match as a condition of accreditation for institutions offering residencies. * the defendants shared information on conditions of employment, and reviewed them in order to keep salaries low.Jung v. Association of American Medical Colleges: A Special Interest Victory , Miranda W. Turner, University of Houston Law Center,November 2, 2004 The defendants challenged the admissibility of the lawsuit with several arguments, including a lack of jurisdiction and that the plaintiffs had not been injured. The court dismissed the cases against two defendants for lack of jurisdiction, and three because the claims of conspiracy did not involve them. The federal district court did allow the case to proceed against 17 defendants, ruling: > ... the Court finds that plaintiffs adequately have alleged a common > agreement to displace competition in the recruitment, hiring, employment and > compensation of resident physicians and to impose a scheme of restraints > that has the purpose and effect of fixing, artificially depressing, > standardizing and stabilizing resident physician compensation and other > terms of employment among certain defendants. Legislative change The lawsuit ended when Congress enacted legislation as a rider added to an unrelated bill (the Pension Funding Equity Act) that exempted participation in a matching program from federal antitrust laws. The rider was called \\"Confirmation of antitrust status of graduate medical resident matching programs\\" (Section 207). Neither the rider nor the then- ongoing Jung v. AAMC case was debated. The rider was lobbied for by the AAMC and the American Hospital Association, and sponsored by Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts. Senators Kohl, Feingold, and Bingaman publicly criticized the way in which the rider was added. The rider praised the 50-year-old Matching Program, saying that \\"[a]ntitrust lawsuits challenging the matching process, regardless of their merit or lack thereof, have the potential to undermine this highly efficient, pro-competitive, and long standing process\\" and \\"would divert the scarce resources of our country's teaching hospitals and medical schools from their crucial missions of patient care, physician training, and medical research\\" The bill containing the rider was signed into law by President George W. Bush on April 8, 2004. The new law prohibited \\"using allegations related to the Match to support any antitrust claim\\", retroactively. The court ruled that the plaintiff's case was dependent on allegations related to the Match. The case was dismissed under the authority of the new law.

The visitor reception centre for the national monument was inaugurated on 2 June 2015 by governor Marcelo Miranda. It had administrative headquarters, bathrooms, male and female quarters, an auditorium and parking. This would make it possible for students to stay overnight. Conservation The unit lies in the Tocantins cerrado. The objectives are to support scientific work and research, and to protect and conserve the palaeontological and biological diversity of the site. The monument holds the most important petrified forest in the southern hemisphere from the Permian period, which lasted from 299 to 250 million years ago. Some of the fossilized plants are tree ferns. At the end of the Permian there was a mass extinction of flora and fauna in which about 90% or marine species and 70% of land species disappeared.

The Defence  The Indian Mutiny began in the Garrison town of Meerut in early May 1857, and the rampaging mutineers reached Delhi on the morning of 10 May, intent on capturing the great magazine and the vast amount of warlike stores. On 11 May Deputy Assistant Commissary John Buckley, Lieutenants Forrest, Willoughby and Raynor, Conductors Shaw and Scully, plus 3 others of the Bengal Ordnance Department defended Magazine for more than five hours against thousands of rebels. After the mutineers had stormed the Palace, the gates of the Magazine were closed and barricaded. Inside the gates were placed 6 pounder Cannon, double charged with grape. For the further defence of the Gate and the Magazine, there was a 24 pounder Howitzer, which could be aimed at any part of the Magazine, which was operated by Buckley. The native Garrison was then armed, but it was clear that they too were on the verge of mutiny as the men refused to obey any orders issued by Europeans. The 9 Europeans decided to defend the Magazine for as long as possible in the hope that relief would come from Meerut, then, if all was lost, to blow up the Magazine and themselves, rather than allow the rebels to seize an Army’s worth of munitions. A train of gunpowder was laid by Buckley and Scully, ready to be fired on a pre—arranged signal, which was that of Buckley raising his hat from his head, on the order given by Willoughby. The gunpowder was to be fired by Scully, but not until the last round from the howitzer had been fired. When the mutineers placed scaling ladders against the wall the whole of the native establishment deserted by climbing up the sloped roofs on the inside of the Magazine and descending the ladders to the outside, after which the enemy appeared in great numbers on the top of the walls. The defenders kept up an incessant fire of grape on them, but it was clear that all was lost. Seeing that the situation was hopeless, Buckley and his comrades took the decision to blow up the arsenal, and consequently themselves, to save the vast quantities of arms and ammunition from falling into rebel hands. On being directed by the severely wounded Lt Willoughby, Conductor Buckley raised his hat as the signal and Conductor Scully took a lighted fuse into the Magazine causing it to ignite. The resulting explosion was the largest ever known and was heard 40 miles away in Meerut. The Magazine simply disintegrated and around a thousand mutineers were killed in the devastating blast.  The Aftermath  Conductors Shaw and Scully, Sub- Conductor Crow, Sergeants Edwards and Stewart were all killed in the blast. A friendly native guided Lieutenant Raynor to safety. Rebels killed Lieutenant Willoughby some two days later whilst he was trying to reach Meerut. Lieutenant Forrest, who was also wounded, reached Meerut after much hardship. In the smoke and confusion Buckley, although severely wounded and blasted almost black by gunpowder, had initially managed to escape the rebels as he was blown clear over the walls and into the River Jumna. He came under heavy rifle fire and he was hit in the elbow. Being already wounded and near exhaustion he collapsed on the far bank and was captured. On learning that his wife and 3 children had been mercilessly slaughtered in the city he broke down, being so distressed that he wanted to die himself and tried to provoke his captors to kill him. However, the rebel leaders had been so impressed with the gallant actions of the defenders in the Magazine that they refused to kill such a brave man. After some weeks he was able to escape and made a safe passage to British lines.

The unit maintains a database of all known archaeological monuments and sites in the Republic of Ireland that date from before 1700 with few selected monuments of the post-1700 period. The database has more than 138,800 records related to archaeological monuments. The Archaeological Survey of Ireland was founded first in 1930 by the National Monuments Advisory Council when the National Monuments Act 1930 came into effect. A central archive was established in 1933 under the direction of the Inspector of National Monuments, Harold G. Leask, to collect published materials about all archaeological sites and monuments.Carey 2003, p. 30. After refounding the Archaeological Survey of Ireland in 1963, field surveys began with County Louth in 1965.Haworth 1975, pp. 7, 12. The compilation of the Sites and Monuments Record (SMR) started in 1982 with per-county lists that were completed in 1992. These lists were later used for the statuary Record of Monuments and Places (RMP) that was established by the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994,See § 12 (1) in consisting of brief per-county lists and associated maps.Lynch 2008, p. 11. In 1982, the Commissioners of Public Works decided to publish a series of archaeological inventories, designed to be comprehensive listings of all sites but providing only very brief summaries. The inventories came with the hope to raise awareness for the monuments to defend against the increasing destruction of vulnerable sites.Buckley 1986, p. ix. The series started in 1986 with County Louth. Currently, it consists of 21 volumes, covering, at least partially, 16 of the 26 traditional counties of the Republic.See the list of Archaeological Inventories: . The most recent inventories were published in 2009 for South Kerry and Cork (vol. 5). In a subsequent phase, a series of much more detailed archaeological surveys was to be published. Currently, only one such volume, covering County Louth, was published by the government in 1989 that was inspired by the previously published archaeological surveys for two Ulster counties: County Down (1966) and County Donegal (1983).Buckley and Sweetman 1991, p. 1.

It is used to determine anxiolytic properties of drugs. The VCT predicts drugs that can manage generalized anxiety disorders and acute anxiety states.  Conditioning  Suppressing behaviour through punishment is commonly used to determine the anxiolytic properties of drugs. During the VCT, animals are punished by electrical shocks when trying to get either food or water. Therefore, the number of times the animal goes to get food or water decreases. When anxiolytic drugs are injected, the number of times animals go up to get food or water increases, even though the animal will still be punished.  Procedure  Mouse Operant Conditioning Chamber with Food Dispenser Experiments are done in a mouse operant conditioning chamber. Conditioning chambers are used to train animals to do simple tasks such as pulling a lever or pushing a button. The animals can be rewarded or punished for doing these tasks. The original method by VCT included 48 hours of water deprivation and then a mild electrical shock every 20 licks when finally given water. Modern versions of the test are less severe. Water deprivation is 18 hours or water is provided for 1 hour a day for four days before beginning the test. Electrical shock is only given for a 3-5 minute time period. The VCT can be done with food deprivation too. Before beginning the test animals must be acclimated to the cage and food pellets. The conditioning chamber must be checked to ensure everything is in working order. On Day 1 animals are placed in the conditioning chamber. Whenever the animal pulls the lever, a food pellet will drop. This takes place for 8 hours. Then the animal is placed back in its cage. Any animal that is unable to eat 15 or more food pellets is either removed from the experiment or receives further training, In Day 2 the animal is injected with saline and then placed back into the conditioning chamber. It is placed there and observed for 1 hour. On Day 3 animals are injected with the agent being tested. They are divided into two groups. One group is taken one by one and placed in the chamber. When they push the lever, they will receive a mild electrical shock. The other group is also placed in the apparatus but does not receive an electrical shock when they push the lever. The group that is injected with the agent but not shocked sets a baseline for the experiment. Dose dependent responses can be tested using the baseline. Following long term administration of the agent, animals should be observed to determine any potential rebound or withdrawal effects.  Criticisms  Since conditions such as anxiety are idiopathic, animal models are difficult to create and therefore flawed. However animal models can be pharmacologically validated by usually by benzodiazepines, a common anti anxiety medication. Other drugs that are known to treat anxiety such as SSRIs which theoretically increase number of responses, show no effect in the VCT. The VCT can give false positives. If the shock the animals are receiving is too low, then animals might ignore the shock and continue to get food or water which can skew results. Drugs that increase thirst or appetite can give inconsistent results. Animal training can take time. If doing the VCT using food, animals must be trained to be able to pull the lever for the food dispenser and accept the pellet. If using water, animals must be trained to be able to push the button and drink water. Because of this, etiological tests which observe spontaneous fears are usually preferred by researchers. Lab personnel must be trained to avoid injury or disease to the animals. Animal housing has well known effects on stress. The original Vogel study did not specify if animals were group housed or individually housed. Modern studies therefore use both types of housing which can have different results. Different animal models can show different anxiety results. Animals can show high levels of anxiety in one test and low levels in a different test. The VCT, which measures anxiety through decreased consumption, cannot be compared directly to tests such as the open field or plus maze that measure anxiety through locomotion activity.

It may have been called “the Snake has Turned” in antiquity, as it has ú-ta-ar MUŠ inscribed at the top edge at the beginning. It is extant on two unprovenanced tablets, designated ATablet A, VAT 5946, VS 10, 214, in the Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin. and B,Tablet B, unknown siglum and present whereabouts, RA 15, 159ff the latter of which includes a request for eternal life for king Ḫammu-rāpī, on the fifth column, 26th line, for whom it is thought to have been composed as an epic hymn of celebration of “the mad dancer in battle”. It is arranged into ten kirugú-stanzas (Akkadian: šēru) and six ĝešgiĝal-antiphons as lyrical retorts, the numbering of which suggest that the work extends over the two tablets, although the second may not be the actual sequel of the first as the first is an eight column tablet while the second only has six columns and there are apparently subtle differences in late Old Babylonian cursive cuneiform distinguishing them, suggesting tablet A is the younger copy. The text Among the most difficult literary texts in Old Babylonian, the work opens lu- na-i-id šu-ur-bu-ta, “let me praise the greatest”. Ištar, the goddess of fertility and war, is terrifying to the gods with her wild, ferocious and \\"virile\\" antics. “She dances around gods and kings in her manliness” and “young men are cut off as if for spears.” The god Ea, who is angered by her outrageous behavior, fashions a suitable counterfoil, Ṣāltum, “discord” out of the dirt beneath his fingernails, to provide her with distraction, somewhat reminiscent of the purpose of Enkidu in the Epic of Gilgamesh. Ea tells Ṣāltum he has created her to humiliate Ištar and sends this ferocious beast to challenge her. Much of the subsequent text is fragmentary, however the adversaries seem to engage in a protracted whirling dance of battle. Finally, Ištar entreats Ea to save her from this monstrous virago, “May she return to her cave! Ea opened his mouth and the hero of the gods spoke to Agušaya: ‘to be sure, as soon as you said it, I will do (it).’” With Ištar's taming, Ea proposes the instigation of an annual Ištar festival, providing an explanation for the origin of the guštum, a whirling dance performed during the festivities, commemorating the war-like character of Ištar. =Principal publications= * line art for Agušaya A * translation of Agušaya A * transliteration and translation of Agušaya A and B * * reproduces her 1972 dissertation transliteration and translation of Agušaya A * * translation * transliteration and translation of Agušaya A and B * * provides philological notes to his new translations posted online at SEAL references 2.1.5.1 and 2.1.5.2.

He was brother to Thietmar of Merseburg, whose Chronicon was the main source of information on him, and his predecessor Henry, Count of Walbeck. Frederick was the first recorded Burggraf of Magdeburg. Frederick and his brother Henry accompanied their cousin Werner, Margrave of the Nordmark, and \\"other excellent warriors\\" in their abduction of Reinhild, the mistress of Beichlingen, from her fortress at Quedlinburg. Werner was captured by the forces of the abbess, but apparently neither Friedrick nor Henry were charged. Frederick supported Werner in his quarrel with Dedo I of Wettin, although it is not clear that he participated in his murder. The years before Dedo's death were overshadowed by a feud with the Counts of Walbeck. When his father-in-law Dietrich was deposed as the Margrave of the Nordmark, Dedo claimed the office of margrave for himself. The office was granted instead to Lothair I, Freidrick's uncle. Dedo I was involved in the devastation of the castle of Wolmirstedt which was in the possession of the Counts of Walbeck. Dedo's dispute with the House of Walbeck continued with Lothair's son and successor as margrave Werner. Dedo was killed by Werner on 13 November 1009, along with his vassals, near Mose at the confluence of the Tange and Elbe rivers. Friedrick married to Thietburga, born of an unknown family. Friedrick and Thietuerga had two children: * Conrad, Count of Walbeck and Viscount of Magdeburg * Brigida, Abbess of the Monastery of St. Lawrence at Magdeburg. (Bridida's parentage is described in two ways by Thietmar. She either the daughter of Frederick or that of his uncle Lothar.) Upon Friedrick's death, his son assumed the titles of Count of Walbeck and Viscount of Magdeburg.

Life  Janina Hescheles' father, Henryk Hescheles, was a journalist in Lwów and publisher of the Polish-language Zionist periodical Chwila.Chwila, by YIVO. Her mother was registrar at a hospital on Józef-Dwernicki Street, and after the outbreak of World War II also served as a nurse. The family lived with her grandparents in the Jewish Quarter of Lwów, a city which at the time was about one-fourth Jewish.Mit den Augen eines zwölfjährigen Mädchens, 1963, p. 153.Mały Rocznik Statystyczny 1939 (Polish statistical yearbook of 1939), GUS, Warsaw, 1939. When Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Hescheles' uncle, Marian Hemar, a brother of her father, was able to flee from Warsaw to Great Britain. In 1939, under terms of the Nazi-Soviet Pact, Lwów was annexed to the Soviet Union, becoming part of Soviet Ukraine. The day after the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 and conquered Lwów, Hescheles' father was murdered in a pogrom perpetrated by the Ukrainian population of Lwów.Mit den Augen eines zwölfjährigen Mädchens, 1963, pp. 151–189. However, another uncle, Stanisław Lem, managed to conceal his Jewish heritage and survived. Janina Hescheles and her mother survived the pogrom. Then they and Hescheles' grandparents and other relatives were imprisoned by the Nazis and forced to work in the German armaments factories. However, with help from the writer Michał Borwicz and the Polish resistance organization Żegota, she was able to escape from the Janowska concentration camp in October 1943. Janina was hidden by various families from Kraków (Cracow) in an orphanage in Poronin, in southern Poland. Three weeks after her escape, with encouragement from Borwicz, Janina Hescheles began writing a memoir of their persecution in Lwów. In 1946, soon after the war ended, it was published in Polish as Oczyma dwunastoletniej dziewczyny (\\"Through the Eyes of a 12-year-old girl\\") by the Organization of Polish Jews in Kraków. Later on, a German translation, Mit den Augen eines zwölfjährigen Mädchens, was published in East Germany (1958) and in West Germany (1963). SInce 2011 it was published in ten different languages. In 1950, Hescheles emigrated to Israel, where she eventually earned a doctorate in chemistry at Technion (the Israeli Institute of Technology). She married the physicist Kalman Altman, and they had two sons. Hescheles (now Janina Altman) continued to work at Technion and the Weizmann Institute of Science, and also at the Technical University of Munich, Germany. Her research has been published in several English and German scientific journals. Since the First Intifada (1987-1991), she has supported the pacifist group Women in Black.Women in Black, website.

He has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Moray since 2017 and was previously a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Highlands and Islands region from 2016 to 2017. Born in Aberdeen, Ross was educated at Forres Academy. After graduating from the Scottish Agricultural College, he worked on a dairy farm. A member of the Scottish Liberal Democrats in his youth, he switched to the Scottish Conservatives and began his political career as a Scottish Parliament researcher and then a councillor in Moray. He stood unsuccessfully for the Moray UK Parliament constituency in the 2010 and 2015 general elections and for the Scottish Parliament constituency in 2011 and 2016. In the latter election, he was elected as a regional list MSP as one of the additional members for the Highlands and Islands. Ross was elected to the House of Commons at the 2017 general election, defeating SNP deputy leader Angus Robertson, and was re-elected in 2019 with a reduced majority. He served as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland under Prime Minister Boris Johnson for six months. He resigned in May 2020, in protest at Dominic Cummings continuing to serve as Johnson's adviser after allegedly breaking lockdown rules during the COVID-19 pandemic. After the resignation of Jackson Carlaw in July 2020, Ross announced his candidature in the August 2020 Scottish Conservative Party leadership election. Five days later, he was elected leader unopposed. He ran on a joint ticket with former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson. Since he serves in the House of Commons and is not an MSP, Davidson leads the party in the Scottish Parliament. Early life and career Douglas Gordon Ross was born in Aberdeen on 27 January 1983 to Sandy and Lesley Ross. In childhood he first attended Alves Primary School and the state secondary Forres Academy before going on to study Agriculture at the Scottish Agricultural College. After graduating, he worked on a dairy farm near Forres, Moray; where his father had been working as a cattleman. He was a member of the Scottish Liberal Democrats in his youth but later became a Conservative voter. Political career Ross began his political career when he took up a post as a parliamentary researcher at the Scottish Parliament. He was first elected to The Moray Council in 2007, representing the Fochabers- Lhanbryde ward, and became part of the Independent/Conservative administration. He resigned from the council administration in December 2009 but continued as a councillor. In 2012, he was re-elected to The Moray Council and again became part of the ruling administration group but was \\"ousted\\" from this in 2014, following a debate about school closures. Ross as an MSP in 2016Ross stood as the Conservative candidate for Moray at the 2010 and 2015 general elections, coming second to Angus Robertson but increased his share of the vote by 5.0% in 2015. He also stood as the Conservative candidate for the Moray Scottish Parliament constituency at the 2011 Scottish Parliament election but finished second to Richard Lochhead. At the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Ross increased his vote by 18.0% but again finished behind Lockhead. However, he was elected to the Scottish Parliament after being placed first on the Highlands and Islands regional list. He supported the UK remaining within the European Union in the 2016 membership referendum. alt=Ross stood again for the seat of Moray at the 2017 general election, challenging SNP deputy leader Angus Robertson. He was successful in overturning Robertson's 9,065 majority with 22,637 votes, 47.6% of the votes cast, gaining a 16.5% swing to the Conservatives. Having gained a seat at Westminster, Ross resigned from his seat in the Scottish Parliament. In 2017, Ross said during an interview that if he was Prime Minister for a day \\"without any repercussions\\", he would \\"like to see tougher enforcement against Gypsy Travellers\\". His remark was criticised, including by Naomi McAuliffe of Amnesty International. Ross apologised for his use of language. The Scottish Football Association launched a disciplinary investigation into his remarks, which did not lead to any formal disciplinary action, but warned him to pay attention to his use of language. SNP and Labour spokespeople criticised Ross for missing a debate on Universal Credit in October 2017, due to his commitments as a football referee. Shortly afterwards, Ross decided he would no longer accept referee appointments while the UK Parliament is sitting. Despite backing remaining in the EU prior to the referendum, Ross stated Parliament should complete Brexit to \\"deliver the will of the British people\\". He voted against Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement at the first round of voting and was absent for the second following his wife going into labour. He supported Mark Harper then subsequently Boris Johnson in the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election. Ross was re-elected at the 2019 general election with a reduced majority. He was then appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, replacing Colin Clark who had lost his seat in the election. He resigned from this role on 26 May 2020, in protest against Dominic Cummings continuing to serve as Chief Adviser to the Prime Minister after having travelled over from London to Durham during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Ross announced his candidature in the August 2020 Scottish Conservative Party leadership election after Jackson Carlaw's resignation on 30 July 2020. On 5 August, he won the contest unopposed and became leader. On 11 August, he conducted a reshuffle where he made Ruth Davidson the Leader of the Conservative Party in the Scottish Parliament, dismissed Annie Wells and Liam Kerr from their deputy leadership positions and did not give Carlaw a position. He also announced plans to run for a seat in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election and succeed Davidson as his party's leader in Holyrood. Football referee Ross is a qualified football referee who is normally an assistant (formerly known as a linesman). He was one of the officials for the 2015 Scottish Cup Final, assisting Willie Collum, and the 2018 Scottish Cup Final, assisting Kevin Clancy. He has run the line in several editions of Scotland's biggest club fixture, the Old Firm derby, and has been involved in continental UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League ties and international FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championship qualifiers.D. Ross, Soccerway He continued his refereeing career after being elected to the Scottish Parliament, and the UK Parliament. In the House of Commons Register of Members' Interests, Ross declared earnings of more than £2,700 in August and September 2017 for his work as an assistant referee. In October of that year, Ross told the football authorities that he would no longer accept refereeing appointments during the week while the UK Parliament is sitting. By December 2017 his declared income from 20 domestic and international games since becoming an MP was more than £11,000. In December 2018, BBC Sport reported that Ross had reduced the number of refereeing appointments due to his work commitments as an MP. At this time, he also argued that the Scottish Football Association should not appoint fully professional referees. In August 2020, Ross apologised for not attending a VJ Day event as a result of previously agreeing to officiate at a Scottish Premiership game between Kilmarnock and St Johnstone. Ross said he would donate his match fee to the charity Help for Heroes. In October 2020, he was the linesman for the England v Wales friendly. Personal life Ross married his wife, Krystle, in 2015. They have one son who was born in 2019.

The congress was initially intended to be held on 15 May 2016 after enough delegates submitted the required signatures, however it was delayed after judiciary conflicts between different courts. After the final decision by Court of Cassation allowing the congress to go ahead, the party executive announced that an extraordinary congress with a leadership election would be held on 10 July while the invitation committee formed by the court declared that the constitutional extraordinary congress would occur on 19 June 2016. Although the MHP executive declared the congress to be against the MHP constitution and legally flawed, the first Congress was held as planned by the inner-party opposition, with a unanimous vote to change the constitution being achieved. The second congress was delayed after judiciary intervention requested by MHP officials, along with a formal request from the Supreme Electoral Council (YSK). The congress was eventually not held, prompting the dissidents to resign and join forces under a new party, namely the İYİ Party. The congress was called for by several inner-party critics of the MHP's current leader Devlet Bahçeli, who had led the party to a heavy defeat in the November 2015 general election. However, since the party constitution did not allow leadership elections at any congress other than the routine ordinary congresses (the next due to take place in 2018), a 'constitutional congress' was required before a leadership vote to amend the constitution and allow an earlier vote to take place. It was therefore expected that the congress due to be held on 15 May would be the first of two MHP party congresses held in the year 2016, the latter featuring a leadership election should constitutional amendments be successful. Background =Coalition process= The MHP, having been projected to win over many disaffected voters from the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) during the June 2015 general election, managed to win 80 seats in Parliament with 16.29% of the vote. In the same election, the AKP failed to win a parliamentary majority, with many commentators expecting the MHP to join the AKP in a coalition given ideological similarities. The post-election strategy of MHP leader Devlet Bahçeli was heavily criticised for being counterproductive and ideologically baseless, with Bahçeli rejecting almost all offers made to him by other parties. Having rejected a coalition with the AKP and declared support for an early election, he later rejected an offer by the Republican People's Party (CHP) leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu to head a triple-party coalition as Prime Minister. At the same time, Bahçeli was criticised for effectively 'handing over' the June–July 2015 Parliament Speaker election to the AKP candidate by abstaining. Fresh elections were called for November 2015 after all government formation attempts failed. =November 2015 election= In the November 2015 general election, the MHP suffered a heavy defeat and halved its parliamentary representation, winning 11.9% of the vote and falling behind the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) in terms of seats to become the smallest party in Parliament with just 40 MPs. Bahçeli subsequently came under heavy fire for the poor election result, with prominent party members such as Meral Akşener and Sinan Oğan openly declaring their candidacy to succeed Bahçeli. Bahçeli subsequently ruled out any prospect of a resignation and declared that the next leadership election would be held as expected in 2018, three years after the previous Ordinary Congress in March 2015. His decision was unable to quell further unrest within the party, with several provincial and district party associations declaring their support for opposing candidates. the party leadership clamped down on dissident party associations by abolishing them and setting up new ones in their place headed by more loyal party members. In the meantime, Ümit Özdağ and Koray Aydın declared their candidacies. =Signatures for an Extraordinary Congress= Under the leadership of opposing candidates, delegates critical Bahçeli began collecting signatures to force an Extraordinary Congress. On 15 January 2016, Akşener announced that she had successfully collected over 400 signatures, enough to call a congress.http://www.ajanshaber.com/mhpde-kurultay-icin-yeterli-imza-toplandi- haberi/323694 The party leadership staunchly rejected demands for an Extraordinary Congress, resulting in party opposition leaders submitting the signature lists to court.http://www.milliyet.com.tr/bahceli-den-ilk- aciklama/siyaset/detay/2223783/default.htm On 19 April, the courts accepted the opposition's call for an Extraordinary Congress.http://www.sabah.com.tr/gundem/2016/04/19/mhpde-olaganustu- kongre-15-mayista-yapilacak the MHP leadership respected the legal outcome, but stated that they would appeal and not recognise the decision.http://www.bbc.com/turkce/haberler/2016/04/160419_mhp_kongre Following a legal appeal, the courts decided to delay the congress indefinitely while they reviewed the case on 29 April.http://www.birgun.net/haber-detay/mhp-de-kongre-surecine-yurutmeyi- durdurma-karari-110644.html On 6 May, the courts rejected the MHP leadership's appeal and declared that the congress should go ahead on 15 May.http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/haber/siyaset/528935/Yargitay_kararini_verdi__MHP_kongreye_gidiyor.html =Legal challenges= On 13 May, two days before the proposed congress, the appeals from the opposition were accepted by an Ankara court. However at the same time, a court in the Samsun town of Gemerek ruled that the congress would be illegal following a legal challenge by the town's pro-Bahçeli party association.http://www.gazetevatan.com/gemerek-mahkemesi-nden-flas- karar-944740-gundem/ In response to the apparent confusion, Meral Akşener filed a complaint against Gemerek Judge İlhan Işık to the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors (HSYK), accusing the judge of ruling on a case that was beyond the remit of a district court.http://www.yenicaggazetesi.com.tr/aksener-gemerek-hakimini-hsykya- sikayet-etti-136646h.htm Although the party opposition declared their intention to hold the congress on Sunday since all legal challenges had been lifted, lawyers at the party's headquarters declared that it would not be legally possible and that the police should stop any attempts by the opposition to do so.http://www.kanalben.com/haber/310946/mhpden-beklenen- aciklama-geldi.html Later on the same day, the Ankara court upheld the Germenek court ruling, again putting the congress on hold.http://www.haberler.com/25-icra-dairesi-nden-mhp-kurultayiyla- ilgili-8436435-haberi/ One of the leadership candidates, Ümit Özdağ, claimed that the attempts to stop the congress had been initiated by the Minister of Justice.http://www.sondakika.com/haber/haber-mahkeme-itirazi-kabul-etti-mhp- olaganustu-8435507/  First Congress  The 19 June extraordinary congress Following the final decision for the Court of Cassation declaring that the congress should go ahead, the MHP national executive declared that the congress would be held on 26 June or 10 July, with Bahçeli standing as a candidate. However, the inner-party opposition declared that the MHP constitution at the time did not allow a leadership election to be held apart from during the routine ordinary congresses every three years, leading to speculation that the MHP executive were planning to hold the congress and then nullifying the result through court order. The inner-party opposition also argued that the date of the congress would be determined by the judicially appointed invitation committee, not the executive, while the executive argued that such a congress would be unconstitutional since it wasn't held in central Ankara and would require members of the ruling executive to officially be declared valid. The first Congress of 2016 was held on 19 June 2016 as announced by the invitation committee at the Anatolia Hotel Esenboğa Auditorium in Ankara, starting at 10am.http://www.milliyet.com.tr/meral- aksener-olaganustu/siyaset/detay/2244852/default.htm Then incumbent party executives and 38 out of 40 MHP PMs boycotted the Congress, Devlet Bahçeli did not attend the event. The opposition declared 752 delegates attended the congress, but Bahçeli's team announced the attendance is much lower, and the Congress did not meet the delegate threshold. The notary officially announced the attendance as 662, making the Congress valid. After the Congress, the opposition successfully changes 13 out of 14 articles of party constitution, allowing party leader elections during extraordinary congress and preventing party bans after June 5, 2016. The second Congress is planned for 10 July 2016, the same date as Bahçeli's announcement. Three days after the Congress, MHP parliamentary group leader Oktay Vural resigned. The congress was heavily criticised by one of the leadership candidates, Süleyman Servet Sazak, for revolving almost entirely around the frontrunner Meral Akşener, with the other candidates not having any input in the proposed constitutional changes.http://www.haberler.com/mhp-genel-baskan-adayi-suleyman-servet- sazak-8552856-haberi/ Potential candidates Although it is not clear if the Congress has authority to elect a new leader, several people publicly disclosed their candidacy. * Devlet Bahçeli, incumbent Leader of MHP, announced his candidacy on 25 May 2016. * Meral Akşener, former Minister of the Interior and former Deputy Speaker of the Grand National Assembly, announced her candidacy on 23 April 2016. * Sinan Oğan, former Member of the Grand National Assembly, announced his candidacy on 21 November 2015. * Koray Aydın, former Minister of Public Works and Housing and former Deputy Speaker of the Grand National Assembly, announced his candidacy on 28 November 2015. * Ümit Özdağ, former Vice-chairman of the Nationalist Movement Party, announced his candidacy on 23 March 2016. * Süleyman Servet Sazak, former Vice-chairman of the Nationalist Movement Party, announced his candidacy on 25 May 2016. * Selim Kaptanoğlu, MHP member, announced his candidacy on 6 November 2015.

History  = Before 1890 = Forerunners to the organization included the Tailors Progressive Union of America (TPUA) in the mid-1800s, as well as assemblies organized by the Knights of Labor. Very important was the tension between custom tailors (specializing in work done to order, usually higher-grade) and shop tailors (ordinary sewing of clothes made ready to wear). Regardless, there was little to no significant and unified tailors' union or movement before the 1880s. By then, shop tailors had begun to build more sophisticated organizations, which were then joined by custom tailors, a move which was vocally supported by John Brown Lennon, the future general secretary of the Journeymen Tailors' Union. A critical concern was the scabbing of custom tailors on shop tailors and vice versa during strikes, which could only be prevented by a more unified form of organization. John Brown Lennon became general secretary in 1886, a position he would hold until losing it to the Canadian socialist Eugene Brais in 1910. By 1887, the Tailors' Progressive Union had adopted a union label to be affixed to clothing, which was recognized by the American Federation of Labor (AFL). The JTU followed with its own union label in 1891. The TPUA was considerably more integrated into the labour movement, being composed mostly of shop tailors, many of whom were outspoken socialists and saw a common cause with other workers more than the journeymen custom tailors did. = 1890s = After 1889, the TPUA had declined in importance and attempts were made by shop tailors to join the JTU, which were rebuffed. In response, some shop tailors and other ready-made clothing workers started the United Garment Workers of America (UGWA) in 1891 and the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) in 1900. All three organizations were recognized by the AFL, causing significant tensions over jurisdiction. These clashes resulted largely in victory for the UGWA and diminished importance for the JTU, with the UGWA gaining jurisdiction over all non-custom-made clothing manufacture, with the JTU being limited to custom tailoring establishments, despite the wishes of its then-secretary, John Brown Lennon. In 1897, the JTU also lost jurisdiction over special-order custom tailoring to the UGWA and Custom Clothing Makers' Union or Special Order Clothing Makers' Union, whose AFL charter was denied. = After 1900 = After 1900, successive and nearly annual attempts to reform the organization, to extend its jurisdiction, and in 1905 to merge with the UGWA and form a Garment Workers' and Tailors' International Union, all failed by membership vote. At its convention in Buffalo in 1909, the JTU recognized the rise in custom factory tailoring at the expense of old-style merchant tailoring, and as a result it claimed jurisdiction over all custom tailoring, which was ineffectually enforced and never fully backed by the AFL. As a result, the JTU began to engage in \\"raiding\\" by attempting to organize workers claimed under the jurisdiction of the UGWA. With Lennon's attempts to amalgamate the organization with the UGWA and ILGWU failed and Eugene Brais elected as secretary, the direction of the organization changed drastically, with the rising socialist wing taking de facto control and renaming the organization to the International Tailors' Industrial Union (TIUI), articulating their preference for industrial unionism over craft unionism and putting it at odds Samuel Gompers, the president of the AFL and a personal friend of John Brown Lennon, who accused the JTU/TIUI of violating AFL bylaws by changing its name without permission. By the early 1910s, the union was divided into three factions: \\"old party\\" (conservative craft unionists), \\"progressives\\" (industrial unionists), and \\"liberals\\", the latter of which advocated reform but retention of the trade union model. This was similar to other garment workers unions, which saw surging support for socialist and industrial unionist positions and within the UGWA, an embrace of class struggle politics. This reflected broad trends at the time which were exemplified by the rise of purely industrial unionist and anti-capitalist organizations such as the Industrial Workers of the World. In 1914, a faction of disaffected UGWA members led by Sidney Hillman split from the organization and joined the JTU/TIUI instead, which by December had passed a motion proposing to rename the organization the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA) in preparation for a merger with the Hillman faction. Also passed was a motion barring members from belonging in two unions of the same trade, a gambit to force the Hillman faction into the JTU/TIUI/ACWA camp. The merger was defeated by vote and further propositions returned the name to \\"Journeyman Tailors' Union of America\\", a move which led to congratulations from the leadership of the AFL.

PC-MRI can be considered a method of Magnetic Resonance Velocimetry. It also provides a method of magnetic resonance angiography. Since modern PC-MRI is typically time-resolved, it provides a means of 4D imaging (three spatial dimensions plus time). How it Works Atoms with an odd number of protons or neutrons have a randomly aligned angular spin momentum. When placed in a strong magnetic field, some of these spins align with the axis of the external field, which causes a net 'longitudinal' magnetization. These spins precess about the axis of the external field at a frequency proportional to the strength of that field. Then, energy is added to the system through a Radio frequency (RF) pulse to 'excite' the spins, changing the axis that the spins precess about. These spins can then be observed by receiver coils (Radiofrequency coils) using Faraday's law of induction. Different tissues respond to the added energy in different ways, and imaging parameters can be adjusted to highlight desired tissues. All of these spins have a phase that is dependent on the atom's velocity. Phase shift (\\\\phi) of a spin is a function of the gradient field \\\\mathbf{G}(t): : \\\\phi = \\\\gamma \\\\int_0^t B_0 + \\\\mathbf{G}(\\\\tau) \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r}(\\\\tau) d\\\\tau where \\\\gamma is the Gyromagnetic ratio and \\\\mathbf{r} is defined as: : \\\\mathbf{r} (\\\\tau) = \\\\mathbf r_0 + \\\\mathbf v_r \\\\tau + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\mathbf a_r \\\\tau^2 + \\\\ldots , \\\\mathbf r_0 is the initial position of the spin, \\\\mathbf v_r is the spin velocity, and \\\\mathbf a_r is the spin acceleration. If we only consider static spins and spins in the x-direction, we can rewrite equation for phase shift as: : \\\\phi = \\\\gamma x_0 \\\\int_0^t G_x(\\\\tau) d \\\\tau + \\\\gamma v_x \\\\int_0^t G_x (\\\\tau) \\\\tau d \\\\tau + \\\\gamma \\\\frac{a_x}{2} \\\\int_0^t G_x ( \\\\tau ) \\\\tau^2 d \\\\tau + \\\\ldots We then assume that acceleration and higher order terms are negligible to simplify the expression for phase to: : \\\\phi = \\\\gamma (x_0 M_0 + v_x M_1) where M_0 is the zeroth moment of the x-gradient and M_1 is the first moment of the x gradient. If we take two different acquisitions with applied magnetic gradients that are the opposite of each other (bipolar gradients), we can add the results of the two acquisitions together to calculate a change in phase that is dependent on gradient: : \\\\Delta \\\\phi = v (\\\\gamma \\\\Delta M_1) where \\\\Delta M_1 = 2 M_1 . The phase shift is measured and converted to a velocity according to the following equation: : v = \\\\frac{v_{enc}}{\\\\pi} \\\\Delta \\\\phi where v_{enc} is the maximum velocity that can be recorded and \\\\Delta \\\\phi is the recorded phase shift. The choice of v_{enc} defines range of velocities visible, known as the ‘dynamic range’. A choice of v_{enc} below the maximum velocity in the slice will induce aliasing in the image where a velocity just greater than v_{enc} will be incorrectly calculated as moving in the opposite direction. However, there is a direct trade-off between the maximum velocity that can be encoded and the signal-to-noise ratio of the velocity measurements. This can be described by: : SNR_v = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\frac{v}{v_{enc}} SNR where SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio of the image (which depends on the magnetic field of the scanner, the voxel volume, and the acquisition time of the scan). For an example, setting a ‘low’ v_{enc} (below the maximum velocity expected in the scan) will allow for better visualization of slower velocities (better SNR), but any higher velocities will alias to an incorrect value. Setting a ‘high’ v_{enc} (above the maximum velocity expected in the scan) will allow for the proper velocity quantification, but the larger dynamic range will obscure the smaller velocity features as well as decrease SNR. Therefore, the setting of v_{enc} will be application dependent and care must be exercised in the selection. In order to further allow for proper velocity quantification, especially in clinical applications where the velocity dynamic range of flow is high (e.g. blood flow velocities in vessels across the thoracoabdominal cavity), a dual-echo PC-MRI (DEPC) method with dual velocity encoding in the same repetition time has been developed. The DEPC method does not only allow for proper velocity quantification, but also reduces the total acquisition time (especially when applied to 4D flow imaging) compared to a single-echo single-v_{enc} PC-MRI acquisition carried out at two separate v_{enc} values. To allow for more flexibility in selecting v_{enc}, instantaneous phase (phase unwrapping) can be used to increase both dynamic range and SNR. =Encoding Methods= When each dimension of velocity is calculated based on acquisitions from oppositely applied gradients, this is known as a six-point method. However, more efficient methods are also used. Two are described here: Simple Four-point Method Four sets of encoding gradients are used. The first is a reference and applies a negative moment in x, y, and z. The next applies a positive moment in x, and a negative moment in y and z. The third applies a positive moment in y, and a negative moment in x and z. And the last applies a positive moment in z, and a negative moment in x and y. Then, the velocities can be solved based on the phase information from the corresponding phase encodes as follows: : \\\\hat{v}_x = \\\\frac{ \\\\phi_x - \\\\phi_0}{\\\\gamma \\\\Delta M_1} : \\\\hat{v}_y = \\\\frac{ \\\\phi_y - \\\\phi_0}{\\\\gamma \\\\Delta M_1} : \\\\hat{v}_z = \\\\frac{ \\\\phi_z - \\\\phi_0}{\\\\gamma \\\\Delta M_1} Balanced Four-Point Method The balanced four-point method also includes four sets of encoding gradients. The first is the same as in the simple four-point method with negative gradients applied in all directions. The second has a negative moment in x, and a positive moment in y and z. The third has a negative moment in y, and a positive moment in x and z. The last has a negative moment in z and a positive moment in x and y. This gives us the following system of equations: : \\\\phi_2 - \\\\phi_1 = \\\\phi_x + \\\\phi_y : \\\\phi_3 - \\\\phi_1 = \\\\phi_x + \\\\phi_z : \\\\phi_4 - \\\\phi_1 = \\\\phi_y + \\\\phi_z Then, the velocities can be calculated: : \\\\hat{v}_x = \\\\frac{ - \\\\phi_1 + \\\\phi_2 + \\\\phi_3 - \\\\phi_4}{2 \\\\gamma \\\\Delta M_1} : \\\\hat{v}_y = \\\\frac{ - \\\\phi_1 + \\\\phi_2 - \\\\phi_3 + \\\\phi_4}{2 \\\\gamma \\\\Delta M_1} : \\\\hat{v}_z = \\\\frac{ - \\\\phi_1 - \\\\phi_2 + \\\\phi_3 + \\\\phi_4}{2 \\\\gamma \\\\Delta M_1} =Retrospective Cardiac and Respiratory Gating= For medical imaging, in order to get highly resolved scans in 3D space and time without motion artifacts from the heart or lungs, retrospective cardiac gating and respiratory compensation are employed. Beginning with cardiac gating, the patient's ECG signal is recorded throughout the imaging process. Similarly, the patient's respiratory patterns can be tracked throughout the scan. After the scan, the continuously collected data in k-space (temporary image space) can be assigned accordingly to match-up with the timing of the heart beat and lung motion of the patient. This means that these scans are cardiac-averaged so the measured blood velocities are an average over multiple cardiac cycles. Applications Phase contrast MRI is one of the main techniques for magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This is used to generate images of arteries (and less commonly veins) in order to evaluate them for stenosis (abnormal narrowing), occlusions, aneurysms (vessel wall dilatations, at risk of rupture) or other abnormalities. MRA is often used to evaluate the arteries of the neck and brain, the thoracic and abdominal aorta, the renal arteries, and the legs (the latter exam is often referred to as a \\"run-off\\"). Limitations In particular, a few limitations of PC-MRI are of importance for the measured velocities: * Partial volume effects (when a voxel contains the boundary between static and moving materials) can overestimate phase leading to inaccurate velocities at the interface between materials or tissues. * Intravoxel phase dispersion (when velocities within a pixel are heterogeneous or in areas of turbulent flow) can produce a resultant phase that does not resolve the flow features accurately. * Assuming that acceleration and higher orders of motion are negligible can be inaccurate depending on the flow field. * Displacement artifacts (also known as misregistration and oblique flow artifacts) occur when there is a time difference between the phase and frequency encoding. These artifacts are highest when the flow direction is within the slice plane (most prominent in the heart and aorta for biological flows) Vastly undersampled Isotropic Projection Reconstruction (VIPR) A Vastly undersampled Isotropic Projection Reconstruction (VIPR) is a radially acquired MRI sequence which results in high-resolution MRA with significantly reduced scan times, and without the need for breath-holding.Page 602 in: References Category:Magnetic resonance imaging ","title":"Phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging"},{"id":"50446752","text":"Allan Lee McCutcheon (March 15, 1950 – May 3, 2016) was an American sociologist and statistician.

Race and class-based price discrimination also exists. Acts of discrimination often have legal ramifications, but a study of gender-based price discrimination first looks at gendered price disparities. From there, the question of whether gendered price disparities prove an intent to discriminate or constitute illegal discrimination can become a legal inquiry that is developed by examining the law of the applicable jurisdiction. Gender-based price discrimination is typically disapproved of, but not universally. In the United States, a few states have adopted statutes forbidding gender-based price discrimination, but these policies are largely unenforced. Typically, price disparities negatively affect women more often than men. For example, a study by the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection found that, on average, women's products cost seven percent more than similar products for men. Gender-based pricing exists in many industries, including insurance, dry cleaning, hairdressing, nightclubs, clothing, and personal care products. The legality of gender-based price discrimination in matching markets has been of debate in the United States and European Union since the 1990s. The debate is centered around whether gender-based pricing is a form of gender discrimination. In other words, instead of prices being based on a market-based analysis of the effects on competition, gender-based pricing may instead reinforce negative stereotypes about both women and men in matching markets. Gender-based price disparities have been found in personal care products, retail sales, and consumer service prices. They also exist in the pricing of insurance, such as health insurance and car insurance. Other studies suggest that gender-based price disparities often occur when negotiating and purchasing new cars. Discount prices based on gender may also be a type of gender-based price discrimination. A common gender-based price discount is a \\"ladies' night\\" promotion, in which female patrons pay less for alcoholic drinks or a lower cover charge than male patrons do. Consumption taxes on certain products but not others have also been viewed a form of gender-based price disparity. For example, in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom, tampons are often subjected to a consumption tax, while related products such as condoms, lubricant, and several other medical items are exempt from the tax. Opponents of the enforcement of laws against gender-based pricing make two arguments. They suggest that courts should dismiss cases involving gender-based pricing because the injury to the plaintiff is so inconsequential that they should not be entitled to relief. They also point to economic efficiency as a justification. In response to the economic efficiency argument, scholars suggest that gender-based pricing should be prohibited on moral grounds, stating that gender should not be used as a proxy for other characteristics, especially when based on stereotypes.  Gendered price disparities  Gender research has heavily focused on the interaction between gender and the economy. Typically, research in this area involves the issue of the gender pay gap. Another aspect of gender research in economics is the less studied issue of gender-based price disparities in the cost of goods and services across different industries. Scholars suggest that the existence of gendered price disparities contribute to gender inequality by creating an economic burden that does not exist for the other gender and by reinforcing gender roles in the marketplace. = Personal care industry = There are a number of different studies on the price disparities between personal care products and services that are marketed towards females and males. For example, the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCA) conducted a study of prices of goods in New York City across five industries, including personal care products. Other universities and academics have also studied the prices in personal care products and services. However, it is also argued that if there is no barrier or prohibition to the consumer buying the cheaper product, the consumer must find added value in the more expensive product and thus there is no real discrimination.  Personal care services  While studies have shown significant price disparities in personal care products between men and women, gendered price disparities across personal care services has been inconsistent. A recent study titled Cost of Doing Femininity examined two areas of personal care services that had directly comparable prices between men and women: hair salons and dry cleaners. The study found that only 15 out of 100 randomly selected hair salons had the same prices for both men and women, and none of the salons charged women less than men. Dry cleaning prices depended on the type and amount of fabric, with more embellishments corresponding with higher prices. This price factor, however, tended to negatively impact women more often than men because women's garments are more likely to be embroidered or be made of delicate fabric.  Personal care products  Gendered price disparities in personal care products are more apparent than in personal care services and across other industries. By and large, the price disparities in personal care products are notably higher than in other industries and cost women around 13 percent more than men. This disparity is especially significant considering women purchase these products more regularly than men. Prices for hair products, followed by razors, cost the most for women - typically costing women almost 50 percent more than men. = Hair care industry = Price disparities in hair salon services between men and women are thought to be justifiable because women's hair is often longer and more complicated to maintain and cut. In recent years, however, this stereotype has changed. Men are often experimenting with their hair, including hair loss treatment and hair color. While women may still spend a considerable amount for hair color and other treatments, many women prefer basic haircuts. Additionally, salon-quality hair styling tools are readily available and easy to use at home. Gendered price disparities for hair salon services have also been documented in different locations across the United States and Europe. The California Assembly Office of Research conducted a survey of five large California cities and found that forty percent of the hair salons charged women, on average, five dollars more than men for a standard haircut. Gendered price disparities in haircut prices also has been found in New York City: Of 199 hair salons examined, nearly 48 percent of hair-cutters charged women more than men for a simple haircut. = Vehicle insurance = The price disparities between men and women in the vehicle insurance market is one of the few instances where men typically pay more than women for identical products and services. Unlike in the markets for retail or personal care products, however, these gender-based price differences can be rationally explained. Because men are believed in general to behave in more risky behaviors than women (driving at excessive speeds, driving recklessly, driving under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol, etc.), the cost of insuring men is greater than the cost of insuring women, and this cost difference is reflected in insurance rates calculated in part on the gender of the insured. Despite vehicle insurance typically costing men more, there is some research to suggest that women actually pay more under the fixed annual pricing system because men drive more miles and are involved in twice as many accidents. = Car price negotiations = For most Americans, new car purchases are their largest consumer investment after buying a home. In 1991, Harvard Law Professor Ian Ayres examined whether the process of negotiating for a new car disadvantaged women and minorities. The study was conducted in the Chicago area and involved 180 price negotiations at 90 dealerships. The study's testers included individuals of different races and genders and each was instructed to use the same negotiation strategy. Each tester entered a car dealership and bargained to purchase a new car. The results of the study concluded that white males received significantly better prices than non- whites and women. = Health insurance = It is argued women tend to pay more than men for health insurance. One explanation for this is that women make more use of the health care services made available to them by their insurance. A detailed survey of medical costs of the period 1999 to 2016 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services shows spending on healthcare for women is higher than for men. According to their study, during the ages of 18 to 44, health spending for females is 84% higher than men. Even when removing the cost of childbirth, spending for women ages 44 to 64 was still 24% higher than for men. Spending for women ages 65+ is 8% higher. {url=https://www.registerednursing.org/healthcare-costs-by-age/title=Here’s How Much Your Healthcare Costs Will Rise as You Age} Adjusting for the cost of treatment due to injuries sustained while in the military makes the disparity greater still. Nevertheless, the Affordable Care Act made gender-based differences in premium prices illegal.  Law and policy  The Supreme Court of the United States has not enunciated a workable evidentiary standard to govern claims of subtle and unconscious forms of discrimination. Further, there is no general federal law explicitly prohibiting gender-based price discrimination. Because many pricing decisions are made by private businesses, the 14th Amendment generally does not apply, and sex was not included as a protected class under federal public accommodation law. As a result, these issues tend to be left to the states. In recent years, an increasing number of states and localities have enacted laws and policies prohibiting gender-based price discrimination in public accommodations, such as nightclubs and bars. For example, courts in California, Florida, Pennsylvania, Iowa, and Maryland have consistently ruled against gender-based pricing. However, other states such as Illinois, Washington, and Michigan, have adopted a case-by-case approach on the issue. = California = California passed the Unruh Civil Rights Act in 1995, making California the first state to enact legislation to protect against gender-based price discrimination.CAL. CIV. CODE § 51. California Assemblywoman Jackie Speier introduced the Gender Tax Repeal Act to \\"try to address the persistent problem of gender-based discrimination in the sale of services related to haircuts, laundry, dry cleaning, and alterations.\\"CALIFORNIA SENATE JUDICIARY COMM., COMMITTEE REPORT FOR 1995 CAL. A.B. 1100, 1995-1996 Reg. Sess. 2 (1995). The law was enacted to prohibit businesses from charging different prices for services based on a customer's gender. The Gender Tax Repeal Act provided for civil actions in which courts may award a minimum of $1,000 or up to three times the amount of actual damages in addition to attorney's fees.See CAL. CIV. CODE § 51.6(d), 52(a). The enactment of the Gender Tax Repeal Act aided in combating gender-based price discrimination in the pricing of services, but did not prohibit such price differentials with respect to products.
