In the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, their territory extended to the north-east until the river Ophis, and covered both the littoral and the mountainous hinterland. Pliny grouped together the Sanni who lived in the region of Trebizond and the Heniochi as one single nation. He also mentions other Sanni, living further on the Colchis littoral, past the mouth of the Rioni. According to Theodoret of Cyrrus (5th century AD), the Sanni and Lazi were two different tribes. In the first centuries AD, Sanni people living in the region of Trebizond were paying tribute to the Roman Empire. However, they tried to avoid heavy direct taxation and later left the coastal areas for the mountains. In the 6th century, Procopius still mentions them as living near the source of the Boasi (today the Chorokhi, or Çoruh River). There have been various interpretations of the ethnonym in Georgian literature; some scholars, such as Simon Kaukhchishvili, suggest that it is related to the name \\"chan\\" or its variants, long present in Greek mythological narratives about Colchis; others, among them Arnold Chikobava, see it as derived from the name still given to Mingrelian people in the Svan language Zan (see also Zan language). In the opinion of S. Dzhanashia, San was indeed an endonym of ancient Colchians, which later evolved into the forms Zan in the north of Colchis (Mingrelia) and Chan in the southern part (which would become Lazistan). The form Τζάνοι (Chani) can be found in Byzantine authors such as Procopius, but Sanni can be found as recently as the 12th century. Today, Chani is still used as an ethnonym for the Laz people.

It is considered by many to be the ancestor of the largest sharks to have ever lived, Carcharocles angustidens, and Carcharocles megalodon. Taxonomy =Research History= Original upright=1.2 Cretalamna was first described by Swiss naturalist Louis Agassiz using five teeth previously identified as the common smooth-hound and collected by English paleontologist Gideon Mantell from the Southerham Grey Pit near Lewes, East Sussex. In his 1835 publication Rapport sur les poissons fossiles découverts en Angleterre, he reidentified them as a new species of porbeagle shark under the taxon Lamna appendiculata. In 1843, Agassiz published Recherches sur les poissons fossiles, which reexamined Mantell's five teeth. Using them, eight additional teeth collected by Mantell, and twenty more teeth collected by various paleontologists in various locations (One tooth found by the 3rd Earl of Enniskillen from the Speeton Clay in Yorkshire; one tooth of the collection of a Strasbourg Museum from an unspecified location; one tooth of the collection of the Hancock Museum from the Marly Chalk near Cambridge; and six teeth of the collection of German paleontologist Heinrich Georg Bronn from chalk around Aachen), he described a species whose teeth had thick bulged roots, lateral cusplets, and extreme variability. Agassiz remarked that some of the examined teeth may be variable enough to belong to a separate species, but ultimately unified them under a new taxon Otodus appendiculatus. The species would later be found in 1958 by Soviet paleontologist Leonid Glickman to belong to a distinct new genus- Cretalamna. Despite Agassiz's remarks on variability, his ultimately broad interpretation of O. appendiculatus subsequently led the species to become a wastebasket taxon culminating to an interpretation of C. appendiculata as a variable cosmopolitan species with a 50 million year range. This changed when paleontologist Mikael Siversson found that the twenty-five syntypes actually represented a mix of at least six or more different species including three additional genera Dwardius, Cretoxyrhina, and Cretodus. To remedy the taxonomic issue, he redesignated one of the syntypes as the sole lectotype of C. appendiculata in 1999. In 2015, he led a study which revisited the taxonomic situation and established a renewed description of the species, which led to the erection of six additional Cretalamna species- C. catoxodon, C. deschutteri, C. ewelli, C. gertericorum, C. hattini, and C. sarcoporthea. Before Siversson, other Cretalamna species have been described. Another species described by Agassiz under the taxon Otodus latus was demoted to a variation of C. appendiculata in 1908, promoted into a subspecies in 1977 by French paleontologist Jaques Herman, and finally elevated to the species level as Cretolamna lata by Herman and paleontologist Van Waes Hilde in 2012. In 1897, French paleontologist Fernand Priem described a single tooth from the Köpinge Sandstone in Scania, Sweden under the taxon Lamna borealis. This would be revised to 'Cretolamna borealis' by Glickman in a 1980 paper. In 1902, German paleontologist Johannes Wanner described teeth from Egyptian Cretaceous deposits near the Dakhla Oasis and Farafra. He noted that the teeth are almost identical with that of the Otodus appendiculatus teeth, except that the Egyptian teeth also contained two clear pairs of lateral cusplets (a feature not seen in Otodus appendiculatus). Wanner concluded that the teeth were of a closely related new species and placed it under the taxon Otodus biauriculatus. In 1935, French Paleontologist Camille Arambourg described a new subspecies of C. biauriculata from teeth found in Moroccan phosphates under the taxon Lamna biauriculata maroccana, which was elevated into its own species in 1997. In 1972, French ichthyologist Henri Cappetta described teeth from Maastrichtian deposits near the Mentès well in Tahoua, Niger, which he assigned to the subspecies Lamna biauriculata nigeriana. This subspecies would also be elevated to its own species in 1991. In 1975, Cappetta and American paleontologist Gerard Case examined Cretalamna teeth described by Arambourg in 1952 from Danian deposits in Morocco and proposed that it represents a new subspecies of the type species and assigned it the taxon Cretolamna appendiculata arambourgi, which Siversson et al. (2015) elevated into its own species. In 2018, American paleontologists Jun Ebersole and Dana Ehret described a new species of Cretalamna from various teeth from the Eutaw Formation and Mooreville Chalk in Alabama, which they named C. bryanti. =Etymology= The genus Cretalamna is a portmanteau of creta, the Latin word for \\"chalk\\", prefixed to the genus Lamna, which is a romanization of the Ancient Greek λάμνα (lámna, meaning \\"kind of fierce shark\\"). When put together they mean \\"chalk-shark\\", which refers to chalk deposits from which the species' type specimens were found in. The type species name appendiculata is a feminine form of the Latin word appendiculātus (having an appendage), a reference to the thick bulged roots found in C. appendiculata teeth. The species name lata is derived from the feminine form of the Latin lātus (wide); a reference to the notably wide teeth of the species. The species name borealis is derived from the Latin boreālis (northern); this is a reference to its discovery from fossil deposits in Sweden, a boreal locality. The specific epithet of C. maroccana is a feminine form of the Latin word maroccānus (Moroccan), a reference to its type locality in Morocco. C. biauriculata's specific epithet is a portmanteau derived from the Latin prefix bi- (two) prefixed onto the Latin auriculātā (eared), together meaning \\"having two ears\\". This is a reference to the species' large lateral cusplets, which somewhat resemble a pair of ears. The species name nigeriana is derived from the country name Niger prefixed to the suffix -iana, a feminine variation of the Latin suffix -ānus (pertaining to), together meaning \\"pertaining to Niger\\". This is a reference to the species' type locality in Niger. The species name sarcoportheta is derived from the Ancient Greek σαρκός (sarkos, meaning \\"flesh\\") prefixed to the Ancient Greek πορθητής (porthitís, meaning \\"destroyer\\"), together meaning \\"destroyer of flesh\\". The species name catoxodon is derived from the Ancient Greek κατοξυς (katoxys, meaning \\"very sharp\\") prefixed to the Ancient Greek ὀδών (odon, meaning \\"tooth\\". Together they mean \\"very sharp tooth\\", referring to the unusually sharp cutting edges of some C. catoxodon teeth. Six of the Cretalamna species have specific epithets that are named in honor of specific people, either for their contributions to the research of their associated species or for notable work they undertook. Of these six, five share a similar word structure that has a person's last name prefixed onto the Latin suffix -i (from). These species are C. arambourgi, which honors paleontologist Camille Arambourg for his discovery of the C. arambourgi type specimens and his contributions to North African paleontology; C. bryanti, which honors the Bryant family who helped enhance the reputation and missions of the University of Alabama, Alabama Museum of Natural History, and McWane Science Center through their commitment to education and support; C. deschutteri, which honors paleontologist Pieter De Scutter for his efforts to make Cretalamna teeth from a Bettrechies quarry available to Siversson et al. (2015) and for his work on Belgian Cenozoic sharks; C. ewelli, which honors paleontologist Keith Ewell who collected most of the C. ewelli type specimens in 2004; and C. hattini, which honors the late geologist Donald E. Hattin \\"for his work on the stratigraphy of the Niobrara Formation, western Kansas\\". The specific epithet of C. gertericorum is structured differently; it is derived from the names \\"Gert\\", \\"Eric\\", and the Latin suffix -orum (a masculine plural declension). The derived names \\"Gert\\" and \\"Eric\\" refer to fossil collectors Gert De Bie and Eric Collier, both of whom collected the majority of Cretalamna teeth examined in Siversson et al. (2015) that were from the Bettrechies quarry. =Spelling= The valid spelling of Cretalamna, specifically between it and 'Cretolamna', has been subject to controversy. Originally, Glickman described the genus with the intention of naming it as 'Cretolamna' , but during publication of the corresponding 1958 paper a typographical error occurred, with the print misspelling it as 'Cretalamna' . Glickman pointed out the spelling as an error and continued to use his intended spelling 'Cretolamna' in later works. This spelling was universally adopted until 1999 when Siversson remarked that this violates ICZN Articles 32 and 33, reinstating 'Cretalamna' as the valid spelling. Since then, the reinstatement of 'Cretalamna' gained prominence and by the 2010s, was accepted by the majority of paleontologists. However, some paleontologists including Cappetta strongly opposed it. In an attempt to suppress the usage of 'Cretalamna' , Cappetta appealed to a representative of the ICZN, arguing that the original intentions of Glickman and the prevailing usage of 'Cretolamna' prior to Siversson (1999) secures its priority. The ICZN, who reportedly were impressed by Cappetta's \\"spirit\\", subsequently erected Article 33.3.1 of the 2000 Edition of the Code in order to address this situation in the future, which states that \\"when an unjustified emendation is in prevailing usage and is attributed to the original author and date it is deemed to be a justified emendation\\". While Cappetta argued in a 2012 handbook that this new provision justifies the priority of 'Cretolamna' due to the spelling's overwhelmingly prevailing usage prior to its replacement by Siversson in 1999, Siversson himself pointed out in a 2015 paper that the provision cannot be worked retroactively, and that the continued prevailing usage of 'Cretalamna' since the provision's establishment ironically secures its priority rather than threaten it. 'Cretalamna' currently remains as the most prevalent spelling and paleontologists have expressed the unlikeliness of a return to the usage of 'Cretolamna' . Biology =Body= Cretalamna was a medium-sized shark with an estimated total length of 2.3 – 3m. It is presumed to have had a fusiform-like body comparable to those of modern lamniformes. This is evidenced by the circular vertebra centra of Cretalamna. Given the size of Cretalamna teeth relative to its body size, it is likely that its caudal fin was not used for stunning prey (as is the case for thresher sharks). Instead, the caudal fin of Cretalamna was more similar to that of the great white shark. =Dentition= Fossil teeth of C. biauriculata from Khouribga (Morocco) Cretalamna teeth are distinguished by a broad triangular cusp and two lateral cusplets. The cutting edges of the teeth are razor-like, while the sides have a smooth surface. Teeth symmetry is variable; some have exact bilateral symmetry whereas others have high asymmetry. Adjacent teeth do not overlap. The exact dentition of Cretalamna is uncertain due to poor fossil representation. Traditionally, most reconstructions of its dentition were constructed from individual shed teeth. Based on a specimen of C. hattini (LACM 128126), the dentition of the shark follows a lamnoid pattern with at least fifteen upper tooth rows and eight lower tooth rows on each side of the jaw. The upper tooth rows contain, from front to back: two symphysial, two anterior, one intermediate, and ten lateral tooth rows. The lower tooth rows contain: two anterior, one intermediate, and five lateral tooth rows. This is given in the dental formula , constructed in a 2007 study of LACM 128126 by paleontologist Kenshu Shimada. It is possible that Cretalamna contained more than two symphysial tooth rows, as the related Cretoxyrhina mantelli possessed four upper symphysial tooth rows. = Jaw = In C. hattini, the upper and lower jaws are similar to that of Cretoxyrhina mantelli. The jaws also resemble those of modern alopiids (thresher sharks) and lamnids. Limited fossil evidence suggests that the upper jaws extended over the lower jaws, giving Cretalamna a subterminal mouth.  Paleoecology  = Distribution = Cretalamna was a widespread genus found in North Africa (Morocco), the Near East (Jordan) Kaddumi H. F. 2009. Fossils of the Harrana Fauna and the Adjacent Areas. Publications of the Eternal River Museum of Natural History, Amman, pp 324 and North America both on the East Coast and in the Midwest. Deposits in Morocco are usually Eocene in age; deposits in Jordan are of Cretaceous and Eocene in age; and most deposits in the U.S. are of Cretaceous and Paleocene age. C. maroccana is more prevalent in Morocco and Jordan, while C. appendiculata is more prevalent in the United States. Both species overlapped at one point in time. = Habitat = Cretalamna (13, lower right) with contemporaneous aquatic animals Fossil evidence of Cretalamna is found in deposits representing a diverse set of marine environments, indicating that it was able to adapt to a wide range of habitats. This may have attributed to its ability to exist through a long temporal range. The fusiform body of Cretalamna suggests it was a pelagic shark. The Cretaceous waters inhabited by Cretalamna were also home to a diverse range of cartilaginous fishes, bony fishes, turtles, squamates, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, birds, and even some non-avian dinosaurs. =Diet= The teeth morphology of Cretalamna implies that it was a generalist. It was a predator and preyed upon large bony fish, turtles, mosasaurs, squids, and other sharks. Some tooth specimens of Cretalamna exhibit heavy wear—likely the result of drastic diet changes. = Extinction = A possible factor to the extinction of Cretalamna is increased competition with newer generalist sharks during the Cenozoic. It is widely believed that Otodus (and thus Carcharocles) is derived from Cretalamna due to its strong similarity to certain species within the genus.

Overview  The Keystone Markers were products of the height of the “Good Roads\\" movement that opened highway travel to the masses. The Keystone Markers were the signature project of the Department, the second oldest of its kind in the nation and predecessor to today's PennDOT. The proliferation of the familiar blue-and-yellow, cast iron Keystone Markers popularized Pennsylvania's reputation as the \\"Keystone State\\". While Pennsylvania once claimed thousands of Keystone Markers, approximately 600 remain. The loss of the Markers prompted Preservation Pennsylvania, the Commonwealth's statewide heritage preservation advocacy organization, to include the Keystone Markers among their most endangered resources in 2011. Keystone Markers associated with towns are the most common of the survivors. In each municipality where the markers were installed, at least two were put up, one on each end of town along the principal roadway. If a town was at the intersection of two such roadways, there were four signs installed, two on each road. Markers for towns indicated the name of the town, the reason why the town was given that name, and the date founded. Many town Keystone Markers indicated the distance to the next town in the upper part of the sign. Thus, each marker for a given town was unique. = Varieties = There are three different varieties of Keystone Markers, each generally associated with a different kind of use. # Front-mount, single-sided sign markers used for towns.

Designed by Maurice Webster, it was built between 1928 and 1930 by Walter A. Strong, then owner and publisher of the Chicago Daily News. In 1962, the castle and surrounding area were purchased by Presbyterian Church. Today, it serves as a year-round camping and retreat center, hosting summer camps and an Olde English Faire.  The castle  left The castle was built by Walter Strong as a summer home for his wife, Josephine, and their five children. In 1928, Strong bought 360 acres of wooded property north of Oregon, Illinois which included a limestone bluff overlooking the Rock River. He was familiar with the area because he and Josephine often stayed at nearby Bee Tree Farm, the summer home of his father- in-law, Towner K. Webster. Strong hired Josephine’s brother, architect Maurice Webster, to design a house on the bluff. The original concept was to build a simple barn and silo structure, but it quickly grew into something resembling a castle, with 16 bedrooms, 9 baths, 8 fireplaces, gargoyles and secret passageways. The original driveway was cut through the bluff which served as a stone quarry for the walls and fireplaces. The castle’s exterior took about nine months to build, the interior another year. In total, the project, which continued into the Great Depression, cost $85,000. The final Tudor style architecture was influenced by Strong’s travels to Europe, his English ancestry, and the historical novels of Sir Walter Scott. Some think the castle was also a retort to fellow newspaper publisher and competitor, William Randolph Hearst. In 1919, after inheriting a fortune, Hearst began construction of the opulent Spanish Renaissance style Hearst Castle at San Simeon. The rustic Strong family retreat, which they called Stronghold, was in many ways the antithesis of San Simeon. Stronghold encouraged informal living and had many features intended to delight visitors, especially children. The Great Hall. At the center of the house was the Great Hall, modeled after a medieval banqueting room. It was 55 feet long, 34 feet wide and had a vaulted ceiling 34 feet high at its peak. At one end was a massive stone fireplace with a metal hood. Josephine thought the hood was too shiny and had it distressed by beating it with rusty chains, a treatment used on fireplaces throughout the house. Just off the Great Hall was a circular library lined with bookcases. Its paneling was stained with coffee grounds to simulate age. One bookcase was designed to swing backwards revealing a secret passageway. It led to a chapel which was finished many years after the original construction. The Strongs wanted their family and guests to dine together, so Josephine had a 20-foot by 6-foot table built for the dining room. It was made from a massive oak tree and weighed a half a ton. It was so large, it had to be placed in the room before the exterior wall could be completed. It was so heavy that the floor sagged and had to be jacked up from the basement. alt= Tying the levels of the castle together was a five-story circular tower. The staircase, which used unseen steel rods to cantilever each tread out from the wall, seemed to float as it spiraled up the height of the tower. At the top was an observation deck with commanding views of the surrounding countryside. At the time of its construction, Lorado Taft’s Black Hawk Statue was visible around a bend down river. In 1932, Josephine hired an unemployed Russian artist, Nicholas Kaisaroff, to decorate parts of the castle. He painted the ceiling of the library in a faux-medieval style. He also painted a fresco on the upper walls of the tower. These were based on characters in Grimms’ Fairy Tales, like Rumpelstiltskin. Kaisaroff is said to have included the faces of the family and their pets in some of his paintings. The family spent their first summer there in 1930. Walter Strong scarcely had time to enjoy Stronghold. On May 10, 1931, he died of a heart attack at his home in Winnetka, Illinois. He was 47 years old. Josephine continued to divide her time between her Winnetka home and Stronghold until her death in 1961. In 1962, Stronghold was sold to the Presbyterian Church.  The center  The current owner, the Presbytery of Blackhawk, is an association of 75 Presbyterian congregations in Illinois. Originally, Stronghold operated as a summer camp and was housed almost entirely within the castle. But in the intervening years, the center’s mission has grown. It now functions as a four- season conference, retreat and camping center. In a typical year, it hosts over 12,000 visitors of many faiths.[l] One of its most popular events is the Olde English Faire. Every October, performers and people dressed in period costumes wander about the castle grounds and sell their wares. Heritage Lodge. To accommodate its expanded range of activities, the center has built five modern buildings and a number of rustic cabins and structures. The newest of these is Heritage Lodge, which mimics the Tudor style of the castle and can accommodate 32 people.

Trained by Michael Matz, Union Rags was one of the leading American two-year-olds of 2011 whose wins included the Champagne Stakes and the Saratoga Special Stakes. Despite a defeat in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile he was one of the early favorites for the 2012 Kentucky Derby, but finished seventh, following a poor start. Skipping the Preakness Stakes, he won the Belmont by a neck over the Bob Baffert-trained colt Paynter. Union Rags was retired from racing in July 2012 after a tendon injury. He entered stud for the 2013 breeding season and his first crop reached racing age in 2016. Background Union Rags is a bay with a white blaze sired by Dixie Union who won the Haskell Invitational Handicap in 2000 before becoming a successful stallion. His dam, Tempo, was a granddaughter of the 1000 Guineas winner Glad Rags. Union Rags was bred by Phyllis Mills Wyeth, 71 (in 2012), whose parents Alice du Pont and James Mills were prominent owners and breeders of Thoroughbreds. Wyeth, who is married to artist Jamie Wyeth, was a steeplechase rider when young, but at age 20 suffered a broken neck and spinal cord damage in an automobile accident. Initially able to walk with braces, she has used a motorized chair for many years. Wyeth initially sold Union Rags as a yearling, on the advice of tax accountants, but repurchased the horse the next year. She races Union Rags under her nom de course, Chadds Ford Stable. Racing career =2011:two-year-old season= Union Rags made his debut on 12 July when he won a Maiden race at Delaware Park Racetrack. In August, he was moved into Grade II company for the Saratoga Special Stakes and won in \\"impressive\\" style by more than seven lengths. On October 8, Union Rags stepped up to Grade I class for the Champagne Stakes at Belmont Park and started the 6/5 favorite against seven opponents. Despite struggling to obtain a clear run on the final turn, he broke clear in the straight to win by more than five lengths from Alpha. Union Rags started favorite for the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Churchill Downs on November 5. He moved up to challenge the leader Hansen in the straight but \\"veered\\" from a straight course before staying on strongly in the closing stages and finishing second by a head. In the voting for the title of American Champion Two-Year- Old Colt, Union Rags finished second to Hansen. =2012: three-year-old season= In his three-year-old debut, Union Rags won the Fountain of Youth Stakes at Gulfstream Park \\"comfortably\\" by four lengths from News Pending, with the favored Discreet Dancer two and a quarter lengths further back in third. At the same course five weeks later, Union Rags started the odds-on favorite for the Florida Derby but finished third behind Take Charge Indy. In the Kentucky Derby, he started second favorite at odds of 5.1/1. Following a poor start, and at one point last in the field, he finished seventh of the twenty runners, seven and a half lengths behind I'll Have Another. Union Rags did not run in the 2012 Preakness Stakes but was entered in the Belmont Stakes on June 9. Following the withdrawal of I'll Have Another, Union Rags started second favorite for the race behind Dullahan. John Velasquez settled the colt in fourth place on the rail as Paynter set the pace. In the straight, Union Rags made steady progress on the inside to overtake Paynter in the final strides and won by a neck. After the race, Matz said, \\"We always thought this horse had Triple Crown potential.\\" Union Rags was being prepared for a run in the Haskell Invitational when he sustained a tendon injury in his left front leg which ruled him out for the rest of the season. A week later it was announced that Union Rags would not race again and would be retired to stud. Stud career Union Rags entered stud at Lane's End Farm for the 2013 breeding season for a fee of $35,000. His first reported foal, a bay colt out of the Dehere mare Gleaming, was born on January 19, 2014. The colt, now named Confederate Rags, is a winner. On April 20, 2016, Union Rags had his first winner in Lady Stardust at Aqueduct in a maiden special weight race going 4 1/2 furlongs. On September 3, 2016 the filly Union Strike became his first Grade I winner when she won the Del Mar Debutante Stakes.

His ancestral name was Ying (嬴), and Duke Xian was his posthumous title. His given name was Shixi (師隰) or Lian (連). Accession to the throne Duke Xian was the son of Duke Ling of Qin, the 25th ruler of the state of Qin. However, when Duke Ling died in 415 BC, the throne was passed to Duke Ling's uncle Duke Jian, instead of his son. Duke Jian reigned for 15 years and was succeeded by his son Duke Hui II, who died 13 years later in 387 BC, and was then succeeded by his son Chuzi II. As Chuzi was only a baby, the power was controlled by his mother, the duchess dowager. In 385 BC, the second year of Chuzi's reign, the minister Jun Gai (菌改) rebelled against Chuzi and the duchess. He led his force to escort Duke Xian, who was at the time exiled in the State of Wei, back to Qin, killed Chuzi and his mother, and installed Duke Xian on the throne. Reforms By the time Duke Xian finally became the monarch of Qin thirty years after the death of his father, decades of internal turmoil had greatly weakened the formerly powerful state of Qin. The neighbouring state of Wei, on the other hand, grew stronger and annexed Qin's Hexi territory (west of the Yellow River). =Abolition of human sacrifice= As soon as he ascended the throne, Duke Xian started to make a series of reforms. In 384 BC, the first year of his reign, he abolished the practice of funeral human sacrifice started nearly three centuries before by Duke Wu, the tenth ruler of Qin, who had 66 people buried with him in 678 BC. The fourteenth ruler Duke Mu had 177 people buried with him in 621 BC, including several senior government officials. Afterwards the people of Qin wrote the famous poem Yellow Bird to condemn this barbaric practice, later compiled in the Confucian Classic of Poetry,Yellow Bird, Classic of Poetry (in Chinese). but the practice would still continue for more than two centuries until Duke Xian abolished it. Modern historian Ma Feibai considers the significance of Duke Xian's abolition of human sacrifice to Chinese history comparable to that of Abraham Lincoln's abolition of slavery to American history. =Moving the capital= In 383 BC, the second year of his reign, Duke Xian moved the Qin capital from the long-time capital Yong (in present-day Fengxiang, Shaanxi) several hundred kilometers east to Yueyang (in present-day Yanliang District of Xi'an). The move shifted the center of Qin closer to other states such as Wei, Han, and Zhao, facilitated commerce, and weakened the powerful aristocratic clans that were entrenched in the old capital. =Establishing counties= Duke Xian expanded the practice of establishing counties, which were administered by bureaucrats appointed by the central government. This was a major departure from the then prevalent practice of enfeoffing territories to hereditary aristocrats who ran their fiefs like mini-states. Duke Xian established several counties in Pu, Lantian, Pumingshi, and even in the new capital Yueyang. The reform strengthened the power of the central government, and would be further expanded to the whole state by the famous reformer Shang Yang under Duke Xian's successor Duke Xiao, contributing to Qin's rise and eventual unification of China. War with Wei In 364 BC, Qin and the State of Wei fought at Shimen (in present-day Yuncheng, Shanxi), and the Qin army for the first time inflicted a major defeat on Wei, until then the strongest power of the Warring States period, reportedly killing 60,000 Wei soldiers. King Xian of Zhou, the nominal ruler of China, congratulated Duke Xian and Duke Xian declared himself the Hegemon of China. Two years later, Qin attacked Wei again at Shaoliang (少梁, in present-day Hancheng, Shaanxi), and captured Wei general Gongsun Cuo (公孙痤). Death and succession Duke Xian reigned for 23 years and died in 362 BC at the age of 62. He was succeeded by his son Duke Xiao of Qin. He was buried in Xiaoyu, near his capital Yueyang.

The book was released on June 19, 2012. It is McLean's first written, but second published, work. It is the only published biography of Brandon deWilde since his death in 1972. Summary and themes All Fall Down, The Brandon deWilde Story covers mostly chronologically the life of Brooklyn-born Andre Brandon deWilde, growing up in Baldwin, Nassau County, New York, then moving to Manhattan with his parents after a series of events catapulted him from a typical 7 year old American school boy to a national phenomenon as a child prodigy theatre and film actor that eventually earned him the tag of \\"one of America's most heartrending cultural icons\\".RememberingBrandon.netMcLean, Patrisha, All Fall Down, The Brandon deWilde Story c. 2012, Faces, Incorporated McLean writes how deWilde achieved fame as the \\"tow-headed, gap-toothed boy\\" who starred in the films The Member of the Wedding (1952) and Shane (1953), the latter which earned him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination, at age 11, for uttering the immortal words, \\"Shane, come back\\", to Alan Ladd. He continued into adulthood with similar successes, until an obsession with music and a dependence on drugs brought his career to a self-imposed standstill. In a twist of the child actor's curse, deWilde's problems arose not from a lack of work, but rather from a continuation of it. Well into his late 20s his youthful features had him performing roles as teenagers and college students. First married in 1963 at age 21, the union lasted until 1969, producing one son, Jesse. A second marriage in 1972, turning drug-free and a return to the stage were all cut short when deWilde was killed in a motor vehicle accident at age 30.Brooklyn Daily Eagle / Gifted Young Brooklynite Through personal interviews, public records, published accounts and deWilde's own words, McLean weaves her story from the time prior to his parents meeting through the aftermath and void left after his death. As reported on the RememberingBrandon.net website, \\"McLean's 2012 interviews with deWilde's elusive widow, Janice Gero, illuminate the dark period of Brandon's life with a candor and honesty heretofore unknown. 'We were so poor we went to the grocery store and were actually taking bags of beans and were putting them inside our clothes to get something to eat,' recalls Janice. 'I never forget it because I had never stolen anything'\\". Writing process McLean's manuscript had been a completed work for more than two decades having been put in repose because Brandon, \\"...never reached the cult status of other dead stars like James Dean\\", according to agents and publishers. About 75 important people in deWilde's life, some now deceased, contributed to the project including family members and friends, schoolmates, colleagues Paul Newman, Julie Harris, Patrick Wayne, Patricia Neal, Chuck Connors, Helen Hayes and others. A combination of events in 2011 persuaded her to revive the project, including \\"an explosion\\" of information and worldwide interest on the internet, the encouragement from her daughter, Jackie Lee, a college senior and writer, and in 2012 finally locating and conducting a series of interviews with deWilde's widow. McLean, a former newspaper reporter, had previously authored and published Maine Street: Faces and Stories from a Small Town (2009) with Down East Books. She resides in Camden, Maine, divorced from Don McLean her husband of many years and conducts an art photography of children business.

The characteristics of each shrine are different. There is a general discourse about the protecting power of the shrines and the spirits that inhabit them echoing the main themes of the ethnic boundary described earlier. Each Saafi village had at least one shrine; and the shrines, each of which had a name and specific characteristics, defined a public sphere of religious ritual that was common to the village. Bandia had the Koffki, Guinabour had Graam and a sacred well, Tchiki had Carit and Enge (an ancestral shrine), Kirène had Jayña, Ndiass (or Diass) had Sahee, Dobour had a spring with healing waters. Each shrine was controlled or administered by a particular matrilineal clan, and one clan, the Leemu, controlled most of the shrines. All the shrines served as focal points for the divination ceremonies held before the beginning of the rainy season. Most were sites of periodic sacrifice to the indwelling spirits,Animal and crop offerings : See Serer religion and Saltigue but the shrines had their own unique characteristics. In addition to possessing the one judging shrine that could kill, Bandia played a key role in the prayers to Koox (the atmospheric supreme God), that occurred only in serious times of drought that threatened the entire district. The shrines at Guinabour (Graam) and Diass (Sahee) could be described as wind spirits. They protected the villages by raising a wind that made them invisible to their enemies, particularly the Wolof. In more general terms, past migrations into the region and the founding of village shrines are essential features of Saafi identity and the system of defense that protected the independence of the region.Diouf, Mamadou, & Leichtman, Mara, \\"New Perspectives On Islam in Senegal\\", January 6, 2009, p 95, [in] Palgrave MacMillan, 2008, History Culture Unlike the Serer-Sine, and most ethnic groups of the Sene-Gambian region, the Saafi people do not have a caste system of griots, slaves, nobility, leather workers, etc. They were ruled over by the heads of the ten matriclans. They rejected Islam, monarchy (centralized government of any kind) and the social distinctions that went along with it, specifically caste and slavery. The Saafi society is purely egalitarian.Diouf, Mamadou, & Leichtman, Mara, \\"New Perspectives On Islam in Senegal\\", January 6, 2009, p 93, [in] Palgrave MacMillan, 2008, The Saafi people inhabit a fertile, well-watered region on the downward slope and valleys of an escarpment with underground streams feeding into the River. Fertility permits relatively intense farming combined with herding cattle and goats, a combination crucial to the Saafi identity and social institutions.Diouf, Mamadou, & Leichtman, Mara, \\"New Perspectives On Islam in Senegal\\", January 6, 2009, p 94, [in] Palgrave MacMillan, 2008, The male life cycle is particular tied to the combination of farming and herding. Boys herd from approximately eight or ten years old until the age of initiation, which occurs between fifteen and twenty years of age. After being called by the father (in consultation with the maternal uncle) to circumcision, the boys enter an age class of initiates made up of forty to sixty young men. After a celebration, the boys are circumcised in a special enclosure where they spend three months studying cosaan (a term corresponding to history, culture, etc.) by learning songs and their meaning. By the end of the period, sustained by meat feasts supplied by fathers and uncles, the initiates emerge as an age class of bachelors with their own secret song. These bachelors receive the weapons and tools of men as gifts from the father, but from this point on they farm for themselves and their uncles. The age class is bound together for the rest of their lives, helping each other to farm, fight, raid (in particular, European colonizers - see Timeline of Serer history), and marry. Married men continue farming but leave the bachelor class. The age classes gathered together males from all clans, and they were the main potential counterweight to the power of the clan leaders. Although the bachelor class formed the military class, people placed greater stress on the protecting power of the village shrines. Language They speak the Saafi language which is part of the Niger-Congo family. Their language is the principal Cangin language and is closer to Palor and Laalaa. In Serer symbols and symbolism, the Saafi people have contributed to many of these symbols. Although not true writing within the definition of the word, Henry Gravrand posits that communication is possible between those who can decipher it, who are usually the initiated. It has been suggested that the mere fact of coming from a Serer heritage does not necessarily equate to having the ability to decipher the symbols, but requires initiation and patience.Madiya, Clémentine Faïk-Nzuji, \\"Canadian Museum of Civilization\\", Canadian Centre for Folk Culture Studies, \\"International Centre for African Language, Literature and Tradition\\", (Louvain, Belgium), p 5, Notes Category:Serer people ","title":"Saafi people"},{"id":"35713115","text":"SunWest, formerly the SunWest Mine, was a limestone mine business in Hudson, Florida.

Published in 1983, it appeared forty years after the preceding book. The title refers to a small museum that the four Moffat children set up to help them remember the special times in their lives now that they are growing up. Like the rest of the series, The Moffat Museum is set in small Cranbury, Connecticut in the early 1900s. Plot \\"The Moffats should have a museum! Suddenly the idea popped into Jane's head…\\"Estes, Eleanor, The Moffat Museum, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2001, pg. 1; Staring idly at the family's barn one day, Jane gets the amazing idea for a Moffat Family Museum, to hold any first or treasured things the Moffat children can think of. The first artifact for their museum is the bike that all four of them used to learn to ride. Rufus' teacher will be spending the summer in London, and she tells the class about the wax museum she plans on visiting while she's there. Rufus is inspired to become a wax statue for the museum, and gathers all the crayons and candles and odd bits of wax in the house to transform himself into \\"Rufus, the Waxworks Boy\\". It's a good time for the Moffats to be storing up memories, because things are changing. Baby Rufus is growing up, and Sylvie is getting ready to marry Reverend Mr. Abbot. Soon Joey will be taking a full-time job. But the museum helps them celebrate and remember their past as they face the future together. Reception Kirkus Reviews gave The Moffat Museum a starred review for \\"\\"books of remarkable merit\\", saying that \\"Estes has lost none of her feel for childhood's small, chance ecstasies--and the Moffats, have lost none of their small-town 1919 appeal… A notable series goes on undiminished--for a third generation of child-readers.\\" Taking note of the forty years between the previous book and this one, Anita Silvey says \\"the writing style proves the writer's ear was still well tuned to the language and thoughts of children\\".

It is often called the online version of \\"Do Not Call\\". The legislation is supported by privacy advocates and opposed by advertisers and services that use tracking information to personalize web content. Senator Josh Hawley has introduced currently pending legislation called the Do Not Track Act.https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th- congress/senate-bill/1578/text  Overview  With the development of Internet technology, a large number of people, business entities and organizations are interacting with each other. For instance, Facebook enables its users to socialize with each other. Google provides e-mail services and entertainment through Gmail and YouTube. Customers pay fees for the services or are exposed to advertisements. While this interaction is processed, users leave a trace of their personal information such as IP address or search history on the internet. Personal information has become a valuable asset because many business entrepreneurs are utilizing it to implement targeting advertisements or marketing promotions. According to a press released from the Consumer Watchdog, however, there is a growing concern for rampant collection of personal information. Privacy advocates worry about the fact that search engine companies can store and utilize the users’ personal information such as medical history, criminal records, profile, location and their orientation for implementing a marketing strategy. In an effort to alleviate those concerns, several U.S. legislators are trying to enact laws to protect internet users’ privacy. Commonly, U.S. citizens know that their online behaviors are being tracked by advertisers, and they are often opposed to this practice. A survey conducted by The Gallup Organization and the USA Today shows 61% of respondents know that some advertisements are shown to them based on their interests. 67% of respondents said that targeting advertisements based on consumers’ online behaviors is unallowable, and 61% of respondents argued that online behavior tracking is unjustifiable. 37% of respondents answered they do not want targeting advertisement, 14% said that they would allow those advertisements.  History  On December 1, 2010, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published a preliminary report highlighting the consumers’ right to prevent websites from tracking their online behaviors. The central plank of the bill was to adopt a Do Not Track opt-out function to web browsers. The FTC judged that online marketers’ pervasive collection of personal information could possibly violate privacy. This issue began to surface again in 2012 after Google announced its new privacy policy. Reps. Edward Markey, Joe Barton, and Cliff Stearns asked the FTC to investigate the legality of Google’s change of privacy policy. They sent a letter to the FTC regarding Google’s changed privacy policy.Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX), cosponsor Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA), cosponsor Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-FL), \\"Letter to FTC regarding Google\\" (February 17, 2012), http://markey.house.gov/sites/markey.house.gov/files/documents/2-17-12%20LTR%20to%20FTC%20Regarding%20Google.pdf  United States legislation  = Do Not Track Act of 2019 = The most recent legislation was introduced by Senator Josh Hawley in 2019. The bill updates previous efforts to create Do Not Track programs by applying the concept beyond web browsers and to all Internet activity, including mobile applications. The bill would allow individuals to, at a touch of a button, prohibit any company from collecting any more data than is indispensable to providing its service, and the bill would impose strict penalties on any company that violated the act.https://www.hawley.senate.gov/senator-hawley- introduce-legislation-give-american-people-do-not-track-option = Do Not Track Me Online Act of 2011 = The Do Not Track Me Online Act of 2011 attempted to make the FTC set the standards for the use of an online opt-out function in the United States, which allows a consumer to forbid the collection or use of private information and to demand a business entity to comply with the choice of a consumer to opt out of such collection or use.Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA), \\"Do Not Track Me Online Act of 2011\\" (February 11, 2011), http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr654ih/pdf/BILLS-112hr654ih.pdf The bill was regarded as an online version of the Do Not Call law which prevents telemarketers from placing a call to individuals who do not want to receive calls from them. This bill also stated that each respective business entity should disclose the current status of personal information collection and whom they share the information with. According to the Do Not Track Me Online Act of 2011, personal information includes: * Name, a postal address or other location, an email address or other user name, a telephone or fax number * Government-issued identification numbers like tax identification numbers, passport numbers, or driver’s license numbers * Financial account number, or credit card or debit card number, or any required security code, access code, or password that is necessary to permit access to an individual’s financial account The bill also forbids data collection about the following: * Medical history, physical or mental health, or the provision of health care to the individual * Race or ethnicity * Religious beliefs and affiliation * Sexual orientation or sexual behavior * Income, assets, liabilities, or financial records, and other financial information associated with a financial account, including balances and other financial information, except when financial account information is provided by the individual and is used only to process an authorized credit or debit to the account * Precise geolocation information and any information about the individual’s activities and relationships associated with such geolocation * Biometric data, including a fingerprint or retina scan * Social Security number The bill was introduced on February 11, 2011.

This bill also included: * Levying a fine to companies which do not follow the bill * Requiring every company in California to make public the activities such as collection, utilization, and storage of customers’ personal information * Providing methods to select whether or not to be tracked for the customers However; on April 27, 2011, several business entities expressed strong opposition to the bill in a letter. The objectors characterized the bill as: * Unnecessary * Harmful for California’s Internet economy and innovation * Unworkable and unenforceable * Gratuitously singles out advertising companies for special regulation * Would have repercussions beyond entities directly regulated by the bill * Costly to the state of California * Unconstitutional = California Assembly Bill AB 370 = The state's Assembly and Senate approved the bill (AB 370) that requires commercial websites and online services to disclose how they respond to an Internet browser's \\"do not track\\" signals and whether and how third parties collect personally identifiable information from consumers who visit those sites. THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS: SECTION 1. Section 22575 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read: 22575\\\\. (a) An operator of a commercial Web site or online service that collects personally identifiable information through the Internet about individual consumers residing in California who use or visit its commercial Web site or online service shall conspicuously post its privacy policy on its Web site, or in the case of an operator of an online service, make that policy available in accordance with paragraph (5) of subdivision (b) of Section 22577. An operator shall be in violation of this subdivision only if the operator fails to post its policy within 30 days after being notified of noncompliance. (b) The privacy policy required by subdivision (a) shall do all of the following: (1) Identify the categories of personally identifiable information that the operator collects through the Web site or online service about individual consumers who use or visit its commercial Web site or online service and the categories of third- party persons or entities with whom the operator may share that personally identifiable information. (2) If the operator maintains a process for an individual consumer who uses or visits its commercial Web site or online service to review and request changes to any of his or her personally identifiable information that is collected through the Web site or online service, provide a description of that process. (3) Describe the process by which the operator notifies consumers who use or visit its commercial Web site or online service of material changes to the operator’s privacy policy for that Web site or online service. (4) Identify its effective date. (5) Disclose how the operator responds to Web browser “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services, if the operator engages in that collection. (6) Disclose whether other parties may collect personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across different Web sites when a consumer uses the operator’s Web site or service. (7) An operator may satisfy the requirement of paragraph (5) by providing a clear and conspicuous hyperlink in the operator’s privacy policy to an online location containing a description, including the effects, of any program or protocol the operator follows that offers the consumer that choice. = Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 = Effective April 21, 2000, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) applies to the online collection of personal information by persons or entities under U.S. jurisdiction about children under 13 years of age. It details what a website operator must include in a privacy policy, when and how to seek verifiable consent from a parent or guardian, and what responsibilities an operator has to protect children's privacy and safety online including restrictions on the marketing of those under 13. = Consumer Privacy Protection Act of 2011 = Reps. Cliff Stearns and Jim Matheson introduced a bill to improve and protect consumer privacy on April 13, 2011. This bill suggests consumers control the uses of private information collected by websites. This bill also states that consumers should be able to place a limit upon the disclosure of information to third-party websites. According to this bill, websites must prompt a clear and conspicuous notice for customers before collecting personal information which is irrelevant to main transactions.Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-FL), cosponsor Rep. Matheson (D-UT), \\"Consumer Privacy Protection Act of 2011\\" (April 13, 2011), http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr1528ih/pdf/BILLS-112hr1528ih.pdf In addition, at the time of the information collection, websites must display their privacy policy to customers. The policy is supposed to clarify the types of information collected, as well as the way the information would be utilized. Websites are also required to provide consumers with the \\"opt-out\\" option. Once the customer makes a decision, websites cannot ask him/her to change the opt-out status until at least a year after the customers’ choice. = Commercial Privacy Bill of Rights = Senators John Kerry and John McCain announced a bipartisan Commercial Privacy Bill of Rights, the United States' \\"first comprehensive privacy law\\", during a press conference on April 12, 2011.Sen.

It mandated that websites collecting user information: *Implement security measures *Provide clear notice to customers *Provide opt- out mechanism to users *Collect personal information in order only to process a transaction or to enhance the quality of service * Discard the information collected after a certain period of time = Do Not Track Online Act of 2011 = On May 6, 2011, the U.S. Senate pushed ahead a bill forbidding online business entities from collecting online users’ location information.Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), \\"Do Not Track Online Act of 2011\\" (May 6, 2011), http://commerce.senate.gov/public/?a=Files.Serve&File;_id=85b45cce-63b3-4241-99f1-0bc57c5c1cff According to this bill, corporations can collect user information under an apparent consent. The notice on the collection and use of information should be provided to users in a clear, conspicuous, and accurate manner. Senator Jay Rockefeller, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, mandated corporations to respect users’ denial of information collection. In addition, the FTC was mandated to punish corporations not following this bill. The bill includes civil penalties of $16,000 per day for violations, with a maximum total liability of $15 million. = Do Not Track Kids Act of 2011 = Representative Edward Markey introduced a bill called the \\"Do Not Track Kids Act of 2011\\".Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA), \\"Do Not Track Kids Act of 2011\\" (May 5, 2011), http://markey.house.gov/sites/markey.house.gov/files/documents/dntk_legislation_0.pdf This bill requires that online stores should get parents’ consent when they collect kids’ information. Even though they can collect it, they cannot use it for marketing purposes. The goal of the \\"Do Not Track Kids Act of 2011\\" is to strengthen privacy protection for children by: *Requiring data brokers to explain the type of information being collected, how the information is used, and policies related to collection of information *Mandating online companies to get parents' consent before collecting children's information *Preventing online companies from utilizing the collected data for target marketing purposes *For parents and children, providing an \\"erase button\\" in order to get rid of publicly available information content online = Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights = The Obama administration announced that consumers have right to control which companies collect and use their information. The administration also stated that the privacy policy of companies should be transparent and understandable, and hacking and personal information leakage should be completely stopped.The White House, \\"Consumer Privacy Data in a Networked World\\" (Feb 23, 2012), http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/privacy-final.pdf The Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights advances these objectives by holding that consumers have a right to: *Individual Control: Consumers have a right to exercise control over what personal data companies collect from them and how they use it *Transparency: Consumers have a right to easily understandable and accessible information about privacy and security practices *Respect for Context: Consumers have a right to expect that companies will collect, use, and disclose personal data in ways that are consistent with the context in which consumers provide the data *Security: Consumers have a right to secure and responsible handling of personal data *Access and Accuracy: Consumers have a right to access and correct personal data in usable formats, in a manner that is appropriate to the sensitivity of the data and the risk of adverse consequences to consumers if the data is inaccurate *Focused Collection: Consumers have a right to reasonable limits on the personal data that companies collect and retain *Accountability: Consumers have a right to have personal data handled by companies with appropriate measures in place to assure they adhere to the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights The purpose of the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights is to deter Internet companies from indiscriminate collection of personal information for targeted ads. In response, The Internet companies such as Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, and AOL promised to provide a \\"do not track\\" mechanism so that customers can choose whether they want to participate in online behavioral advertising or not. However, the guideline has its limitation that it is not enforceable. The Obama Administration encouraged the United States Congress to grant the Federal Trade Commission the authority to enforce each element of the statutory Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights. Once enacted, Internet companies infringing upon the rights put forth in these guidelines could suffer sanctions from the FTC. = A new Commercial Privacy Bill of Rights = \\"A new Commercial Privacy Bill of Rights\\" was introduced by Sen. John Kerry and Sen. John McCain. = Federal Trade Commission report = In March 2012 the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published a report called \\"Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change\\". FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz stated that \\"data brokers have deceived the Internet users” and “we need to focus on that the data brokers have collected personal information without the users knowing it\\". The FTC articulated that the purpose of the report was to protect the user privacy which is constantly exposed while surfing the Internet. In addition, the FTC discussed the Do Not Track mechanism and recommended browser vendors to enable users to control the level of personal information tracking by adopting an opt-out function. The Digital Advertising Alliance agreed with the FTC proposal, and it is planning to adopt the opt-out function within 2012. The FTC also recommends mobile application companies to come up with simple, effective, and approachable privacy protection measures. It also required data brokers to reveal their identities by establishing a centralized website enabling transparent collection of personal information, and to allow users to access personal information collected by data brokers.  The Right to be Forgotten (European Union)  = Concept = The European Union expressed its concern about the personal information management. On January 25, 2012, Viviane Reding, the vice chairperson of the European Commission, suggested General Data Protection Regulation which is a more strict form than the Directive 95/46/EC is. This is a right to ask service providers to delete the personal information which were collected by data brokers under a users’ consent in order to strengthen the user information protection. The right to be forgotten also includes the notion of not to be searched, and extinctive prescription of information.European Commission, \\"Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council\\", (January 25, 2012), http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data- protection/document/review2012/com_2012_11_en.pdf The regulation recommends service providers to request consent from their users when they deal with sensitive personal information. When failing to comply with the regulation, service providers would be fined up to €1 million or 2% of their sales figures. Reding articulated that change of regulations related to the past Internet environment is inevitable due to the changes of digital circumstances such as technological development and globalization. She also stated that the current credibility of Internet companies is low because of weak personal information management. The proposed law would include the following: * Autonomic control of personal information * Applicable regulation not only of companies based in the EU area, but also for companies dealing with personal information of EU citizens * Request users’ apparent consent before collecting personal information * A unitary regulation applied to the entire EU * Mandatory reporting when information leakage occurs * Transferable personal information when users change their Internet service provider = Objection against the statute = As a response to the proposal, there are several objections against the statute. * Corporations are opposed to it, claiming that the strict internet standard would aggravate the economic situation of EU and retard the development of the Internet industry * Edward Vaizey, the Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries in UK, raised doubt on how they can implement the “right to be forgotten” since it is easy to replicate the original copy of content on the Internet * The Center of Digital Democracy (CDD) anticipated that it would not be easy for the EU to reach an agreement with the Internet service providers  Discard of resident registration numbers (South Korea)  = Concept = The resident registration numbers (RRN) have been used for online identification purposes in South Korea. The Korea Communications Commission introduced a law preventing the Internet websites which have more than 10,000 daily active users from collecting and using RRN; it took effect on August 18, 2012. The range of law will be extended to every website in 2013. = Objection against the statute = However, there are arguments against this law: * RRN is required to be presented in order to identify users as a way of protecting vulnerable users such as teenagers or the handicapped from indecent content * RRN is widely used for online transactions but there are no suitable alternatives * Preparing systems for other verification methods such as i-PIN or authentication certificate can lay an economic burden on service providers  Opposition to Do Not Track  There are some arguments against Do Not Track proposal. Opponents emphasize its economic benefits of online behavioral advertising and its quality of services. According to their arguments: * Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA) and e-mail are the most effective advertising methods. Privacy regulation can reduce the effectiveness of behavioral advertising. If the effectiveness of OBA deteriorates, the credibility for the effectiveness of advertisement would be diminished, thus hindering entire economic recovery * Behavioral targeting is an essential part of ad network, publisher, and advertiser success. Behavioral targeting advertisement is an important revenue source for publishers and ad networks. Content supported by advertisers is a crucial component of traditional media * Service providers such as Google collect personal information in order to provide higher-quality service. Moreover, this information collection has been modified reflect changing trends  Reactions of online companies  Among the major Internet browsers and search engines, the Do Not Track policy has been quite controversial. For instance, Google’s contentious privacy settings, effective earlier this year, raised questions of how companies would interpret and implement the Do Not Track policy. Microsoft has recently implemented a Do Not Track option into its Internet Explorer 10 browser as its default setting, which has instigated a number of public comments and critique from major companies. Sarah Downey, from Abine Inc., commented on Fox Business Network that even if you opt-in on the Do Not Track option, advertisers can still collect your data and track your behavior. Abine Inc. created a Do Not Track Plus add-on that claims to completely block tracking. Downey continues to state that the in-browser Do Not Track option is a more of a \\"voluntary message\\" or a \\"request, not an obligation\\" to the advertisers not to track you. Furthermore, the Digital Advertising Alliance stated, earlier this year at an industry consortium, that the Do Not Track option should be a “choice actively made by an individual consumer”, in which Microsoft’s new software denies consumers that choice. A Yahoo! Policy blog post also argues that Microsoft’s decision “degrades the experience for the majority of users and makes it hard to deliver on our value proposition to them”. Executives from Dell, IBM, Intel, Visa, Verizon, Walmart, and Yahoo!, one of the initial supporters of the Do Not Track policy, argue that Microsoft should \\"realign with the broader business community by providing choice through a default of 'off' on your browser's 'do not track' setting\\".

Yet on weekends she meets with her gang of violent Nazis, xenophobic lower class kids. She and her boyfriend Sandro (Gerdy Zint) violently attack and beat down foreign-looking passengers on a train and even attack a conductor. Soone thereafter police raids her house while she is watering her grandpa's flowers. Both she and Sandro are arrested and Sandro is sent to prison. Meanwhile it is shown that Svenja's stepfather is incredibly strict on her against which she eventually rebels. She meets 19-year-old Markus (Lukas Steltner) who works for her family in their garden and they start hanging out. He turns out to be friends with Marisa and is a Neo-Nazi like Marisa. 15-year-old Svenja is very intrigued by the violent, partying, in-the-moment life-style these young Nazis have and becomes more and more involved. Sandro is eventually about to be released from prison and Marisa's mother (Rosa Enskat) cannot stand the thought of Sandro moving in with her daughter while Marisa even wants to have a child with him. Mother and daughter have a sharp dispute over the issue in the local grocery shop where both of them work. After her fight with her mother two young refugee brothers from Afghanistan (Sayed Ahmad Wasil Mrowat as Rasul and Najebullah \\"Najeb\\" Ahmadi as Jamil) become the target of her bad mood. Later Marisa and her gang enjoy themselves at the shore. They consume a lot of alcohol and chant aggressive slogans about Marisa's two former customers who arrive on the scene to take a swim. Rasul and Jamil are chased off the shore. The appalled Rasul breaks the side mirror of Marisa's car as they leave. Marisa later finds her mirror broken off and chases the two who are heading \\"home\\" on Jamil's scooter. She uses her car as a weapon pushing them off the road at high speed. Then she flees the scene. Back with her friends she attempts to drown her qualms in alcohol. At this point Svenja and her new friend have also shown up at the beach but are chased away by a furious Marisa. Some time later Marisa sees Rasul again at her workplace and he is short of money. She still lets him do his shopping. Meanwhile Rasul's situation has gotten worse. As a result of the accident Jamil's papers have been checked officially in hospital and he got deported. Rasul is supposed to live in an orphanage. He eludes his custodians and is caught red-handed during shoplifting by Marisa's mom. Marisa gets violent against her own mother just to free Rasul before she follows him to his hiding place where he offers her a drink and helps her bandage a foot injury. Sandro is released from prison and Marisa picks him up and complies with his wish to visit a Neo-Nazi party where Sandro buys the pistol of an old Austrian Nazi. He frightens off Markus, beating him down and kicking him out of the gang. Little later Markus blindsides Sandro with some accomplices and they heavily beat down Sandro. He attempts to restore his self-confidence by forcing himself on Marisa. Afterwards he also threatens a number of immigrants with his pistol and beats up Rasul when he sees him in front of Marisa's house. Marisa decides to help Rasul to get to Sweden where his uncle lives. She tells her friend Svenja to come with them because Svenja recently ran away from home with a large sum of money stolen from her stepfather. She takes revenge for Rasul and herself by beating up Sandro with a baseball bat who opposed her plan to get away from him. But Sandro catches up as they reach Rügen where a boat will leave to Sweden because Svenja has called him and asked him to pick her up revealing their position to him. He arrives on the scene and fires a single shot from the pistol he bought shooting Marisa dead minutes after Rasul left on a boat.

It grows in savannas and sandy bog areas of the Southeastern United States. Pinguicula lutea’s flower is usually in a bright yellow or a straw-yellow color and very rare in white color.Barry Rice, The Carnivorous Plant FAQ, January 2011 Like all the insectivorous plants of the genus Pinguicula, P. lutea traps small insects by using specialized glands on the surface of its basal rosette leaves. Distribution Pinguicula lutea lives along the Gulf Coastal plain of the south-east USA. It is commonly found in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida and Southeast Louisiana.Sagebud, Yellow Butterwort (Pinguicula Lutea), April 28, 2012 Habitat Pinguicula lutea thrives in a drier environment as compare to other Pinguicula that live in the South. It prefers to grow on poor nutritive soil and in acidic bogs with the pH ranges from 5.0 to 6.0.Carolina Carnivores, Yellow Butterwort- Pinguicula Lutea, 2004 The soil is mix of half peat moss and half sand. Partial shade areas like open pine wood, marshes, moist savannas, and sandy soils are favorable by P. lutea. Leaves Pinguicula lutea is a perennial herbaceous plant. The leaves of P. lutea are yellowish-green basal rosettes. The simple shape leaf blade displaces from ovule to oblong.eNature, Yellow Butterwort, 2007 P. lutea has curved leaves and pointed tip. The size of a mature leaf is around 5 to 7.5 cm long and 2.5 cm wide. The diameter of an entire rosette can up to 15 cm. The fleshy surfaces of the leaves are covered with numerous sticky droplets called the mucilage. The mucilage is secreted by the peduncular gland on the top of each stalk. Small insects often get trap by the glandular stalks for mistaking the mucilage as water drops.Botanical Society of America, the Butterworts, April 28,2012 Once the prey stuck on the droplets, a digestive enzyme is released to extract nitrogen from the insect. The margin of the leaves also slowly roll inward and relax again after the digestion is complete. Like many carnivorous plants, this trapping mechanism allows the plant to seek supplement nitrogen sources from the insect as a way to replace the nutrient-deficient habitat. Flowers and fruits Flowers of P. lutea open from February to May. P. lutea produces yellow solitary flowers each with five irregular petals and five sepals. A flower petal has one to several notches. One of the petals extended all the way down to the back and forms a 1 cm long slender spur. This structure holds the nectar. Usually, only pollinators that have a long tongue can reach the nectar. The size of the flowers ranges from 1 to 3 cm. The flower is held slightly upright on one of the long stalks that come from the basal rosette. P. lutea can produce multiple flower stalks in spring and can reach as high as 50 cm.Native Plant Database,Pinguicula lutea Walt., 2012 Both the stalk and the sepals of the P. lutea are covered with fine hairs. After a flower is pollinated by a pollinator, the flower develops into a rough capsule. Within the capsule there are small seeds with a diameter of 8mm.

Typically, it is found in the form of a small tree or a large shrub and blooms in early spring, usually in the months of March and April. Flowers of the Texas Hawthorn are white and usually produce small, one-inch, scarlet fruits that are said to resemble tiny red apples. Its twigs are usually armed with thorns that can grow to be about one to three inches long. Distribution Crataegus texana is a native species to the United States. It has a limited range, growing in only nine or ten counties of the coastal plain and south- central Texas regions. It can be found in the rich bottomlands and river bottoms in the Gulf Prairies and marshes and in rich sandy clay loams of the Post Oak Savannah and Rio Grande Plains. Habitat and ecology Crataegus texana usually grows in bottomland soil near an intermittent water source. It can, however, be found to grow in fencerows as well as in areas with heavy deciduous shrub and vine growth. It has a moderate heat tolerance and needs only a modest amount of water. It can grow in areas with partial sunlight and has adaptable soil requirements.\\"Crataegus texana\\" is a deciduous tree meaning that it sheds its leaves every year. Morphology Crataegus texana is a perennial tree that grows to be about 25 feet tall and has long, sharp thorns. It has shiny, dark green leaves that can grow to be between 0.75-1.5 inches long. Its simple leaves have toothed leaf margins with a parallel veination. Their leaves are ovate in shape, acute at the apex, and cuneate at the base. Flowers and fruit Flowers of Crataegus texana grow in flat-topped clusters of five white petals to be about 0.50-0.75 inches wide. It blooms in early spring and develops a round, fleshy, red fruit that is actually a pome, a fleshy fruit that has an outer thickened layer with a central core that contains seeds located inside a capsule. =Food= The edible fruits are sometimes cooked into jams and jellies. Also, upon distillation, the Texas hawthorn can be used to make liquors.

It is a perennial flowering plant that is often noted because of its yellow flowers. It has 18 chromosomes at the diploid stage. Description The morphology of the plant consists of a herb and its flower. The herb is erect, and the flowers have yellow sepals and multiple carpals. The herb has a green, oblong leaf with pinnate venation. These leaves are about 5–7 cm in length and 4–6 cm in width. The leaf blade is broad, while the base is suddenly narrowed and of an ovate or lanceolate lobed shape. The leaves are in alternate arrangement throughout the stem. In addition, it has a broad sinus base with \\"dorsifixed pubescence\\" underneath. The petiole is about 1–2 cm long. The rhizome is short, while the stem is erect, long branched, and colored white pubescent. Also, there are only a few stem-leaves. The herb grows from 100 to 150 cm. C. lavandulifolium flowers grow in a corymb-style head and are terminal. They also have yellow heads that contain multiple carpals; these stretch from 14–15 mm in diameter. They also contain three or four oblong bracts that have soft tissue and are elliptical and tipped. These bracts have hemispherical involucre or coverings. In addition, the yellow corollas of the flower are about 5–7 mm long and 1.5–2 mm wide These heads stretch to about 1.5 cm in diameter. These bisexual florets have obtuse and irregular anther bases. They have pistillate ray florets that can be yellow or white. From these pistillates, they produce achenes, which are indehiscent and angled. The pappus, a modified calyx, is not present or extremely small. Taxonomy The species was first described in 1872 by Ernst von Trautvetter as Pyrethrum lavandulifolium, with the name attributed to Friedrich von Fischer. In 1909, Tomitaro Makino placed the species in Chrysanthemum when describing Chrysanthemum boreale (which he had mentioned as a variety of C. indicum in 1902). He noted that C. boreale \\"came very near\\" to C. lavandulifolium. The two are now treated as one species. When it became understood that Linnaeus's Chrysanthemum, which was typified by a Mediterranean annual species, was distinct from the largely Asian perennial species, these latter, including C. lavandulifolium and C. boreale, were initially given names in the genus Dendranthema. In 1999, the genus name Chrysanthemum was conserved for the Asian species, so the name Chrysanthemum lavandulifolium became acceptable again. Distribution C. lavandulifolium naturally occurs or is native to regions of eastern Asia such as Korea, Japan, and China. In China, it is found in the provinces Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan. In Japan, it is found primarily in Honshu and Kyushu. In Korea, it is found in Gyeongsangbuk, Gangwon, and Chungcheongbuk. Chrysanthemums may have been introduced to Japan by Chinese in the eighth century AD. Habitat and ecology C. lavandulifolium, a perennial plant, grows well in warm climates around East Asia. It flowers from October to November. The plant grows well on moist clayey soils in full sun. It is also quite immune to high temperatures and lack of moisture. Medicinal use In Korea, C. lavandulifolium has been used to treat vertigo, a type of dizziness, in traditional medicine. In addition, its flowers have been used as an antipyretic. It has been also noted to have anti-inflammatory effects on disease such as atopic dermatitis. Diseases This particular type of chrysanthemum is noted to be affected by black plight. In addition, in Korea and other Asian countries, C. lavandulifolium has contracted a downy mildew infection caused by Paraperonospora minor. The fungi-like agents grow on leaves and turn them a yellowish color, and the plant eventually wilts until it dies out. This study was the first to find C. lavandulifolium with this infection.

This species of fish has a spotted distribution inhabiting various small rivers and streams in North America. The gravel chub requires a highly specific clean habitat making it vulnerable to various types of pollutants and in need of conservation efforts. Description The gravel chub is a medium-sized minnow usually smaller than 10 cm. Its slender body is colored silver with an olive tint on the back and a white tint on the front, followed by a crosshatch pattern all over the scales. The gravel chub is often misidentified as the streamline chub, the gravel chub can be distinguished from the streamline by the more defined crosshatch marking and lack of dark blotches along the lateral line, which runs straight from the anterior to posterior end of the fish. The gravel chub is also defined by its subterminal jaw with barbels extending from both of the upper and lower maxillary jaw bone. Their outer covering consists of small bony- ridged, cycloid scales (40–43 of these scales run along the lateral line) and a forked homocercal tail. Gravel Chubs are soft ray-finned fish and have no adipose fin. The pectoral fins are pointed made up of approximately 13-16 rays and located relatively low on the body, typical of primitive species. The pelvic fins are rounded, made up of eight rays and located further back posterior to the dorsal fin in the abdominal position. The caudal fin is moderately forked and pointed. Distribution and habitat Gravel chubs are mainly found in the Northeastern parts of North America, but there have also been reports of populations in Ontario's Thames river, but not since 1958. Studies in both the 1970s and 1980s of the Thames River further confirmed this. In North America its distribution has been described as spotty, expanding from south-central Arkansas to southern Minnesota and out towards western New York. In many states the fish is only seen in certain bodies of water. Examples of this is in New York where the species are only found in the drainage of Allegheny River, or in Minnesota where the gravel chub is limited to two drainage rivers of the Mississippi River: the Root River and the Upper Iowa River. In Wisconsin the gravel chub are confined to the lower Rock River including the lower Pecatonica River, lower Sugar River and the main channel. Gravel chubs inhabit select small rivers and medium to large creeks and streams. They are commonly seen gathered in slightly turbulent areas of water called a riffle. They can be found in the summer in water around 18 °C to 25 °C. They prefer long flat areas in river and stream beds and can also be found at the tail of rapids and head of pools where riffles are most common. They prefer bottom with fine limestone gravel and other pea-sized rocks. Gravel chubs are only found in clear, clean water and are intolerant to excess silt and debris. They are more often found in areas with limited macrophytes and larger root aquatic plants, algae and moss. Because of their need of a specialized clean habitats, the gravel chub is especially vulnerable to various forms of pollution, especially from agriculture practices that create erosion and excessive silt. In past sampling surveys the gravel chub had been found as far north in the Upper Iowa River as Le Roy, Minnesota, but because of excessive amounts of sewage, pesticides and sedimentation of rocks and sand, this is no longer the case. The presence of gravel chubs in a body of water is an indication of good water quality in the area. Diet The gravel chub has a pointier snout that allows it to probe the bottom of their habitat in search of small plant particles, desmids, diatoms, and tiny aquatic insects. Gravel chubs have a high density of taste buds on their snouts increasing their sensitivity to taste, which they use to locate their prey. Reproduction Little is known about the biological life cycle of the gravel chub. Studies of populations in Kansas indicate that spawning occurs in early spring, while in surveys of Minnesota waters, indicate spawning starting in May and continuing into June. Adult gravel chubs have been spotted spawning by gathering on gravel bars in soft currents created by a rise in the waterline after hard rains. Conservation status and management The gravel chub is considered a threatened species in many areas mostly due to the fact that it has a highly specific, clean habitat need. As of 1988 it was considered endangered in Kansas, under legal protection in Indiana and Wisconsin and considered a special concern in Kentucky, Minnesota and New York. Gravel chubs need constant mild currents with silt free riffles. Agriculture run-off is the biggest threat to this type of habitat, increasing the turbidity of the current and the amount of silt in rivers and streams. Populations in southern Minnesota are experiencing a great amount of stress due to the large amount sediment deposit from the Mississippi River that disturbs flow regimes. The Minnesota DNR has been continuing to monitor and improve water quality of rivers and streams in southern Minnesota. Iowa and New York also have put extra conservation efforts towards the gravel chub. In Iowa the gravel chub was once threatened, but now abundant all over the state. In New York there has been a strong push by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation to establish a bigger, self-sustaining population in the Allegheny River drainage basin by restocking and monitoring the gravel chub in the area. In order for conservation efforts to continue, more research needs to be done regarding the life cycle, genetics, and identification of habitat stressors. A better understanding of this species is vital to establishing a proper conservation management plan for the gravel chub.

Through plant invasion this species has become naturalized in many other parts of the world. Some of these naturalized regions include South Africa, North Western Europe, Australia and North America. Given the wide range of climate and ecological conditions of these regions, B. elongata has been able to disrupt the ecosystems of their native plant habitats and has been label as an invasive species in many of its naturalized zones. In North America, this species is often found as a roadside weed in the southwestern states, particularly in the state of Nevada. Studies allude that the Cruciferae might have migrated through the Bering land bridge from what is now Central Asia. Commonly known as the long-stalked rape or as ' in German, this species is a close cousin to Brassica napus (rapeseed) and a secondary genetic relative to B. oleracea (kale). As a close genetic species of the rapeseed, the long- stalked rape has one of the highest counts of accumulated polyunsaturated linoleic and linolenic acid. Both compounds are heavily used to manufacture vegetable oils. Brassica elongata has the propagative potential of turning into a horticultural product from what is currently a noxious weed. Distribution Brassica elongata is a native species that spreads from Eastern European countries starting from Austria to the Asian-Temperate that extends to Afghanistan and Iran. There are also areas in Northern Africa near Morocco with similar arid climates that have B. elongata as a native species. As an invasive species, B. elongata has spread north up to Norway, southwest into parts of France and Italy, and has even been introduced in large areas of Southern Africa, Southern Australia, and Southwest America.http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=BREL2 B. elongata was first collected in the United States at Linnton, Oregon by Wilhelm Suksdorf in 1911. The collection occurred near a surrounding ballast where ships were often unloaded but its specific subspecies of B. elongata was unknown. The next recording had occurred in Bingen, Washington in 1915. Thereafter in 1968, with no apparent evidence of the species spreading, Brassica elongata subsp. integrifolia was discovered by John Thomas Howell, an American botanist, while driving on the roadsides of US Highway 50 in the east-central regions of Nevada. Since then B. elongata has become an identifiable common sight of the regional flora of the desert regions of Eureka and White Pine counties. Distribution of Brassica elongata in the United States Habitat and ecology Brassica elongata is a perennial plant. Its habitat is often located in semi- arid to arid climates in regions located in Europe, central Asia, North America, Africa, and Australia. The plant undergoes its flowering during June through July in the Northern Hemisphere. It can grow on disturbed ground and on roads with open juniper and sagebrush desert areas. B. elongata can develop an abundant amount of seeds that germinate over a range of alternating temperatures. However, germination rates drop considerably at very cold seedbed temperatures. Description There are five subspecies of B. elongata: elongata, imdrhasiana, integrifolia, pinnatifida and subscaposa. The stems extend out from the base and are branched basally. The basal leaves are obovate to elliptic () and its margins are sub-entire to dentate. The cauline leaves have oblong or lanceolate leaves that are up to in length. The inflorescence is raceme. =Flowers and fruit= Petals on B. elongata are bright yellow to orange yellow with its apex rounded and mostly obovate. It reaches about and its sepals to about in length. The filaments are in length with anthers. The fruits have a valvular section with 5–11 seeds per locule. The fruits are spreading and ascending from the base and its seeds may differ in shades of grey to brown. The seeds are in diameter and its seed coat is dehiscent and becomes mucilaginous when wet. Potential commercial value Research has shown when measuring fatty acid content of some of the commonly known Brassicacae, such as Brassica napus, B. nigra and B. rapa, B. elongata has shown to have one of the higher counts of fatty acids in concentration of mass per leaf. These fatty acids, α-linolenic acid (C18:3n-3) and linoleic acid (C18:2n-6), are nutritional omega-3 oils and compounds that the human body is unable to synthesize. Research has shown that increased deficiencies in these polyunsaturated fatty acids lead to a higher rate of diseases for human populations in industrialized countries. While the USDA has labeled B. elongata as a noxious weed, cultivating this plant in its natural harsh and arid climate in order to harvest its organic compounds has a promising upside in a low risk scenario. Oils from the rapeseed (B. napus), a close tertiary genetic relative of B. elongata, are also currently being utilized to research alternative forms of biodiesel.

She has written over thirty history and STEM-based museum theatre pieces for cultural institutions across the United States and has been featured by the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, the United Nations' International Day of Women and Girls in Science, and on television across the globe. She is a member of Actors' Equity Association, SAG-AFTRA, and Dramatists Guild of America. Early Life and Training Elysia Segal was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and attended Lake Highland Preparatory School in Orlando, Florida. While there, she placed fifth at the 2003 National Catholic Forensics League National Championships and was elected to the Teen Arts Advisory Council for Orlando Mayor Glenda Hood. Segal also participated in the school's nationally acclaimed ASPIRE Science Research Program, which matches students with leading researchers at local research facilities to gain graduate-level analytical and research skills. She has since credited this experience as highly influential of her love of blending STEM topics and in- depth research with the arts. She was a semifinalist in the Discovery Channel Young Scientist Challenge and won first place at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in 2003 with her research project analyzing the use of proteoglycans as a biomarker for congenital hydrocephalus. Main-belt asteroid 17795 Elysiasegal was named for her in recognition of this achievement. Segal graduated from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts Drama program after studying at the Stella Adler Studio of Acting, the CAP21 Musical Theatre Conservatory, Stonestreet Studio's Film & TV Workshop, and at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, Ireland and went on to pursue a Masters of Arts in the inaugural class of the Museum Studies program at City University of New York, developed in collaboration with the New-York Historical Society. She is a Certified Interpretive Guide (CIG) through the National Association for Interpretation. Acting career Segal's performance credits include her portrayal of the feisty, lesbian performance artist \\"Maureen\\" in RENT, The Legend of Flowers (Lincoln Center), George M. Cohan: In His Own Words (Lake Placid Center for the Arts), and The Who's Tommy (DeBaun Center for Performing Arts). She has also made a number of film and television appearances including The Music Never Stopped (Official Selection of the 2011 Sundance Film Festival), Going the Distance, Royal Pains, and Mercy, and has appeared in numerous museum theatre performances at cultural sites across the United States (see below). In 2010, Segal starred as \\"Gillian\\" in Together This Time: A New Rock Musical by Andrew Heyman and Zac Kline, a role which she originated at NYU's Graduate Musical Theatre Writing Program two years prior. She also appeared in the show's off-Broadway premiere later that summer at the Lucille Lortel Theater. She also portrayed \\"Beth II\\" in Ryan O'Leary's 'Y: The Last Man', a film adapted from the Brian K. Vaughan and Pia Guerra graphic novels of the same name. It premiered at the 2011 Litchfield Hills Film Festival and screened with a Q&A; panel at I-CON 30 at Stony Brook University. She received a Best Actress nomination at the 2011 FTC Luminaries for her appearance in Louis Matta's time-travel film The Traveler, which went on to win Audience Favorite Sci-Fi Mini Short in the 2011 ShockerFest International Film Festival. Segal received a nomination for Outstanding Actress for her performance as \\"Daisy Miller\\" in the world premiere reading of the play Pushing Daisy at the Gene Frankel Theatre. The largely autobiographical piece by playwright and cancer survivor Lauren Epsenhart was the first to be produced by The Pushing Daisy Project, an organization which promotes cancer awareness by showcasing new works. Writer/director Terence Krey later cast her as \\"Cassandra Southwick\\" in his web series pilot Entwined, which went on to win \\"Best Use of Numerical Element\\" in Celebrate the Web 5, and then again as \\"Chloe,\\" the lead in his genre-blending indie-horror-romance feature Not A Monster. They collaborated the next year for Celebrate the Web 6 as well on the steampunk-inspired pilot \\"The Belle and The Bot,\\" with Segal (also a producer on the project) playing Abigail, the time-traveling Southern belle from the year 1863, and Krey as her tragic robot husband, Edward. The show won \\"Judge's Choice\\" and runner up for \\"Audience Choice\\" in the competition, and was screened at VidCon 2012. She also co-produced and starred as Penelope in Krey's supernatural dramedy feature film, \\"Winter Slides.\\" In 2014, she was cast as the lead in Things I Left on Long Island, a new play by Jonathan Larson Grant recipient Sara Cooper, which premiered at the New York International Fringe Festival. The play was the recipient of the 2014 Fringe Excellence Award for Playwriting and was a TimeOut New York Critics' Pick. She had previously workshopped the play with Cooper at Theater for the New City and Dixon Place. She also workshopped material from Cooper's musical Elevator Heart, music by Amy Burgess, Julia Meinwald and Julianne Wick-Davis. Museum Theatre Segal first became interested in museum theatre and costumed interpretation while working with Wildlife Theatre at the Bronx and Central Park Zoos in 2010. She has since gone on to research, write and perform original theatrical shows and experiences for school groups and the public at a number of institutions including the New York Transit Museum, the New-York Historical Society, and the DAR Museum, among others. Her historical interpretations often give a voice to underrepresented women in history and science such as inventor Mary Walton, a citizen scientist from the late 1800s who beat Thomas Edison to discovering a method to quiet New York's elevated railroad, and the pioneer women who inspired the creation of the iconic Madonna of the Trail statues along the National Old Trails Road. Her work has been noted as presenting complex, vivid portraits of her subjects that shines a light on both their triumphs as well as their flaws and showcases a variety of themes such as problem solving, social activism, community, and overcoming obstacles such as gender inequality. It is also uniquely notable in its depth of historical research and careful inclusion of primary source materials and quotations. She often additionally utilizes innovative formats and staging, ranging from interactive encounters, to digital theatrical gaming, immersive roaming adventures, live recreations of events, and even rap battles. In 2018 she was hired to begin producing original theatrical performances at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City, housed inside the historic former aircraft carrier USS Intrepid. She has created a number of shows, including a performance about the life of teen aviatrix Elinor Smith who rose to fame in the 1920s after illegally flying under New York City's East River Bridges. Segal also oversees the innovative National Endowment for the Humanities research and performance residency Crossing the Line: Bringing History to Life with Teens, in which she guides students in the development of their research, analysis, interpretation and writing skills through their creation of original performance pieces based upon primary and secondary sources. Segal currently serves as the Vice President of the International Museum Theatre Alliance and speaks regularly at conferences and events about her work in the museum theatre field.

Geography  The village is located on the Watso peninsula in the form of a large C (open to the northeast) attached to the east bank, forming the north-eastern shore of the Du Poste Bay, barring the exit of this bay and including the village of Mistissini in the North-West. A road connected to Route 167 serves this peninsula. The village is located at the mouth of the Du Poste Bay and in the southern part of Abatagouche Bay.  History  The Crees have lived in the area of the watershed of the Rupert River and around Lake Mistassini for centuries. French explorers and traders entered it on the 17th of September. During the second half of this century, a trading post was established on Lake Mistassini. Its position changed from time to time until the Hudson's Bay Company established it at the current location of the village. The trading post was supplied by a canoe brigade at Fort Rupert (today Waskaganish) up the Rupert River or through Neoskweskau (a former Cree site) on the Eastmain River. The itinerary of the trip moved south - first by Oskelaneo when the railway was built in 1910, and later by the region of Lac Saint-Jean. The road reached Mistissini in 1970.

At 323 feet, it is the tallest building in the state. It houses the Idaho headquarters of Zions Bank, as well as Holland & Hart and other companies. Construction was completed in early 2014, and a grand opening celebration was held on February 15. The location, formerly known as \\"the pit\\" and the \\"Boise Hole\\", had sat vacant since 1987. Besides Zions Bank, other tenants include Holland & Hart LLP, Ruth's Chris Steak House, CTA Architects Engineers, First American Title Company, Clenera, LLC, and the Idaho Technology Council. Half of the top floor (17th Floor), known as the Idaho & Snake River Rooms, is available for limited public rental focused on non-profit and community oriented events. Design The building's spire was changed several times after complaints that it resembled similar spires used by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Former structures Eastman Building, circa 1970s The Overland Hotel occupied the site from 1864 to 1904, and a noteworthy guest in 1870 was General William T. Sherman. The hotel was purchased by Hosea B. Eastman in 1877, and was the site of Boise's first telephone exchange in 1883. With the intent of building a new hotel it was demolished in 1904, but after estimates were deemed too expensive, Eastman decided on a retail and office building instead. Until 1987, the site was occupied by the Eastman Building, designed by Tourtellotte and Company. Originally four stories when it opened in 1905 as the Overland Building, two more were added in 1910. It was renamed the Eastman Building in 1926 following the owner's death and was filled with legal, dental, and medical offices. It gradually fell from favor and it was acquired in 1972 by the Boise Redevelopment Agency for a proposed downtown mall. Slated for demolition in 1978, preservationist interests intervened and it stood idle for nearly another decade. An offer was made in 1981 to move it several blocks south to the 8th Street Marketplace. With plans finally set for its refurbishment, the Eastman Building was destroyed two days later by fire in January 1987, fought by more than one hundred firefighters for over a day and a half, and was demolished soon after.

It returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post voting system. Vacancy Llewellyn Atherley-Jones, the Liberal MP for North West Durham resigned his seat. He was appointed a Judge of the City of London Court, which meant he had to halt his political career. He had been the local MP since the constituency was created in 1885. He had started his legal career as the Barrister for the Miners' National Union, giving him a particular affinity with the large number of miners living in the constituency. Previous result The seat had always been a safe Liberal seat, and was so at the last election; Atherley-Jones Candidates Stuart- Bunning *The Liberal candidate adopted on 4 January 1914 was the radical Aneurin Williams. He was Liberal MP for Plymouth (UK Parliament constituency) between the two general elections of 1910. He was chairman of the executive committee of the Land Nationalisation Society and a director of the First Garden City Ltd. He belonged to a Middlesbrough firm of ironmasters. *The Unionist candidate was James Ogden Hardicker. He had been their defeated candidate at the last General Election in December 1910. *The Labour Party decided to intervene, having never fielded a candidate here before. Their candidate, 44-year-old G. H. Stuart-Bunning was well travelled. He had stood at the York division of Yorkshire at the 1906 general election,K. D. Brown, The First Labour Party, 1906-1914, p.108 then in the 1908 Dundee by-election in Scotland, then at the January 1910 general election at Eccles in Lancashire, before alighting in Durham. In each case he had finished bottom of the poll.British parliamentary election results 1885-1918, Craig, F.W.S. (1974) He had no links to the constituency or to the mining industry. He was sponsored by the Postmen's Federation. Campaign Aneurin Williams Polling Day was set for 30 January 1914. Given the large number of miners and iron- workers among the electorate, issues affecting those voters were expected to feature. The Liberal candidate Aneurin Williams launched his campaign at a public meeting in Consett on 5 January 1914, at which he was supported by his brother, the Liberal MP for Middlesbrough, Penry Williams.Dundee Courier, Angus, 6 Jan 1914 On 6 January 1914, Williams spoke at the Co-operative Hall, Stanley sharing a platform with Mr. Straughan.Newcastle Journal, Tyne and Wear, 7 Jan 1914 On 9 January 1914 Williams spoke at a public meeting in Quebec alongside the Rev. Thomas Dale of Waterhouses, who said the Liberal party in the division had secured a very worthy candidate.Newcastle Journal, Tyne and Wear, 10 Jan 1914 On 20 January 1914, the Liberal candidate, Aneurin Williams declared that he advocated Irish Home Rule, religious equality in Wales, the abolition of Plural voting, further reform of the House of Lords, land and housing reform and popular control over licences.Dundee Courier, Angus Other issues to feature in his campaign included a defence of National Insurance and improvements to the conditions of agricultural labourers.The Times 2 Feb 1914 p10 About 2,000 Irishmen were electors in the constituency. With the Liberal Government currently steering through parliament, the 3rd Irish Home Rule Bill, Home Rule was the main issue of the by-election. The Labour candidate as well as the Liberal candidate agreed with the Liberal Government's policy.The Nation and Athenæum, Volume 14 The Unionist candidate was left to defend the actions of the likes of Sir Edward Carson who called on Ulster Unionists to resist the British Government \\"by any means\\". The issue of Women's suffrage also featured in the campaign. A combination of the Unionist Party, the Irish Nationalists and a minority of Liberals had defeated the measure earlier in the parliament. The Liberal candidate, Aneurin Williams was a vocal supporter of giving women the vote while his Unionist opponent Hardicker was an opponent. Despite this, the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies chose to enter the campaign in support of the Labour Party candidate, greatly increasing the chances of victory for the anti-suffrage Unionist candidate.Barry Dackombe, Journal of Liberal History, Volume 57 It was announced on 15 January 1914 that the Militant Women's Social and Political Union had established campaign headquarters in Consett to also campaign in support of the Labour candidate.Western Daily Press, Bristol, 16 Jan 1914 The influential Durham Miners' Association had initially withheld their official support from the Labour Party candidate, but their executive committee passed a motion calling on all miners to support the Socialist candidate.The Times, 8/1/1914 p8 Although there was a sizeable mining community in the constituency, the Association had not pressed to have their own candidate. The fact that the Labour Party candidate was neither local nor a miner, meant he had limited appeal to their members. At this time the Durham Miners were fairly evenly split between those like their President William House, who supported the Labour Party and those like their General Secretary John Wilson who supported the Liberal Party. The pro-Labour Party element of the Union were still reeling from the 1913 Houghton-le-Spring by-election when House stood as a DMA endorsed Labour Party candidate and came third, while miners lodges across the constituency supported the Liberal, who won despite not being a miner.Political Change and the Labour Party 1900-1918 by Duncan Tanner However, that did not stop individual miners leaders taking different sides in the campaign. On 20 January, the Liberal Aneurin Williams spoke at the Council School, Tanfield Lea. He shared the platform with J. J. Gray, a checkweigher at the Tanfield Lea Colliery. Newcastle Journal, Tyne and Wear, 21 Jan 1914 On 21 January 1914 Williams spoke at the Miners' Hall, South Moor in front of an audience of about 300. Newcastle Journal, Tyne and Wear, 22 Jan 1914 Nominations closed on 23 January 1914, confirming this was the first three-cornered contest in the division. The Liberal and Labour candidates argued over who was the more genuine representative of the workers.Daily Citizen, 21–24 January 1914 The Labour campaign focused on a handful of English trade unionists who had been deported from South Africa for trying to organise a General Strike. The Times reported that this news could result in 500 Liberal voters switching to the Labour Party candidate.The Times 31 Jan 1914 p10 On 29 January 1914, the eve of poll, Williams received a telegram of support from David Lloyd George in which he stated \\"Looking forward to the pleasure of welcoming you back as a member of the House Commons. Your practical acquaintance with social problems, especially housing, will be most valued.\\"Western Daily Press, Bristol Result Williams victory as portrayed in the local press The result was declared on Saturday afternoon, 31 January at Lanchester in front of a large crowd.The Times 2 Feb 1914 p10 Williams held the seat for the Liberals. The Unionist vote share was also down on December 1910; Although the Liberal majority had been massively reduced, they had every reason to be satisfied as the result was seen as an endorsement of the government's Irish policies, achieving a majority of 8,703 when the two pro- Home Rule candidates votes were combined.The Nation and Athenæum, Volume 14 Following the announcement of the result, cheering Liberal supporters carried Williams shoulder high to his car from where he started a tour of the constituency to thank the voters. He made a statement to the press in which he said that he regarded the result as a \\"triumph for the principals of radical social reform as against Tariff Reform.\\" The Unionist candidate Hardicker was forced to admit that the electorate had demonstrated its approval of the Liberal Government. The Socialist candidate, Stuart-Bunning stated that he would only return to fight the seat again if the executive of the Postal Federation were prepared to fund his campaign.The Times 2 Feb 1914 p10 Aftermath A General Election was due to take place by the end of 1915. By the autumn of 1914, the following candidates had been adopted to contest that election. *Liberal Party: Aneurin Williams *Unionist Party: James Hardicker Due to the outbreak of war, the election never took place.

It is found within some viruses, and most eukaryotes including mammals, insects, plants and yeast. It is also found in tRNA, rRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) as well as several long non-coding RNA, such as Xist. The methylation of adenosine is directed by a large m6A methyltransferase complex containing METTL3 as the SAM-binding sub-unit. In vitro, this methyltransferase complex preferentially methylates RNA oligonucleotides containing GGACU and a similar preference was identified in vivo in mapped m6A sites in Rous sarcoma virus genomic RNA and in bovine prolactin mRNA. More recent studies have characterized other key components of the m6A methyltransferase complex in mammals, including METTL14, Wilms tumor 1 associated protein (WTAP), KIAA1429 and METTL5 . Following a 2010 speculation of m6A in mRNA being dynamic and reversible, the discovery of the first m6A demethylase, fat mass and obesity- associated protein (FTO) in 2011 confirmed this hypothesis and revitalized the interests in the study of m6A. A second m6A demethylase alkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) was later discovered as well. The biological functions of m6A are mediated through a group of RNA binding proteins that specifically recognize the methylated adenosine on RNA. These binding proteins are named m6A readers. The YT521-B homology (YTH) domain family of proteins (YTHDF1, YTHDF2, YTHDF3 and YTHDC1) have been characterized as direct m6A readers and have a conserved m6A-binding pocket. Insulin-like growth factor-2 mRNA-binding proteins 1, 2, and 3 (IGF2BP1–3) are reported as a novel class of m6A readers. IGF2BPs use K homology (KH) domains to selectively recognize m6A-containing RNAs and promote their translation and stability. These m6A readers, together with m6A methyltransferases (writers) and demethylases (erasers), establish a complex mechanism of m6A regulation in which writers and erasers determine the distributions of m6A on RNA, whereas readers mediate m6A-dependent functions. m6A has also been shown to mediate a structural switch termed m6A switch.  Species distribution  = Yeast = In budding yeast (Sacharomyces cerevisiae), the homologue of METTL3, IME4 is induced in diploid cells in response to nitrogen and fermentable carbon source starvation and is required for mRNA methylation and the initiation of correct meiosis and sporulation. mRNAs of IME1 and IME2, key early regulators of meiosis, are known to be targets for methylation, as are transcripts of IME4 itself. = Plants = In plants, the majority of the m6A is found within 150 nucleotides before the start of the poly(A) tail. Mutations of MTA, the Arabidopsis thaliana homologue of METTL3, results in embryo arrest at the globular stage. A >90% reduction of m6A levels in mature plants leads to dramatically altered growth patterns and floral homeotic abnormalities. = Mammals = Mapping of m6A in human and mouse RNA has identified over 18,000 m6A sites in the transcripts of more than 7,000 human genes with a consensus sequence of [G/A/U][G>A]m6AC[U>A/C] consistent with the previously identified motif. The localization of individual m6A sites in many mRNAs is highly similar between human and mouse, and transcriptome-wide analysis reveals that m6A is found in regions of high evolutionary conservation. m6A is found within long internal exons and is preferentially enriched within 3’ UTRs and around stop codons. m6A within 3’ UTRs is also associated with the presence of microRNA binding sites; roughly 2/3 of the mRNAs which contain an m6A site within their 3’ UTR also have at least one microRNA binding site. By integrating all m6A sequencing data, a novel database called RMBase has identified and provided ~200,000 N6-Methyladenosines (m6A) sites in the human and mouse genomes. Precise m6A mapping by m6A-CLIP/IP (briefly m6A-CLIP) revealed that a majority of m6A locates in the last exon of mRNAs in multiple tissues/cultured cells of mouse and human, and the m6A enrichment around stop codons is a coincidence that many stop codons locate round the start of last exons where m6A is truly enriched. The major presence of m6A in last exon (>=70%) allows the potential for 3'UTR regulation, including alternative polyadenylation. The study combining m6A-CLIP with rigorous cell fractionation biochemistry reveals that m6A mRNA modifications are deposited in nascent pre-mRNA and are not required for splicing but do specify cytoplasmic turnover. m6A is susceptible to dynamic regulation both throughout development and in response to cellular stimuli. Analysis of m6A in mouse brain RNA reveals that m6A levels are low during embryonic development and increase dramatically by adulthood. Additionally, silencing the m6A methyltransferase significantly affects gene expression and alternative RNA splicing patterns, resulting in modulation of the p53 (also known as TP53) signalling pathway and apoptosis. m6A is also found on the RNA components of R-loops in human cells, where it is involved in regulation of stability of RNA:DNA hybrids. The importance of m6A methylation for physiological processes was recently demonstrated. Inhibition of m6A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m6A methylase Mettl3 led to the elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of Mettl3 led to a shorter period. The mammalian circadian clock, composed of a transcription feedback loop tightly regulated to oscillate with a period of about 24 hours, is therefore extremely sensitive to perturbations in m6A-dependent RNA processing, likely due to the presence of m6A sites within clock gene transcripts. The effects of global methylation inhibition on the circadian period in mouse cells can be prevented by ectopic expression of an enzyme from the bacterial methyl metabolism. Mouse cells expressing this bacterial protein were resistant to pharmacological inhibition of methyl metabolism, showing no decrease in mRNA m6A methylation or protein methylation.  Clinical significance  Considering the versatile functions of m6A in various physiological processes, it is thus not surprising to find links between m6A and numerous human diseases; many originated from mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of cognate factors of m6A. The linkages between m6A and numerous cancer types have been indicated in reports that include stomach cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, kidney cancer, mesothelioma, sarcoma, and leukaemia. The impacts of m6A on cancer cell proliferation might be much more profound with more data emerging. The depletion of METTL3 is known to cause apoptosis of cancer cells and reduce invasiveness of cancer cells, while the activation of ALKBH5 by hypoxia was shown to cause cancer stem cell enrichment. m6A has also been indicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis and obesity, as FTO is a key regulatory gene for energy metabolism and obesity. SNPs of FTO have been shown to associate with body mass index in human populations and occurrence of obesity and diabetes. The influence of FTO on pre-adipocyte differentiation has been suggested. The connection between m6A and neuronal disorders has also been studied. For instance, neurodegenerative diseases may be affected by m6A as the cognate dopamine signalling was shown to be dependent on FTO and correct m6A methylation on key signalling transcripts. The mutations in HNRNPA2B1, a potential reader of m6A, have been known to cause neurodegeneration. The IGF2BP1–3, a novel class of m6A reader, has oncogenic functions. IGF2BP1–3 knockdown or knockout decreased MYC protein expression, cell proliferation and colony formation in human cancer cell lines. The ZC3H13,a member of the m6A methyltransferase complex, markedly inhibited the colorectal cancer cells growth when knocked down. Additionally, m6A has been reported to impact viral infections. Many RNA viruses including SV40, adenovirus, herpes virus, Rous sarcoma virus, and influenza virus have been known to contain the internal m6A methylation on virus genomic RNA. Several more recent studies have revealed that m6A regulators govern the efficiency of infection and replication of RNA viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). These results suggest m6A and its cognate factors play crucial roles in regulating virus life cycle and host-viral interactions.

Hamilton (born September 9, 1990) is an American professional baseball center fielder for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played for the Cincinnati Reds, Kansas City Royals, Atlanta Braves, and New York Mets. The Reds selected Hamilton in the second round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft, and he made his MLB debut in 2013. Hamilton holds the Minor League Baseball single-season stolen base record with 155 steals—10 higher than the previous Minor League record set by Vince Coleman, and 25 more than Rickey Henderson's record set on the Major League level. He also holds the Cincinnati Reds record for most stolen bases by a rookie in a season. Early career =Amateur career= Hamilton attended Taylorsville High School in Taylorsville, Mississippi, where he was all-state in baseball, football and basketball. He was a top football prospect at wide receiver, signing a letter of intent to play college football at Mississippi State University. =Minor league career= The Cincinnati Reds selected Hamilton in the second round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft. Prior to the 2011 season, Hamilton was ranked by Baseball America as the 50th-best prospect in baseball. That season, while playing for the Dayton Dragons, Hamilton became the 12th minor league player to have 100 stolen bases in a season, and the first since 2001. He finished the 2011 season with 104 total stolen bases and hit .278/.340/.360. Prior to 2012, Baseball America ranked Hamilton as the 48th-best prospect. MLB rated Hamilton as the 31st-best prospect, fourth-best shortstop, and the second-best prospect in the Reds organization behind catcher Devin Mesoraco.\\"2012 Prospect Watch\\". On August 21, 2012, Hamilton stole a record 146th base in his 120th game of the season for the Pensacola Blue Wahoos. The record was previously held by Vince Coleman for the Class A Macon Redbirds, set in 1983. He finished the 2012 season with 155 stolen bases and hit .311/.410/.420. After the 2012 season, the Reds announced that Hamilton, who originally played shortstop, would move to center field for 2013. Bill Bavasi, the Reds' vice president of scouting and player development, told MLB.com that the move was made for several reasons, including the fact that two other established shortstops, Zack Cozart and Didi Gregorius, were already on the roster. Prior to the 2013 season, Hamilton was ranked as the Reds' best prospect by Baseball America. For the season with the Louisville Bats, in 123 games he stole 75 bases and hit .256/.308/.343. Major League career =Cincinnati Reds= The Reds promoted Hamilton to the major leagues on September 2, 2013, and made his debut on September 3 against the St. Louis Cardinals as a pinch runner for Ryan Ludwick. He stole second base off Yadier Molina, and came around to score on a Todd Frazier double. Hamilton appeared in four major league games as a pinch runner until September 10 when, in the seventh inning, he replaced Shin-Soo Choo in center field and also made his batting debut, going 0-for-2 in a loss at home to the Chicago Cubs.\\"Billy Hamilton 2013 Batting Gamelogs\\". baseball-reference.com. Retrieved September 10, 2013. Hamilton with the Reds in 2016 Hamilton made his first start on September 18, 2013, in a Reds road win over the Houston Astros. Playing center field and batting ninth, in his first at-bat of the game he notched his first Major League hit, a second-inning double to left field off Astros' starter Brad Peacock, and later got his first run batted in, driving in Todd Frazier with an infield single. For the game (which went 13 innings), Hamilton reached base five times, going 3-for-4 with two walks, two runs scored, one RBI, and four stolen bases in four attempts off four pitchers. Hamilton became the first Major League player since 1920 to steal four bases in his first Major League start. In his first 10 times on base, he stole nine bases and scored six runs. He was successful in his first 13 steal attempts, before being thrown out on his 14th attempt. Hamilton became a regular with the Cincinnati Reds in 2014. He had something of a rough start to the season, hitting just .221 through April 27 and being caught in five of his first 15 attempts at stealing. By around the time of the All-Star break, however, Hamilton's stats had greatly improved and he was attracting positive attention from a number of sources, tipped as a potential Gold Glove candidate for defense and also noted for unexpected power hitting. On September 2, Hamilton, with his 55th stolen base of the season, set a Cincinnati Reds franchise record for most stolen bases in a season by a rookie, edging out the mark of 54 set in 1909 by Bob Bescher. Despite this, Hamilton was second in Major League Baseball for stolen bases at the time, with Dee Gordon having recorded 58. For the season, he batted .250/.292/.355 with 56 stolen bases while leading the league in being caught stealing, with 23. On October 23, Hamilton was nominated for the 2014 Gold Glove for National League Center field, but lost to Juan Lagares of the New York Mets. Hamilton also finished 2nd in NL Rookie of the Year voting, losing out to New York Mets pitcher Jacob DeGrom. At the opening of the 2015 season, Hamilton joined Vince Coleman (1987) as the only players in Major League Baseball history to steal six bases in their team's first three games. In the following game, he stole a seventh base, again matching Coleman for a record by being one of two players to steal seven bases within the first four games of the season. He ended the season hitting .226/.274/.289 with 8 doubles and 3 triples (all career lows) and 57 stolen bases in 412 at bats. Balls he hit had the lowest average exit velocity of any major leaguer (79.3 miles per hour), and he had the ninth-fastest sprint speed among major leaguers (29.7 feet per second). In 2016, Hamilton hit a career- best .260 with a career-low 3 home runs and 17 RBIs in 119 games, going 58/66 in stolen bases. Balls he hit had the second-lowest average exit velocity of any major leaguer (80.0 miles per hour), and he had the sixth-fastest sprint speed among major leaguers (30.2 feet per second). On May 4, 2017, Hamilton stole his 200th career base. He ended the season batting .247/.299/.335 while establishing career bests in at bats (582), runs (85), hits (144), triples (11), and a career high in strikeouts (133). He also went 59/72 in stolen base attempts. Balls he hit had the second-lowest average exit velocity of any major leaguer (78.6 miles per hour), and he had the sixth-fastest sprint speed among major leaguers (30.1 feet per second).

He earned $4.6 million. Reds general manager Nick Krall said he tried to trade Hamilton, but there was no interest on the part of other teams. After the 2018 season, the Reds non-tendered Hamilton, making him a free agent. =Kansas City Royals= On December 11, 2018, Hamilton signed a one-year $5.25 million contract that included up to $1 million in incentives with a mutual option for the 2020 season, with the Kansas City Royals. On August 16, 2019, Hamilton was designated for assignment. =Atlanta Braves= On August 19, 2019, Hamilton was claimed off waivers by the Atlanta Braves.

Released on May 22, 2012, the album was about the season that the band is currently in at the time of composing the music. Produced by Brown Bannister and Dan Muckala, the album met with positive critical and commercial reception. The album sold over 33,000 copies its first week and debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 and at No. 1 on the Christian Albums chart. The first single released from the album is the song \\"The Hurt & the Healer\\". This song reached No. 1 on the Christian Songs and AC Indicator and Soft AC/Inspirational charts, No. 2 on the Hot Christian Adult Contemporary chart, and No. 11 on the Christian CHR chart. The second single \\"You Are I Am\\" reached No. 3 on the Christian Songs chart. Background =Concept= In the past, MercyMe and Millard have made songs \\"based on what people wanted to hear me say. 'Bring the Rain' is a great example. It sounds like I've got it all together, but it's where I wanted to be; not where I was. This past year, I've definitely had those moments where I found myself asking God, 'You are still in control, right?'\\" This was because the loss of his cousin, who was a firefighter that was killed in the line of duty. So, this album was written from this trying season in Millard's and MercyMe's life, which Millard described as \\"one of the most disturbing and proud moments of my life.\\" This was because Millard is a person that is a \\"guy who has all the questions to the guy who is asked all the questions.\\" The album was written from the perspective of \\"telling people they're beautiful in the eyes of Christ\\". In addition, Millard said that they are \\"reminding people that their identity is in Christ...not their guilt or shame, that they're not a bad person trying to be good...they're redeemed, sanctified.\\" Millard denotes with respect to this album that \\"sin is powerless and can't remove us from the hand of God. I've had to go through the fact that I set up my dad in sainthood, but never addressed the years of abuse. I am not my shame. I'm not my guilt. Christ is not getting back on the cross. It's finished once and for all. For the first time, after years of being in the church, I feel like I'm seeing a part of God and myself. This is the first time I'm really living it. I am worthy. It's been a big shift for me. I'm done telling people to stop sinning and, instead, let them know who they are in Christ.\\" So, this album is a major reversal for MercyMe to one of reassurance rather than condemnation and one of making music out of their current situation. =Recorded= This album was recorded in 2011–12 at the Echo Mountain Studios in Asheville, North Carolina. Composition =Music= The music on the record is one of telling each and everyone of us who we are in Christ, and we need to claim it. Furthermore, we need not deny the Cross because it is done once and for all-time sake. =Lyrics= The lyrics for the song \\"The Hurt & the Healer\\" come from the death of Millard's cousin in the line of duty and it represents the season the band is going through right now. In addition, the song is the trend setter for the rest of the record because it gives the album its essential theme. The lyrics to the song \\"You Are I Am\\" come from a longing of asking \\"God, 'You are still in control, right?'\\" To this, the song says \\"You're the one who conquers giants/ you're the one who calls out kings/ you shut the mouths of lions/ you tell the dead to breathe\\". Singles The first radio single was \\"The Hurt & the Healer\\". This song has been reached No. 1 on the Christian AC Indicator and Soft AC/Inspirational charts, No. 2 on the Hot Christian Adult Contemporary chart, Christian Songs chart at No. 3 and No. 11 on the Christian CHR chart. Book This August 2013, a book inspired by \\"The Hurt & the Healer\\" was released by Baker Books. The book was co-authored by Bart Millard and Andrew Farley, best-selling author of The Naked Gospel and God Without Religion. Critical reception The Hurt & the Healer received generally positive reception from twelve music critics. James Christopher Monger of Allmusic's rated the album four stars, saying that the album \\"may not deviate much from the fairly predictable, anthem-heavy template of previous outings, but few bands in the genre are as adept as MercyMe when it comes to implementing that sound effectively.\\" At CCM Magazine, Grace S. Aspinwall rated the album three stars, writing that \\"while they could have reached even further lyrically, this is their best project to date.\\" In addition, Aspinwall wrote \\"but this latest album shows that the band continues to push itself to greatness.\\" Todd Jennings of Christian Broadcasting Network rated the album three stars, noting that \\"The album contains 10 catchy, well-written songs—each could have potential for radio play\\", however \\"unfortunately, the album also comes across a little over-produced (do we really need more auto- tuning?) and too polished. All of the songs sound great, but lack the raw feel that made some of their earlier work so relatable [sic].\\" At Christianity Today, Ron Augustine rated the album three stars, writing that \\"MercyMe is clearly a band intent on making music to and for God, and for that their work will never return void.\\" Founder Tony Cummings of Cross Rhythms rated the album a perfect ten squares, saying that \\"undoubtedly, 'The Hurt & the Healer' is one of the standout albums of the year and everyone, including producers Brown Bannister and Dan Muckala, should be proud of having created such an uplifting, and potentially heart-changing, set of songs.\\" At Worship Leader, Jeremy Armstrong rated the album three stars, stating that because of the darker tone to the music it \\"costs more memorable hooks in the up-tempo tunes.\\" Jonathan Andre of Indie Vision Music rated the album four stars, noting that \\"MercyMe have created one of their most mature and lyrically profound of their career, with much musical experimentation to show that the album is one of the rockiest they have ever done\\" on which \\"stretches musical boundaries to boldly assert its authority as one of this year’s standout albums.\\" At Jesus Freak Hideout, Alex \\"Tincan\\" Caldwell rated the album three- and-a-half stars, stating that \\"firmly in their second decade as a band, MercyMe is in dire need of breaking out of the Adult Contemporary mold, and The Hurt & the Healer shows signs that they might be on their way, however slowly, to a more diverse and creative future as an artist.\\" Kevin Davis of New Release Tuesday rated the album a perfect five stars, saying that the album \\"each album has improved upon their previous excellent offering\\". At The Phantom Tollbooth, Michael Dalton rated the album three-and-a-half stars, writing that Bart Millard is \\"in fine form but he also gets an excellent assist from group background vocals scattered throughout\\", which he likes how the production is \\"slightly raw, [and] uncluttered\\". Joshua Andre of Christian Music Zine rated the album four-and-a-half stars, noting that with what he has \\"experienced in this 40 minutes musical and lyrical journey across an expanse of genres from alternative rock to the humble piano ballad, I can truly say that MercyMe has matched their 2010 album 110%!\\" At Louder Than the Music, Jono Davies rated the album four stars, stating that \\"as this has so many strong tracks on the album that actually the bar has been set very high.\\" Commercial performance The album sold 33,000 copies the first week that it was released.

The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 67% approval rating, with an average rating of 7.35/10 based on 9 reviews. Diana Steenbergen of IGN gave the eighth season an 8.5 out of 10 and called it an improvement over the seventh season, writing, \\"What we got was a solid season-long mythology storyline, some great supporting characters, and of course, a lot of the always reliable backbone of the show – Sam and Dean Winchester.\\" She commented positively about the return of the demons/angels storyline and addition of new recurring characters such as Benny, Naomi, and Metatron, but criticized Sam's \\"regular life\\" storyline that got \\"fizzled\\" and dropping the tablet trials at the last minute.

Zasloff (born July 2, 1946) is an American physician, medical researcher, and entrepreneur. Zasloff is primarily known for his work on antimicrobial peptides. Early life Michael Alan Zasloff was born to a Jewish family, the son a dentist and an artist. Growing up on Manhattan's West Side, he studied at the Bronx High School of Science. Education Zasloff did his undergraduate work at Columbia University and earned his M.D. and Ph.D. from the New York University School of Medicine. He did his residency training in pediatrics at the Boston Children's Hospital and a research fellowship at Johns Hopkins University. In 1975 he joined the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a postdoc. Professional career Zasloff stayed at the NIH after he finished his postdoc, and in 1981 he was made the Chief of the Human Genetics Branch of the National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development. In 1986 he discovered magainins, a family of antimicrobial peptides in the skin of the African clawed frog. Magainin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was founded in the late 1980s to commercialize the peptides. Zasloff left the NIH at about the same and went to University of Pennsylvania, in part because the NIH policies made it difficult for him to participate in the company. Magainin eventually went public and its name was changed to Genaera. The company attempted to develop squalamine, trodusquemine, and pexiganan (a version of a magainin), but the company closed in 2009 without having brought any products to market. At Penn, working with Fred Kaplan, Zasloff continued research he had begun at the NIH on the cause and treatment of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. Zasloff left Penn in 1992 and joined Magainin full time. He was with the company until its lead product, pexiganan, was rejected by the FDA in 1999 for lack of efficacy compared with the standard of care for diabetic foot ulcers, and he went to Georgetown University's medical school, where he was appointed Dean for Research and Translational Science. In 2011 Zasloff found that squalamine had antiviral activity. In 2013 Zasloff co-founded a company called Formula XO that sold haircare products. He later co-founded a company called Enterin, that intended to develop a derivative of squalamine called kenterin as a treatment for Parkinson's disease; the company received its first round of venture funding in 2017. Personal life Zasloff is married to Dr. Barbara Zasloff, a clinical psychologist (whom he met when they were undergraduates at Columbia University), and they have three daughters.

Name  It is also referred to as Heshuote Khanate (和硕特汗国), State of Khoshut, or Quoshote Khanate. In Cyrillic it is spelled Хошууд. History Tibet was conquered by Mongols during the Yuan dynasty. During the transition between the Ming and Qing dynasties, in 1642, the Khoshut local government was established by Güshi Khan, a Khoshut prince and leader of the Upper Mongols. He was enthroned by the Dalai Lama as Khan and leader of Tibet. With Güshi Khan as a largely uninvolved overlord, the 5th Dalai Lama and his intimates established a civil administration which is referred to as the Lhasa state or Ganden Phodrang. The Khoshut Khanate was conquered by the troops of the Dzungar Khanate in 1717, who deposed Yeshe Gyatso, a pretender to the position of the Dalai Lama promoted by Lha-bzang Khan, the last ruler of the Khoshut Khanate. The Dzungars were in turn expelled by the expedition forces of the Qing dynasty from Tibet in 1720, and Tibet was unified with Qing China. (See Qing conquest of Tibet.)

In this region, the Gaurs increased their influence and expanded the kingdom. Due to the rule of Gaurs, this state is still famous by the name of Gaudati. The Gaurs here also fought the Amber kingdom. In the early 16th century, Riddmal became the ruler of Gaur Maroth, the Patvi leader of the Gaur rulers of the region After the killing of Kolaraj Gaur by Rao Shekha(he was also killed in this battle) at Kololav pond near Ghatwa, there were 12 battles with Rao Shekha, a relative near Gaur.

The Gaurs had a good relationship with Shah Jahan during Shahjahan's reign and were influential in the Delhi Durbar, but during Aurangzeb's era, the Gaudas of Maroth remained weak in the Delhi Durbar.

The French and native convoy of four French vessels and fifty native canoes carrying 1200 fighters was led by Paul Marin de la Malgue and the New England forces were led by Captain David Donahew. The New Englanders were successful. The Governor of Ile Royal Louis Du Pont Duchambon thought that the New Englanders would have ended their siege of Louisbourg had Marin arrived.; Patterson, p 17; \\"Pote's Journal\\" ibid p. xxvii) (There were 1800 French soldiers at Louisbourg versus 4200 New Englanders.) Instead, the day following the battle, Duchambon surrendered Louisbourg to New England.Contemporary British colonial accounts record the siege as occurring 30 April – 16 June in the Old Style.  Background  At the outbreak of the war, in May 1744, Captain David Donahue of the Resolution took prisoner the chief of the Mi'kmaq people of Ile Royale Jacques Pandanuques with his family to Boston. Donahue used the same strategy of posing as a French ship to entrap Chief Pandanuques as he does in the Naval battle off Tatamagouche.Pierre Malliard.MEMORIAL OF THE Motives of the Savages, called Mickmakis and Maricheets, for continuing the War with England since the last Peace. In May 1745, Paul Marin de la Malgue led 200 troops and hundreds of Mi'kmaq joined a siege against Annapolis Royal. The siege was ended after three weeks when Marin was recalled to assist with defending the French during the Siege of Louisbourg. During the Siege at Annapolis, the Wabanaki Confederacy (Mi'kmaq and Maliseet) took prisoner William Pote and some of Gorham's Rangers. During his captivity, Pote wrote one of the most important captivity narratives from Acadia and Nova Scotia. While at Cobequid, Pote reported that an Acadian said that the French soldiers should have \\"left their [the English] carcasses behind and brought their skins.\\"(William Pote's Journal, 1745, p. 34) He also wrote about the Naval battle off Tatamagouch.  Battle  Captain Donahew in Resolution (12 guns, 50 crew) was travelling with Captain Daniel Fones in (14 guns, 100 crew); and Captain Robert Becket in Bonetta (six guns). The two latter ships left Resolution to pursue smoke from what they believed to be a French and native encampment. Shortly after they left, four French vessels appeared, led by Marin. Upon seeing the native canoes, Captain Donahew hoisted a French flag on his own sloop so the natives would think it was a French privateer with a prize. The wind dropped off and the Resolution was becalmed and surrounded by the French vessels and canoes. At 10:00 am on 15 June 1745, Donahew raised the British flag on his ship and a fierce two-hour battle ensued. Donahew reported firing at the four vessels two hundred rounds from his four pounders; fifty-three rounds from his three pounders, and \\"my swivel and small Arms continually playing on them.\\"(Howard Millar Chapin. New England Vessels in the Expedition Against Louisbourg, 1745. Providence, R. I. ) The British reported there was a \\"considerable slaughter\\" of the French and natives.Ralph M. Eastman. \\"Captain Noah Stoddard\\" in Some Famous Privateers of New England. 1928. p. 68 The four French vessels were about to board Donahew's vessel when relief arrived, Captain Fones and Captain Becket returned. As a result, the French retreated to Gouzar. The two other French vessels went up near-by Dewar's River. The natives remained behind a seawall. The convoy eventually retreated to Tatamagouche. They built defenses on land, anticipating an attack by the New Englanders. Another New England vessel appeared. A week after the initial attack, presumably because of the number of their losses, the Huron decided to abandon the convoy and return to Quebec.  Aftermath  Daniel Fones Letter, Battle off Tatamagouche, 1745 The battle was significant in the downfall of Louisbourg because Marin's relief envoy was thwarted.Patterson, pp.16-18; Note that Murdock erroneously locates this battle of Cape Sable. Duchambon at Louisbourg distinctly stated that Marin's failure to appear proved disastrous to him at a time when succor would have meant victory (See William Pote's journal, p. xxvii). Without the relief of the convoy, the following day Louisbourg fell.Contemporary British colonial accounts record the siege as occurring 30 April – 16 June in the Old Style. Weeks after the fall of Louisbourg, Donahew and Fones again engaged Marin, who was now nearing the Strait of Canso. Donahew and 11 of his men put ashore and were immediately surrounded by 300 Indians.The New England Historical and Genealogical Register, Vol. 77, p. 103 The captain and five of his men were slain and the remaining six were taken prisoner. The Indians were said to have cut open Donahew's chest, sucked his blood, then eaten parts of him and his five companions. This tale significantly heightened the sense of gloom and frustration settling over the fortress. On July 19, the 12-gun provincial cruiser of Donavan's, Resolution, sailed slowly into the harbour with her colours flying at half-mast. The horrifying tale of the fate of her captain, David Donahew, and five crew members spread rapidly through the fortress.  Legacy  In commemoration of this battle, the Historic Sites Monument Board, in August 1939, erected at Tatamagouche a monument in a spot overlooking the waters of the harbour. (See Battle of Tatamagouche Monument.) Captain Fones brought Tartar (14 guns) back safe to her home port in Rhode Island. Two cannon from Tartar are on the lawn of the Newport Historical Society (See Tartar's Guns), which were formerly mounted close to the Oliver Perry Monument at Washington Square, Newport, Rhode IslandRalph M.

Herbert was born on April 12, 1882, in Yankton, South Dakota, to Amherst Willoughby and Velma Barber. His father, a civil engineer, was greatly interested in natural sciences. He grew up attending public schools in Orlando, Florida, and then attended high school for two years in Washington, D.C. Beyond this he received very little formal education, although he did take some night classes. As a child he had become interested in insects, and in 1898 he worked with Dr. E. A. Schwartz as assistant preparator of insects in the National Museum in Washington. He held his position until 1902 and came back again from 1904 to 1908. During the years 1902 to 1904 he studied cotton insects in southern fields under the Bureau of Entomology in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Starting in 1908 on he worked as a specialist on beetles in the Division of Insect Identification of the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Until Dr. Schwartz died in 1928, Barber continued to work closely with him at the National Museum. In 1913, Barber published two papers about Micromalthus debilis, a small wood-boring beetle. He had discovered that there are several distinct types of larvae in this species and that under certain conditions larvae will produce both eggs and live larvae. This has since been confirmed by other scientists, but initially it was doubted by many entomologists. This was potentially his greatest single discovery, which occurred only fifteen years after he had his first exposure to entomological work. Barber was a naturalist with wide interests. He was an internationally recognized authority on chrysomelid, bruchid, and lampyrid beetles and often was consulted for his knowledge of Coleoptera as well as many other subjects. He traveled to collect insects to many parts of the United States, Mexico, and Guatemala. Barber belonged to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Entomological Society of Washington, the Coleopterists’s Society, the Entomological Society of America, the American Association of Economic Entomologists, the Biological Society of Washington, the Washington Academy of Sciences, and the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club. As a member of the Washington Biologists’ Field Club, Barber spent a lot of time on Plummers Island studying the beetles there with Dr. Schwartz. Barber died on June 1, 1950.

Similar terms include data discrimination and network management. Net bias occurs when an ISP drops packets or denies access based on artificially induced conditions such as simulating congestion or blocking packets, despite the fact that ample capacity exists to carry traffic. Examples (models) of net bias include tiered service (specialized service), metering, bandwidth throttling, and port blocking. These forms of net bias are achieved by technical advancements of the Internet Protocol. The idea of net bias can arise from political and economic motivations and backgrounds, which create some concerns regarding data discrimination arising from political and economic interests. Non- discrimination means that one class of Internet customers may not be favored over another. According to this view, the Internet should continue \\"to operate in a nondiscriminatory manner, both in terms of how subscribers access and receive Internet transmitted services and how content and other service providers reach subscribers.\\" Every internet user should have equal upload and download capabilities on every network. Net neutrality The principle of equal treatment of traffic, called \\"Net Neutrality\\" by proponents, is not enshrined in law in the United States but is supported by some regulations. Most of the debate around the issue has centered on tentative plans, now postponed, by large Internet carriers to offer preferential treatment of traffic from certain content providers for a fee. Network neutrality is a set of rules that forbid network owners from discriminating against independent applications (instead of against competing ISPs, as with open access).  Models of net bias  = Tiered service (specialized service, bandwidth partitioning) = Tiered service is one of the strategies employed to change Internet pricing and involves an intent to have flexibility in quality of service (QoS) on the Internet. Tiered service allows ISPs to create and manage speed-related subscriber tiers. In other words, this model partitions bandwidth and provides different levels of peering requirements and offers transit clients different amounts of throughput. This model stems from the perception of technical and economic limitations in the broadband industry. As technology develops, the demand for faster and higher performance of communication networks and the customer demand for bandwidth-intensive services, such as streaming videos, have increased. These situations result in network congestion that is mainly driven by a small number of heavy users. Moreover, ISPs argue that existing flat-rate plans do not enable them to cover the additional cost required to manage heavier network traffic. Accordingly, this model may allow ISPs to reach different market segments with different data plans, targeting the different types of needs based on speed tiers, volume data caps, and other customizable conditions. = Metering = Metered service (also called pay-per-use) is another strategy utilized to change Internet pricing other than tiered service. This model represents a usage- based pricing scheme that charges users based on their packet usages. Metered service contrasts with the model of paying a flat fee on a recurring basis to have unlimited access to a given good or service. This metering scheme not only satisfies ISPs in terms of recovering cost, but also enables users to rethink their usage patterns with a price signal. This pricing plan can benefit low-volume users because metered service might create new and possibly lower price points for those users. On the other hand, research shows that price is the most important factor for users, among other factors such as Internet speed, which indicates that broadband users are price-sensitive. Price-sensitivity explains why few consumers like having to think about how much they are using the Internet. In addition, from the users’ perspective, one study suggested that consumers might have far less tolerance for unsolicited advertising, spam emails, banner advertising, and third party users of throughput when they are required to consider the cost for the amount of traffic. However, from the ISPs’ perspective, one study indicates that a usage-based pricing scheme does not cause ISPs’ discrimination incentives against content providers because ISPs are able to gain sufficient profits for the network investment to meet market needs. =Bandwidth throttling= Bandwidth throttling is a tactic that allows information and telecommunication companies to regulate network traffic and control network congestion. This type of measure is viewed as a limitation on users’ upload and download speeds (rates) of content. Comcast, one of the major ISPs, conducted bandwidth throttling on 49% of its customers who were using bandwidth for P2P file sharing. After Comcast's actions were exposed, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ordered the company to stop throttling on a large scale. In particular, this form of net bias frequently targets heavy mobile users who consume large amounts of content (packets), like unlimited data plans. Mobile companies such as AT&T; and Verizon have their own throttling policy because they are sometimes required to limit users’ traffic to maintain the quality of the entire network. Recently, however, throttling has become a controversial issue because some companies infringe upon this policy. For example, AT&T; had to pay US$850 to one customer to compensate for slowing down data speeds because they violated the terms of unlimited smartphone data contracts. In response to these complaints from smartphone subscribers, AT&T; announced that they would change their policy for unlimited data users. = Blocking (port blocking) = Port blocking includes the deliberate decision by ISPs to deny onward transmission of traffic, or delivery of traffic, to an intended recipient. ISPs do not have a legitimate reason to deny onward packet transmission to specific customers of other ISPs. The ISPs have contractually committed to carry any and all packets from the former ISP without regard for the identity and marketplace success of that ISP's customers (on a first-come, first-served basis). However, an ISP is more likely to have higher incentives for port blocking when the ISP is vertically and horizontally integrated because those integrated companies attempt to enhance the marketplace attractiveness of corporate affiliates. For example, AT&T; blocked Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) because the company was concerned that the VoIP service might threaten its wireless and wired telephony service. Thus, an ISP can engage in port blocking for VoIP traffic when giving preference to an affiliated telephone company.  Technical component for net bias  Technological advancements allowed these types of net bias to function, while the technology was not fully matured enough to apply new pricing or QoS schemes in the past. In other words, as network technologies develop, ISPs implemented technological innovations that can prioritize packets and meter them when faced with increasing bandwidth requirements, using systems to distinguish properties of data packets. Packet analysis enables ISPs to monitor the Internet traffic, and can be performed by a computer program or hardware component that intercepts and logs traffic passing over a digital network. There are many technologies for network management such as SNMP or NETCONF.  Motivations The idea of network flexibility in pricing, service provisioning, and QoS tends to be based on economic and political considerations. These considerations show that net bias (network flexibility) makes economic sense and may not violate a reasonable expectation of net neutrality. = Economic motivations = ISPs have been increasingly investing in the infrastructure necessary to transport the bits and packets that correspond to commercially successful content and services. As the Internet becomes more capable of covering most converged services, and those services require wide bandwidth, high QoS guarantees, and time-sensitivity, ISPs must make substantial investments to the network. Moreover, at the early stage of the Internet's appearance, ISPs were able to concentrate on “connectivity” over “cost” because the government supported the development of the Internet. However, as this support has been removed and ISPs have sought to recoup their investment, cost recovery has become substantially more important to ISPs. In addition, incumbent carriers like AT&T;, whose business involves both the Internet and telephony service, needed the new powerful source of revenue because traditional telephony became less profitable and its market share declined. In this situation, the incumbent carriers recognize that the significant profits accrued by Internet content and application providers such as Google can bring carriers the new revenue streams they are seeking. Accordingly, some of the major ISPs believe that the best way to achieve their goals is through the partitioning of network bandwidth and the prioritizing of bitstreams by offering different QoS. Likewise, some researchers argue that these strategies could work, emphasizing that ISPs should have unregulated pricing freedom, which may lead to promoted innovation, risk tasking, and diverse services and features. In addition, Yoo pointed out that ISPs could offer undropped packets and timely packet delivery even under truly congested conditions when they have the option of offering a premium peak service. Professor Lawrence Lessig also indicates that consumer-tiering, which provides end users with different throughput speeds or permissible volume of traffic, could recoup infrastructure investments and create the necessary incentives for increased investment. = Political motivations = As the FCC has perceived the need to create more incentives for incumbent carriers to invest in broadband, the commission has taken apart the access requirements and pricing model that force incumbent carriers to offer services at a low rate through the Telecommunications Act of 1996. In addition, the FCC has removed the traditional regulatory burdens for common carriers that provide Internet access and services. These deregulatory initiatives have freed the carriers of having to share and interconnect facilities providing information services. Some proponents of net bias argue that ISPs do not have legal obligation to operate as common carriers and that the network's interconnection arrangements result from commercial necessity. Moreover, in terms of establishing the network's interconnection, ISPs argue that they used their resources to maintain and upgrade the network for customers, and so far popular websites have received a “free ride” from these resources. Advocates of net bias also propose lawful pricing. Network flexibility for pricing, interconnection, and QoS characterize the initiatives as lawful price discrimination that can provide consumers with greater flexibility and potentially lower bills for low-volume users. Advocates of net bias also argue that combining simple routing with superior service offers options that are no different from the multiple classes of service provided by most airlines or the qualitative difference between free and toll highways. Consequently, some experts contend that the option of offering network flexibility provides a means for consumers and carriers to utilize premium services. =Internet censorship= The concept of freedom of information has emerged in response to state sponsored monitoring, surveillance, and censorship of the Internet. Internet censorship includes the control or suppression of publishing or accessing information on the Internet. Data discrimination may also occur on a national level to censor political, 'immoral' or religious Internet content. For example, China and Saudi Arabia both filter content on the Internet, preventing access to certain types of websites. Singapore has network blocks on more than 100 sites. In Britain, telecommunication companies block access to websites that depict sexually explicit images of children. In the United Arab Emirates , Skype was being blocked. In Norway, some ISPs use a voluntary filter to censor websites that the police (Kripos) believe to contain images of abuse of children. Germany also blocks foreign sites for copyright and other reasons. In the U.S., public institutions (e.g. libraries and schools), by law, block material that is related to the exploitation of children, and 'obscene and pornographic' material, unless they do not receive funding. The network filters also block sites and material relating to women's health, gay and lesbian rights groups, and sexual education for teenagers.http://www.ifea.net/cipa.pdf  Concerns regarding discrimination  The Internet has been historically regarded as an open and “best effort” network. Internet routers must forward packets on a first-come, first-served basis without regard for the analysis of data or content inside the packet. This aspect of the Internet has increased its value, contributing not only to the quality of our lives, but also to economic growth around the globe. Based on these notions, forms of net bias have created some concerns regarding discrimination from economic and political perspectives. In other words, unreasonable net bias occurs when an ISP conducts a discrimination strategy against a specific type of packet without a reasonable and fair financial or operational justification. = Concerns about economic discrimination = Users enjoy the high level of value when they are able to access the Internet on an unmetered and flat-rate basis. Users can also obtain attractive content subsidized by advertisers who employ the flat-rate subscription option by adding to the downloaded packet payload. This value proposition provides users with the benefits of the Internet, emphasizing connectivity with less regard for cost-related concerns. Likewise, the positive network effect — which refers to the process whereby more and more people adopt a service or buy a good, and as a result users receive enjoyable benefits and additional users are attracted to the Internet — created by the spread of the Internet is substantially beneficial. In the Internet, interlinking hundreds and thousands of networks reduces transaction costs and brings a flood of free information to subscribers. However, if major ISPs can freely block and degrade specific traffic streams, there would be societal losses as the Internet becomes more expensive and less productive. Proponents of net bias contend that market- based Internet access achieves efficient outcomes, such as creating innovation incentives for ISPs to invest in building and expanding networks. Nevertheless, opponents of net bias claim that allowing price and service discrimination may ruin the value of the Internet and enable ISPs to shut out competitors or other stakeholders who are unwilling or unable to pay surcharges. In other words, when large or powerful ISPs place a disproportionate financial burden on small and less financially sound ISPs and their subscribers by using forms of net bias like port blocking or tiered services, they may exacerbate the digital divide that separates people with easy and robust Internet service access opportunities from those without. One consumer group, Free Press, calls attention to a number of disadvantages that specialized services (tiered services) may produce. This organization argues that any form of prioritization on the open Internet would bring enormous disadvantages in terms of innovation, competition, investment, consumer choice, and free speech because this permission may enable ISPs to choose specific content/applications with respect to their own interests and thereby destroy the nature and value of the today's open Internet. Free Press cautions that specialized services will result in unbalanced and unparalleled economic growth, which is utterly against the public interest. Viewpoint of Pro- discrimination advocates While a broad presumption pertaining to data discrimination is perceived censorship, those in favor of this practice claim that there are benefits. The ISPs are a business, and as such, “…correctly state that external, non-market driven constraints on their ability to price discriminate can adversely impact their incentive to invest in broadband infrastructure and their ability to recoup that investment.” There are times when it could make sense, in the eyes of the ISPs, to give preference to one type of content over another. For example, loading a plain text and image website is not nearly as strenuous as loading sites such as Hulu and YouTube. Frieden states that “Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) seek to diversify the Internet by prioritizing bitstreams and by offering different quality of service guarantees. To some observers, this strategy constitutes harmful discrimination that violates a tradition of network neutrality in the switching, routing, and transmission of Internet traffic.” While the QoS argument is that network neutrality rules make allowances for network owners to practice some types of discrimination to protect the functioning of the network. Argument Against Data Discrimination Those who oppose data discrimination say that it hurts the growth of the Internet, as well as the economy that is rooted in the depths of the Internet model. “Instead of promoting competition, such picking of winners and losers will stifle the investment needed to perpetuate the Internet's phenomenal growth, hurting the economy.“ If, for example, telecommunication network operators blocked data packets of Voice-over-IP services that might substitute their own telephone services, this would not only discriminate against specific firms but also reduce competition and economic welfare. Technically, this would not be a problem. Although data packets are homogeneous with respect to switching and transmission treatment, type, source, and destination can be revealed and data packets be handled differently if a network operator prefers to do so. Another problem is that the type of data that is given preferential treatment is up to the discretion of the ISP. This allows them to move data as they see fit, whether it be through a political, moral, any other such kind of \\"lens\\". This goes against the first amendment, the freedom of speech because by stopping certain kinds of information from reaching the end user, they are censoring content. It is not the place of the ISP to censor content from the people. The real threat to an open Internet is at the local network (the ends), where network owners can block information coming in from the inter-network, but it also is at the local network where the most harm can occur. Because of this, network neutrality rules allow some discrimination by the local network to protect itself, though it may not be based on content or type of application. For example, network owners want to protect their networks from being damaged. So, some discrimination is allowed to \\"prevent physical harm to the local Broadband Network caused by any network attachment or network usage.\\" This means that local network operators may not control which types of applications users choose to employ, what type of devices users use to access the network, or which type of legal content users choose to convey or consume. The only allowable restrictions are on applications that cause harm to the local network. Proponents of network neutrality concede that network security is crucial enough to warrant making an exception to a network neutrality rule. Allowing network providers to deviate from neutrality only to the extent necessary to protect network trustworthiness is rooted in judicial and regulatory decisions and administrative rules that helped establish the principle of nondiscrimination as the core of network neutrality. Sen. Al Franken has spoken out on FCC rulings “calling net neutrality the 'free speech issue of our time,'” Franken (D-MN) expressed his displeasure with the FCC's recent net neutrality rules. ‘These rules are not strong enough,' he said, pointing out that paid prioritization was not banned and that wireless networks are allowed to discriminate at will. The rules mark the ‘first time the FCC has ever allowed discrimination on the Internet’ and they ‘will create essentially two Internets.’ Another important concept for marketers to understand is that of disparate impact. If a discrimination case is brought against your company, the plaintiff would have to show evidence of disparate impact. = Concerns about political discrimination = In 2005, the FCC issued a Broadband Policy Statement (also known as the Internet Policy Statement) that offered guidance and insight into its approach to the Internet and broadband consistent with Congress’ direction. (FCC) The four principles of this statement are as follows: :*To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public Internet, consumers are entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice. :*To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public Internet, consumers are entitled to run applications and use services of their choice, subject to the needs of law enforcement. :*To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public Internet, consumers are entitled to connect their choice of legal devices that do not harm the network. :*To encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public Internet, consumers are entitled to competition among network providers, application and service providers, and content providers. At first glance, these principles appear noncontroversial in terms of standards regarding the freedom of the network. However, these principles do not address regulations with respect to the issues of differentiations in pricing, interconnection, and QoS. Further, the unregulated forms of net bias have the potential to create false congestion by the ISPs. More specifically, advanced Internet protocol technology can allow ISPs to fabricate congestion and drop packets when no real congestion takes place. In addition, existing peering and transit agreements between stakeholders such as small and large ISPs may lack a specific prohibition of deliberate packet loss. Many ISPs contend that major content providers such as Google or Yahoo! enjoy a free ride. AT&T;, one of the major ISPs, stated that the current standard procedure for Internet pricing and interconnection has left the company burdened with having to create, maintain, and frequently upgrade an expensive bit transport infrastructure whereas content providers do not have to do the same. However, Rob Frieden points out that the ISPs’ practices of net bias, as they are based on a “free rider” consideration, may violate the principles of network freedom or even the peering and transit agreement between ISPs. Based on existing peering and transit agreements made by AT&T;, Google is allowed to have its traffic delivered to AT&T; subscribers free of charge, and AT&T; is compensated for the traffic from other ISPs by the agreements. Moreover, if AT&T; penalizes Google's traffic from the various forms of net bias, it would jeopardize the principles of network freedom as well as violate its contractual commitment to its peers and transit customers who have paid for best efforts access to AT&T;'s networks. Technical and market convergence as well as deregulation by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 provided incentives for companies to integrate vertically and horizontally. As a result, those integrated companies have discrimination incentives such that they may try port blocking or unfair throttling to enhance the marketplace attractiveness of corporate affiliates. From this perspective, Free Press emphasized through its comments to the FCC Notice of Inquiry that specialized services should be provided with fairness, particularly in the vertically integrated environments of the information and telecommunication industry (e.g., Comcast, which has both content and broadband services). Consequently, concerns regarding discrimination raised the need of network neutrality regulations to preserve the open Internet and public interest and enable the Internet industry to survive and succeed. The FCC and Data Discrimination In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission does not permit data discrimination except for \\"reasonable traffic management.\\" The Federal Communication Commission defines reasonable traffic management as follows: > A network management practice is reasonable if it is appropriate and > tailored to achieving a legitimate network management purpose, taking into > account the particular network architecture and technology of the broadband > Internet access service. It is considered unreasonable for internet service providers to manage traffic by blocking applications or assigning quality of service based on source, destination, or unreasonable application provider payment. Regardless, there are currently no laws prohibiting internet service providers from offering different service plans that may restrict consumers' access to selected material. In June 2007 the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published Broadband Connectivity Competition Policy which suggested that it may be beneficial to consumers if broadband providers would pursue a variety of business arrangements, including data prioritization, exclusive deals, and vertical integration into online content and applications. The report also suggests that government should move cautiously in implementing any changes to current regulations. =FCC Appeals= * Verizon Communications filed an appeal against the FCC in the United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit on January 20, 2011. The FCC's rules aim to prevent Internet service providers from blocking certain websites or applications. Verizon's appeal claims that the FCC has overstepped its authority and that the rules violate the company's constitutional rights. The company says that the net neutrality rules modify the terms of existing licenses held by Verizon. Rather than launching a lawsuit that directly challenges the regulations, the company is appealing the rules as an illegal change to their existing licenses. **“It has been a very long and drawn out fight, and it has certainly distracted the FCC for the last year. It has distracted the carriers as well, who have spent a lot of time, effort and money in terms of publicly fighting about it and privately fighting about it,\\" says Larry Downes an industry consultant and author...\\"It is very, very unlikely that AT&T; will file suit,\\" said Downes. \\"They've said publicly and repeatedly that they are comfortable with the net neutrality order and I take that as a pretty strong indication that they are not going to litigate it.\\" =Evidence of Anti-competitiveness= During a hearing held by Rep. Greg Walden, one of the speakers put forth a question that needs to be addressed by the FCC, as well as other groups that are in support of Net Neutrality. The speaker said, \\"If the mere threat of Internet discrimination is such a concern and if the FCC has done no analysis to demonstrate why one company has more market power than another, why would discrimination by companies like Google or Skype be any more acceptable than discrimination by companies like AT&T; and Comcast?\\" During the same hearing, a different member spoke up and quoted Section 230 of the Communications Act saying, \\"...preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by federal or state regulations.\\" essentially saying that there should be laws in place so that the government knows how to handle its authority over the FCC and ISPs. He did not say that these laws are not laws meant for regulating what the FCC does, but how the FCC should act. In 2005, a small North Carolina telecom company, Madison River Communications, blocked their DSL customers from using the Vonage VoIP service. Service was restored after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) intervened and entered into a consent decree that had Madison River pay a fine of $15,000.http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-05-543A2.pdf In this case, the FCC investigated allegations that Madison River violated nondiscriminatory obligations contained in the Communications Act, but the redefinition of broadband as an information service dramatically reduces the authority of regulators to deter this kind of competitive misconduct. As Anti- Piracy * “Network-level filtering means your Internet service provider – Comcast, AT&T;, EarthLink, or whoever you send that monthly check to – could soon start sniffing your digital packets, looking for material that infringes on someone’s copyright. “What we are already doing to address piracy hasn’t been working. There’s no secret there...\\"\\" This may be one of the major reasons that ISPs want to be able to discriminate against certain data types. Ever since the dawn of peer-to-peer file sharing, both the MPAA and the RIAA have been hounding ISPs to divulge any and all information relating to file sharing. With the implementation of data discrimination, that file sharing data can be, and will be, thrown to the bottom of the pecking order. This will render any kind of sharing, even the kind that isn't deemed illegal, useless because the transfer speeds will be unusably slow. * Center of Digital Democracy (CDD) conducts a study which finds out several internet service providers (ISP) offer advertising companies specific packages for users personal information. Examples Worldwide, the BitTorrent application is widely given reduced bandwidth or even in some cases blocked entirely. Worldwide, under heavy attack from spam e-mail, many e-mail servers no longer accept connections except from white-listed hosts. While few care about the rights of spammers, this means that legitimate hosts not on the list are often blocked. Save The Internet, an advocacy organization led by Free Press, is documenting situations in which ISPs have engaged in data discrimination. * In 2005, Canadian telephone giant Telus blocked access to voices-for-change.ca, a website supporting the company's labour union during a labour dispute, as well as over 600 other websites, for about sixteen hours after pictures were posted on the website of employees crossing the picket line. * In April 2006, Time Warner's AOL (America On Line) blocked all e-mails that mentioned www.dearaol.com, an advocacy campaign opposing the company's pay-to-send e-mail scheme. An AOL spokesman called the issue an unintentional glitch. * In February 2006, some of Cox Cable's customers were unable to access Craigslist because of a confluence of a software bug in the Authentium personal firewall distributed by Cox Cable to improve customers' security and the way that Craigslist had their servers misconfigured. Save the Internet said this was an intentional act on the part of Cox Cable to protect classified ad services offered by its partners. The issue was resolved by correction of the software as well as a change in the network configuration used by Craig's List. Craig's List founder Craig Newmark stated that he believed the blocking was unintentional. * In August 2007, Comcast was found to be preventing or at least severely delaying uploads on BitTorrent.TorrentFreak. Comcast Throttles BitTorrent Traffic, Seeding Impossible August 17, 2007 These claims were verified in October by the EFFEFF,tests agree with AP: Comcast is forging packets to interfere with user traffic, OCTOBER 19TH, 2007 and Associated Press.Svensson, Peter, and AP T. Writer. \\"Comcast Blocks some Subscriber Internet Traffic, AP Testing shows.\\" The Associated Press October 20, 2007. * In September 2007, Verizon Wireless prevented a pro-choice organization from sending text messages to its members coordinating a public demonstration, despite the fact that the intended recipients had explicitly signed up to receive such messages. * On February 4, 2010, Verizon Wireless blocked 4chan, an English language imageboard from being accessed by its customers. A few days later, on February 7, 2010, Verizon Wireless confirmed that 4chan had been \\"explicitly blocked\\", offering no explanation. The block was lifted a few days later. *In a March 2009 Freedom House report on Internet and digital media censorship worldwide, Egypt scored a 45 (out of 100), slightly worse than Turkey but better than Russia. Cuba scored a 90, making it more Net- censored than even Iran, China and Tunisia. Cellphone service is too expensive for most Cubans. *Comcast Corp. actively interferes with attempts by some of its high-speed Internet subscribers to share files online, a move that runs counter to the tradition of treating all types of Net traffic equally. The interference, which The Associated Press confirmed through nationwide tests, is the most drastic example yet of data discrimination by a U.S. Internet service provider. It involves company computers masquerading as those of its users. Comcast's interference appears to be an aggressive way of managing its network to keep file-sharing traffic from swallowing too much bandwidth and affecting the Internet speeds of other subscribers. **If widely applied by other ISPs, the technology Comcast is using would be a crippling blow to the BitTorrent, eDonkey and Gnutella file-sharing networks. While these are mainly known as sources of copyright music, software and movies, BitTorrent in particular is emerging as a legitimate tool for quickly disseminating legal content.

It returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post voting system. Vacancy Sir Charles Cripps KC was elected for Wycombe in 1910. He received a peerage from the Liberal government in 1914 and took the title Baron Parmoor of Frieth in the County of Buckingham. Electoral history The Liberal Party had gained the seat from the Conservatives in the 1906 landslide before losing it back in January 1910. The Liberals did not contest the seat in December 1910 when the Conservative candidate was elected unopposed. In January 1910 the Conservative majority was 2,556. Cripps Candidates *There was some speculation as to who the Unionist candidate would be. It was thought that Coningsby Disraeli a former MP and nephew of the former Prime Minister might be chosen. Another candidate considered was Seddon Cripps, the son of the retiring MP.The Times, 2 Jan 1914 However, on 10 January, the Unionists selected William Baring du Pré. He was appointed High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire and deputy lieutenant of the county in 1911 and was a justice of the peace for Buckinghamshire.Debrett's House of Commons and Judicial Bench 1916 He was a popular landlord from a family long- established at Beaconsfield.The Times, 13 January 1914 *The Liberal Party already had a candidate in place. In November 1913 they had selected Claud Vere Cavendish Hobart as their prospective parliamentary candidate. However, on 12 January he withdrew as candidate because, as an outsider to the area, he felt he had not got to know the constituency well enough. The local Liberals did have a willing candidate from within their membership in Tonman Mosley who had bought the country house of Bangors Park, Iver, in the constituency. He had been a Unionist until he resigned and joined the Liberals in 1913. He was the Chairman of South Buckinghamshire Liberal Association.The Times, 13/1/1914 He was a barrister and businessman from a landed background. He had been Chairman of the Buckinghamshire County Council since 1904. He unsuccessfully contested Lichfield Division of Staffordshire as a Conservative in the 1885 general election.Who's Who: www.ukwhoswho.com *There was speculation about a Labour Party candidate standing, due to problems with the local chairmaking industry, but the speculation came to nothing. Campaign Polling Day was set for 18 February 1914. Given that the out-going MP had been awarded a barony on 16 January, this left only about 4 weeks for campaigning. The new Great Western and Central railway line to Marylebone Station, opened in 1906, had brought a flood of commuters into the seat around Gerards Cross and Beaconsfield. The rise of 1,800 in the electorate in 1910-14 was largely attributable to this phenomenon, and most of these new voters were reckoned to be Unionists.The Times, 16 February 1914 The core of the Liberal vote was the working class of High Wycombe, mainly engaged in chairmaking. Since November 1913, the whole town had been riven by a lock-out in the chairmaking industry. By February 1914 some 2 to 3,000 men were idle and there had been a number of riots in which factories and the metropolitan police had been stoned. The chairmakers were estimated to be 75-80% Liberal and the dispute deprived the Liberals of the help of some of their keenest supporters. The strike leader, Cllr Forward, advised his followers to abstain. Efforts at mediation could not solve the dispute before polling day. The Liberal government's National Insurance Act was still thought to be unpopular with many voters. The Liberal campaign was run by the Marquess of Lincolnshire who, as Earl Carrington, had been President of the Board of Agriculture from 1905-1911. He had started his own career in politics by becoming Liberal MP for Wycombe in 1865 and had maintained strong ties with the area. He was a leading advocate in the Liberal party of the Rural Land Campaign which sought to reform land ownership, land taxation, abolish plural voting and improve agricultural wages. Lincolnshire launched the local Liberal land campaign at a meeting on 2 February.Lloyd George, Liberalism and the land by Ian Packer There was an intensive Liberal campaign in the rural villages. A specially imported staff of lecturers was reported to be 'scouring the countryside' pressing the land policy.The Times, 7 February 1914 Result The local press reported 'light' voting in Wycombe, while the Unionists were able to poll successfully the commuters at the eastern end of the seat.South Bucks Free Press, 20 February 1914 An increased Unionist majority of over 3,000 was confidently predicted.Daily Chronicle, 20 February 1914 Yet, instead of a humiliating reverse, the Liberals achieved a small pro-government swing of 1.2% from the January 1910 result; The relative success of the Liberal campaign was attributed to the rural land campaign.Lloyd George, Liberalism and the land, by Ian Packer Aftermath The Wycombe result was a boost to Liberal moral and helped convince the party of the importance in placing the Rural Land Campaign at the centre of their platform at a General Election expected to take place later in the year. It demonstrated that the campaign could save the 30 English rural seats won by the party in December 1910 and assuming the 1.2% swing could be repeated, would see the Liberals gain 9 rural seats. If the election were to be delayed long enough to allow for the passage of the Plural Voting Bill, a further 8 English rural seats would be gained by the Liberals. Due to the outbreak of war, the election never took place and when it finally did, much had changed.

She made one complete voyage to Bombay. During her second voyage to Bombay she was wrecked in 1777, Captain Alexander Hamilton left the Downs on 9 April 1772, bound for Bombay. Marquis of Rockingham reached Johanna on 23 July, and Bombay on 17 August. On 4 November she was at Tellicherry and Kedgeree on 28 December. On her homeward-bound voyage she passed Ingeli, a point on the Hooghli River on 8 March 1773. She reached Mauritius on 15 May and St Helena on 14 July. She arrived at the Downs on 18 September. Between this voyage and the next Marquis of Rockingham may have undergone modifications. That would account for both the duration of the time between voyages and the change in her size between the two voyages. Alternatively, the 499 tons is somewhat suspect. Following Queen Anne's charter of 1702, between 1708 and 1747 almost every EIC vessel was registered as being of under 500 tons (bm). The reason was that the charter required every vessel of 500 tons or over to carry a chaplain.Cotton (1949), p.41. Apparently the Directors of the EIC did not feel this was a worthwhile expense. However, the practice of under registering may have persisted after the original motivation had elapsed. For her second voyage, Hamilton left the Downs on 9 April 1776, again bound for Bombay. She reached Madeira on 24 April, Johanna on 29 August, and Bombay on 1 October. She then sailed to Surat, which she reached on 29 November, before she returned to Bombay on 25 December.

The station consisted of two separate depots on opposite sides of the tracks. The brick outbound depot was located just north of the Blakemore Street bridge, while the wooden inbound depot was located south of the overpass. History =Operation= Mount Hope station in an 1889 advertisement for the Old Colony Railroad The station was built as an infill station on the existing Boston & Providence Railroad circa 1882. The outbound building showed \\"1884\\" on one of its stones. The station was at railroad level below grade; street access was via sets of stairs. The wooden inbound building was built sometime after the outbound building. The Boston & Providence Railroad was acquired by the Old Colony Railroad in 1888, which in turn became part of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1893. A brief controversy took place over poor station lighting in 1906. The station buildings were closed in 1941 or 1942 after World War II started, but trains still served the station. The inbound building was demolished after a fire and replaced with a small shelter. Ridership declined due to the competing #32 trolley line as well as the general disuse of railroads, but the station was never completely abandoned. The NYNH&H; folded into Penn Central in 1969, who sold the line and station to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority in 1973. Conrail took over Penn Central in 1976 and the Boston & Maine Railroad was contracted to operate the southside commuter lines starting in March 1977, thus marking the sixth operator to run trains to Mount Hope. =Closure= The former station site in 2016 On November 3, 1979, the MBTA closed the tracks from Readville to Back Bay for construction of the Southwest Corridor. Providence and Franklin trains were rerouted via the Fairmount Line, while Mount Hope and Hyde Park were closed. When the corridor reopened to commuter trains in October 1987, only Hyde Park was returned to service. Mount Hope was considered too close to Forest Hills and the Orange Line to be useful. The MBTA offered instead a limited-service stop several hundred yards south at Cummins Highway, but local opinion was against the plan. Housing units have been erected on the sites of both the inbound and outbound station buildings. The foundation of the outbound building was discovered during construction of a condominium complex. Today, no visible remnants of the station exist. =Proposed Orange Line extension= Mount Hope is located in a densely populated neighborhood just six miles from downtown Boston, making it a strong candidate for rapid transit service rather than conventional low-frequency commuter rail service. The 1945 Coolidge Commission Report recommended that an extension of the Orange Line south from Forest Hills be built to Dedham via West Roxbury rather than Mount Hope. The 1966 Program for Mass Transportation recommended a bifurcated Orange Line, with one branch to West Roxbury or Hersey and another to Readville or Route 128 via Mount Hope. Various reports over the next two decades continued to recommend various combinations of the extensions; however, due to cost, the 1987 relocation of the Orange Line to the Southwest Corridor was terminated at Forest Hills. Hyde Park, Readville, and the Needham Line instead received limited upgrades, like handicapped accessible platforms. The extension is still periodically discussed. The 2004 Program for Mass Transportation listed an extension to Route 128 with intermediate stops, including—possibly—Mount Hope, at a cost of $342.8 million. The extension was listed as low priority, due to environmental issues with crossing the wetlands south of Readville, and because the corridor already has commuter rail service.

This eukaryotic encystation in Acanthamoeba spp., is known to involve a crosstalk between the trophozoite form of the cell and unfavourable microenvoirment that induces it. It is thought that once tumor cells disseminate and begin to migrate to a new site to metastasize, the interaction of the tumor cells with that microenvironment determines whether the cells will proliferate and form metastases or undergo growth arrest and enter cancer dormancy. It is suggested that the disseminated cells choose dormancy when the new environment is not permissive in situations such as cellular stress or a lack of available growth factors.Ranganathan Aparna C., Adam Alejandro P. and Aguirre-Ghiso Julio A. (2006). Opposing Roles of Mitogenic and Stress Signaling Pathways in the Inductions of Cancer Dormancy. Cell Cycle. 5:16, 1799–1807. These dormant cells can stay in this state for long periods of time and can be clinically undetectable.Aguirre-Ghiso, Julio A. (2006). The Problem of Cancer Dormancy: Understanding the Basic Mechanisms and Identifying Therapeutic Opportunities. Cell Cycle. 5:16, 1740–1743. However, these cells can be dangerous because they can strike back years after the doctor and patient believe the patient is cured. They can exist in a quiescent state for many years, but the dormancy period can be interrupted to start proliferating uncontrollably and form metastases that cannot be treated. Cancer dormancy is often associated with minimal residual disease (MRD) where some tumor cells are left behind after a treatment and can persist either at the primary tumor site or as disseminated cells that are proliferating or dormant. MRD has been found in a widespread range of cancers including but not limited to: breast, prostate, colon, gastric, colon, pancreatic, head and neck, neuroblastoma, leukemia, melanoma, and others. These cells are often found in the bone marrow, but are also found in other organs and usually indicate poor prognosis for the patient.Braun S., Vogl F. D., Naume B., Janni W., Osborne M.

Garland, Dr PH, FACE, Edward D. Gorham, MPH, Sharif B. Mohr, MPH, Frank C. Garland, PhD. =Types of cancer dormancy= Cancer dormancy can refer to two different types: tumor mass dormancy and cellular dormancy. # In tumor mass dormancy, the tumor mass will continue to divide until it is physically limited by size, does not have access to the blood supply, or the immune system acts on it. Here the cells are not completely inactive, but they cannot expand and sit in a balance between proliferation and apoptosis. An emerging Hippo (Hpo) signaling pathway is thought to be responsible for controlling organ size, cell contact inhibition, and tumorigenesis by stopping cell proliferation and promoting cell death.Uhr Jonathan W. and Pantel Klaus. (2011). Controversies in clinical cancer dormancy. PNAS. 108:30, 12396–12400. Tumor mass dormancy is also often associated with angiogenic dormancy. This occurs when tumors enter a hypoxic state because they cannot get to blood vessels. If the number of cells still proliferating is balanced by the number dying from no blood supply, the tumor sits in angiogenic dormancy.Naumov G.N., Akslen L.A., and Folkman J. (2006). Role of angiogenesis in human tumor dormancy: animal models of the angiogenic switch. Cell Cycle. 5:16, 1779–1787. # Cellular dormancy refers to the cell entering a state of quiescence where growth is arrested in G0-G1 of the cell cycle, and cells are truly inactive and asymptomatic. This is referred to as the dormancy that tumor cells enter when they survive dissemination but cannot adapt immediately to stresses or the new microenvironment. Recently, model pathogenic eukaryotic cell encystation has been linked to cancer cell dormancy, Acanthamoeba spp. were studied for conditions leading to their encystation. These conditions were imposed on prostate cancer cells to induce a state of dormancy from which they could be revived by elimination of the provoking stimuli.Baig AM, Khan NA, Abbas F. Eukaryotic cell encystation and cancer cell dormancy: Is a greater devil veiled in the details of a lesser evil? Cancer Biol Dormant cells might also have different mechanisms that can be used to evade an immune response. =Signaling pathways= Although the mechanism of signaling in cancer dormancy is also poorly understood, there is evidence of many different signaling pathways that are involved in the switch between proliferation and dormancy. The signaling most likely comes from the microenvironment. The switch seems to be mediated by interactions between surface receptors such as uPAR and integrins, mitogenic signaling from the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, and stress induced signaling from the p38 pathway.Aguirre-Ghiso J. A., Liu D., Mignatti A., Kovalski K., and Ossowski L. (2001). Urokinase receptor and fibronectin regulate the ERK (MAPK) to p38(MAPK) activity ratios that determine carcinoma cell proliferation or dormancy in vivo. Mol Bio Cell. 12, 863 – 879. One example that has been extensively researched is the balance between the ERK pathway and p38 pathway. The ERK pathway has a major role in many cellular processes, but in cancer dormancy it is thought to be involved in mitogenic signaling that results in heightened proliferation.Aguirre-Ghiso J. A., Estrada Y., Liu D., and Ossowski L. (2003). ERK(MAPK) activity as a determinant of tumor growth and dormancy; regulation by p38(SAPK). Cancer Res. 63, 1684–1695. The p38 pathway is thought to be involved in cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Thus, a higher ERK/p38 ratio usually indicates proliferation and a lower ratio causes dormancy.Aguirre-Ghiso J. A., Ossowski L., and Rosenbaum, S.K. (2004). Green fluorescent protein tagging of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 pathways reveals novel dynamics of pathway activation during primary and metastatic growth. Cancer Res. 64:20, 7336 – 7345. Clinical and therapeutic importance The push for understanding the mechanism of cancer dormancy is important for several clinical reasons. These dormant cancer cells are often untreatable due to drug resistance. These cells are usually resistant to chemotherapy because they are not dividing, and chemotherapy best targets rapidly diving cells.Naumov G.N., Townson J.L., MacDonald I. C., Wilson S.M., Bramwell V. H., Groom A. C. and Chambers A. F. (2003). Ineffectiveness of doxorubicin treatment on solitary dormant mammary carcinoma cells or late-developing metastases. Breast Cancer Res Treat. 82:3, 199 – 206.Ranganathan A. C., Zhang L., Adam A. P., Aguirre- Ghiso J. A. (2006). Functional coupling of p38-induced upregulation of BiP and activation of RNA-dependent protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase to drug resistance of dormant carcinoma cells. Cancer Res. 66, 1702–1711. # An idea for a therapeutic strategy is to cause cancer cells to be induced or maintained in a dormant state. By inducing normally untreatable malignant cells into growth arrest, the patient would be able to survive in a chronic asymptomatic condition. This could be accomplished by finding the correct ratio of mitogenic signals like ERK to p38. However, even though a cell can remain dormant for a long period of time, there is always the risk of interrupted dormancy leading to metastasis by even the smallest change in a signaling network. Another therapeutic strategy is to develop methods to knock out dormant cells completely. # By targeting the mechanisms behind dormant cell survival and how they acquire drug resistance, it might be possible to induce these dormant cells to their death. # Finally, it is hoped that understanding the mechanism of dormancy will allow researchers to find potential markers of dormancy that might contribute to determining the prognosis of the patient. Remaining questions There are many questions that remain to be answered in the quest for understanding cancer dormancy more fully. Some of these include: * What is the actual cause of awakening dormant cancer cells? * How closely similar are dormant cancer cells and cancer stem cells? *Is the mechanism of cancer dormancy different for different types of cancer? *Do all long-term cancer survivors that are free of relapse also have dormant cancer cells hidden somewhere? Finally, it is important for scientists to use models that can more accurately model the stage of cancer dormancy to discover its mechanism. By more fully understanding the mechanism of cancer dormancy, it will be possible to find new therapeutic strategies to target these dormant cancer cells. It might be that the body is not completely rid of cancer cells in the way that might be considered “cured” by complete elimination, but it is an alternative “operational cure” by which the patient is in control of a chronic disease so that they will eventually die with their cancer instead of from it.

It was a Scottish Highland constituency that returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post voting system. The constituency was a district of burghs representing the parliamentary burghs of Cromarty, Dingwall, Dornoch, Kirkwall, Tain and Wick.For the burghs included see Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1832-1885 and 1885-1918. The by-election took place during the third anniversary of the Liberal Government's re-election of December 1910. It was thought to be a key indicator to the outcome of the following general election anticipated to take place in 1914-15. Vacancy At the January 1910 general election Robert Munro was elected Member of Parliament for Wick Burghs. In 1913 Munro was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Lord Advocate by H. H. Asquith. This meant he had to resign his seat and seek re-election. Electoral history The constituency was created in 1832 and returned Liberals at every election until 1892 when, following a split in the Liberal Party over Irish Home Rule, the seat was won by a Liberal Unionist. Unionist candidates won four consecutive general elections, including 1906 when the Liberal Party swept the country. Against the trend, Munro gained the seat for the Liberals at the January 1910 general election and held it at the December General Election; Robert Munro Candidates *Robert Munro had quickly established a reputation as a formidable candidate for the Liberal Party, on the back of his unexpected victory in January 1910. He was born in the Scottish highlands, but just outside the constituency in Alness. *The local Unionists selected a new candidate for this election, in Alexander George Mackenzie. Campaign Polling day was set for 8 December. Nominations closed on 1 December to confirm a 2-party contest. The issue of Irish Home Rule was again at the top of the political agenda as the Liberal Government had introduced the Third Irish Home Rule Bill. The Unionist dominated House of Lords had rejected the bill for a second time and the Liberals were preparing to introduce it for the third and final time. Leading Ulster Unionist politician Sir Edward Carson opposed the bill and sought to rally opposition in Ulster through the creation of the Ulster Volunteers a paramilitary group, armed with weapons supplied by Germany. He called on Unionists to use \\"all means necessary\\" to oppose the British Government.Asgard (yacht)#cite note- ring95-99-1 Liberals like David Lloyd George criticised Unionists and Carson in particular for acts of treason. Munro received a telegram of support from Lloyd George in which he also took the opportunity to attack Unionist double standards on religious questions: \\"It is rather sickening to see the upholders of sectarian privileges in England and Wales profess to be the champions of religious equality for Ireland. I wish English and Scottish Tories would concede to English and Welsh Nonconformists the same measure of religious equality and fair play as will be guaranteed to Ulster Episcopalians and Presbyterians under the Home Rule Bill.\\"\\"Unionism In Scotland.\\" Times [London, England] 8 Dec. 1913: 12. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 3 Mar. 2014. Result There was a swing of 4.5% to the Liberals, whose candidate Robert Munro increased his majority over the Unionist; The increase in the Liberal majority was hailed with exultation by Liberals as a triumphant condemnation of 'Carsonism'.The Spectator, 13 DECEMBER 1913, Page 3 Munro's majority of 443 was the largest ever recorded in the history of the constituency. Munro's explanation was that \\"the election had been fought on Home Rule first and last\\".\\"Wick Burghs Result.\\" Times [London, England] 10 Dec. 1913: 5. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 3 Mar. Aftermath Carson was to eventually back down and along with his Irish Unionist colleagues, supported an amendment to the Home Rule Bill for the \\"temporary exclusion of Ulster\\". A General Election was due to take place by the end of 1915. By the autumn of 1914, the following candidates had been adopted to contest that election; *Liberal Party: Robert Munro *Unionist Party: Due to the outbreak of war, the election never took place. By the 1918 general election, Wick Burghs was abolished as part of the boundary review and the burghs split between Caithness and Sutherland and Ross and Cromarty. Munro was elected for the lowland seat of Roxburgh and Selkirk. Mackenzie did not stand again.

The Worship of snakes deities is popular in Sri Lanka, especially in Nainativu, the historic home of the Nagas. Several different indigenous clans lived in the island of Sri Lanka during the pre-Vijaya era (before 505 BCE). These clans of Sri Lanka and the mystical kingdom of Lanka were mentioned in the great epics of Mahabaratha, Mahavamsa, Manimekalai, Ramayana and Sangam. Ordhendra Coomar Gangoly. The art of the Pallavas, Volume 2 of Indian Sculpture Series. G. Wittenborn, 1957. p. 2. It is believed that four main clans lived in Sri Lanka before king Vijaya explored the island. The four clans are Yaksha (Yakku), Naga, Deva, and Raksha (Rakus). It is believed that these names were attributed metaphorically to indicate their profession: Yaksha people were believed to inhabit in the mountains where they had used monsoon wind to mould iron, Raksha people were supposed to be farmers who used the steel products of the yaksha people in their farming endeavours (the name Raksha is derived from the two syllables ra + kus, in Sinhalese means \\"stomach\\"; literally means the people who fulfill hunger or the people who provide rice, the staple food of the Sinhalese people), the Naga people were believed to be traders, the Deva people were the rulers, the people who used to be the link between the Raksha people and yaksha people.

The majority of the native population were farmers and cattle herders. They had knowledge about healing arts (ayurvedic), built irrigation systems and temples. There were trade relations and royal intermarriage between the indigenous people of Sri Lanka and their neighbors in the Indian kingdoms. The era before the arrival of Prince Vijaya was not well documented so there is not much known of the previous native rulers of Sri Lanka. Ravana the mythical king of Lanka kingdom is considered the most famous and most powerful native king who ever reigned in Sri Lanka.

He was the president of the Moroccan association of contemporary cataclysmic jurisprudence research and studies and a member of the Moroccan Religious Scholars. Islamopedia Online Zamzami was also one of the founders of the International Union of Muslim Scholars and a member of the Moroccan Parliament. Zamzami was the sole Member of Parliament affiliated with the party of reform and virtue and was seen as an enemy to secularists and communists in Morocco. Zamzami was shunned and criticized by members of his party after he issued a series of controversial fatwas.Reform and Virtue criticism  History and religious career  Abdul-Bari Zamzami was born in Tangiers, Morocco, in 1943 and started his career under the wing of his late father, Sheikh Mohamed Zamzami Mohamed Zamzami . at the Big Mosque of Tangiers; the late Mohamed Zamzami called for a return to the sunna and fought against the Sufi ways Mohamed Zamzami . present in Morocco. Abdul-Bari Zamzami moved to Casablanca in 1975 La Vie Eco . or 1976 where he started delivering Friday sermons at the Yusufi Mosque, the Muhammadi Mosque, and “Ould Lhamra” in the old medina. During the 1980s, Zamzami became popular thanks to his religious speeches for which he used the Moroccan Darija dialect.La Vie Eco He also created a newspaper, Al-Sunna, which publication stopped a few months after its first edition.Al Sunna Newspaper Zamzami's sermons caused him to be suspended from preaching in 1978, 1979, 2000, and 2001 Ban from sermons . allegedly due to his mixing of the political and the religious. In 2001, Zamzami was one of the founders of the Moroccan association of contemporary jurisprudence research and studies, of which he was the president. The association aims at fighting \\"currents\\" that try to eradicate sharia law from the constitution.La Vie Eco He died of cancer on 10 February 2016 at the age of 73.Le cheikh Abdelbari Zamzami est mort  Political career  In 2007, Zamzami won a seat in parliament thanks to his popularity in the neighborhood where he preaches in Casablanca. He later lost his seat in the 2011 elections La Vie Eco . although he is still listed as a parliament member on the government's website. Following his retirement in 2011, Zamzami decided to dedicate himself to issuing Fatwas retirement . and obtained a public transportation permit to operate a for-profit vehicle Al Haouz . Zamzami advocated against the creation of religious-based political parties, despite belonging to one himself;Asharq Al-Awsat his reasoning was that Islam-based parties would be an insult to the populations of predominantly Muslim countries, as it would denote that only their adherents follow the Muslim creed. Further, Zamzami announced his support for the government's monitoring of mosques and religious sermons as a tool to protect countries from extremism.Asharq Al-Awsat  Public criticism  Abdul-Bari Zamzami was banned from preaching at the mosque on several occasions due to controversial views he has discussed with the public.La Vie Eco Following his retirement, Zamzami obtained a permit to operate public transportation from the Ministry of transport and tourism, for which he was amply criticized by the population. Indeed, Moroccan media criticized the former parliamentarian, who inadvertently forgot that \\"thousands of citizens struggle and cannot obtain such permits\\" despite being more in need for a source of income than he is. Zamzami responded that since he has been banned from giving sermons at mosques for approximately ten years, and because of his retirement, he found himself in need of a source of income and had to request such a permit. (Receiving public transportation permits in Morocco is somewhat exclusive and is usually a source of income many can only dream of, as conferring such permits is usually not based on any set criteria aside from connections or other corrupt methods such as bribery) Further criticism of Zamzami came from the Amazigh community after he allegedly announced that Amazigh language and identity is an abomination and that calls [to make Amazigh an official language in Morocco] are heretic according to the Muslim faith.Amazighophobia  Controversial fatwas  Zamzami was a contributor to Islam Online,Islam Online . where he occasionally issued fatwas and answered questions about jurisprudence. In addition, Zamzami issued approximately 2,000 fatwas during his career;La Vie Eco . despite only issuing four or five about sexual topics, Zamzami has been faced with a lot of criticism. His latest include the fatwa dubbed \\"necrophilia fatwa\\" which edict gives a man the right to engage in sexual intercourse with his wife up to six hours after her death;Necrophilia fatwa despite recognizing that such an action is despicable in mainstream society, Zamzami persisted in backing his original fatwa, claiming marriage does not end in death.Necrophilia despicable but okay The necrophilia fatwa went viral after Al Arabiyah published an article alleging that Egypt was about to adopt a law in its favor, a measure that proved to be a hoax propagated further by western media. In addition, a new fatwa allowing women to masturbate using sex toys, carrots, pestles, bottles, and other phallic- looking objects warranted the wrath of the Moroccan and international Muslim community against Zamzami.Hoax criticism . Zamzami also previously published a fatwa allowing Muslim women to drink alcohol during their pregnancy if it is part of their cravings.Alcohol during pregnancy Other controversial fatwas he issued include the possibility for people to take medicine without breaking their Fast during Ramadan as long as they do not drink water. This fatwa made Zamzami unpopular among other religious figures who questioned his integrity as a scholar. In addition, Zamzami also announced that it is against the religion to take to the streets after the King delivers a speech; this fatwa made the population, as well as the media question his intentions.

Chuzi was the grandson of Duke Jian of Qin, who was the uncle of his predecessor Duke Ling. When Duke Ling died in 415 BC, the throne passed to his uncle Duke Jian instead of to his son, the later Duke Xian. Duke Jian reigned for 15 years and was succeeded by his son, Chuzi's father Duke Hui II, who reigned for 13 years and died in 387 BC. When Chuzi succeeded his father as ruler of Qin he was either one or two years old, and the state of Qin was effectively controlled by his mother, the duchess dowager. Just two years later, in 385 BC a minister in the government, Jun Gai (菌改), rebelled against Chuzi and the duchess. He led his forces to escort Duke Xian, who was at the time exiled in the State of Wei, back to Qin, killed Chuzi and his mother and installed Duke Xian on the throne.

He was the youngest of four boys. He was brought up in Chateau-Arnoux-Saint-Auban and had a religious upbringing, aspiring to become a missionary. He had struggled with asthma and academic subjects at school, while excelling in drawing and painting.Peppiat, Michael & Jane A. Peterson, \\"Art Plural: Voices of Contemporary Art\\" Gatehouse, \\"Art Plural: Voices of Contemporary Art\\", Gatehouse; accessed 21 October 2017. With the support of a local artist; however, he became interested in painting and drawing at a young age. At age 11, discovering a book on Pierre-Auguste Renoir, he first understood that he might be able to forge a career out of his particular talent. After several attempts at gaining a formal education in the arts, he worked as a stage designer at the Nice Opera in 1959. In 1961, Venet joined the French Army whilst also starting to establish his style as an artist. During this period, he painted with tar, creating his art with his feet in a gestural style. This work eventually developed into black monochromatic paintings which eschewed all forms of action painting. Career 88.5 Arc x 8, 2012, Gibbs Farm, Kaipara Harbour, New Zealand After completing his military service, Venet returned to Nice, where he established his studio and continued to explore painting with tar, creating art with coal, and photography. His first sculpture, Coal Pile, has a restrained and minimal quality. =1960s= Subsequently, Venet became familiar with the work of Arman and some of the New Realists in Paris, such as César Baldaccini, Raymond Hains and Jacques Villeglé, and started sculpting with cardboard. He exhibited alongside New Realists and Pop artists' works in the Salon Comparaisons at the Paris Museum of Modern Art. In 1966, during a two-month visit to New York City, Venet was influenced by Minimalism, consequently incorporating this style into his art (cfr. Tubes). In 1967, Venet moved to New York and shared fellow artist Arman's studio, at 84 Walker Street (formerly Jean Tinguely's). =1970s= From 1971 to 1976, Venet did not create any art, entering a period of retrospection. He took up teaching Art and Art Theory at the Paris-Sorbonne University, and frequented lectures in England, Italy, Poland and Belgium. He resumed his artistic activity in 1976, exhibiting works at \\"Documenta VI\\" in Kassel in 1977. In 1979, he created a series of wood reliefs, entitling them Arcs, Angels, Diagonals. =1980s and 1990s= During the 1980s, Venet continued to develop his art along logical lines. He also composed, choreographed and imagined the costumes and designs for Jean-Louis Martinoty’s production of the ballet Graduation. In the 1990s, he created his Indeterminate Lines series and subsequently his Arcs, which have been exhibited at various locations, including Versailles and internationally. Recent years Venet’s work has become known internationally, with sculptures exhibited in Belgium, America, Japan, Austria, Switzerland, Germany and more recently New Zealand. Venet is represented by BlainSouthern. In 2005, Venet received the title of Chevalier de La Legion d’Honneur, France’s highest honour. In 2012, Venet was commissioned by Alan Gibbs, an art collector based in New Zealand; His newest and largest sculpture stands in the Gibbs Farm sculpture park. In 2012, luxury car maker Bugatti invited Venet to create a one-off artwork to be applied to a Veyron Grand Sport. The finished work, described as \\"the fastest artwork ever\\", was revealed at the Rubell Family Collection in Miami during Art Basel Miami Beach. In 2016, Venet was awarded the International Sculpture Center's Lifetime Achievement in Contemporary Sculpture Award. Works Two Indeterminate Lines is a 1993 steel sculpture by Bernar Venet, installed on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) campus, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States.

Although Gow Langsford Gallery is often associated with John Leech Gallery, which origins can be traced back to the mid-19th century, the former was created as a separate venture and with a different purpose in mind. Gow Langsford Gallery, Lorne Street, Auckland Past On 3 August 1855, John Leech ran an advertising in the Southern Cross newspaper which read as follows: :John Leech (late of the firm of Richardson and Leech opposite the Royal Hotel, George Street Sydney) Respectfully announces to the inhabitants of Auckland that he has commenced business in High-street, opposite the Wesleyan Chappel as Carver, Gilder, Picture-frame and Looking-glass Manufacturer. Having had considerable experience in the above-named branches, he is quite confident of giving the most perfect satisfaction to those who may favour him with an order. Picture-Frames and Looking glasses re-gilt and re-silvered. Gold Mouldings of every pattern made to order. Ladies Needlework handsomely framed. By 17 March 1860, an advertisement in The New Zealander says that John Leech had moved premises to ‘Opposite the Old Fellows’ Hall, Queen St. By 1866, the business was trading in Wellesley Street between Albert and Elliott Street. However, in October 1866, “Mr Leech was able to make a bold move up the hill to the “Golden Mile” of Shortland Street where he settled down with his family. The firm John Leech occupied these premises for more than eighty years. During this time in Shortland Street, the business displayed works in its window by artists such as Gustav von Tempsky, Alfred Sharpe, John Barr Clark Hoyte and Charles Frederick Goldie, to mention but a few well known 19th and early 20th century artists. John Leech died in 1879 where upon the business continued under his son Harold who was also known as John, until his death in 1945, aged 87. Allan Swinton joined the firm in 1946, and in 1959 bought the business. During this time, the business moved to new premises on Lorne St. The space was composed of two galleries: one for the display of reproductions and another for the display of original works. Around this period, artists such as Michael Smither, Jan Nigro, and Garth Tapper were among the many that joined the Gallery. On 24 October 1973, the New Zealand Herald ran a story written by T.J. McNamara \\"New home for gallery\\" reviewing the new gallery space: “The spacious new premises of the John Leech Gallery, in Albert St, were opened by the deputy mayor of Auckland, Dr R.H.L. Ferguson last night”… and so began another era of John Leech gallery at 106 Albert Street. A circuit of galleries developed in the area which Hamish Keith described in the New Zealand Herald on 24 October 1973: “The new John Leech Gallery is only a step away from the Lincoln Gallery, Barry Letts and New Vision, which turns the area into something close to Auckland’s own Bond Street.” Allan Swinton continued to run the business and eventually sold it to Mr Hooker in 1975. Although the shift in ownership had a negative impact on the business, the new joint venture between the art collectors, Murray and Bev Gow and a picture framer named Bill Hart in 1977, the gallery reverted to its original aim of exhibiting artists and offering framing services. As a result, the business began to flourish once again. By 1980, Murray Gow and Bill Hart bought the Dunham Gallery of Remuera and renamed it John Leech Gallery, Remuera. This business was managed by Latif Zwart and followed the city branch organisation of exhibiting artists as well as offering framing services. In 1986, Chase Corporation bought the building where John Leech was operating. Thus, when the lease on the Albert Street premises came to an end, the city branch gallery was consolidated to the Remuera site. By this stage John Gow, the son of Murray, had joined the company and Bill Hart no longer participated to the venture. The business continued to flourish under the Gow family. The dealing of the 19th and early 20th century art had a profound impact on the business and became a major economic resource for the gallery. During this period, works by artists such as Frances Hodgkins were purchased and sold on behalf of and via John Leech Gallery. John Leech Gallery was relocated in central Auckland opposite the Auckland Art Gallery, complementing Gow Langsford Gallery which is now situated in new premises on Lorne Street. The Remuera branch continues to offer framing services while the city branch moved on to be an online gallery in 2011. Present Gow Langsford Gallery celebrated their 30th anniversary in 2017. Founding Directors John Gow and Gary Langsford were both appointed Members of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2018 New Year Honours. Long serving Gallery Manager Anna Jackson became Director of the gallery in 2015.

He was a vigorous opponent of Robert I, King of Scotland during the First War of Scottish Independence, and was knighted by Edward I, King of England for his services to the English Crown. Dungal was a close associate of John MacDougall, Lord of Argyll, who he may have regarded as a kinsman. Dungal received grants of lands in England and Ireland after losing his own in Scotland. During his career, Dungal commanded Dumfries Castle and Rushen Castle, and is described by a contemporary record as \\"Captain of the army of Galloway\\". Dungal had a large family, and was succeeded by his son, Duncan. The MacDoualls Dungal was the head of the MacDouall family,Blakely (2009) p. 62; Oram (1992) p. 39. one of the most influential kindreds of Galloway.Blakely (2009) p. 62. The precise location of the MacDoualls' lands are uncertain, although they seem to have been in Wigtownshire, since the fourteenth-century Chronicle of Lanercost reports that Dungal's son, Duncan, raised forces in \\"beyond the Cree\\" in 1334.Daniels (2013) p. 92; Maxwell (1913) pp. 286–287; Stevenson (1839) p. 278. As part of the summer campaign of the English forces in 1303, Robert Bruce VII, Earl of Carrick was ordered to assemble one thousand men from Kyle, Cunningham, and Cumnock; and a further one thousand from Carrick and Galloway.Penman (2014) p. 74; McNamee (2012a) ch. 3 ¶ 68; Barrow (2005) p. 184; Oram (1992) p. 37; Bain (1884) p. 348 § 1356; Stevenson (1870) p. 178 § 438. Amongst the men whom Robert was working with were Gibbon MacCann, and Dungal himself, who were ordered to assemble two thousand men from Galloway.McNamee (2012a) ch. 3 ¶ 68; Blakely (2009) pp. 62, 67 n. 34; Barrow (2005) pp. 184–185; Oram (1992) pp. 36 n. 27, 37; Reid, RC (1958) pp. 52–53; Bain (1884) p. 268 § 1049; Stevenson (1870) p. 178 § 438. In 1306, Robert struck a claim for the Scottish throne. In the process he murdered John Comyn III, Lord of Badenoch,Strickland (2008) pp. 84, 97–98; Barrow (2005) pp. 181–183. and betrayed the patriotic cause of the dethroned and exiled King of Scotland, John Balliol, a man who had possessed a third of the former Lordship of Galloway.Blakely (2009) p. 65 n. 9. Like other native Gallovdian clans, such as the MacCanns and MacCullochs, the MacDoualls were natural opponents of the Bruce cause.Traquair (1998) p. 144. Although the MacDoualls and MacCullochs profited in their support of the English, these families came to suffer after Robert's 1306 rebellion, when he directed his energies against the people of Galloway.Oram (1992) p. 37. Nevertheless, families such as the MacDoualls and MacCanns continued to oppose Robert on behalf of his English counterparts, Edward I and Edward II.Penman (1999) p. 34. Victory against the Bruces illumination of Edward I on folio 9r of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson C 292.Statutes of England to 1320 (n.d.a). In January 1307, Dungal defeated a force of Bruce supporters who invaded Galloway, landing at Loch Ryan.Daniels (2013) p. 92; McNamee (2012a) ch. 5 ¶ 58; McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¶ 5; Brown (2008) p. 24; Strickland (2008) p. 101; Traquair (1998) pp. 144–145; Lydon (1992) p. 2; Oram (1992) p. 39. It is unknown if this strike was a mere maritime raid or the opening stage of a planned mainland campaign.Brown (2008) p. 24. One possibility is that the invading force was intended to divert attention from Robert's own landing.Barrow (2005) p. 220; Duffy (2002) p. 52. Another possibility is that the invading force was meant to annihilate the MacDoualls and MacCanns—if so, the attackers failed miserably.Barrow (2005) p. 220. According to the Chronicle of Lanercost, the invasion force consisted of eighteen ships, and was led by Thomas Bruce, Alexander Bruce, Reginald Crawford, an unidentified Lord of Kintyre, and an unidentified Irish kinglet. This source reports that Dungal—described as \\"a chief among the Gallovidians\\"—defeated the invaders, who are stated to have landed on 9 February. The chronicle further relates that Dungal had the Lord of Kintyre and the Irish kinglet beheaded, and sent their heads to Edward I at Lanercost. Thomas, Alexander, and Reginald, are similarly stated to have been sent to the king.Penman (2014) pp. 104–105; Caldwell (2012) pp. 284–285; McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¶ 5; Brown (2008) p. 24; Scott (2009) ch. 8 ¶ 53; Duncan (2007) p. 152 n. 36–38; Barrow (2005) pp. 218–219; Strickland (2008) p. 101; Ingamells (1992) p. 53; Oram (1992) p. 39; Shead; Stevenson; Watt et al (1991) p. 434 n. 34; Reid, NH (1984) p. 294; Maxwell (1913) pp. 179–180; Mackenzie (1909) p. 402 n. 36; Chronicon Domini Walteri de Hemingburgh (1849) p. 252 n. 1; Stevenson (1839) p. 205. According to the fourteenth-century Guisborough Chronicle, the invaders had been \\"surprised by night\\".Reid, NH (1984) pp. 294, 337 nn. 49–50; Chronicon Domini Walteri de Hemingburgh (1849) p. 252. The continuation of the Paris version of Flores historiarum gives a similar account of Dungal's actions, likewise naming his opponents as Thomas, Alexander, and Reginald, but differs by assigning the name Malcolm Makaill to the Lord of Kintyre, and notes two Irish chieftains.Caldwell (2012) pp. 284–285; Strickland (2008) p. 101; Ingamells (1992) p. 53; Luard (1890) p. 136; Yonge (1853) pp. 594–595 ch. 27. The fourteenth-century Gesta Annalia II merely relates that Thomas and Alexander were captured at Loch Ryan, and later beheaded at Carlisle.Duncan (2007) p. 152 n. 36–38; Skene (1872) p. 335 ch. 120; Skene (1871) p. 342 ch. 120. The Chronicle of Lanercost states that Thomas, Alexander, and Reginald were executed at Carlisle on 17 February.Penman (2014) p. 105; Scott (2009) ch. 8 ¶ 53; Taggart (2004) pp. 95–96; Shead; Stevenson; Watt et al (1991) p. 434 n. 34; Maxwell (1913) pp. 179–180, 180 n. 1; Chronicon Domini Walteri de Hemingburgh (1849) p. 252 n. 2; Stevenson (1839) p. 205. As a result of his services to the English Crown, the same source further reports that Dungal was knighted by Edward at Carlisle on Easter Day, 26 March 1307.McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¶ 5; Strickland (2008) p. 101 n. 102; Oram (1992) p. 39; Maxwell (1913) pp. 181–182; Stevenson (1839) p. 207. Dungal is elsewhere recorded to have been rewarded with £40 on 3 February 1307 for the taking of Thomas, Alexander, and Reginald.Penman (2014) p. 105; McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¶ 5; Brown (2008) p. 47 n. 5; Duncan (2007) p. 152 n. 36–38; Ingamells (1992) p. 53; Lydon (1992) p. 2; Oram (1992) p. 39; Shead; Stevenson; Watt et al (1991) pp. 433–434 n. 33; Reid, NH (1984) p. 294; Paul (1908) p. 490; Mackenzie (1909) p. 402 n. 36; Bain (1884) p. 509 § 1915; Document 5/3/0 (n.d.a); Simpson; Galbraith (n.d.) p. 216 § 492 (xvi). Edward I is also recorded to have awarded Dungal with a grant of the forfeited lands of Brice Blair, the office of coroner of Ayr, and the lands of the Mark that had been previously held by Robert Boyd.Oram (1992) p. 39; Reid, RC (1958) p. 53; Palgrave (1837) pp. 318–319 § 143. Robert I.Birch (1905) p. 135 pl. 20. Edward I's remorseless executions of Robert's supporters may be explained by the latter's murder of John Comyn, an act the English king regarded as sacriligous.Strickland (2008) pp. 97–104; Calendar of the Patent Rolls (1898) p. 436; Bain (1884) pp. 473 § 1757, 477 § 1776. Although chivalrous compassion became fashionable in England in the twelfth century,Gillingham (2004) p. 114. and spread into Scotland and Wales by the thirteenth century, there was no comparable political transformation in Gaelic Ireland.Gillingham (2004) p. 128. The Bruces' connections with the Gaelic world may have enabled the English Crown to treat adherents of the Bruces as if they were Irish.Strickland (2008) p. 101, 101 n. 102; Gillingham (2004) p. 132. Such a possibility may be exemplified by the battlefield executions doled out by Dungal.Strickland (2008) p. 101, 101 n. 102. In March 1306/1307, on account of his success campaigning in support of the English, Dungal successfully petitioned Edward I to grant his like-named younger brother the marriage of the daughter and heir of Hugh Chaumpaigne.Oram (1992) p. 39; Reid, RC (1958) p. 53; Bain (1884) pp. 506–507 § 1905. The same month, Dungal is recorded to have successfully requested a pardon for Elias Vaux, for the latter's part in the killing of Nicholas, son of Robert Goyt.Reid, RC (1958) p. 53; Calendar of the Patent Rolls (1898) p. 508; Bain (1884) p. 510 § 1919. Further defence of Galloway A fourteenth-century illumination of Edward II on folio 105r of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson C 292.Statutes of England to 1320 (n.d.b). Dungal's actions in support of the English may exemplify the Gallovidians stance against the Bruce cause. As a result of this opposition, Robert oversaw a campaign against the Gallovidians, commanded by his brother, Edward, who was later made Lord of Galloway. This operation appears to have been unleashed after the death of Edward I in July, and after the succeeding Edward II concluded a campaign of his own late in August, returning to Carlisle on 1 September.McNamee (2012a) ch. 5 ¶ 129; Duncan (2007) p. 268 n. 239–351. The Bruce campaign is partly evidenced by an English order, dated 25 September, commanding that refugee Gallovidians be allowed to feed their flocks in Inglewood Forest.McNamee (2012a) ch. 5 ¶ 129; Blakely (2009) p. 62; Scott (2009) ch. 10 ¶ 16; Duncan (2007) p. 268 n. 239–351; Barrow (2005) p. 224; Traquair (1998) p. 151; Reid, NH (1984) p. 299; Calendar of the Close Rolls (1892) p. 2; Bain (1887) p. 3 § 14. Five days later, Edward II ordered John, Earl of Richmond to quash the Bruce campaign in Galloway, since several English supporters—namely John St John, Dungal, and Donald MacCann—had alerted the English Crown of the dire situation in the region.Scott (2009) ch. 10 ¶ 16; Duncan (2007) p. 268 n. 239–351; Traquair (1998) p. 151; Shead; Stevenson; Watt et al (1991) p. 445 n. 54; Reid, NH (1984) pp. 299, 338 n. 76; Reid, RC (1958) p. 53; Bain (1887) p. 3 § 15; Palgrave (1830) p. 370; Rymer; Sanderson (1818) p. 8; Document 1/28/0 (n.d.). Midway through 1308, Edward Bruce overran Galloway, and in the process probably drove Dungal and his family out of Scotland.Scott (2009) ch. 10 ¶ 47; Barrow (2005) pp. 234–235, 469 n. 81; Reid, NH (1984) p. 308. This campaign seems to be reported by the Chronicle of Lanercost,Young (2018) p. 125; Caldwell (2012) p. 285; McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¶¶ 18–20; Duncan (2007) p. 344 n. 479; Barrow (2005) pp. 234–235, 469 n. 81; Traquair (1998) p. 155; Reid, NH (1984) pp. 308, 342 n. 121; Maxwell (1913) p. 188; Stevenson (1839) p. 212.

The final clash in this Gallovidian campaign may have been fought near Buittle, on the banks of the River Dee, rather than the Cree as claimed by the Bruce.Barrow (2005) pp. 235, 469 n. 82. Specifically, Gesta Annalia II relates that a certain 'Donald of the Isles' led a host of Gallovidians to the River Dee, where they were defeated by Edward Bruce, and the leader was himself captured.Young (2018) p. 125, 125 n. 91; Caldwell (2012) p. 285 n. 103; McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¶ 20; Shead; Stevenson; Watt et al (1991) p. 444 n. 54; Reid, NH (1984) pp. 308, 342 n. 121; Lamont (1981) pp. 165–166; Skene (1872) p. 337 ch. 125; Skene (1871) p. 345 ch. 125. Whilst it is possible that the defeated man mentioned by this source might refer to Donald of Islay, an apparent member of Clan Donald,Reid, NH (1984) pp. 308, 342 n. 121; Lamont (1981) pp. 165–166. another possibility is that it instead refers to Dungal himself.Lamont (1981) pp. 165–166. A later account of the battle, preserved by the fifteenth-century Scotichronicon,Young (2018) p. 125 n. 91; Penman (2014) p. 107; Duncan (2007) pp. 344, 344–345 n. 479; Murray (2002) p. 229 n. 35; Shead; Stevenson; Watt et al (1991) pp. 344–345, 444–445 n. 54; Goodall (1759) p. 242 bk. 12 ch. 17. confusingly identifies 'Donald of the Isles' as leader of the Gallovidian forces, but then includes a verse about the clash in which a 'Donald of Islay' is identified as an ally of Edward Bruce.Duncan (2007) p. 344 n. 479; Shead; Stevenson; Watt et al (1991) pp. 344–345, 444–445 n. 54; Goodall (1759) p. 242 bk. 12 ch. 17. As such, there is reason to suspect that the Bruce-aligned 'Donald' mentioned by this source is identical to Donald of Islay,Young (2018) p. 125 n. 91; Penman (2014) p. 107; Caldwell (2012) p. 285, 285 n. 103; McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¶ 20; Murray (2002) p. 229 n. 35; Shead; Stevenson; Watt et al (1991) pp. 444–445 n. 54. and that the Gallovidian-aligned 'Donald' is identical to Donald MacCann, a Gallovidian who consistently supported the English against the Bruces, and who disappears from record at about this point in history.Young (2018) p. 125 n. 91; Penman (2014) p. 107; Caldwell (2012) p. 285, 285 n. 103; McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¶ 20; Oram (1992) p. 40; Shead; Stevenson; Watt et al (1991) p. 444–445 n. 54. The account of Edward Bruce's campaigning against the Gallovidians, given by the Chronicle of Lanercost, states that his forces were partly composed of men from the Isles.McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¶ 19; Barrow (2005) p. 469 n. 81; Lamont (1981) pp. 165–166; Maxwell (1913) p. 188; Stevenson (1839) p. 212. The evidence of Donald of Islay in league with pro- Bruce forces could indicate that Gesta Annalia II was erroneous in placing him and the Islesmen against Edward Bruce's forces.Reid, NH (1984) p. 342 n. 121. One possibility is that the account given by Chronicle of Lanercost influenced Gesta Annalia II in its identification of Edward Bruce's foe as from the Isles. Ejection, territorial grants, constabularies and shrievalties Having been forced from Scotland, Dungal received an order of protection from the English Crown in August 1308, presumably in the context of an attempt to regain his lands. Nevertheless, Dungal's venture appears to have been unsuccessful,Reid, NH (1984) pp. 308, 342 n. 123; Rotuli Scotiæ in Turri Londinensi (1814) p. 56. and months later he was granted an English manor in compensation. Specifically, in April 1309, Dungal received a royal grant of the Yorkshire manor of Temple-Cowton to sustain himself and his family.Lord (2013) p. 199; McNamee (2012a) ch. 6 ¶ 38; McNamee (2012b) ch. 5 ¶ 61; Scott (2009) ch. 10 ¶ 47; Thornton (1998) p. 4; Oram (1992) p. 40; Reid, NH (1984) pp. 308, 342 n. 123; Reid, RC (1958) p. 54; Murison (1899) p. 77; Bain (1887) p. 17 §§ 83–84. The record of his grant is the first time that Dungal is attested as a knight. It was probably an English elevation. Certainly, Dungal is stated to have been \\"hated by the enemy\\" for his actions in Scotland.McNamee (2012b) ch. 5 ¶ 61; Reid, RC (1958) p. 54; Bain (1887) p. 17 §§ 83–84. Prior to 1308, the manor was a possession of the Knights Templar.Lord (2013) pp. 25, 93, 105, 110–111, 114, 199; Page (1914). On 8 February 1311/1312, the manor—then recently taken into royal possession—was ordered by the king to be delivered into the hands of Dungal's wife, Matilda, until Dungal was able to receive it himself.Reid, RC (1958) p. 54; Page (1914); Calendar of the Close Rolls (1892) p. 399; Bain (1887) p. 49 § 241. Whilst serving the king in 1310/1311, Dungal was made constable of Dumfries Castle,Penman (2014) pp. 130–131; Scott (2009) ch. 10 ¶ 47; Barrow (1976) p. 166; Reid, RC (1958) p. 54; Bain (1887) p. 48 § 235; Document 5/3/0 (n.d.b). and as such served as Sheriff of Dumfries.Reid, RC (1958) p. 54; Murison (1899) p. 77. On 7 February 1312, Dungal was compelled to surrender the castle to Robert's forces. Despite his part in the capture and later execution of the Scottish king's brothers two years earlier, Dungal was allowed to go into exile after giving up the castle.Penman (2014) pp. 130–131; Scott (2009) ch. 12 ¶ 35; Brown (2008) p. 46; Barrow (2005) p. 251; Barrow (1976) p. 166; Reid, RC (1958) p. 54; Murison (1899) p. 77; Bain (1887) p. 60 § 304; Document 0/0/0 (n.d.). The fall of Dumfries took place in the context of Robert's push to seize several castles in south-western Scotland that were still holding out against him. Of these, Dumfries and Caerlaverock were probably the strongest.Barrow (2005) pp. 250–251; Bain (1887) p. 55 § 279. The army that forced the surrender of the besieged Dumfries garrison was probably commanded by Edward Bruce and James Douglas.Penman (2014) pp. 130–131. In correspondence dating to 29 May, Edward II commanded that Dumfries Castle be fortified.Reid, RC (1958) p. 54; Bain (1887) p. 54 § 274. In July, Dungal's brother, Fergus, is recorded to have to have been engaged in supplying the castle with munitions.Taggart (2004) p. 127; Barrow (1976) p. 166; Reid, RC (1958) p. 54; Bain (1887) p. 55 § 278; Document 5/3/0 (n.d.c). Later that month, Dungal acknowledged the receipt of certain supplies, although afterwards in August he is reported to have complained to the English Crown that a lack of supplies expected from Carlisle had contributed to the desertion of many of his men.Scott (2009) ch. 10 ¶ 47; Barrow (1976) p. 166; Reid, RC (1958) p. 54; Bain (1887) pp. 55–56 § 281; PoMS, H4/27/0 (n.d.). Castle Rushen. Dungal commanded the castle against the invading forces of Robert I. At some point after his expulsion from Dumfries, Dungal was stationed on the Isle of Man, as the thirteenth- to fourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann reports that the Scottish king led an invasion of this island on 18 May, making landfall at Ramsey with a massed fleet, and besieged Castle Rushen until Dungal was forced to surrender it on 12 June.Penman (2014) p. 132; McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¶ 53; Brown (2008) p. 46; Barrow (2005) pp. 252–253; Thornton (1998) p. 4; McDonald (1997) p. 197; Oram (1992) p. 40; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 110–111; Stevenson (1858) p. 404. Dungal was probably appointed as commander of the castle at some point after an apparent coup by Simon de Montagu.Barrow (2005) p. 252; Bain (1887) p. 60 § 307. The confusion caused by this revolt may have been seized upon by Robert,McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¶ 53. who probably launched his maritime invasion from the Solway Firth.Oram (1992) p. 40. Following his expulsion from Rushen, Dungal appears to have gone to Ireland.McNamee (2012a) ch. 7 ¶ 24; McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¶ 53. The chartulary of St Mary's Abbey, Dublin reports that Robert sent fleets to assail the Irish on the last day of May. Although the Ulstermen are said to have fended off king's raiding fleets, the chartulary reports that he was able to land in Ireland on account of the Earl of Ulster, with whom he obtained a truce.Penman (2014) p. 132; McNamee (2012a) ch. 7 ¶ 24; McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¶ 53; Gilbert (1884) p. 342. The record of Robert setting off for Ireland may be significant in that he appears to have pursued a feud with Dungal from the castles of Dumfries and Rushen to Ireland. Although in comparison to his English counterpart Edward I, Robert appears to have shown remarkable personal restraint towards prisoners of war—particularly in the case of Dungal himself—there is reason to suspect that Edward Bruce's Gallovidian campaign of 1308 was prosecuted in the context of a bitter feud with the MacDoualls.Strickland (2008) pp. 111–112, 112 n. 170. Later history In July 1314, Dungal was sent from Carlisle by Andrew Harclay to warn Edward II at York of an impending attack by Robert upon Carlisle.Traquair (1998) p. 208; Reid, RC (1958) p. 54; Bain (1887) p. 70 § 369. In August 1316, Matilda is recorded to have received a gift of £10 from Edward II, and Dungal himself is stated to have been entitled to a yearly sum of £20.Reid, RC (1958) p. 55; Bain (1887) p. 96 § 504. At some point, Dungal is recorded to have been ordered by the English Crown to serve in Ireland, and to have petitioned the king for specific lands in Ireland—those of Leixlip—until he could recover his lands in Scotland.Duffy (2002) p. 62; List of Diplomatic Documents (1963) p. 213; Reid, RC (1958) p. 55; Bain (1887) p. 157 § 857. In February 1326/1327, Edward III, King of England is recorded to have remitted the balance of the £10 Dungal was owed annually for the ward of the former lands of Henry Malton in York and Cumberland.Reid, RC (1958) p. 55; Bain (1887) p. 165 § 910. In 1319/1320, Dungal was granted a £20 annuity for services rendered to the English Crown.Penman (2014) pp. 203, 379 n. 118, 382 n. 59; Penman (1999) p. 39 n. 38; Bain (1887) p. 133 § 701. A petition of Dungal's son and heir, Duncan MacDouall, dating to 1347, relates that Dungal lost £100 worth of Scottish lands supporting the cause of Edward I and Edward II. This source further reveals that a brother of Dungal was slain during the war—on account of the brothers' part in the capture and execution of Robert's brothers—and that Dungal's eldest son was slain, supporting the English cause, at the Battle of Bannockburn. Duncan's petition relates that his father received an annual sum of £20, and that at present, Duncan and Dungal's six other sons were deprived of support. As a result, Duncan requested that his father's pension be continued. Duncan's petition was endorsed: \\"It seems to the Council it would be charitable to do some favour to them\\".Brown (2008) p. 130; List of Diplomatic Documents (1963) p. 217; Reid, RC (1958) p. 57; Murison (1899) p. 77; Bain (1887) p. 278 § 1522. The names of Dungal's other sons are unknown. One possibility is that one was the Thomas MacDouall whose wife, Johanna, is reported to have been abducted at Carlisle in 1308, along with Thomas' goods and chattels.Reid, RC (1958) p. 57; Bain (1887) p. 7 § 36. Dungal was closely associated with John MacDougall. For example, in July 1310, Dungal is recorded to have received 100 merks from John for his service to the English.Thornton (1998) p. 4; Reid, RC (1958) p. 54; Bain (1887) p. 29 § 157. Later, in 1315/1316, John, Dungal, and Duncan MacGodfrey are recorded to have received wages and supplies from the English for their services against the Scottish Crown in the Irish Sea region.Penman (2014) p. 372 n. 95; McNamee (2012b) ch. 5 ¶ 61; Reid, RC (1958) pp. 54–55; Bain (1887) p. 92 § 479. Both Dungal and Duncan MacGodfrey are recorded amongst the garrison of Carlisle after the fall of Edward Bruce in 1318.McNamee (2012b) ch. 5 ¶ 61. It is possible that the activities of the MacDougalls and MacDoualls in the Irish Sea region partly spurned on the Bruce campaign in Ireland.Penman (2014) p. 165. It is possible that Dungal regarded John MacDougall as a kinsman.Barrow (2005) p. 472 n. 30; Simpson; Galbraith (n.d.) pp. 230–231 § 562; Document 5/3/0 (n.d.d). John died in September 1317, and Dungal supervised his funeral.Barrow (2005) p. 472 n. 30. Dungal acted as the latter's executor, and in March 1326/1327, Dungal is recorded to have petitioned Edward III for the balance of John's annual pension of 200 merks in order to pay off the John's outstanding debts.Reid, RC (1958) p. 55; Bain (1887) p. 166 § 912. Dungal himself was dead by January 1327/1328,Barrow (2005) p. 253; Oram (1992) p. 42; Reid, RC (1958) p. 55. when his widow—identified as Margaret—was confirmed the ward of Henry Malton's former lands that had been granted to Dungal.Oram (1992) p. 42; Reid, RC (1958) p. 55; Bain (1887) p. 171 § 944. Later in February, Edward III is recorded to have freed Dungal's executors from the demand of debts upon these lands, on account of Dungal's faithful service.Reid, RC (1958) p. 55; Bain (1887) p. 171 § 946. Dungal was succeeded by his son, Duncan.Reid, RC (1958) p. 55. Margaret was dead by January 1333/1334.Reid, RC (1958) p. 55; Bain (1887) p. 200 § 1106.

Biography = Early life = She was born on May 16, 1965 in Mexico City, Mexico. Since childhood, Bogue claims to have defined her female identity. She was raised by her mother and grandmother and attended a boys' school in Mexico City. It was precisely during the performance of a school play, that Alejandra was able to interpret a female character for the first time, which affirmed her artistic vocation and gender identity. In the late 1970's, Bogue participated in a beauty contest called Youth Values of Crossdressing, organized by the famous Mexican drag queen known as La Xóchitl, obtaining first place. At that time, Bogue met Naná, a transgender model, who served as her mentor and integrated her into the world of Mexican sexual diversity. It was in 1984, when Bogue became Alejandra definitively. Bogue started working on a transvestite show at the L'Barón bar, located in the south of Mexico City. It was at the Flamingos nightclub where Bogue began a career as a Female impersonator. She suffered numerous arrests by the police, spending nights in prison, abuse, sexual violence, and various beatings due to transphobia and homophobia. In 1985, Bogue moved to Acapulco where she was part of the transvestite show that was performed at the Gallery nightclub. There she made imitations of figures such as Annie Lennox, Nina Hagen and Madonna. In 1988, she returned to Mexico City, joining the Kitsch Company, a theater company that presented cabaret shows in the famous nightclub known as El Nueve, located in the Zona Rosa of Mexico City. At that time, Bogue also worked as a model, posing for the lens of many photographers. In that facet of her career, Bogue came to appear in Mexican versions of magazines such as Vogue and Elle. = Career = In 1990, while Bogue worked as the hostess of the Bugambilia nightclub in Mexico City, the photographer Adolfo Pérez Butrón recommended her with the American photographer Joel-Peter Witkin. Bogue is invited to pose for Witkin's lens. The photograph was titled Man with a Dog. In 1992, Bogue poses for the second time for Witkin's lens in photography Three Kinds of Woman. In 1990, Bogue debuted in the theater with Bertolt Brecht's Baal, directed by José Luis Cruz. Bogue went fully into the theater for the rest of the 1990s. In 1992, Bogue collaborated as a costume designer in Jaime Humberto Hermosillo's film La tarea prohibida. Between 1994 and 1997 she was part of the theater group La Fábrica, directed by Rosario Armenta. In 1996, she acted with a small role in the film El amor de tu vida SA, by the filmmaker Leticia Venzor. In 1997 she performed in the play Cuando la higuera reverdezca by Fabiola Díaz de León, under the direction of Darío T. Pie, at the Teatro Silvia Pinal. In 1998 she was part of one of the productions of The Maids, by Jean Genet, under the direction of Adriana Roel, together with the actresses Patricia Reyes Spíndola and Pilar Pellicer and represented in the Foro Stanistablas theater. Thanks to her participation in this montage, Bogue obtained the award as Female Revelation from the AMCT (Mexican Association of Theater Critics). In 1999 she starred in the play Dos Gardenias, by Fernanda Villeli, directed by Patricia Reyes Spíndola. In the 1990s, Bogue also entered the world of performance accompanying musician DJ Chrysler. She participated with Chrysler in the performance 15'000 volts, and participated in a performance accompanying Chrysler at the opening act of a David Bowie concert in Mexico City in 1997. In 2000, Bogue performed in a performance at a concert by the Chilean rock group La Ley in Mexico City. Between 2000 and 2002, Bogue participated in a cabaret and drag queen show called El show de las Hermanas Vampiro. It was in 2001 that Bogue met Mexican television host and journalist Horacio Villalobos. In 2001, Bogue began to collaborate with Villalobos in his television show Válvula de escape on the music channel Telehit, owned by the Televisa network. In that same year, she appeared on the film Seres humanos, by Jorge Aguilera. In 2002, Bogue performed in the children's play. In that same year, Bogue performed a small role in the film Frida, a Hollywood production, directed by Julie Taymor and starring Salma Hayek. In 2002, Bogue was integrated into Desde Gayola, a comic TV show created by Villalobos. In this show, Bogue gained great popularity by playing the characters of La Tesorito (a parody of the Mexican actress and singer Laura León), Tearruina Fernández (parody of the Mexican television host Talina Fernández), and Sonia Infame (parody of the Mexican actress Sonia Infante), among others. In parallel, Bogue held the position of Costume Coordinator for Telehit. Desde Gayola also toured the country with theatrical and cabaret shows. Bogue participated in Desde Gayola: El Show, between 2003 and 2004, and Érase una vez...Desde Gayola, between 2005 and 2006. Bogue also acted in two chapters of the TV series Mujer, Casos de la Vida Real, produced by Silvia Pinal for Televisa (2002 and 2004). Parallel to her work on television, in 2003 Bogue acted in the comic film Sin ton ni Sonia, by Carlos Sama. In early 2006, Bogue left Desde Gayola, due to personal and work differences with Villalobos. Desde Gayola finally went off the air through Telehit in August of the same year. After ending her relationship with the TH show, Bogue stopped playing her characters, who became emblems of the series. Currently, comments from the public point out that the Bogue characters were the best that the television show had. At the end of 2006, Bogue joined the TV show Guau!, a magazine television show produced and broadcast by Telehit and focused on issues of the LGBT community. In that same year, Bogue returned to the theater with the cabaret show No soy Madonna, pero soy La Bogue, a sort of biographical monologue to the rhythm of Madonna's greatest musical successes. In 2008, Bogue obtained the opportunity to present her first television show: Que show con La Bogue!, through the Telehit signal. Bogue served as producer and creator of the show. In this program, Bogue sang, danced, made imitations, conducted interviews and presented comic skits. Among the characters that Bogue created for her sketches are Betty BO5 (representation of an actress in decline, with problems of alcoholism and drug addiction); Wendy Citlally (makeup artist and stylist, whose bibles are the yellowish magazines), Matalina Vil (parody of the character Catalina Creel from the Mexican soap opera Cuna de lobos), and La Madrota (portrait of an alcoholic and decadent prostitute). The show was aired for three years. In 2009, Bogue served as the host of the Latin American broadcast of the British reality show Sky 1 There's Something About Miriam, broadcast on Telehit. In 2010, Bogue was selected to be part of the Mexican theatrical version of the film Todo sobre mi madre by Pedro Almodóvar, with the character of La Agrado (played in the film by Spanish actress Antonia San Juan).

It returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post voting system. Vacancy Silvester Horne had been one of the Liberal MPs for the dual member seat of Ipswich since the January 1910 elections. In 1914, returning from New York, he was taken ill suddenly and died. Previous result Horne In terms of a purely party vote, the votes cast for the party ticket were as follows; Candidates Masterman * 41-year- old Charles Masterman was chosen as the Liberal candidate. In 1914 he was appointed to the Cabinet as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. However under the law at the time, any MP nominated as minister was legally required to recontest their seat in a by-election. Masterman lost his own seat at Bethnal Green, though this was not uncommon, and sought a return to parliament here. * 32-year-old London Barrister John Ganzoni was chosen by the Unionists as their candidate. He had been in place long enough to effectively nurse the constituency. He claimed to have had a haircut in every Barber's Shop in Ipswich.Eastern Daily Press, 18 May 1914 * 38-year-old Australian John Scurr stood as a Socialist candidate. In 1913 he was a Socialist candidate at the Chesterfield by-election. He had also stood as Socialist candidate against Masterman at Bethnal Green. Scurr was Chairman of the London District Committee of the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union. Masterman had personal misgiving about contesting Ipswich; \\"It was an area of small employers, hostile to Insurance. It was a very Protestant area, reluctant about Home Rule. The local Liberals were enthusiastic and pressed hard for him to come, and Mr. Illingworth (Liberal Chief Whip) did not see how to refuse them.\\"C. F. G. Masterman by Lucy Masterman Campaign The campaign was dominated by the National Insurance Act introduced by Masterman in 1911. Both the Unionist and Socialist candidates attacked the Act. On 22 May 1914 David Lloyd George a close ally of Masterman, visited the constituency to speak for the Liberal campaign. He attacked the Unionists for their behaviour over Ulster which he considered a threat to constitutional government. Unionists had given support to a possible call to arms to resist the introduction of the Liberals Irish Home Rule Bill. He also emphasised the benefits of National Insurance and Old Age Pensions.Lloyd George, Liberalism and the Land: The Land Issue and Party Politics in England 1906-14 by Ian Packer Result This was the last contested by-election to take place before the outbreak of the Great War, after which the main political parties agreed an electoral truce.

At the 1918 elections he unsuccessfully fought West Ham Stratford. A general election was due to take place by the end of 1915. By the autumn of 1914, the following candidates had been adopted to contest that election. Due to the outbreak of war, the election never took place.

Hearing about the growing Oregon wine industry and the work of pioneering winemakers making Pinot noir, the Casteel brothers and their wives sold their houses in Seattle, Washington and purchased land that was slated to become a trailer park in the Eola Hills northwest of the city of Salem, Oregon. The land was deemed \\"not suitable for farming,\\" but the Casteels found the south-facing slope with good exposure and shallow, well-drained soils to be ideal for viticulture, so they purchased the land and planted of Pinot noir vines in 1977.Nick Passmore \\"The Heights of Oregon Pinot noir \\" Business Week Magazine September 16th, 2010 The Casteels named the area Bethel Heights after the unincorporated area of Bethel, Polk County, Oregon where the estate is located.Bethel Heights \\"Our History \\" Accessed: May 3rd, 2012 Over the years, the Casteels expanded and planted more acres to Pinot noir and other varieties such as Chardonnay and Pinot blanc. In 1984, a winery was built on the estate and they began producing wine under the Bethel Heights label with Terry Casteel taking over the main winemaking duties. By 1992, the winery operation had grown enough that the vineyard stopped selling fruit to other wineries and began using all of the estate grapes for the Bethel Heights label. Many of Ted and Terry Casteel's children have followed in their parents' footsteps and are working in the winery. In 2007, Terry and Marilyn's son Ben Casteel took over head winemaking duties, as Terry's sense of smell declined due to the advancement of Parkinson. Ted and Pat's daughter Mimi was the general manager and viticulturist until 2016, when she left Bethel Heights to focus on her own vineyard, Hope Well. Today, the winery is still owned by members of the Casteel-Dudley-Webb families. Vineyards Bethel Heights Vineyard is a site located on the west slope of the Eola Hills just northwest of Salem in the shadow of Mount Jefferson. The grapevines are planted on south facing slopes at elevations between 480–620 feet above sea level. The estate has a diverse soil profile with soils at the 300 feet elevation being among some of the oldest soils in the Willamette Valley including sandstone and marine sediment that was laid over 35 million years ago when what is today Oregon was still part of the Pacific Ocean. At 500 feet elevation, the soil is much younger with red clay and volcanic soils from previous eruptions in the Cascade Range.Bethel Heights Vineyard \\"Soil into Wine: in the trenches at Oregon Pinot Camp\\" July 21st, 2010 One of the Bethel Heights estate vineyards and the Eola- Amity Hills AVA as scene from the tasting room. As of 2008, Bethel Heights had planted with dedicated exclusively to Pinot noir that is partitioned into individual blocks. These include: *West Block - planted with UC-Davis (UCD) Pinot noir clone 2A and 23 that planted on its own (non-grafted) rootstock in 1977 *Flat, South and Southeast Blocks - planted with UCD 4 on its own rootstock in 1979 *Shed Block - of Dijon Pinot noir clone 777 grafted onto 20 yr old Chardonnay rootstock in 2000. *Additional plantings include planted with Dijon 114 and 115 on grafted rootstock in 1994 and 1996 and 6.5 acres planted with UCD 4, Dijon 115 and 777 in 2002. In 1999, Bethel Heights acquired the land just south of the main estate vineyard and began planting 20 acres of what is now known as Justice Vineyard. While considered an estate vineyard, some fruit from Justice is sold to other wineries. In addition to Pinot noir, Bethel Heights grows on their own estate Chardonnay from Wente and Dijon 76 clones as well as Pinot blanc and Pinot gris. Bethel Heights first started as a vineyard selling its grape to other winemakers and soon got a reputation for the high quality of their Pinot noirs. In 1983, California wine producer Randall Grahm of Bonny Doon Vineyard even purchased grapes from Bethel Heights to produce an Oregon style Pinot noir that wine critic Anthony Dias Blue reviewed favorably.Anthony Dias Blue \\"New Wines Hit Market In A Veritable Deluge\\" The Evening Independent May 15th, 1985 As the winery operation grew, Bethel Heights stopped selling its estate fruit to other wineries in 1992 and in by 1995 they were sourcing grapes (including Riesling, Pinot gris, Grüner Veltliner, and Gewürztraminer) from several well-known and well-respected vineyards throughout the Willamette Valley. These include: *Seven Springs Vineyard - located on the eastern ridge of the Hills near Salem *Elton Vineyard - located on the eastern slope of the Eola Hills west of Hopewell, Oregon *Freedom Hill Vineyard - located northwest of the town of Monmouth, Oregon in the foothills of the Pacific Coast Range *Nysa Vineyard - located in the Dundee Hills AVA *Jessie James Vineyard - located on Walnut Hill near Amity, Oregon A Grüner Veltliner made by Bethel Heights With several vineyards and designated blocks, Bethel Heights has adopted the Burgundian practice of producing several different bottlings of Pinot noirs from the individual blocks and vineyards. Terry Casteel noted to Wine Spectator that they do this because the grapes from the different blocks \\"...have distinct personalities, and they're complete wines.\\" Casteel also notes that the reputation of a vineyard is enhanced by vineyard designated wine more than they would be going into a wine with a more generic Oregon wine or Willamette Valley wine label.Harvey Steiman \\"Oregon's Burgundian Knot\\" The Wine Spectator June 19, 2002 =Sustainability= The winery has earned a reputation in the Oregon wine industry as a pioneer in \\"sensible and sustainable\\" viticulture with co-founder and vineyard manager Ted Casteel leading the efforts to create the Low Input Viticulture and Enology (LIVE) certification program. At the vineyard, Casteel and his daughter and viticulturist Mimi Casteel utilize elements of both organic and biodynamic viticulture practices that minimizes the use of synthetic chemicals in the vineyard. This includes using sulfur sprays (similar to the Bordeaux mixture) until post-bloom. Later in the season they do use some synthetic products for reliability and to lessen the overall environmental impact of fuel, emission and labor cost that repeated organic spraying would require. In 1997, Bethel Heights was one of the first vineyards in Oregon to be certified Salmon-Safe and they are a member of the Oregon Certified Sustainable Wine (OCSW) with their wines carrying the OCSW logo since 2008. Under this criteria Bethel Heights commits itself to producing wine that is \\"... made using environmentally responsible agricultural practices and responsible winemaking practices, and those are verified by an independent, third-party certifying agency.\\" In 2007, they were among the first Oregon wineries to join the Oregon Global Warming Commission and pledged to go carbon neutral by 2010.

It is found along north-eastern Atlantic coastlines. This is a red sponge which forms thin, smooth encrusting patches, up to 5 cm across, with regularly spaced oscula. Description Ophlitaspongia papilla forms small encrusting patches seldom more than across on boulders and rocks. It is very thin and flat with a smooth shiny surface. The oscula are well-defined and regularly distributed, each having a small collar with a slightly raised edge. The colour of this sponge is blood red. Distribution and habitat Ophlitaspongia papilla occurs in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, its range extending from the British Isles to the Canary Islands, the Azores and Madeira. It is also known from New Zealand waters. It normally occupies a zone between the average high water mark of neap tides and below the average level low water of spring tides. It is occasionally found at slightly greater depths encrusting the shells of bivalve molluscs such as Chlamys opercularis. It tends to be found in areas with high water movement, either from currents or the action of waves, and is usually found under overhangs, on vertical walls, in crevices or on ledges. Life cycle Larvae are liberated by Ophlitaspongia papilla over a period of about a month in late summer. These initially swim upwards, rotating as they swim, and remain at the surface. Most later swim downwards and descend to the substrate where they can creep about before metamorphosis takes place some 24 to 36 hours after liberation, but some metamorphose on the surface. Mortality is high in widely-separated individuals but lower when several undergo metamorphosis close together as these individuals subsequently coalesce into fused masses. It is possible that these masses could be formed by larvae from different sponge populations. The result may be equivalent to cross-fertilisation within a common envelope and result in an enlarged gene pool and the efficient production of genetic diversity.

The Times Digital Archive. Web. 2 March 2014. The debate between Tariff Reform and Free trade did not play much of a part in the campaign but the issue of Irish Unionism versus Irish Nationalism did. =Irish Home Rule= The Liberal government was in the process of steering through parliament the Third Irish Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish Nationalists. The bill was opposed by the Unionist opposition and most infamously by the Irish Unionist Leader Sir Edward Carson who in 1912 had urged those who disagreed with the government to use any means to oppose the measure. This was meant as a call for Ulstermen to take up arms. Furthermore, Unionist politicians had been encouraging British Army officers to disobey orders to quell any Ulster uprising. At a Liberal campaign meeting on 2 May, three MPs spoke in support of Bannister. Tom Wing the former Grimsby Liberal MP, Francis Neilson and Irish Nationalist Richard McGhee. McGhee attacked the Unionist leader Sir Edward Carson for his treasonous position. Bannister added that \\"If he were King, he would chop off Sir Edward Carson's head.\\"\\"A Candidate's Laugh.\\" Times [London, England] 4 May 1914: 10. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 2 March 2014.

The Times Digital Archive. Web. 2 March 2014. On 9 May, leading Irish Nationalist MP T.P. O'Connor visited Grimsby in support of the Liberal campaign. He highlighted the activities of Unionist politicians who sought to encourage British army officers to mutiny.

The Times Digital Archive. Web. 2 March 2014 The Unionist campaign decision to focus on Irish Home Rule might have seemed difficult to understand. However, in past Grimsby elections, the issue had seemed to be the one that had served them best. =National Insurance Act= As with previous by-elections, the Unionist campaign sought to attack the Liberal government's National Insurance Act. However, this idea backfired on them early on; with the issue subsequently dropped from their campaign. At a Unionist campaign meeting on 4 May Lord Robert Cecil attacked the National Insurance Act, arguing that employers should not be made to contribute. The following day, a deputation of local insurance agents met with Tickler to point out that without employer compulsion, the scheme would not work. Tickler's response was one of support for Cecil.\\"The Grimsby Contest.\\" Times [London, England] 6 May 1914: 10. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 2 March 2014.

Result There was a small swing of 1.5% to the Liberal Party, but was not quite enough to regain the seat from the Unionists. The result would have given a great deal of confidence to Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith about his party's prospects of winning the next general election. It would also have re-assured him about implementing Irish Home Rule. Aftermath The Irish Home Rule was passed in parliament later that month. However, Asquith delayed its implementation due to the outbreak of war a few months later. A general election was due to take place by the end of 1915.

It was also previously known as Cardigan House, Bishop's Grove and Ingle Hall.  History  = As residential dwellings = St George's House is a two-storey brick and corrugated iron building constructed in 1891/92, in Federation Queen Anne style. St George's House was built by the Perth Diocesan Trust of the Anglican Church, specifically to provide an income for the Trust. In 1856 Matthew Hale, the first Anglican Bishop of Perth and an independently wealthy clergyman, purchased five allotments on St George's Terrace to build a residence for himself and his family. Hale favoured this location because of the large grounds and natural spring that flowed all year round, and because there was an existing house and stables. The land was purchased from Edward Hamersley and Alfred Hillman Senior (Assistant Surveyor General). These lots form the land known as the Bishop's See, located between St Georges Terrace, and Mount and Spring Streets at the western end of the Perth central business district. Hale built several buildings on the Bishop's See, including Bishop's House (1859, also known as Legacy House), Bishop's Cottage (1860, also known as Clergy House), Hale House (1872, also known as the Native Mission Cottage and Hale Cottage). In 1875 Hale handed all his Perth properties over to the Perth Diocesan Trust and left Western Australia to take up his appointment as Bishop of Brisbane. The Perth Diocesan Council constructed a number of buildings on the Bishop's See following Hales departure, included St George's House (1892, which was also known as Bishop's Grove, Cardigan and Ingle Hall), St George's Mansion () and Bishop's Court (1935, also known as Bishop's Grove). All these residential properties were leased to private tenants to provide an income for the diocese. St George's House was constructed in 1891/92 as a set of three two-storey houses in conjunction with a pair of two-storey semi-detached houses. The houses were to the design of architect John Talbot Hobbs, who was the official architect for the Perth Diocesan Council. He had arrived in Western Australia in 1887. An entry in one of Hobbs' ledgers records the preparation of plans and specifications, and supervision of the erection of five houses on St George's Terrace and the erection of a fence. The cost of this work was 225 pounds 3 shillings and it was commissioned in August 1891. A photograph taken in 1895 shows these two buildings, which were very similar in style. Both have prominent gables facing the street, corbelled chimneys, single level verandahs with decorative timber-work and rendered quoins, string courses and dressings to the windows. Whilst the verandah extended across the whole facade of the semi-detached houses, St George's House has two separate verandahs on each of the two larger gable fronts and a small awning covering a secondary entry of the western side of the building. A photograph dated 1894, shows St George's House in more detail, including turned balustrades to the verandahs above the main entry porch and a further entry to the building on the eastern side similar to that on the west. The building was basically symmetrical. St George's House, and other buildings on the Bishop's See, had many name changes throughout their history; evidence suggests that both St George's House and the building on Lots L261/2 and L263/4 were originally referred to as Bishop's Grove even though this name was later given to a set of flats located at 225 St George's Terrace. The name Bishop's Grove is used in the two photographs that show St George's House, taken in 1894 and in 1895, referring to it and the other building as Bishop's Grove. On 31 January 1893, a tender was accepted by the Perth Diocesan Council from Musto Briggs & Gill for the construction of the Bishop's Grove roadway. Fred Alexander, in his book Four Bishops and Their See, refers to Bishop's Grove: Wise's Post Office Directory refers to 235-239 St George's Terrace as \\"Bishop's Grove\\" in its first edition of 1897. Previous editions do not list street numbers or the name of the building. The history of tenants in St George's House can be ascertained from the Directory, and also indicates that the street address for St George's House may have once included 233 St George's Terrace. In 1897, four tenants are listed at Bishop's Grove, including George Leake, May Smith, Edward Hooper and George Berry. The number of tenants remains unchanged until 1906, when only three tenants are listed, being at 235, 237 and 239 St George's Terrace. In 1912, the building was being leased to tenants Miss C E Neill (233-235), Mrs E B Ward (237) and Mrs May Smith (239). From about 1915 until the 1960s, 235-239 St George's Terrace was operating either as two boarding houses or as an apartment and a boarding house. Some of the names listed in Wise's Post Office Directory as operating boarding houses are Dicken's Boarding-house (235) and Maginni's Boarding-house (237-239), 1923 Nisbet apartments (235) and Ayliffe Boarding-house (237-239), 1937 Mrs E L Dunning and Mr Edwd G Dunning (235) and Mrs H V Carter apartments (237-239), 1949. In 1912, a two-storey high verandah was added on all four sides to St George's House, with only the central section facing St Georges Terrace left untouched. The verandahs were eventually enclosed to accommodate more rooms. Extensive additions and alterations were carried out in 1939, to the eastern portion of the building then being referred to as \\"Cardigan\\". The architects for these works were Hobbs and Winning, and the successful contractor was A James & Co., for a price of 3,060 pounds. The works included the addition of a further 26 bedrooms and bathrooms and lavatories at the rear. The eastern gable wall facing St George's Terrace was demolished and the building renovated throughout. The front verandah and balcony were also altered and given a modern treatment in brick and concrete. The extent of these works to the eastern side of the building can be seen in a 1943 metropolitan sewerage plan. The western side appears unaltered (external walls given only) and a wing extends to the rear of the central unit. The plan shows the residences to have cellars, and shows the location of the out-buildings, fences and verandahs. A photograph taken in the 1980s shows the front gable cut back to a hip and a two-storey brick structure extending from the front of the building. Also in 1939, the Perth Diocesan Council modernised several other city properties. Tender notices show that Hale House (in Spring Street) was modernised with extensive renovations and additions being carried out; St George's Hall and Crystal Hall (both on the corner of Hay Street and Cathedral Avenue) also underwent renovations and alterations including the addition of a new modern style facade. Hobbs and Winning were the architects for all these works. The name \\"Bishop's Grove\\" was now being used to refer to a set of flats built in 1935 by the Perth Diocesan Council at 225 St George's Terrace (designed by Hobbs Forbes and Partners and also sometimes referred to as Bishop's Court ). From 1940 onwards, Wise's Post Office Directories show Bishops's Grove Flats being at 225 St George's Terrace. This building was demolished in 1986 to make way for St George's Square office tower. = Conversion to offices and redevelopment = During the 1960s, St George's House was converted from boarding houses into offices in response to higher rental values, and a lunch bar was provided on the ground floor. Although no notice of demolition has been located, it would appear that during the 1960s the other residential building on Lots L261/2 and L263/4 was demolished to make way for BP House, which was designed by Hobbs, Winning and Leighton and built in 1968. By the early 1980s, the Perth Diocesan Trust was concerned that the Bishop's See was losing money. A plan for the redevelopment of the site by Oldham Boas Ednie Brown, including three high rise office towers, a low rise office tower, a three-level podium structure, restoration of Bishop's House and gardens and 1,200 parking bays, was approved by Perth City Council. St George's Investments (later Australian City Properties (ACP)) obtained a 99-year leasehold of the 1.62 hectare property in 1986. The buildings in Bishop's See included St George's House, Bishop's House and BP House. Bishop's Grove Flats had been demolished for the St Georges Square office tower development that included a tennis court, parterre garden and a carpark. Included in the original lease conditions was the proviso that Bishop's House had to be restored and opened to the public. Although there were plans for the building's demolition due to its dilapidated condition, Alistair McAlpine (property developer, treasurer of Britain's Conservative Party, and Chairman of St Georges Investments (ACP)) decided to retain and refurbish the building and rename it St George's House. St George's House therefore became ACP's corporate headquarters. In 1986, ACP commissioned the architectural firm, Oldham Boas Ednie-Brown, to carry out the restoration of St George's House, which involved partial conservation and partial adaptation with some new material being introduced. Much of the external timberwork (such as the picket fencing, verandah balustrades, and gable finials) had disappeared, the tuckpointed brickwork had been painted, original roof sheeting had been replaced, the original roof vents had gone and the single-storey front porches had been removed. Internally, larger rooms had been subdivided, new doorways added and original timber work and plaster mouldings had been either damaged or were missing. The facade also now consisted of asbestos sheeting and louvre windows. The outer layer of additions and alterations that hid its character for more than 50 years was completely removed in 1987, reducing the number of rooms from 60 to 30. Much of the original fabric, particularly the bricks, had to be replaced owing to its poor condition. Some, though not all, of the verandahs were also reinstated and the building was completely refurbished internally. In 1996, a proposal was put before the Perth City Council to subdivide the Bishop's See to create a separate lot of 4,700 square metres, containing St George's Square and the parterre gardens (Lot A). The proposal included the retention of St George's House and Bishop's House on Lot B and the site of a proposed 50 storey office complex. Approval was given subject to the development of a minor town planning scheme for the site to resolve plot ratio and car-parking distribution for the lots. St George's Square was sold in 1998. From 2000 to 2002, it was used as offices by the Hawaiian Property Investments but then remained vacant from 2002 to 2011. = The Terrace Hotel = St George's House was refurbished and converted into a luxury boutique hotel — The Terrace Hotel — with 15 rooms, large bar and restaurant. The hotel opened on 1 November 2012. The Terrace Hotel was nominated as a finalist in the WA Heritage Awards as an Outstanding Tourism Product. The Western Australian Heritage Awards were established in 1992 to recognise outstanding commitment and contribution to heritage conservation and the promotion of heritage in Western Australia. The hotel announced its closure on 7 July 2018. Heritage value St George's House was classified by the National Trust of Western Australia on 11 May 1998 and listed on the City of Perth's Municipal Inventory, which was adopted 13 March 2001. It was permanently entered on to the State Register of Heritage Places on 24 March 2000 by the Heritage Council of Western Australia.

Lope Díaz II de Haro \\"Cabeza Brava\\" (b. 1170 – d. 15 November 1236) was a Spanish noble of the House of Haro, the sixth Lord of Biscay, and founder of the municipality of Plentzia. He was the eldest son of Diego López II de Haro and his wife, María Manrique. Lope was also a member of the Order of Santiago.  Biography  Lope Díaz fought alongside his father at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa where he distinguished himself. That action expelled the Almohads from the region and brought it under Castilian rule. The battle was commanded by three Christian kings; Alfonso VIII of Castile, Peter II of Aragon and Sancho VII of Navarre. Lope Díaz came to power in difficult times after the death of his father on 16 October 1214. A few days after he came to power, King Alfonso VIII of Castile died, leaving his 10-year-old son, the ill-fated Henry I of Castile, as heir to the throne after mysterious the death of his older brother, Fernando de Castilla y Plantagenet. The House of Lara gained power over Henry and started a rivalry with his sister, Berengaria of Castile, who consequently was Lope Díaz' patron. In 1217, Henry was 'accidentally' killed at the age of 13 by a falling roof tile. He was succeeded by his sister Berengaria, with the support of Lope Díaz, amongst other nobles, who later abdicated in favor of her son Ferdinand III of Castile, crowned in Nájera. Alfonso IX of León, the father of Ferdinand III was against the coronation of his son and invaded Castile with the support of the House of Lara. During this invasion, Álvaro Núñez de Lara gained power in Nájera and was subsequently defeated and imprisoned by Lope Díaz. For his supporting role in the backing of Ferdinand III as king, Lope Díaz was granted the title of \\"Alférez del Rey\\", or lieutenant of the king. He was married to the daughter of King Alfonso IX and step-sister of Ferdinand III, Urraca Alfonso de León. He was also given titles over the villages of Haro and Pedroso. Lope participated in various other wars supporting the ascension of Ferdinand III such as the expeditions against the Moors in Andalucía, of which the most important was the capture of Baeza in 1227. For his role in the city's capture, Lope Díaz was given the title of Conquistador de Baeza. In the early 1230s, the bishop of Calahorra wanted to exert his power over all the churches subject to the Monasteries of San Millán de la Cogolla. This led to multiple lawsuits that would end in 1232 with the move of the Diocese of Calahorra y La Calzada-Logroño to Santo Domingo de la Calzada. By 1235, the fallout from this shakeup was so great that Lope was forced to expel the bishop who fled to Rome and the diocese moved back to Calahorra. In 1234, fresh conflict broke out between King Ferdinand III and two of his leading magnates, Álvaro Pérez de Castro el Castellano: head of the House of Castro, and Lope Díaz II de Haro. Lope's grievances with the king were a result of a disagreement between the two at the siege of Úbeda. Without the approval of the king, who was uncle of Lope's daughters as his sister was Lope's wife, Alvaro Perez de Castro married Lope's daughter Mencia Lopez de Haro. This led king Ferdinand to relinquish all the titles and lands granted to Álvaro Pérez de Castro by the crown even though the conflict was settled arbitrarily by the Queens Berengaria de Castilla and Elisabeth of Swabia.  Death  Lope Díaz de Haro II died shortly after on 15 November 1236. He was buried in a sepulcher at the monastery of Santa María la Real de Nájera  Marriage and Descendants  Lope Díaz married Urraca Alfonso de León, the illegitimate daughter of Alfonso IX of León and his lover, Inés Íñiguez de Mendoza.

Along the way she meets a man named Ibrahim Siregar, who haunts her thoughts. Rustam's parents are unwilling to accept Dirsina as a daughter in law due to her different ethnicity; interethnic marriages are forbidden by adat (tradition). Although now married to two women, Rustam insists that he only loves Dirsina. When the guests realise that Dirsina is ill, they agree to leave so she can rest. Rustam asks for help from his neighbour, Doctor Meerman, who suggests that he pray for God to show him a way. Instead, Rustam attempts to commit suicide, an action which Meerman stops. When Nuraini's mother meets with Meerman, the two women discuss the issue and agree that it would be best if Nuraini and Rustam divorced. When this is done, Rustam asks for forgiveness. Rustam's family accepts Dirsina as a daughter-in-law and return to Padang. Writing Asmara Jaya was written by Djamaluddin Adinegoro, an ethnic Minangkabau writer from Talawi, Sawahlunto, West Sumatra, under the pen name Adinegoro. Originally studying medicine, he took up journalism while studying in Germany. It was during his time in Germany that he wrote Darah Muda, his first novel, and Asmara Jaya. Themes Like most works published by Balai Pustaka, the state-owned publisher of the Dutch East Indies, in the early 20th century, Darah Muda deals with the conflict between Minang adat and modern, Western, culture. However, Asmara Jaya was more optimistic in this regard. Unlike most other works, like Marah Roesli's Sitti Nurbaya, which tended to end with the deaths of all or most main characters, Adinegoro's novel had the young protagonist succeed in marrying his true love. Aside from Adinegoro's works, Abas Soetan Pamoentjak's Pertemuan (Meeting; 1927) and Tulis Sutan Sati's Sengsara Membawa Nikmat (Blessing in Disguise; 1929) had happy endings. The novel also continued a theme introduced in Adinegoro's first novel, Darah Muda (Young Blood; 1927), namely interethnic marriage between Minang and Sundanese people. A similar theme was dealt with in Hardjosumarto's Rusmala Dewi (1932), which dealt with the relationship between a Javanese man and Minang girl. Publication Asmara Jaya was published by Balai Pustaka in 1928. It saw a second printing three years later. After the publication of Asmara Jaya, Adinegoro focused on journalism; he never released another literary work. In 1980, Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw wrote that Asmara Jaya was well written but lacking in local flavour. In 1983 Indonesian literary scholar Aning Retnaningsih wrote that, of Adinegoro's two novels, Asmara Jaya was the weaker of the two, as the protagonist required outside help to overcome his romantic difficulties and the father's change of heart came across as a deus ex machina.

Becker and Gary Selden in which Becker, an orthopedic surgeon at SUNY Upstate working for the Veterans Administration, described his research into \\"our bioelectric selves\\". The book was first published by William Morrow and Company in 1985. Overview The first part of the book discusses regeneration, primarily in salamanders and frogs. Becker studied regeneration after lesions such as limb amputation, and hypothesized that electric fields played an important role in controlling the regeneration process. He mapped the electric potentials at various body parts during the regeneration, showing that the central part of the body normally was positive, and the limbs were negative. When a limb of a salamander or frog was amputated, the voltage at the cut (measured relative to the central part of the body) changed from about -10 mV (millivolts) to +20 mV or more the next day—a phenomenon called the current of injury. In a frog, the voltage would simply change to the normal negative level in four weeks or so, and no limb regeneration would take place. In a salamander, however, the voltage would during the first two weeks change from the +20 mV to -30 mV, and then normalize (to -10 mV) during the next two weeks—and the limb would be regenerated. Becker then found that regeneration could be improved by applying electricity at the wound when there was a negative potential outside the amputation stub. He also found that bone has piezoelectric properties which would cause an application of force to generate a healing current, which stimulated growth at stress locations in accordance with Wolff's law. In another part of the book Becker described potentials and magnetic fields in the nervous system, taking into account external influences like earth magnetism and solar winds. He measured the electrical properties along the skin surface, and concluded that at least the major parts of the acupuncture charts had an objective basis in reality. In the last chapters of the book, Becker recounts his experiences as a member of an expert committee evaluating the physiological hazards of various electromagnetic pollutions. He presents research data which indicate that the deleterious effects are stronger than officially assumed. His contention is that the experts choosing the pollution limits are strongly influenced by the polluting industry. In 1998 Becker filed a patent for an iontopheretic system for stimulation of tissue healing and regeneration (US 5814094 A). The title of the book is a reference to the fiction anthology I Sing the Body Electric by Ray Bradbury, itself a reference to the poem of the same name by Walt Whitman.

The practice of breastfeeding or suckling between humans and other species has gone in both directions: women sometimes breastfeed young animals, and animals are used to suckle babies and children. Animals were used as substitute wet nurses for infants, particularly after the rise of syphilis increased the health risks of wet nursing. Goats and donkeys were widely used to feed abandoned babies in foundling hospitals in 18th- and 19th-century Europe. Breastfeeding animals has also been practised, whether for health reasons – such as to toughen the nipples and improve the flow of milk – or for religious and cultural purposes. A wide variety of animals has been used for this purpose, including puppies, kittens, piglets and monkeys. Suckling of animals by humans Terracotta feeding bottles surviving from the third millennium BC in Sumeria indicate that children who were not being breastfed were receiving animal milk, probably from cows. It is possible that some infants directly suckled lactating animals, which served as alternatives to wet nurses. Unless another lactating woman was available, a mother who lacked enough breast milk was likely to lose her child. To avert that possibility if a wet nurse was not available, an animal such as a donkey, cow, goat, sheep or dog could be employed. Suckling directly was preferable to milking an animal and giving the milk, as contamination by microbes during the milking process could lead to the infant contracting a deadly diarrheal disease. It was not until as late as the 1870s that stored animal milk became safe to drink due to the invention of pasteurisation and sterilisation. The Jewish Talmud permits children to suckle animals if the child's welfare dictates it. =Mythology and stories= Sculpture of Romulus, Remus and the Capitoline Wolf A bear suckling an abandoned child The suckling of animals by infants was a repeated theme in classical mythology. Most famously, twin brothers Romulus and Remus (the former founded Rome) were portrayed as having been raised by a she-wolf which suckled the infants, as depicted in the iconic image of the Capitoline Wolf. The Greek god Zeus was said to have been brought up by Amalthea, portrayed variously as a goat who suckled the god or as a nymph who brought him up on the milk of her goat. Similarly, Telephus, the son of the demigod Heracles, was suckled by a deer. Several famous ancient historical figures were claimed to have been suckled by animals; Cyrus I of Persia was said to have been suckled by a dog, while mares supposedly suckled Croesus, Xerxes and Lysimachus. In reality, though, such stories probably owed more to myth-making about such prominent figures, as they were used as evidence of their future greatness. A 12th century novel from Al-Andaluz, Hayy ibn Yaqdhan, has the title character growing up in isolation on a tropical island, fed and raised by an antelope. The story reached Europe in a Latin translation, and then in 1708 an English edition. Stories of abandoned children being brought up by animal mothers such as she-wolves and bears were widespread in Europe from the Middle Ages and into modern times. One real-life case was that of Peter the Wild Boy, found in northern Germany in 1724. His coarse, curly hair was attributed to his being (supposedly) suckled by a bear, based on the premise that characteristics of the animal foster mother had been transmitted to him via her milk. (It is now thought he had Pitt-Hopkins syndrome, a condition unidentified until 1978.) =Perceived effect on character= The belief that animal characteristics could be transmitted via milk was widely held; the Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus thought that being suckled by lionesses conferred great courage. Goats were thought to transmit a libidinous character and some preferred to employ donkeys as wet nurses instead, as they were thought to be more moral animals. In modern Egypt, though, donkeys were disfavoured as wet nurses as it was thought that a child suckled on donkeys' milk would acquire the animal's stupidity and obstinacy. Human milk was thought to transmit character traits as well; in 19th century France a law was proposed to ban disreputable mothers from nursing their own children so that their immoral traits would not be transmitted via their milk. =Use of goats and other animals= Donkeys suckling children in a French institution, 1895 Goats have often been used to suckle human babies and infants. The Khoikhoi of southern Africa were reported to tie their babies to the bellies of female goats so that they could feed there. In the 18th and 19th centuries, goats were widely used in Europe as alternatives to human wet nurses, as they were easier to obtain, cheaper to use and safer, in that they were less prone to passing on diseases. This use of animals was already a well-established practice in rural France and Italy; Pierre Brouzet, the personal physician of Louis XV of France, wrote of how he had seen \\"some peasants who have no other nurses but ewes, and these peasants were as strong and vigorous as others.\\" In 1816, a German writer named Conrad A. Zweirlein overheard a conversation at a fashionable resort about the problems of wet nurses and responded by writing a book called The Goat as the Best and Most Agreeable Wet Nurse, which popularised the use of the animals for many years. One important use of goats for suckling concerned the feeding and attempted cure of babies born with congenital syphilis inherited from their mothers. Liquid compounds laced with mercury were fed to nanny goats – if they refused to drink them, honey was recommended as a way of disguising the metallic taste – or were ingested into the goat's bloodstream via a deliberately inflicted wound on the animal's leg that was covered with an ointment containing mercury. The mercury would accumulate in the goats' milk and was passed into the syphilitic babies when they suckled at the goats' teats. This method did have some effect of improving the infants' mortality rates, though the goats tended to die prematurely of mercury poisoning. In France, homes for foundlings (abandoned babies) often kept large numbers of goats to feed the infants, as they were considered less problematic than lower-class wet nurses. In some institutions, nurses (nannies) carried the infants to the goats; elsewhere, the goats came to the infants. Alphonse Le Roy described how goats were used at the foundling hospital in Aix-en-Provence in 1775: \\"The cribs are arranged in a large room in 2 ranks. Each goat which comes to feed enters bleating and goes to hunt the infant which has been given it, pushes back the covering with its horns and straddles the crib to give suck to the infant. Since that time they have raised very large numbers [of infants] in that hospital.\\" In 19th-century Ireland, foundlings from Dublin were \\"sent to the mountains of Wicklow, to feed upon the goats' milk. As the children grew older, the goats came to know them, and became very tame; so that the infant sought the goat, and was suckled by it as he would have been by a human wet nurse. These children throve remarkably well.\\" Donkeys were preferred in England; as one writer has put it, \\"nothing was more picturesque than the spectacle of babies, held under the bellies of the donkeys in the stable adjoining the infants' ward, sucking contentedly the teats of the docile donkeys.\\" In Brittany, attempts were made around 1900 to employ sows as wet nurses but foundered due to opposition to the use of pigs for this purpose. Breastfeeding by humans of animals The breastfeeding by humans of animals is a practice that is widely attested historically and continues to be practised today by some cultures. The reasons for this are varied: to feed young animals, to drain a woman's breasts, to promote lactation, to harden the nipples before a baby is born, to prevent conception, and so on. English and German physicians between the 16th and 18th centuries recommended using puppies to \\"draw\\" the mother's breasts, and in 1799 the German Friedrich Benjamin Osiander reported that in Göttingen women suckled young dogs to dislodge nodules from their breasts. An example of the practice being used for health reasons comes from late 18th century England. When the writer Mary Wollstonecraft was dying of puerperal fever following the birth of her second daughter, the doctor ordered that puppies be applied to her breasts to draw off the milk, possibly with the intention of helping her womb to contract to expel the infected placenta that was slowly poisoning her. Mary Cooley Spencer, an American woman living in Colonia Dublan in 1911 breastfed a collie puppy while suffering from smallpox. Mary had a 5-month old daughter, who was cared for by a friend while Mary recovered. Nursing the puppy allowed Mary to maintain her milk supply until she was no longer contagious. Animals have widely been used to toughen the nipples and maintain the mother's milk supply. In Persia and Turkey puppies were used for this purpose. The same method was practised in the United States in the early 19th century; William Potts Dewees recommended in 1825 that from the eighth month of pregnancy, expectant mothers should regularly use a puppy to harden the nipples, improve breast secretion and prevent inflammation of the breasts. The practice seems to have fallen out of favour by 1847, as Dewees suggested using a nurse or some other skilled person to carry out this task rather than an animal. Religious and ceremonial reasons have also been a factor. Saint Veronica Giuliani (1660–1727), an Italian nun and mystic, was known for taking a lamb to bed with her and suckling it as a symbol of the Lamb of God. In far northern Japan, the Ainu people are noted for holding an annual bear festival at which a captured bear, raised and suckled by the women, is sacrificed. Bears were also suckled by the Itelmens of the Kamchatka Peninsula of Russia but in their case for economic reasons, to benefit from the meat when the bear was grown and to obtain highly prized bear bile for use in traditional medicine. Tribal peoples around the world have breastfed many types of animal. Travelers in Guyana observed native women breastfeeding a variety of animals, including monkeys, opossums, pacas, agoutis, peccaries and deer. Native Canadians and Americans often breastfed young dogs; an observer commented that the Pima people of Arizona \\"withdrew their breasts sooner from their own infants than from young dogs.\\" In the present day, the act of breastfeeding animals has been used as a sometimes controversial artistic statement. The album art for Boys for Pele by Tori Amos includes a photograph of the singer breastfeeding a piglet. In Ireland, 22-year-old model and PETA member Agata Dembiecka became the focus of controversy in 2010 when a calendar issued by an animal rescue charity featured a photograph of her suckling a puppy.

Minato City Local History Museum. He played an important role in the negotiations for the \\"Harris Treaty\\" which opened commercial relations between Japan and America, and his assassination caused a minor diplomatic crisis between Japan and the various Western powers. Life Heusken was born in Amsterdam to Joannes Franciscus Heusken, who worked for a soap manufacturer, and Johanna Smit. The death of his father jeopardized his chances of a successful career, so he immigrated to the United States and became a naturalized citizen, changing his name to Henry Conrad Joannes Heusken. However, he found that life in New York City was difficult as well, and was forced to move from job to job based on his contacts with the local Dutch community. In 1855, these same contacts introduced him to Townsend Harris, who had been appointed for the first United States Consul General to Japan, and who was looking for a personal assistant and interpreter in the only European language the Japanese were familiar with. Heusken departed New York in October 1855 on the , and worked closely with Harris during the negotiations for the Treaty of Amity and Commerce of 1858. Harris reported to Washington in his official reports that Heusken was kind and amiable in temper, never showing violence to the Japanese, and a universal favorite. However, in his personal diary, Harris complained that Heusken was lackadaisical, stating \\"I believe that Mr Heusken only remembers when to eat, drink and sleep – any other affairs rest lightly on his memory\\" Harris, Complete Journals, Rutland, 1959 On other occasions, Harris sought to warn Heusken about his late hours. After the American consulate was relocated to Zenpuku-ji in Edo, Heusken quickly became one of the most publicly visible foreigners among the multiple western delegations in Edo. He frequently rode about the town and castle on horseback, a privilege that was traditionally reserved for the samurai caste. Count Friedrich Albrecht zu Eulenburg, head of the Eulenburg Expedition which was in Japan for the purpose of negotiating a commercial treaty between Prussia and Japan similar to treaties secured by the other European powers, requested that Harris loan Heusken to serve as interpreter during the negotiations.Japanese-German Relations, 1895-1945: war, diplomacy and public opinion By Christian W. Spang, Rolf-Harald. Wippich, p. 1 After having dinner with Count Eulenburg on the night of 14 January 1861, Heusken was returning to his quarters at Zenpuku-ji accompanied by three mounted officers and four footmen bearing lanterns. The party was suddenly ambushed by seven shishi from Satsuma Domain, including Shōuhei Imuta. Despite his escort, Heusken suffered mortal wounds to both sides of his body in the fight. He mounted a horse and galloped about 200 yards to the American Legation, where he was taken inside and treated. Early in the following morning, he died of his wounds. Harris insisted on an ostentatiously large funeral procession, with the participation of all the foreign missions in Japan, and Heusken was buried at the cemetery at Korin-ji in Tokyo, Japan. \\"The murder of Heusken\\" Immediately after the funeral, most western diplomats retreated from Edo to Yokohama and brought ashore greater numbers of French and British soldiers for protection as trade dwindled. The \\"yet unpunished and unatoned homicide of Mr. Heusken\\" was cited by William H. Seward as a hindering factor in relations between the U.S. and Japan during this period.William H. Seward to the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Japan. 1 August 1861. U.S. National Archives Identifier 6158603. No one was ever convicted of the murder, and the only reparations made by the government of Japan was a $10,000 payment to Heusken's mother. Heusken wrote a detailed diary of his time in Japan, which was published in 1964 as \\"Japan Journal 1855-1861\\".Japan Journal, 1855–1861. By Henry Heusken. Trans, and edited by Jeannette C.

A British officer named the island Peacock Island for its structure, which he thought resembled the splayed feathers of a peacock. It is visited mostly for its Shiva temple, the Umananda Temple, and is also home to a large population of golden langurs, an endangered species of primate. The islet can be reached via 10-minute ferry, available from Umananda Ghat, located near Guwahati Highcourt. Mythology According to Hindu mythology, Shiva created the island for his wife Parvati's happiness and pleasure. Shiva is said to have resided here in the form of Bhayananda. According to a myth in Kalika Purana, Shiva burnt Kamadeva with his third eye on Umananda when he interrupted Shiva's deep meditation, hence its alternative name Bhasmachal (Assamese: bhasma, \\"ash\\"; and achal, \\"hill\\"; literally, \\"hill of ashes\\"). History In 1897, an earthquake damaged the temple heavily, but was later repaired by a local merchant. The temple displays mixture of both Hindu Vaishnavism and Shaivism. There are Assamese craftings of Ganesha, Shiva, Parvati, Vishnu, and other Hindu deities. During the repairing work of the temple some new Vaishnavi scripts were written on the walls. Craftsmen also carved figures out of rock on the island. Festivals Maha Shivaratri is widely celebrated in Umananda. Monday is considered to be the holiest day in the temple and the new moon brings bliss to the pilgrims.

Sundar's cousin Shanti, who lives with his family and takes care of the entire household, is fond of him and wishes to marry him. Sundar's father Sivasamy also wants this marriage to take place. When Shanti discovers the love between Sundar and Uma, however, she changes her mind. Sivasamy asks Sundar to marry Shanti, but he refuses, revealing that he is in love with Uma. Furious, Sivasamy begins looking for another bridegroom for Shanti. Meanwhile, Uma goes to seek permission to marry Sundar from her brother, who is her only living relative. She tells Sundar that she will send him a letter on a particular date (10 October). When Uma's letter informs him that she has decided to marry another person because she is not willing to go against the wishes of her brother, an emotionally distraught Sundar becomes bedridden. In truth, Uma's brother and sister-in-law were killed in a road accident, leaving behind their three children. She decided to renounce her love for Sundar to take care of the children, and lied to him so that he would not come after her. While taking care of the dejected Sundar, Shanti is confronted by her bridegroom who accuses her of having a relationship with Sundar. When Sundar realises how much his father and his cousin have suffered because of him, he decides to marry Shanti.

Hearing this, Geetha realises that her father was once in love with her teacher. Shanti learns of Sundar's relationship with Uma. Not wanting to cause Sundar and Shanti to separate, Uma gives a letter to the school principal Sundaravathanam, asking him to take care of her brother's children if something happens to her, and goes to a cliff to meet Sundar. She asks Sundar that will he come with her leaving everything behind she calls call him. Sundar tells her that he could leave anything except his wife and child. This is the answer Uma wants, having decided that, if Sundar talked about leaving Shanti and Geetha, she would throw herself from the cliff. At the same time, Shanti concludes that Uma and Sundar should be united, and decides to commit suicide, Uma and Sundar stop her, with Uma telling her everything that happened between her and Sundar was in the past.

Based on the original version of same name created and produced by Cris Morena, the soap opera tells the story of a group of orphans that live in a manor, known as Raio de Luz, whose lives are touched and changed by Carol. Their experiences such as discovering first love, deceptions, loneliness and friendship, as well as adventures in fantasy, are depicted throughout the series. The narrative is enhanced by musical themes and videos. The Brazilian soap opera ran for five seasons until SBT's contract with Telefe ended in 2001. On September 19, 2012, SBT announced a new version of Chiquititas, which premiered on July 15, 2013 following the good ratings obtained by the 2012 remake of Carrusel. Unlike Chiquititas Brasil, the new Chiquititas production is completely made in Brazil, and is the first without involvement of Cris Morena. Story line Chiquititas Brasil received mild alterations from Chiquititas throughout its storyline. = Season One = Soon after Gabriela had a child, her father José Ricardo Almeida Campos kidnapped his granddaughter because, as a very conservative man, he could not accept the idea that his daughter became involved with an employee. As his granddaughter Mili needs a place to live, he creates an orphanage named \\"Raio de Luz\\" (\\"Light Gleam\\", originally \\"Rincón de Luz\\", which means \\"Corner of Light\\"). Mili grew up in this Manor alongside other girls that later arrived. Her fellows are Bia, Ana, sisters Tati and Vivi, and Cris. As the years passed, the girls became a family. They are supervisioned by Ernestina, the rigorous and funny janitor of the orphanage, and Chico, the adorable Chef very beloved by the girls. Emilia is the director of the orphanage until Carmem, an ambitious woman who's also sister of José Ricardo, takes her off this position. Soon, a new girl known as Pata is introduced. She initially does not get along with the other girls, but later is well accepted and becomes their friend, and particularly Mili's best friend. In this orphanage full of hopes and dreams, each of the chiquititas, guided by Mili, will live thousands of adventures full of love, friendship and fun. Pata later meets her half- brother, nicknamed Mosca. Initially considered a \\"delinquent\\" by Carmem, he then becomes the first male infant upheld by the place, awakening Cris and Vivi's feelings. Ernestina becomes tired of being pranked by the girls and is replaced by Matilde, her stricter (and darker) identical twin sister that won't tolerate their banters, as Carmem, the orphanage director, greedily manages to own the Manor where Raio de Luz is localized to herself. The girls' lives will be touched and changed by Carolina, or Carol, a young woman that works in one of the Almeida's factories and studies for social working. Carol lives with her friend Clarita and her somewhat rascal brother Beto. They take care of Dani, a girl that recently lost her mother. In the factory, Carol meets Junior, Ricardo's oldest son, an economist that lived in London and is back to São Paulo due to work. They'll fall in love with each other but José Ricardo, snobbish, will do anything to keep them apart. His daughter, Gabriela, became mentally affected since she believes she had a stillbirth child, actually a lie her father told her right after Mili was born. Her serious condition is softened by Mili herself, both unaware of their blood ties. = Season Two = After Ricardo's tragic death, his sister Carmem is chosen to be in charge of his fortune. She manages to keep the secret Ricardo most wanted to protect: Mili's true origins. Meanwhile, is a new beginning in Carol's life, since she was named the orphanage director by Ricardo himself, right before he died in a car crash in the previous season. Junior left São Paulo once again, this time with Gabriela, seeking psychological treatment for her. Due to the distance, Carol brokes up with him as she meets a new man in her life, doctor Fernando Brausen. Brausen is Dani's physio after she suffered an accident in the manor and became seriously paralysed. Carol also meets a girl abandoned in the streets, named Maria, who Carol uphelds as her own daughter. Since the remaining girls start to interact with the newcomer boys, Mili discovers her first love when she meets Júlio. Maria later finds out that her favourite doll Laurinha is actually able to be alive itself. Actress Flávia Monteiro with the young cast of Chiquititas Brasil, Season Two. Maria uncovers a mysterious Phantom of the Opera-like figure living inside the hidden areas of the manor, a man named Miguel. He's a friend of Fernando from the past, who Fernando thought was dead after an airplane crash. The man actually survived the accident, which had left a scar on his face. Also, Miguel believes that one of the resident chiquititas is his lost daughter, she possibly being Bia, Cris, or Mili. He helps Maria in the search for her mother, whom she lived with in the streets before being taken off by Carol and Clarita. Maria's background is later revealed by her mother, Esther, to Carol. Esther explains that, since she was infertile, her second husband became abusive and deposited his hatred onto the little girl. Maria was then forced to be abandoned by her mother. The repentant woman would later vainly get back to look for her daughter. Esther is once again reunited with Maria, saying goodbye to the little girl, as she dies due to her broken death. Formerly alcoholic, the father of Vivi and Tati comes back to their lives as he's rehabilitated. Since Vivi would not come back, she says goodbye to the Manor and particularly to Mosca, who was her first love. Ana is adopted by a business executive and takes her best friend Fábio with her. As some of the original chiquititas finally find their parents and leave the manor, new children are later welcomed, increasing the family inside Raio de Luz. = Season Three - At the corner = Carmem finally manages to close the orphanage. However, Carol and the youngsters receive the help of a mysterious man named Pedro Vega who donates his old mansion to them. The huge, beautiful manor is located at the corner of the Harmony Alley. In its initially creepy insides, they'll meet Helena, the house's governess, a baleful and mean- spirited woman who keeps her granddaughter Lúcia locked in a windowless bedroom, in order to \\"protect\\" her. In the neighbourhood, the youngsters make new friends. Their life starts to change since some of them are leaving their childhood behind and are starting to grow, as they experiment their first love and will realize the power of friendship. One of the orphans, mischievous boy Neco, soon discovers Lúcia and became her friend for life, showing her the world and gradually making her part of their family, against Elena's will. Mosca (the first male orphan welcomed by the orphanage) soon discovers he has a serious bone disease, and faces this particular obstacle in this season. The relationship between Carol and Fernando will be torn apart thanks to Andréa, Fernando's former fiancée, and their son Diego. An unscrupulous man named Felipe Mendes Ayala demonstrates interest to orphan Maria, to whom Carolina became maternally attached, and they will fight in court for her custody. Adult and young cast of Chiquititas Brasil in Season Three Tati cames back to the Manor due to her non-adaptation to her family's conditions, also because she overly missed her friends. She experiments first love feelings with Tatu, one of the boys of the Harmony Alley, but their relationship does not work out. Fran and Samuca start being more than friends, but Marian and Bel interfere in their relationship. Marian is a troubled orphan; Bel resides in the Harmony Alley and is the best friend of Lila and Janu, a girl who is uncertain between Mosca and André. Lila also develops her feelings for Mosca, despite the disapproval of her mother. Gabriela returns sane to São Paulo, she and Mili reapproximate, and they become closer each day with Carmem following them closely, trying to keep them from knowing the secret and their true ties. She joins forces to Marian, an orphan with bad intentions who's jealous of Mili, doing everything to hinder her life. Due to Marian's deeds, Mili ends up blind after an accident, and her place as Gabriela's real daughter and Luca's girlfriend is taken by Marian. But in the end, the truth will finally emerge. The youngsters will also explore secrets kept in the Manor involving mysteries, magic, fantasy, and a hidden treasure, also wanted by Carmem. As in the original version, during this season the first Raio de Luz orphanage is closed and re-opened in a new manor. Also, some of the more heavy and melodramatic storylines were dropped. The show's most popular character Mili, the protagonist played by Fernanda Souza, says goodbye and goes to a new life with her mother. = Season Four = After legal and personal fights with each other, Carolina and Felipe then fall in love. They dispute custody of Maria, the smallest among the orphans, as Felipe, under the new identity of Manoel, gets close to them and to the children in the Manor. Among new orphans introduced are Simão and Hannelore, newcomers from a reformatory after a presumed behavioral change. But this two will be very unpopular to the veterans due to their actions, also due to their affiliation to Elena. Mosca develops a stronger relationship with Lila, the girl next door, and Fran discovers her origins as an heiress of a huge fortune before she quits it due to her relatives' ambition. Later, she and her pals in the Manor reluctantly say goodbye to her love: the smart, adorable and former orphan Samuca, who was reunited with his father and is going to live with him. After her mother goes to psychological aid and his father is arrested for domestical violence, Bel moves to the Manor. During a tour, Tati gets lost in the forest, where she meets a fearless boy named Yago. She's rescued by Mosca and Manoel, and takes Yago with her to the manor. A young woman, Estrela, arrives in the house looking for work. At the day of their wedding, Carol and Manoel's romance is torn apart after she finds out the truth about his real identity. In the fourth season's final episodes, some of the children are transferred to another institution in Rio de Janeiro, and Carolina makes a travel to promote the orphanage's activities, leaving the youngsters under the care of Alfredo the Chef and Estrela. The Book of Life is given by her to them, and the children says to Carol that she's \\"their shine\\", and that they'll be there waiting for her. Tati leaves the show after four seasons as she is adopted alongside Yago. Helena, the main antagonist of this season, is a fugitive from the police after her criminal acts, and as the Manor became her property, it is sold on auction. The council intends to send the children to different places, and since the group of orphans don't want to be torn apart, Estrela remembers of her grandfather's house in a small town near to São Paulo. Mosca says emotionally says goodbye to Lila, as they orphans are forced to leave the Manor. They need to move faster, as tractors approach to knock their house down. = Season Five - Moving on = The group spent some time homeless, as Bruna, the youngest of the chiquititas, faithfully keeps the Book of Life gifted by Carol. Alfredo, Estrela and the remaining orphans then arrive in her grandfather's farm in São Dionísio, an inland small town. The orphans are welcomed in the farm, and everything seems fine until Estrela notices her grandpa is gone. Also, the farm is about to be demolished as it is located in an area occupied by a logging company. The orphans need to hide, as they are not supposed to be under such condition. Near the farm is a rich mansion that also belongs to Estrela's family. Its owner is a young businessman named Rian, son of Tonico and the promoter of the deforestation project that threats the graner. He lives with his only child, Lucas, and nephews Inês, Álvaro and Rodrigo. Inácia \\"Naná\\" is the rigorous housekeeper of Rian's family. Rian then arrives from the United States, and later, his girlfriend Cora and her little daughter Talita also come to the mansion. Cora is an ambitious woman with interest in Rian's fortune. She also brings Hannelore, a troublesomed orphan that lived in the Raio de Luz manor and was adopted by Cora soon after being transferred to a shelter in Rio de Janeiro. Hannelore then becomes Cora's accomplice in causing trouble to the orphans. The cast of Chiquititas Brasil in the fifth and final season. Unlike the original version, the storyline was not rebooted. Fran meets Rodrigo, a charming but crafty boy, and Yuri, a more loveable orphan and the first welcomed in this new Raio de Luz. Uncertain about her feelings, she finds herself divided between the two boys. Mosca starts working as a gardener in the mansion, and gets closer to Inês, a pampered and altered girl. The children become desolated after assuming that Carol supposedly died in an airplane crash, but she later reappears from the skies, falling right on Rian and Cora's wedding cake with her balloon (just as Ana did in the original version). After her return, Carol settles in the granary, alongside Estrela, her adorable grandfather Tonico and, once again, reunited with the chiquititas. The granary then becomes their newest home, Raio de Luz, as well as a new orphanage. Carol's arrival makes Cora even more enraged, as her plans to send the orphans to a reformatory are ruined, as well as her greed over Rian's wealth. She also tries to separate Rian and Carol, who fall in love for each other. An enormous tree is located in the very centre of the granary, which is a gateway to a magical world the youngsters later explore, known as The Anthill. In this place they meet creatures like talking ants and find secret passages that link the granary to the mansion. In the end of Chiquititas Brasil, Carolina and Rian get married and adopt part of the orphans, and the other ones are sent to another institution. Cora is caught in the act by the police after the help of a redeemed Hannelore. Half- brothers Mosca and Pata, who were in the show since Season One, are adopted by Amanda, an artist introduced in Season Three as Pata's supposed mother. Estrela ends up alongside Álvaro, and Fran chooses Yuri over Rodrigo, who is now Bel's boyfriend. The children say farewell to each other, as Bruna notices that the Book of Life is no longer placed upon its usual place. Sitting on the feet of the Tree, Carol and her family watch the Book of Life fly away, as Carol states that \\"whoever find this Book, will then find a light gleam that will brighten your life, forever and ever\\". Cancellation The fifth season was the last to be adapted for Brazilian audiences. In 2001, SBT was airing other soap operas directed for children, such as El diario de Daniela, which were providing higher ratings than Chiquititas at that time. One of the clauses in SBT's contract with Telefe allowed SBT to produce Chiquititas in 2001 by itself, and the show could be filmed on Brazilian locations. However, Cris Morena had disagreements with Telefe and later broke relations with the Argentine net, what also have influenced on the end of Chiquititas Brasil. Cast =Adult cast from 1997 to 2001= =Chiquititas and Chiquititos cast from 1997 to 2001= Production Brazilian TV show host and entrepreneur Silvio Santos, owner of SBT, originally wanted the show to be called Pequeninas, as it is the literal translation of \\"chiquititas\\" (\\"little girls\\") to Brazilian Portuguese.http://revistaquem.globo.com/QUEM- News/noticia/2012/07/chiquititas-saiba-como-estao-meninas-da-novela-15-anos- apos-estreia.html Actress Suzy Rêgo was initially considered to play the adult protagonist of this version, portrayed by Romina Yan in the original show, but the role eventually went to younger actress Flávia Monteiro, who took singing lessons to sing her musical themes by herself, without needing to dub them. Eight years later, in 2005, Rêgo would get a main role in Floribella, the Brazilian version of Floricienta, also created by Cris Morena. In 1998 (Season Two), produced Roberto Monteiro hired screenwriter Caio de Andrade to translate and adapt the Argentine series. Andrade worked on the script until Chiquititas Brasil's final season, in 2000.http://cultureba.com.br/2013/07/16/sbt-analisando-as-adaptacoes- brasileiras-de-chiquititas-e-carrossel/#.UkPDhtK1F2Y The songs were translated and adapted to Brazilian Portuguese by Caion Gadia,http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ilustrada/ult90u324041.shtml and differently from the original version, most of the actors dubbed the voices of professional singers in their themes. The exceptions were Flávia Monteiro, Gésio Amadeu, Omar Calicchio, Magali Biff and Débora Olivieri, from the adult cast. The Brazilian series begun in 1997, when the Argentine version was in its third season, and it was shot in Buenos Aires, in the same Telefe studios and locations used for the original series, with Buenos Aires fitting as São Paulo in the storyline. With the exception of \\"Até 10\\" (\\"Up To 10\\") and \\"Sinais\\" (\\"Signs\\"), all the music videos were shot in Brazil, using locations such as the Museu Paulista's park, the Paulista Avenue, São Paulo's Theatro Municipal and the Latin America Memorial, among others throughout the country. Most part of the Season Five videos were shot in Fernando de Noronha. Reception Soon after its debut, the show became extremely popular spawning hundreds of merchandising and selling over 3 million albums. Being part of the cast became a dream among many Brazilian children. In and in 1999, over 15.000 people in São Paulo, 10,000 in Rio de Janeiro and 6,000 in Recife attended the auditions for the show's third season, breaking the record for the biggest casting ever (as a comparison castings for Ídolos, the Brazilian version of American Idol, are attended by 2,000 people in each state and 4,000 in São Paulo). Following the musical productions released in Argentina, the Brazilian version also had live musical presentations on its country, featuring the whole main cast, in 1998, when the show was on the third season. The cast and crew were supposed to be on tour throughout Recife, Fortaleza and Brasília, but due to budgetary issues, the tour was canceled and the group presented only in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. In 2000, when Chiquititas Brasil was on its fifth year, the videoclip \\"Adolescente\\" (\\"Teens\\") became one of the 10 most viewed on MTV Brasil. Legacy In 2007, SBT aired Chiquititas 2000 (Chiquititas Season Six) as a single story in order to continue from the point the Brazilian adaptation stopped, under the tagline \\"A new adventure is about to start\\", albeit Chiquititas 1999 was not accurately adapted for the Brazilian audience. However, the airings attracted good ratings and in the following year, Chiquititas Sin Fin was aired. The show catapulted the careers of several cast members, such as Carla Diaz, Fernanda Souza, Stephany Brito, Bruno Gagliasso and Débora Falabella. In 2011, Diaz portrayed Márcia in Rebelde Brasil, the Brazilian version for the series of same name created by Cris Morena. Remake In September 19, SBT announced on its official website that a new production of Chiquititas for 2013,http://www.sbt.com.br/noticias/?c=10800&t;=chiquititas+e+a+proxima+producao+da+teledramaturgia+do+sbt/ in order to maintain the positive ratings obtained by Carrossel, also directed for younger viewers.http://www.ibahia.com/detalhe/noticia/sucesso-de- carrossel-faz-sbt-pensar-em-nova-versao-de-chiquititas/http://www.parana- online.com.br/editoria/almanaque/news/626452/?noticia=NOVELA+CHIQUITITAS+TERA+REMAKE+PREVISTO+PARA+2013 Actress Manuela do Monte stars as Carol, and Giovanna Grigio portrays Mili.

Diego López III de Haro (b. ? – d. October 4, 1254, Bañares). Was the eldest son of Lope Díaz II de Haro and of Urraca Alfonso de León, the illegitimate daughter of King Alfonso IX of León. Diego succeeded his father as the Lord of Biscay between the years 1236 and 1254.  Biography  In his young adulthood, Diego loyally served his uncle, the King Ferdinand III of Castile. After his father fell out of favor with the king, Ferdinand III decided to revoke the hereditary titles of lordship over La Rioja but left him with Castilla la Vieja. In defiance, Diego rebelled against the king several time, each time being forgiven after the fact. Diego then remained loyal until Ferdinand III's death in 1252. Alfonso X of Castile ascended to the throne after the death of Ferdinand III. Diego, his cousin, continued to serve him in his same position, but their relationship was incredibly strained. Finally, Diego exercised his right to refuse obedience to the king (a law recognized in Middle Age legislation to feudal lords) and began searching for another qualified candidate to become King of Navarre.  Death  On October 4, 1254, Diego López III de Haro died in a town of La Rioja called Baños de Río Tobía. He was killed in a bathing tub filled with boiling water under the pretext that it would cure his rheumatism. He was buried in the Monastery of Santa María la Real of Nájera where his father and family members were previously entombed.  Marriage and Descendants  Diego married Constanza de Bearne, daughter of Vizconde Guillermo II de Bearne and his wife, Garsenda de Provenza. The couple had the following five children: * Lope Díaz III de Haro - (b. c. 1245? – d. Alfaro 1288). Inherited the Lordship of Biscay after the death of his father. Married Juana Alfonso de Molina, daughter of Alfonso de Molina and niece of the king, Alfonso IX of León. He was killed in Alfaro in 1288 by Sancho IV of Castile, the king of Castile and León. * Diego López V de Haro - (b. c. 1250? – d. 1310). Noble from Biscay, married Violante de Castilla y Aragón, daughter of King Alfonso X of Castile. He died during the Siege of Algeciras in 1310. His body was buried in the Monasterio de San Francisco de Burgos which no longer exists today. * Urraca Díaz de Haro - Married Fernando Rodríguez de Castro, a noble who held title over Cigales and Cuéllar and son of Rodrigo Fernández de Castro, Vizconde of Cabrera and lord of Cigales, and his wife Leonor González de Lara. * Teresa de Haro. - Married Juan Núñez I de Lara, head of the House of Lara and son of Nuño González de Lara \\"el Bueno\\", also head of the House of Lara. * Sancha Díaz de Haro (b. ? – d. after 1287) On April 22, 1287, her brother Diego donated to her the aldea de Santa Olalla.Real Academia de Historia, Colección Salazar y Castro, Ref.

Vincent was the son of Francis Vincent, chapman of Weedon, Northamptonshire, and his wife, Elizabeth Langham, daughter of Edward Langham of Guilsborough, Northamptonshire, and sister of Sir John Langham, 1st Baronet. Vincent was apprenticed to Thomas Langham, a Grocer of London, and established himself as a linen-draper. He became a member of the Worshipful Company of Grocers in about 1639 and a member of the Honourable Artillery Company in 1640.

The satellite had a mass at launch of , and is expected to operate for at least 15 years. It is positioned in geostationary orbit at a longitude of 76.5 degrees East, and carries 56 transponders with an operating power of 8.4 kilowatts; 28 operating in the C band and providing services to Asia, Africa, eastern and central Europe and Australia and the other 28 operating in the , covering Africa, the Middle East, the People's Republic of China, and Taiwan. The satellite's solar arrays generate 11.4 kilowatts of power. Apstar-7 was launched by a Long March 3B/E carrier rocket, flying from Launch Complex 2 at the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre. Liftoff took place at 10:27 UTC on 31 March 2012, with the rocket placing the satellite into a supersynchronous transfer orbit. Operational history Thales Alenia Space built Apstar-7 as an ITAR-free satellite, containing no restricted American components. The United States prohibits the export of satellite components when a Chinese launcher will be used. Ironically, the US Department of Defense leased bandwidth on Apstar-7 in May 2012 to improve communications with the U.S. Africa Command. In 2013, Thales Alenia was forced to discontinue its ITAR-free satellite line after US supplier Aeroflex admitted that it had sold them ITAR-controlled components.

It is distributed in Africa and Asia. Taxonomy The generic name \\"Platycorynus\\" first appeared in the second and third editions of Dejean's Catalogue of Coleoptera, where it was attributed to Chevrolat. Nine species were listed for the genus, four of which were nomina nuda at the time of publication, but no formal description was given for it. The genus was later briefly characterized by Frederick William Hope in 1840, under the new name \\"Corynodes\\". In 1865, Thomas Ansell Marshall published a monograph on Corynodes, dividing it into seven subgenera: Platycorynus, Corynodes, Theumorus, Eurycorynus, Omodon, Erigenes, and Bathycolpus. The latter five were originally intended to be new genera. In the same year, Hamlet Clark created a new genus, Corynoeides, for one of the species placed in Corynodes. However, Joseph Sugar Baly did not accept Clark's genus nor Marshall's subdivisions. In 1956, Monrós & Bechyné pointed out that Platycorynus Chevrolat in Dejean, 1836 was available and had priority over Corynodes Hope, 1840, and that therefore the former should be used as the valid name for the genus. According to Volume 6 of the Catalogue of Palearctic Coleoptera, published in 2010, Corynodes, Corynoeides, Eudora, Neolycaria and all of Marshall's subgenera are now treated as synonyms of Platycorynus. Species The genus includes the following species: * Platycorynus abyssinicus (Jacoby, 1886) ** Platycorynus abyssinicus abyssinicus (Jacoby, 1886) ** Platycorynus abyssinicus niloticus Kuntzen, 1914 * Platycorynus aemulus (Lefèvre, 1889) * Platycorynus aeneus Baly, 1864 * Platycorynus affinis (Chen, 1934) * Platycorynus ahmadi (Abdullah & Qureshi, 1969) * Platycorynus amethystinus (Marshall, 1865) * Platycorynus andamanensis (Lefèvre, 1891) * Platycorynus angularis Tan, 1982 * Platycorynus angulicollis (Jacoby, 1884) * Platycorynus apicalis Kimoto & Gressitt, 1982 * Platycorynus approximans Baly, 1864 * Platycorynus arcuatefasciatus (Pic, 1938) * Platycorynus argentipilus Tan, 1982 * Platycorynus asphodelus (Marshall, 1865) * Platycorynus assamensis (Baly, 1879) * Platycorynus aureipennis (Baly, 1867) * Platycorynus azureus (Sahlberg, 1829) * Platycorynus backoensis Medvedev & Rybakova, 1985 * Platycorynus bakeri (Weise, 1922) * Platycorynus balyi (Jacoby, 1884) * Platycorynus basalis (Jacoby, 1884) * Platycorynus bellus (Chen, 1940) * Platycorynus bengalensis (Duvivier, 1890) * Platycorynus biseriatus Baly, 1864 * Platycorynus brevipennis (Jacoby, 1896) * Platycorynus buonloicus Medvedev & Rybakova, 1985 * Platycorynus cavifrons (Jacoby, 1908) * Platycorynus ceylonensis (Jacoby, 1908) * Platycorynus chalybaeus (Marshall, 1865) * Platycorynus chrysis (Olivier, 1808) * Platycorynus chrysochoides Chen, 1940 * Platycorynus chapanus (Chen, 1934) * Platycorynus circumductus (Marshall, 1865) * Platycorynus coelestinus Baly, 1864 * Platycorynus coeruleatus (Baly, 1867) * Platycorynus coeruleicollis (Pic, 1940) * Platycorynus compressicornis (Fabricius, 1801) * Platycorynus congener Baly, 1864 * Platycorynus costatus Baly, 1864 * Platycorynus costipennis (Chen, 1940) * Platycorynus cribratellus (Fairmaire, 1885) * Platycorynus cumingi Baly, 1864 * Platycorynus cupreoviridis Tan, 1992 * Platycorynus cupreatus (Baly, 1867) * Platycorynus cupreus Baly, 1864 * Platycorynus cyanicollis (Olivier, 1791) * Platycorynus davidi (Lefèvre, 1887) * Platycorynus decemnotatus (Baly, 1860) * Platycorynus dejeani Bertoloni, 1849 * Platycorynus deletus (Lefèvre, 1890) * Platycorynus dentatus Tan, 1982 * Platycorynus descarpentriesi (Selman, 1970) * Platycorynus discoidalis (Jacoby, 1898) * Platycorynus dohrni Baly, 1864 * Platycorynus egenus (Lefèvre, 1887) * Platycorynus egregrius (Lefèvre, 1885) * Platycorynus elegantulus Baly, 1864 * Platycorynus fabricii Baly, 1864 * Platycorynus faroogi (Abdullah & Qureshi, 1969) * Platycorynus fraternus Baly, 1864 * Platycorynus fulgurans (Marshall, 1865) * Platycorynus fuscoaeneus Baly, 1864 * Platycorynus gibbosus (Chen, 1934) * Platycorynus grahami Gressitt & Kimoto, 1961 * Platycorynus gratiosus Baly, 1864 * Platycorynus hijau Medvedev & Takizawa, 2011 * Platycorynus hirsutus (Jacoby, 1895) * Platycorynus igneicollis (Hope, 1843) * Platycorynus igneipennis (Baly, 1867) * Platycorynus igneofasciatus (Baly, 1860) * Platycorynus ignitus Baly, 1864 * Platycorynus impressicollis (Jacoby, 1908) * Platycorynus indigaceus Chevrolat, 1841 * Platycorynus iridescens (Berlioz, 1917) * Platycorynus janthinus (Marshall, 1865) * Platycorynus japonicus (Jacoby, 1896) ** Platycorynus japonicus japonicus (Jacoby, 1896) ** Platycorynus japonicus umebayanashii Kimoto, 1974 * Platycorynus kivuensis (Burgeon, 1940) * Platycorynus laeviusculus (Lefèvre, 1888) * Platycorynus laosensis Kimoto & Gressitt, 1982 * Platycorynus lateralis (Hope, 1831) * Platycorynus latus (Pic, 1934) * Platycorynus lefevrei (Jacoby, 1895) * Platycorynus limbatus (Baly, 1881) ** Platycorynus limbatus congoensis (Burgeon, 1940) ** Platycorynus limbatus limbatus (Baly, 1881) * Platycorynus longicornis Baly, 1864 * Platycorynus lorquini (Baly, 1867) * Platycorynus malachiticus (Marshall, 1865) * Platycorynus marginalis (Weise, 1912) ** Platycorynus marginalis luluensis (Burgeon, 1940) ** Platycorynus marginalis marginalis (Weise, 1912) * Platycorynus marshalli Baly, 1864 * Platycorynus mentaweiensis (Jacoby, 1896) * Platycorynus micans (Chen, 1934) * Platycorynus micheli (Lesne, 1900) * Platycorynus modestus (Jacoby, 1908) * Platycorynus monstrosus (Baly, 1867) * Platycorynus mouhoti Baly, 1864 * Platycorynus multicostatus (Jacoby, 1895) * Platycorynus mutabilis Baly, 1864 * Platycorynus nasiri (Abdullah & Qureshi, 1969) * Platycorynus niger (Chen, 1940) ** Platycorynus niger niger (Chen, 1940) ** Platycorynus niger yunnanensis Tan, 1982 * Platycorynus nigripes (J.

He was born in Ham-Nord, Quebec, the son of Alfred Demers and Rose Anna Dufresne, and was educated in Victoriaville. In 1912, his father and mother moved to Debden, Saskatchewan; they were one of the first families to settle in the area. They convinced Omer and his brother Adelbert to move to Debden. The two brothers arrived with a boxcar full of supplies and, soon after arriving, built a store which included living quarters. In 1914, Omer married Lucienne Larose. With his business going well, he soon built a larger store and residence. Demers helped open the first school in the town in 1915 and helped establish a Catholic parish. He also served as postmaster from 1912 to 1919. In 1920, Demers became the first mayor of Debden. He sold the store after his wife developed tuberculosis. After she recovered, she opened a women's clothing store in Debden. Demers took up ranching and then muskrat ranching; both ventures were not successful. He was defeated by Albert Victor Sterling when he ran for reelection to the assembly in 1944. In 1945, Demers moved to British Columbia. He died in Esquimalt at the age of 75.

She was a member of the first class of women admitted to Harvard Divinity School, and one of the first women ordained in the United Presbyterian Church. After earning a doctorate in theology at Union Theological Seminary, she joined the faculty at Yale Divinity School, where she taught for 28 years. Russell was a pioneer in the field of feminist theology. She authored, co-authored or edited over 17 books, including: Feminist Interpretation of the Bible (1985), Inheriting our Mothers' Garden: Feminist Theology in Third World Perspective (1988), Church in the Round: Feminist Interpretation of the Church (1993), and Dictionary of Feminist Theologies (1996). She has been described as a \\"prominent matriarch of contemporary feminist bible criticism.\\" She was also active in the ecumenical movement, and worked closely with the National Council of Churches, the World Council of Churches, and the YWCA.  Biography  =Early Life= Letty Mandeville Russell was born in Westfield, New Jersey on September 20, 1929. She was the second of three daughters born to Miriam (née Towl) and Ricketson B. Russell. Her mother gave up a professional career as a bacteriologist to care for her children; before her children were born, she worked on a floating hospital in New York during World War I. Russell's father worked as a trade-show salesman. Russell attended Wellesley College, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in biblical history and philosophy in 1951. After graduation, she taught third grade in Connecticut for one academic year. Late in 1952, Russell moved to New York to begin work as the director of Christian Education at Mount Morris-Ascension Church, one of four churches in the East Harlem Protestant Parish. She worked in Harlem until 1955, before leaving to attend seminary. = Parish Ministry, Harvard Divinity School and Ordination = In 1955, she was admitted to Harvard Divinity School after appealing their male-only admission policy. She was one of eight women admitted to the school that year, in a reversal of long-standing opposition to women's inclusion in the ministry preparatory program. Russell graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Sacred Theology (S.T.B.) in 1958. In 1958, Russell was the first women ordained in her presbytery in the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. Only three years prior, the denomination had voted in their General Assembly to allow the ordination of women to the Word and Sacrament. Following her ordination, she returned to the East Harlem Protestant Parish (EHPP) in 1958, to serve as pastor at Mount Morris-Ascension Church, where she served for the next ten years. Russell's ministry focused on leadership development with the mostly Black and Hispanic members of the congregation to become leaders in the parish and the community. Her experiences in Harlem contributed to her personal and professional commitments to marginalized communities. = Academic Career and Yale Divinity School = Returning to graduate school, Russell earned a Master of Sacred Theology (S.T.M.) from Union Theological Seminary in New York in Christian education and theology in 1967. Two years later, Russell completed her Doctor of Theology (Th.D.) in mission theology and ecumenics from Union. In the fall of 1969, Russell began her academic career as assistant professor of Religious Studies at Manhattan College, Bronx, New York where she taught Protestant theology. She began teaching at Yale University Divinity School in 1974 where she would teach for the next 28 years. She began as an assistant professor of theology, and was promoted to Professor of Theology in 1985. She officially retired in 2001, but she continued to teach a few courses at Yale Divinity School as an emerita professor. =Ecumenism= Russell was a leader in the ecumenical movement and she served on several units of the World Council of Churches, including the Faith and Order Commission from 1975-1983 and was one of the drafters of the document \\"Giving Account of the Hope Together\\" (Bangalore, India, 1978). She also worked with the National Council of Churches, including the Task Force on the Bible and Sexism; and Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the successor to the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America. She also served as a consultant to the U.S. Working Group on the participation of Women in the World Council of Churches and as religious consultant to the National Board of the YWCA. =Death= Russell died of cancer on July 12, 2007. She was survived by her spouse, Shannon Clarkson.  Contribution to the field  =Theology= Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza, the Krister Stendahl Professor at Harvard Divinity School, said, \\"She pioneered feminist theology not only in theology and ethics but also in biblical studies.... Letty was not only a great liberation theologian but also a great church-woman. She knew how to utilize the resources of church and university for nurturing a feminist movement around the world.... As a skilled organizer she worked tirelessly for wo/men and feminist liberation theology.\\" =Ecclesiology= In an introduction to a Festschrift published in Russell's honor in 1999 under the title Liberating Eschatology, fellow Yale Divinity School theologians Margaret Farley and Serene Jones called Russell's influence on contemporary theology \\"monumental\\" and wrote of her \\"uncanny ability to articulate a vision of the church that is radical in its feminist- liberationist critique but that nonetheless remains anchored in the historic traditions and communities of the Christian church.\\" In one of her last major public addresses, the annual Paul Tillich Lecture delivered at Harvard University in May 2006, Russell spoke to the role of the Church in confronting injustice. She said, \\"Our struggle is to overcome the fear of difference and to break the bars that keep us apart. [Others] want what we want. They want to work, they want to change the social structure. They want hospitality with justice.\\" =Feminist Pedagogy= At Yale Divinity School, Russell's influence extended far beyond the confines of classrooms on Sterling Divinity Quadrangle. She was the inspiration behind creation of the school's international travel seminar program—now known as \\"The Letty Russell Travel Seminar\\"— under which Yale Divinity School students have traveled to countries around the globe for direct encounters with the realities of religion on the world stage, frequently in impoverished countries. Yale Divinity School Dean Harold Attridge said that, through the travel seminar, Russell’s “legacy of commitment to a universal vision of engaged theology will continue as a vital part of Yale Divinity School.” Farley said about Russell, \\"She leaves a legacy of wisdom, integrity, and indomitable hope. Voices will rise from women and men throughout the world to bear witness to her gifts to them, not the least of which is her gift of faithful friendship... There is perhaps no other feminist theologian who has been more dedicated to ecumenical, interfaith, and international theological dialogue. Hers has been the influence not of imposition but of partnership. Yet her work has challenged everyone, not only because of its substance but because of her own commitment to making the world both more just and more hospitable.\\" =International Feminist Scholarship= Throughout her career, Russell developed multiple initiatives to facilitate dialogue among feminist scholars, particularly scholars from traditionally under-represented communities. She was on the World Council of Churches steering group that developed the program Being Church: Women's Voices and Visions, which held a series of regional discussions on feminist ecclesiology between 2000-2005. She was instrumental in establishing the Doctor of Ministries in Feminist Theologies Programme, which is a joint theological education programme between the World Council of Churches and San Francisco Theological Seminary, USA. Russell described the goal of this program as empowering women \\"from countries of the South as they become leaders in their communities and therefore subjects of their own theology and history.\\" A global advocate for women, Russell was a member of the Yale Divinity School Women's Initiative on Gender, Faith, and Responses to HIV/AIDS in Africa and was co-coordinator of the International Feminist Doctor of Ministry Program at San Francisco Theological Seminary.

It is considered one of the most popular boleros released during the Cuban musical movement led by pianists. The song has been recorded by several performers, including Roberto Carlos, Diego El Cigala, Fania All-Stars, Eydie Gormé, Danny Rivera, Tito Rodríguez and Bebo Valdés, among others. In the song, the protagonist kisses different lips looking for new sensations, haunted by the memory of a past love. The song has experienced popular acclaim, especially with the version recorded by Mexican singer Luis Miguel on his album Romance released in 1991. This version peaked at the top of the Billboard Top Latin Songs chart in the United States, and the album was deemed as responsible for reviving the bolero genre. Background and composition \\"Inolvidable\\" was written by Cuban pianist Julio Gutiérrez. Gutiérrez was born in Manzanillo, Cuba, and at age six he played piano and at 14 he directed his own orchestra. In 1940, the Orchestra Casino de la Playa toured eastern Cuba, and on that tour Miguelito Valdés met Gutiérrez and suggested he should go to the capital (Havana), where better opportunities would arise. Months later, Gutiérrez moved to the capital, and was hired as a pianist in the orchestra Casino de la Playa. \\"Inolvidable\\", written in 1944,Luis Miguel Romance (Liner Notes) Warner (1991) was released during the Cuban musical movement led by pianists, in which Gutiérrez participated. Two songs composed by Gutiérrez, \\"Inolvidable\\" and \\"Llanto de Luna\\" (\\"Crying Moon\\"), were highly successful boleros in Latin America. In 1992, a compilation album including an instrumental version of the song performed by Gutiérrez was released. Musically \\"Inolvidable\\" is a bolero. According to Rodrigo Bazán, in his book Y Si Vivo Cien Años... Antología del Bolero en México, the song was not different from others that were released at the time about unhappy love, but differed from other popular genres that based their lyrics on the lack of love such as tango. With the song, Julio Gutiérrez joined the list of prominent boleristas in Cuba. Lyrically, the song presents the protagonist kissing different lips and looking for new sensations (\\"He besado otras bocas buscando nuevas ansiedades\\"). Performers In 1963, Tito Rodríguez recorded \\"Inolvidable\\" on his album From Tito Rodríguez with Love. The song became very successful, selling one-and-a-half million units. Musical ensemble Fania All- Stars released their first studio album Tribute to Tito Rodríguez in 1976 and included a cover version of \\"Inolvidable\\". The album was originally intended to feature the group in a supporting role for Rodríguez, but resulted in a tribute album after the singer died from leukemia in early 1973. Brazilian singer-songwriter Roberto Carlos included his version of the song on the album Quero Que Vá Tudo Pro Inferno in 1975. Puerto-Rican Danny Rivera recorded a tribute album titled Inolvidable Tito: A Mi Me Pasa lo Mismo Que a Usted, including a version of \\"Inolvidable\\".Danny Rivera Inolvidable Tito: A Mi Me Pasa lo Mismo Que a Usted (Liner Notes) DNA (1986) The album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Latin Pop Performance. In 1988, American singer Eydie Gormé had her version of the track on the album De Corazón a Corazón. Cuban pianist Bebo Valdés and Spanish flamenco performer Diego El Cigala recorded the track for their collaborative album Lágrimas Negras. The album was produced in 2003 by Academy Award winner Fernando Trueba, sold 200,000 units in Spain and won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Traditional Tropical Album. Paloma San Basilio recorded \\"Inolvidable\\" on her album Invierno Sur released in January 2007. =Luis Miguel version= Mexican singer Luis Miguel released the 1991 album Romance, which was produced by Miguel and Mexican singer-songwriter Armando Manzanero, and included a selection of classic boleros. The success of the album revived the interest for bolero, even though the new musical arrangements of the songs make them unrecognizable. Romance received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Latin Pop Album (which it lost to Jon Secada's Otro Día Más Sin Verte), was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and sold seven million copies worldwide. The first single taken from the album was \\"Inolvidable\\", a version that according to Carlos Monsiváis in his book Los Rituales del Caos, guarantees \\"the adoption of the past, and that the romantic sensibility is not dead.\\" The track debuted in the Billboard Top Latin Songs chart (formerly Hot Latin Tracks) at number 30 in the week of November 23, 1991, climbing to the top ten three weeks later. \\"Inolvidable\\" peaked at number one on January 25, 1992, spending five weeks at the top of the chart. The song was number three on the Billboard Top Latin Songs Year-End Chart of 1992. In Mexico, the song and the following single (\\"No Sé Tú\\") remained in the top of the charts for six months altogether. Miguel's cover was recognized as one of the award-winning songs at the 1994 BMI Latin awards. A live version of \\"Inolvidable\\" was included on the EP América & En Vivo in 1992 and as a part of a medley with the rest of the singles taken from Romance on the live album Vivo (2000).

He was Duke of Ratibor and Kronov jointly with his brother Nicholas V from 1424 to 1437 and the sole Duke of Ratibor from 1437 until his death.  Life  His parents were John II \\"the Iron\\" and his wife Helen of Lithuania, a niece of King Jogaila of Poland. Wenceslaus fought together with his father and other Silesian princes on the Polish side against the Teutonic Knights in the Hunger War in 1414. Although Wenceslaus and his older brother Nicholas V were probably already adults when their father died in 1424, their mother, Helen of Lithuania, acted as regent until 1428. From 1428 to 1449, she styled herself as Lady of Pleß; presumably Pleß was her Wittum. From 1428 to 1437, Wenceslaus and Nicholas V ruled their territory jointly. In 1437, it was divided, with Wenceslaus taking Ratibor and Nicholas taking Duchy of Krnov, Bruntál, Rybnik, Pleß and Baborów. In late 1437, a majority of the Bohemian Estates elected Albert II from the House of Habsburg as the new King of Bohemia. A minority favoured his eleven-year-old rival Casimir, the son of King Jogaila of Poland. In 1438, Poland invaded Silesia and devastated the Duchies of Opole and Ratibor. After this, Duke Wenceslaus of Ratibor, as well as Duke Wenceslaus I of Zator and his brothers Duke Przemysław of Toszek and Duke Jan IV of Oświęcim, were willing to accept Casimir as King, under certain conditions. Nevertheless, all Silesian Dukes paid homage to Albert II in Wrocław in November 1438.Rudolf Žáček: Dějiny Slezska v datech, p. 104. After Nicholas V died in 1452, Wenceslaus took up the guardianship over his underage sons John IV \\"the Elder\\" and Wenceslaus III, jointly with their step-mother, Barbara Rockenberg, until 1464. From 1452 to 1462, she styled herself Lady of Pleß; presumably Pleß was her Wittum. Duke Wenceslaus of Ratibor died in 1456 and was buried in the church of the Dominican monastery at Ratibor.  Marriage and issue  In 1437, Wencelsaus married Margaret (d. 1464), a daughter of Vincent of Szamotuły, Castellan of Międzyrzecz and widow of Casimir II of Belz.

The tools developed by DELPH-IN adopt two linguistic formalisms for deep linguistic analysis, viz. head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) and minimal recursion semantics (MRS).Ann Copestake, Dan Flickinger, Carl Pollard and Ivan A. Sag. 2005. Minimal Recursion Semantics: An Introduction. In Proceedings of Research on Language and Computation. All tools under the DELPH-IN collaboration are developed for general use of open-source licensing. Since 2005, DELPH-IN has held an annual summit. This is a loosely structured unconference where people update each other about the work they are doing, seek feedback on current work, and occasionally hammer out agreement on standards and best practice.  DELPH-IN technologies and resources  The DELPH-IN collaboration has been progressively building computational tools for deep linguistic analysis, such as: * LKB system (Linguistic Knowledge Builder): a grammar engineering environment where linguists can build unification grammars with the Head- driven Phrase Structure Grammar formalism * PET parser (Platform for Experimentation with efficient HPSG processing Techniques): an open source parser which produces HPSG parse trees with Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) outputs PET Parser website * ACE processor (Answer Constraint Engine): an efficient system to process DELPH-IN grammars that provide HPSG syntactic parses with MRS outputs. The latest version of ACE is able to generate natural language sentences.ACE parser/generator homepage * LOGON infrastructure is a collection of software and DELPH-IN grammars to provide transfer-based machine translation. The LOGON approach to machine translation has proven to provide quality oriented hybrid (rule-based and stochastic) translations.Stephan Oepen, Erik Velldal, Jan Tore Lønning, Paul Meurer, Victoria Rosén, and Dan Flickinger. 2007.Towards hybrid quality-oriented machine translation.

Following the 2006 Thai coup d'état by the Royal Thai Army, he became a key organizer of the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship opposed to it. He was forced to step down after allegations of lèse majesté, a legal weapon commonly used in Thailand to silence dissent, and has been in exile since the 2009 Thai political unrest. Early life and education Born in Bangkok to a middle- class family of five, Jakrapob was educated at Kasetsart University Laboratory School and Chulalongkorn University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science, before completing a master's degree at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies of Johns Hopkins University as a Fulbright scholar. He later received a doctor's degree from the same university. Foreign ministry and media career His return from the United States in 1994 was followed by a short stint at the Charoen Pokphand Group, after which he entered the foreign ministry’s information department, although he soon resigned following a dispute with his superiors.Open Letter to Jakrapob Penkair He then found employment as a news analyst at PTV. Political career Jakrapob's rise to prominence began in 2003 when Thaksin Shinawatra appointed him government spokesperson. He became a close aide to the prime minister, and in 2005 ran as a Thai Rak Thai candidate in that year's general election. In the aftermath of the coup which ousted Thaksin, Jakrapob became a key organiser of the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD). In the wake of the People's Power Party's 2007 electoral victory Jakrapob gained a place on Samak Sundaravej's cabinet. On April 1, 2008 he was appointed an executive of two state-owned television channels with a mandate to reform them.Jakrapob spearheads Channel 11 revamp and new \\"flexibility\\" Allegations of lèse majesté Although he was careful to keep his criticisms of King Bhumibol oblique, Jakrapob's known republicanism,The Tragedy of King Bhumibol however, rankled the military and its equally paranoid royalist establishment allies, and they were keen to see him removed from office. Their chance came with the circulation of Thai translations of a speech Jakrapob gave in English at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Thailand in August 2007. Because the speech, which was a critique of Thailand's perennial culture of patronage, directly attacked privy council president Prem Tinsulanonda, it provoked an outcry from the Democrats, who accused him of having insulted the palace.Police to summon Jakrapob for allegedly lese majeste Although he held a press conference to profess his loyalty to the monarchy, Jakrapob readily admitted his opposition to the royal family to the United States embassy as well as his participation in the dissemination of anti-monarchist ideas at the grassroots level in order to prepare for an eventual alteration of Thailand's political order. Thaksin and Samak failed to support Jakrapob, however, leading him to resign on May 8, 2008. UDD role and exile Despite the negative publicity Jakrapob remained an outspoken political activities and continued to be a tireless participant in UDD activities. He became associated with the movement's radical wing and soon formed a splinter group known as \\"Red Siam\\" with former communist Surachai Danwattananusorn.\\"Red Siam\\" adds revolutionary twist to Thai crisis Because the group became much maligned for allegedly promoting violent revolution and the dismantlement of the monarchy the mainstream UDD was forced to sever ties with Jakrapob and his allies.Red shirts not condone Jakrapob splinter group Surachai was sentenced to 7 1/2 years in prison in 2012 for lèse majesté, but was pardoned by the king in October 2013. Jakrapob went into hiding following the Songkran riots, vowing to carry out a more robust campaign against the government of Abhisit Vejjajiva and his establishment patrons.Thai protesters 'plan new action' Although still living in exile, he publicly resurfaced in May 2012 as a columnist for Red Power, a red shirt publication with republican leanings. Jakrapob also wrote for another similar magazine, The Voice of Taksin, under the pseudonym \\"Jit Pollachan\\". Two of his fictional stories, which were thinly-veiled portrayals of the king and the royal family, were used by the Thai Constitutional Court of Thailand to convict Somyot Prueksakasemsuk of lèse majesté. Despite his known republicanism, in an interview with Prachatai, he toned down his stance, expressing his admiration for the monarchy as a historical institution and a medium for national unity. He nevertheless restated his adamant belief that the monarchy needs to be depoliticised.

With the contacts he had made working in the grocer industry and the knowledge he had gained, he launched his first journal, The Grocer in 1862, from his premises based in Bow Lane, London. The Grocer gave readers the latest news and analysis of the trade. A year later the Wine Trade Review launched as a supplement to The Grocer. By 1864, Reed targeted the brewing industry with Brewers Journal, and its supplement, Hop & Malt Trades Review and in 1868 he had added Tobacco Trade Review to his company's magazine line up. Reed died in 1920; at that time The Grocer was his company's best known publication, and was used by the Ministry of Food to make announcements. After Reed's death his publishing company continued to be operated by his son. In 2011, William Reed acquired him! a research based retail consultancy. It bought also The Publican and merged it with its Morning Advertiser title to form The Publican's Morning Advertiser (the name was changed back to The Morning Advertiser in 2016). That year the company showed a turnover of about £27 million and profit of about £1,668,000. The company had 266 employees.

In the first half of the 17th century, Kakhetian king Teimuraz I had conducted resistance against his Persian overlords, which culminated in the bloody and devastating years of the mid-1610s; after successfully repelling an expedition sent by Shah Abbas I, Kakheti was invaded once again by the Shah himself in 1616, much of its population massacred or deported. In the following years, Qizilbash lords were appointed as governors of Kakheti, while a large number of Qizilbash tribal folk were relocated to Georgia in order to strengthen the central control. In the early 1630s, the Persians tried to put Kakheti under control of the more submissive Kingdom of Kartli, led by Georgian prince Rostom, a convert to Islam. When such control had been installed, and Teimuraz had fled to Western Georgia, in the 1650s, a policy of colonisation of Kakheti by Qizilbash Turcoman tribes was decided by the Persians, for a number of reasons. One of these reasons was to repopulate this part of the province, while another one was to keep an eye on the restive nobles. Yet another reason was due to the fact that the Safavid possessions in Georgia were geographically close to the Daghestan province. From Daghestan, Lezgian marauders frequently organized raids into parts of the northwestern Safavid domains, including Safavid Georgia. Lastly, it was also decided as a measure against Russia, which had increased its pressure on Daghestan (see also; Russo-Persian War of 1651-1653), a neighboring province of the Georgia province. The forced installation of the Qizilbash was the immediate motive for the uprising. Kakheti had been divided in two administrative regions: the south-eastern part was under the power of the beglarbeg of Karabakh, the rest under that of Nakhchivan. Up to 80,000 Turcomans migrated to Kakheti. They started building a fortress at Bakhtrioni, and transforming the ancient monastery of Alaverdi into one. The uprising was, as in 1615, inspired by the main noble families who had remained faithful to Teimuraz I. However, according to Georgian accounts, the mass of the population took part in it, as they were being evicted of their villages and farms by the incomers. The Eristavi Zaal, Duke of Aragvi, one of the main feudal lords in Kakheti, a former supporter of Teimuraz who had made allegiance to Rostom and the Persians in 1648 and thus gained even more power, took the lead of the uprising. Among the leaders were also Bidzina Choloqashvili, Shalva, Eristavi of Ksani, and his brother Elizbar Eristvisshvili. Georgian mountain people, such as the Tushs, the Khevsurians and the Pshavs, also joined the rebellion, under the leadership of Zezva Gaprindauli, Nadir Khosharauli, and Gogolauri. The Georgian forces, once united, attacked the Turcoman fortresses at Bakhtrioni and Alaverdi and vanquished them. They then defeated Turcoman forces in other places of Kakheti. However, the weak organisation and isolation of the rebels allowed the Persians, now under personal direction of Shah Abbas II, to successfully counter-attack and defeat them. The Eristavi Zaal was murdered by his own nephews at the order of the shah, and his children sent to the Persian court. Upon those news, Bidzina Choloqashvili, Shalva of Ksani and Elizbar Eristvisshvili asked the shah for forgiveness, but he had them delivered to the tribes that the insurgees had massacred earlier. They were tortured and put to death. They would be canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church. Kakheti remained under Persian rule, even if the rebels had succeeded in defeating the Turcomans, who did not remain in the region In 1664, the Persians agreed to have Archil (Shah-Nazar Khan), son of the king/vali of Kartli, installed as king/vali of Kakheti. The uprising soon entered Georgian collective memory, and many songs and poems were composed about it, while the mountain warriors became well-known folk heroes. The battle at Bakhtrioni, and the heroism of the mountaineers, inspired Vazha-Pshavela his epic poem Bakhtrioni (1892), while Akaki Tsereteli wrote a whole novel about it, Bashi-Achuki.

She published works under the names Alice E. Gillington, Betty Gillington and The Romany Rawny. Gillington published early works of poetry with her sister, May Byron, before moving into a caravan and living with local Gypsy folk. She joined the Gypsy Lore Society and went on to publish books about Gypsies, collections of their folklore, folk songs and singing games. Although she corresponded with the Folk-Song Society, she never joined. Early life Gillington's father was chaplain at the Brookwood asylum Alice Gillington was born in 1863 at Audlem, Cheshire to John Maurice Gillington and Sarah Dumville Gillington. She was the second of four children with an older sister, Mary Clarissa Gillington and two younger brothers, George William Gillington and John Louis Gillington. Her Dublin-born father was an aspiring clergyman, then working as a clerk, whilst her was mother born in Huyton, Lancashire. The family moved to Bisley, Surrey when her father found a role as a chaplain at the Brookwood Hospital, the local asylum. In 1892, Alice and her sister published a book of poems, dedicated to their parents. It included some poems that they had published previously in other books. Alice went on to write other poems such as The Doom-Bar, about the Doom Bar sand bank in Cornwall, which were included in A Victorian Anthology, 1837 – 1895. Gypsy work Gillington produced a collection of Gypsy folktales in 1903, and went on to join the Gypsy Lore Society a few years later. It was there that she caught the eye of Augustus John and John Sampson. She gradually moved into a caravan and by 1911 had fully migrated into \\"The Brown Caravan,\\" together with her brother John who was in \\"The Yellow Caravan,\\" and remained living as a nomad for the remainder of her days. Often she would set up camp with different Gypsy groups, sometimes away from them, but her brother was always nearby. Whilst living with the Gypsies, Gillington published a number of collections of their folk songs and singing games. She attempted to contribute to the Folk-Song Society's journal by sending songs to Lucy Broadwood, though was unsuccessful. Later though, Robert Andrew Scott Macfie contacted her to ensure she kept collecting folk songs. Gillington was secretive about her time with the Gypsies, trying to keep her life with them separate from her old life. She complained in letters about afternoon visitors and specifically stated in one \\"I never want my Komalesti's to know I write about them.\\" Gillington eventually died of a stroke on 22 May 1934 in Poole, Dorset.

In February 1914, he was appointed to the post of Governor-General of Australia and thus resigned his seat. Electoral history This was the result at the last election; Ferguson The result of the previous election is worth noting because it was a three-way contest; Candidates Bell *Malcolm Smith was chosen as the Liberal candidate to defend the seat. A local businessman, he became the Provost of Leith in 1908. *George Welsh Currie was chosen as the Unionist candidate. He had been born and raised in Edinburgh. *William Walker the previous Labour candidate had taken a job as a Civil Servant which precluded him from standing for parliament. Joseph Nicholas Bell was chosen by the Labour Party as their candidate. He was sponsored by the National Amalgamated Union of Labour. Campaign Labour's intervention was expected to hurt the Liberals, but there was evidence that they might still win a three-way contest; Although Labour had not stood here last time, a Labour candidate had contested the January 1910 general election, finishing third and polling 18.9%. Although Bell was a moderate in Labour Party terms, his campaign was run by extreme Socialists. Bell explained his position by stating he was a Socialist and he was selected by the working class bodies of Leith. The Seamans Union Leader Havelock Wilson visited the constituency to speak in support of the Liberal candidate and was involved in an exchange with the Socialist Emmanuel Shinwell who sought court action for alleged slander with £1,000 for damages.Scottish Notes, Justice 26 February 1914, page 6 Result Currie *The change in vote share and swing are compared to the previous three- way contest in January 1910. Aftermath A General Election was due to take place by the end of 1915. By the summer of 1914, the following candidates had been adopted to contest that election. Due to the outbreak of war, the election never took place. The Leith Burghs seat was abolished and mainly replaced for the 1918 elections by Leith. Smith did not contest the 1918 elections but was elected MP for Orkney & Shetland in 1921. Bell became Labour's prospective candidate for the new seat of Leith but was replaced at the eleventh hour. *Currie was the endorsed candidate of the Coalition Government. References * Craig, F. W.

Having served two terms as the youngest ever Secretary General of the European Movement International, he served as Director of European Friends of Armenia (EuFoA), an International NGO seeking to build bridges between Armenia and the EU between 2016 and 2018, and as Political Advisor to Maria Joao Rodrigues, Vice-President of the S&D; Group in the European Parliament, from April 2018 to July 2019. Diogo Pinto was awarded the class “Commander” of the Order of Prince Henry for services in the expansion of the Portuguese culture, its history and its values. He lives in Brussels, and he often speaks at public events, gives interviews and publishes opinions. Education and early career Diogo Pinto grew up in Guimarães, Portugal, after his family moved to the city in 1980. He initiated his studies at Santa Luzia Primary School, moving directly to second grade, and went on to win an award for academic merit, delivered by Sociedade Martins Sarmento, when he was only 8. For his secondary studies, Diogo Pinto, attended, first, Escola Secundaria Francisco de Holanda and, later, Escola Secundaria Martins Sarmento; in both schools, he was not only recognised as one of the best students, but also known for his extra-curricular activities: as a volleyball player in the youth teams of the defunct Desportivo Francisco de Holanda, and a youth leader in the local chapter of Movimento Catolico de Estudantes (MCE). In 1992, in his senior year, Diogo Pinto was elected President of the Guimarães’ Municipal Youth Council. That same year, Diogo Pinto moved to Lisbon to pursue his studies, and joined the national leadership of MCE, first as Deputy National Coordinator and, one year later, as National Coordinator of MCE. In 1995, at 20 years-old, Diogo Pinto was elected President of the Portuguese National Youth Council (CNJ), position in which he served parallel to his studies of Sociology at the Instituto Superior de Ciências do Trabalho e da Empresa (ISCTE-IUL). He was President of CNJ until February 1998; soon after his resignation, Diogo Pinto became one of the coordinators of the World Youth Festival’98, which took place in Portugal later that same year. In 1999, he went back to CNJ, first as Project Officer for the 2000 Portuguese Presidency of the European Union and, later, as Board Advisor. Diogo Pinto became National Director of Intercultura (AFS) Portugal in 2001. Career at European Youth Forum In 2005, Diogo Pinto was elected Secretary General of the European Youth Forum, the platform of youth organisations in Europe, representing more than 100 national youth councils and international non- governmental youth organisations, and bringing together tens of millions of young people from all over Europe. The Youth Forum works to empower young people to participate actively in society and strives for youth rights in international institutions such as the European Union, the Council of Europe and the United Nations. Nominated as a candidate by both EFIL – European Federation of Intercultural Learning and CNJ – the Portuguese National Youth Council, Diogo Pinto won a close election and took office on May 11, 2005. As Secretary General of the Youth Forum, Diogo Pinto led a team of more than 20 staff, and worked alongside three different Presidents, for two consecutive terms, until the end of May 2009. During his tenure, the Youth Forum achieved, among others, the adoption of the European Youth Pact, the emergence and consolidation of the EU Structured Dialogue on Youth, and the recognition, by and in the Lisbon Treaty, of specific youth rights to participation in the EU decision-making processes; at the level of the Council of Europe, the successful implementation of the “All Different, All Equal” Campaign Against racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and intolerance, and the adoption of “The Future of the Council of Europe youth policy: Agenda 2020” Declaration are both worth mentioning. Last but not least, in 2007, in Lisbon, the Youth Forum co-organised the 1st Europe-Africa Youth Summit, thus inaugurating a new era of cooperation among youth organisations at the global level. During his two terms, Diogo Pinto organised big events of the Youth Forum in several cities all over Europe, such as Baku, Brussels, Castelldefels, Prato, Rotterdam and Vilnius, and he attended conferences, meetings and other activities in more than 40 countries in 4 different continents. Career at European Movement International In June 2009, in Prague, Diogo Pinto was appointed Secretary General of the European Movement International (EMI), the largest pan-European network of pro-European organisations with more than 70 Member Organisations, bringing together European civil society, business, trade unions, NGOs, political parties, local authorities and academia. Created in 1948 as a follow-up to the Hague Congress of Europe, which took place in The Hague and was presided by Winston Churchill, the European Movement’s first major achievement was the creation of the Council of Europe in 1949. The European Movement was also responsible for the creation of the College of Europe in Bruges and the European Centre for Culture in Geneva. One of its major accomplishments during the 1950s and throughout the 1990s was the setting-up of a network of pro-European organisations and think-tanks in almost every European country. After more than 60 years of playing an essential role in the process of European integration, and in times of European crisis, the European Movement felt the need to reform itself, and develop and implement new structures and procedures. This task was entrusted to the new Secretary General. As a result of this, the organisation grew in Members and expanded to new countries, improved its financial health, and managed to consolidate its reputation among pro-European circles, the European institutions and other civil society organisations. During his first term, important projects and events took place, such as the 2ndhttp://casa-mediterraneo.es/wp- content/uploads/2010/02/conclusionesen.pdf and 3rdhttp://www.wfot.org/Portals/0/PDF/Invitation%20Letter%20to%20Tunis%20Congress.pdf Congresses of the North-South Mediterranean Dialogue for a Shared Vision of the Future (Alicante and Tunis, respectively), the EMI Congress on Civil Society in Candidate and Potential Candidate Countrieshttp://europeanmovement.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Istanbul- Congress_Final_Report.pdf (Istanbul) and the EMI Congress on Eastern Partnership Countrieshttp://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/81397/ (Yerevan), as well as the first ever statutory meeting held outside the EU (Belgrade). During this time, the voice of the EMI was also heard on diverse topics such as the new institutional architecture created by the Treaty of Lisbon, climate protection, poverty and social exclusion, the establishment of the European Citizens' Initiative, European economic governance and the economic crisis, enlargement of the EU, etc. Diogo Pinto was appointed for a second three-year term as Secretary General, at the EMI Federal Assembly meeting held in Brussels on 26 May 2012http://europeanmovement.eu/press_release/emi-federal- assembly-re-appoints-diogo-pinto-as-secretary-general-and-adopts-new-policy- positions/. In this term, less focus was given to big events and more efforts were put into growing and consolidating the network, developing policies and campaigns. Building-up on the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to the EU, and the first signs of the end of austerity policies, the EMI started looking beyond the crisis and addressed topics such as the need for democratic reforms in the EU, in connection with the EP 2014 Elections. Throughout the six years of his two terms, Diogo Pinto served alongside two EMI Presidents: Pat Cox and Jo Leinen. Besides the events already mentioned, he organised EMI meetings in cities such as Athens, Dublin, Nicosia, Riga, Rome, Toledo, The Hague and Warsaw, and further visited and attended events in his capacity as Secretary General of the EMI in more than 30 countries.

Municipally, it is incorporated as Proletarskoye Urban Settlement in Novgorodsky Municipal District, one of the four urban settlements in the district. Population: History The settlement was first mentioned in 1495 as Seltso u Nishi. At that point, it was a part of Derevskaya Pyatina of Novgorod Lands. In 1835, a windmill was built here by the engineer and landowner Kazimir Raykhel (Casimir Reichel). The area became known as Novaya Melnitsa, which means \\"The New Mill\\". In 1885, his son, Pyotr Raykhel, built a porcelain factory. In 1892, the factory was sold to Ivan Kuznetsov.

It was commissioned on 30 April 2012. History The Indian Navy has deployed detachments to the Lakshadweep Islands since independence. The Lakshadweep islands were a part of the Madras Presidency under the British Raj and in accordance with the Indian Independence Act 1947, enacted by the British parliament, the islands were transferred to the new Union of India. Though the Madras Presidency had an overwhelming Hindu majority, the islands had a Muslim majority. Hence, it seemed possible that the new dominion of Pakistan might seek to lay claim to the islands. On the orders of Vallabhbhai Patel, the first Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India, a ship of the Royal Indian Navy was sent to the islands to hoist the Indian national flag and ensure the islands' integration into the Union of India. Hours after the arrival of the Indian ship, vessels of the Royal Pakistan Navy were seen near the islands, but after observing Indian naval presence they returned to Karachi. The navy has maintained permanent facilities on Kavaratti island since the 1980s. The islands are en route on vital shipping lanes from the Indian mainland to the Persian Gulf. With increasing threats, such as attacks by Somali pirates, the island territory has grown in relevance to Indian security considerations. INS Dweeprakshak was hence commissioned to provide support facilities for naval vessels based on the islands, as well as to enhance surveillance capabilities over shipping lanes.

It is one of the historic administrative village of Jakarta. The boundary of Kwitang is the Ciliwung to the west, Jalan Kramat Kwitang to the north, Jalan Kramat Raya to the east, and Jalan Kramat 4 to the south. The administrative village was locally known as the location of the Kwitang book market, especially in the 1970s. History Kampung Kwitang by the Ciliwung in 1910s. The name Kwitang was first mentioned for a neighborhood situated between a road to the east of Ciliwung (which would be developed as part of the Groote Postweg during the governorship of Daendels) and a section of the Ciliwung to the south of Noordwijk (now Jalan Ir. H. Juanda). The neighborhood was initially dwelled (rented) by immigrants from China. The first Chinese migrants in Batavia arrived from Fujian (or Hokkien); this is followed by migrants from Guangdong or Kwantung. Chinese migrants from Guangzhou (Canton) belonged to the Punti ethnic group, a relatively small ethnic group which settled themselves in the neighborhood of Kwitang, Batavia. The name Kwitang itself was derived from Gnuidang, a Zhangzhou name for the province of Guangdong; Zhangzhou being the most common dialect of Hokkien used in Java. Since then, the neighborhood with its Punti population was known as Kampong Kwitang. The claim of the name Kwitang from a person named Kwee Tang Kiam is disputed, as the surname Kwee is not common in Batavia at that time. In 1824, the area of Kampong Kwitang was sold to the government (verponding) according to the Resolutie van de Governeur Genaraal in Rade dd 28 Desember 1824 No 25. Kampong Kwitang became known as Land Kwitang. The first to buy the Land Kwitang parcel was F. Rijnkarl (1839). Later, Land Kwitang was acquired by Voute de Guérin (1847). By 1887, the area of Kwitang had been divided into two: Kwitang Oost (which include Kampung Tanah Tinggi and Kampung Rawa) and Kwitang West (the area which corresponds to the present administrative village of Kwitang). In mid 19th-century, the missionary started their activity in Kwitang West, which lead to the establishment of Kwitang Church. In 1919, Land Kwitang West was acquired by the Burgemeester Batavia for f. 150,000. The acquisition was done after the acquisition of Land Menteng in 1913. In 1925, Heusen & Mees sold the Kwitang Oost (Tanah Tinggi) for f. 70,000. Book market Gunung Agung, a 1950s-established bookstore established in Kwitang. Gunung Agung bookstore began its book selling business in Jalan Kwitang in 1953. At least since the 1970s, Kwitang was known as the place to get second-hand books in Jakarta. The book stalls were usually spread along the sidewalk of Jalan Kwitang and especially along the Ciliwung. Since 2008, these booksellers have been relocated to other sites by the city administration, including to the nearby Pasar Senen. List of important places The building of the Museum Sumpah Pemuda.

This life narrative integrates one's reconstructed past, perceived present, and imagined future. Furthermore, this narrative is a story – it has characters, episodes, imagery, a setting, plots, and themes and often follows the traditional model of a story, having a beginning (initiating event), middle (an attempt and a consequence), and an end (denouement). Narrative identity is the focus of interdisciplinary research, with deep roots in psychology. In recent decades, a proliferation of psychological research on narrative identity has provided a strong empirical basis for the construct, cutting across the field, including personality psychology social psychology, developmental and life-span psychology, cognitive psychology,Singer, J.A. & Salovey, P. (1993). The remembered self: emotion and memory in personality. New York: Simon & Schuster. cultural psychology,Rosenwald, G., & Ochberg, R. L. (Eds.). (1992).

Personality and psychotherapy: Treating the whole person. New York: Guilford Press. Context =Development= Development of a child's narrative identity is largely influenced by the opportunities for narrative expression he or she has through conversations with caregivers and friends. Speakers provide more accurate autobiographical information when speaking to attentive listeners as opposed to distracted listeners, therefore developing more specific autobiographical memories which give rise to richer personal narratives. Young children whose parents share more detailed personal narratives from their own lives tend to have more detailed and coherent personal narratives themselves by the end of the preschool age period. Capability constructing narratives for a life story framework and form an identity first emerges in adolescence - initiated during adolescent struggles for identity formation., This plays a vital role in adulthood by supporting generativity, and it helps to foster meaning-making at the end of life. The development of life story narratives in adolescence is facilitated by co-constructed reminiscing, in which caregivers use discussion, comparison, and analysis of inner motivation to guide reflection about past events and create narratives that explain situations and behavior. This helps adolescents develop an understanding of the relationship between the \\"self\\" of the past and their personal narrative in the present. An interesting finding from adolescent research shows more semantic stories increase and become more meaningful in a child's life. When a child, especially a boy, makes stronger semantic connections in early adolescence, he has a worse sense of well-being, but as he moves to late adolescence his well-being increases. the large jump in cognitive learning during adolescence allows this change to take place. Since this is a very important time for children to expand their social groups and conversational constructs, more semantic narratives can be created and allow the meaning making construct to develop. =Personality psychology= A person's narrative identity is a layer of personality related to, but distinct from the broad dispositional traits (The Big Five) and contextualized characteristic adaptations, described in Dan P. McAdams's three-level framework. Dispositional traits, drawn from the Five-Factor Model of personality are broad, decontextualized descriptors that are relatively stable across the lifespan and are useful for drawing comparisons between individuals. Characteristic adaptations encompass a person's motivations, developmental concerns, and life strategies and are used to describe the individual within their contextualized time, place, and social roles. Narrative identity, the \`third level in McAdams' framework encompasses the internalized, evolving story of the self. It is argued that assessing all three levels simultaneously gives you a personological description of the whole person. Different ways of interpreting and narrating life changes correlate with different forms of personality development. Because of the close linkage between narrative identity and psychological well-being, a common research focus in narrative identity is in exploring the relationship between characteristics of narratives and how they relate to personality development in the domains of ego development and psychological well-being. Individuals who place a high importance on understanding new viewpoints show higher scores in ego development, and those that placed importance on interpersonal relationships, joy and societal contribution tend to have higher scores on well-being. =Epistemology= Narrative can be approached through one of two epistemological paradigms: hermeneutic (also called \\"narrative\\"), or paradigmatic.Bruner, J. \\"Two Modes of Thought,\\" in Actual Minds, Possible World, (Harvard University Press, 1986), pp. 11-43. The hermeneutic approach seeks to capture the specific, personal, and highly contextualized elements of an individual's story.Josselson, Ruthellen (2004). \\"On Becoming the Narrator of One's own Life\\". In Lieblich, Amia, McAdams, Dan P., Josselson, Ruthellen (eds.) (2004). Healing Plots: The Narrative Basis of Psychotherapy (pp. 111–127). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. The paradigmatic approach, on the other hand, tries to classify narratives, determine associations, draw cause-and-effect relationships, and test and validate hypotheses - to transcend the particulars that the hermeneutic approach primarily concerned with, to generate generalizable scientific findings. Components of identity narratives Life narratives are often examined and evaluated by the presence and extent to which they contain various structural and thematic components. =Structure= Coherence is one of the primary structural elements of narratives. As individuals develop from children to adults, four types of coherence emerge in their abilities to tell stories: *Temporal coherence: the telling of a story in a clear, chronological way, i.e. event B follows event A. *Causal coherence: drawing cause-and-effect relationships between events in the narrative and also between events and their effect on the narrator's sense of self. *Thematic coherence: the narrator making a reflective evaluation of their story, revealing themes, overarching trends, and creating meaning from the narrative. *The cultural concept of biography: the story assuming the format and prose common to the narrator's culture and context. Some amount of coherence is always necessary in a narrative, otherwise it will be incomprehensible, while too much coherence may make the narrative hard to believe, as though it too-neatly ties together the complexity of life. The general extent to which coherence is present or absent in a narrative has been found to be related to a variety of important outcomes such as overall psychological well-being and the nuance and complexity of meaning-making processes (ego development). =Content= Turning to content, research on narrative identity has focused especially on the thematic elements of personal narratives. When participants in research studies are asked to recount a personal narrative, researchers code the story on the following seven constructs: redemption, contamination, agency, communion, exploratory narrative processing, coherent positive resolution, and meaning making. An additional construct named performance has been newly recognized and also included in some researchers coding. *Redemption: the narrator transitions from a generally \\"bad\\"/negative state, to a generally \\"good\\"/positive state (A → B). Such a transition can be characterized as being a sacrifice (enduring a negative event A to get the benefit of B), recovery (attaining a positive state after losing it), growth (bettering the self psychologically, physically, personally), or learning (gaining/mastering new skills, knowledge, wisdom). *Contamination: the narrator transitions from a generally good/positive state, to a bad/negative state (B → A). Often, this transition is marked by a denial or not being able to remember the 'good' of the state before - it has been overwhelmed by the current 'bad' state. Common sub-themes in contamination include victimization, betrayal, loss, failure, illness/injury, disappointment, or disillusionment. *Agency: refers to the extent to which the narrator is autonomous, and has the power to affect his/her own life. Agency is sometimes broken down into four pathways: self- mastery (the protagonist masters, enlarges, or betters the self), status/victory (the protagonist attains a heightened status or prestige amongst their peers), achievement/responsibility (the protagonist has significant achievement in some task, job, or goal), and empowerment (the protagonist is made better through an interaction with something larger and greater than the self). *Communion: the narrator is motivated to form intimate friendships/relationships; showing intimacy, sharing, belonging, affiliation, etc. Common themes in communion are: love/friendship, reciprocal and noninstrumental dialogue, providence of caring/help to another, or a general feeling of unity/togetherness with the world/others. *Exploratory narrative processing: the extent that the narrator engages in self-exploration while telling a story; a high score suggests profound self-exploration and/or a deep understanding of oneself. The practice of exploratory narrative processing in times of struggle is one avenue through which maturity develops, and narratives of positive self-transformation are often characterized by increased exploratory narrative processing. *Coherent positive resolution: the extent to which tensions dissolve, providing closure and a satisfying ending to a narrative. Increased coherent positive resolution in narratives correlate with improvements in ego-resiliency, or one's adaptability under stress. *Meaning-making: the extent to which the narrator gleans meaning from a narrative. Scores on responses range from low (no meaning; narrator simply recounts story), moderate (extracting a concrete lesson from the story—for example: do not put hands on hot surfaces), to high (gaining a deep insight from the narrative—for example: learning that you can't judge a book by its cover). *Performance: The narrator describes life stories around the outcome of their performance. This narrative tends to be seen typically among elite athletes. It can be considered a very dominant narrative since it is very accepted within the athletic community. Research in narrative constructs The constructs mentioned above can vary in a narrative depending on the characteristics of the narrator and the circumstances of the story. Research on construct variance is conducted by having participants tell a story that is scored for some number of the eight narrative constructs. =Individual characteristics= The characteristics of a narrative can vary depending on age: during the adolescent years, narrative sophistication increases with age. For example, in one psychological study, adolescents aged 14 to 18 wrote narratives about significant turning points in their lifetimes. The researchers coded the narratives for meaning making. The results showed that age was positively correlated with meaning making scores.This suggests that the capability to incorporate meaning in life stories develops over the course of adolescence. The characteristics of a narrative can also vary depending on generativity (the degree to which an individual wishes to improve society and help future generations) and optimism. For example, in one study, participants narrated personally meaningful events from their pasts; these could be positive, negative turning point, or early childhood memories. Research participants with high generativity and optimism scores tended to have high narrative redemption scores. Differences in identity status also correlate with differences in narrative characteristics. The identity status theory of identity development examines an individual's exploration of identities and his or her commitment to an identity. There are four identity statuses: identity achievement (the most adjusted status and an integration of exploration and commitment), moratorium (exploration with no commitment), foreclosure (commitment with no exploration), and diffusion (no commitment or exploration). The foreclosure and diffusion identity statuses are the least developmentally advanced. In addition, they are associated with lower meaning making scores than achievement and moratorium. Personal experience narrative is the very thread that identity is crafted from. During the storytelling process what people say, how they say it, and especially if they keep saying it, determines who they are and where they stand. The words you use, or diction, situates you in a social group. Voicing and ventriloquation of past selves positioned against current self or others yields a trajectory of narrative and an evaluative tool of the construction of self-identity. Represented content and enacted positioning, therefore, can interrelate in two ways so as to construct the self. Past voices can lie on trajectory towards the storytelling self, or map out and organize the present self. Along with creating a coherent sense of identity, this helps build empathy between speaker and audience, which deepens the connection of the speaker's own self- identity. One cannot become a 'self' alone, and thus the audience is vital to the creation of self through the positioning and arranging of past and current selves.Wortham, Stanton. 2001. \\"Narrative Self-Construction and the Nature of Self.\\" In Narratives in Action. New York: Teachers College Press, 136-156. =Circumstances of the story= The narrative constructs of a story can also depend on its plot. For example, the emotionality of a plot affects the characteristics of a story. In one study, 168 adolescents each recounted three self-defining narratives. Narratives containing negative and/or conflicting emotions receive higher meaning making scores than narratives containing positive or neutral emotions. Narrative themes can also depend on the event type. Different event types have varying levels of tension, and researchers posit that tension level is associated with narrative construct scores. For example, a mortality (or life-threatening) event would have a higher tension level than a leisure (i.e. vacation) event. Mortality narratives also receive higher meaning making scores than leisure narratives. Achievement (i.e. winning an award) and relationship events are posited to have mixed tension levels; for example, in relationship events, an interpersonal conflict would contain more emotional tension than falling in love. Achievement and relationship narratives also have varying meaning making scores. =Implications= The use of narrative constructs is associated with well- being: people who incorporate negative life events into their narrative identities as instances of redemption tend to have higher instances of levels of happiness and well-being. For example, high school seniors who were able to find a positive outcome from a negative adolescent experience (redemption) had higher levels of well-being than students who could not find a silver lining. Much of the research on narrative constructs has not established causation: researchers do not know whether well-being causes redemption sequences in narratives, or whether redemption sequences cause well-being. Also, researchers do not know whether tension in a narrative causes meaning making, or whether meaning making leads to tension. Psychologists will need to determine causation before these findings can be practically implemented, such as in psychotherapy. Autobiographical memory The formation and organization of memories is the central mechanism through which narrative identity is constructed. The life story allows individuals to organize recollective memories and more abstract knowledge of their past into a coherent biographical view. Different types of memories have been identified and classified, and have unique influences on how individuals develop their narrative self. Just as autobiographical memories influence personal narratives, these narratives also influence memories - For instance, narrative expression is critical for the development of a sense of agency in autobiographical memories. The opportunity to tell stories about their lives can help autobiographical narrators establish a coherent sense of who they are. Charlotte Linde's definition of personal experience narrative is quintessential to the idea of narrative identity and is evidence into how these stories and the process of telling them craft the framework for one's own identity. Personal narrative is a powerful tool for creating, negotiating and displaying the moral standing of the self. The self has to be related to something, in this case an audience, but must also be related properly. Personal experience narrative culminates the discontinuity between inner experience and the portrayed self. The often hidden purpose of narratives as a social process is to show that the narrator knows what the norms are and agree with them, or depending on the audience, disagree with them. The very act of narrating creates the occasion for self-regard and editing. \\"The nature of the process of narration contributes to the creation of this reflexivity, because one can never immediately speak the present in the present. This necessarily creates a distinction between the narrator and the protagonist of the narrative, and interposes a distance between them. Consequently, the narrator can observe, reflect, adjust the amount of distance, and correct the self that is being created.\\" Thus, temporal continuity- or identity of the self through time- is the most basic form of coherence we can create.Linde, Charlotte. 1993. 'Narrative and Iconicity of Self.\\" In Life Stories: The Creation of Coherence. New York: Oxford University Press, 98–126. Narrative identity is mainly concerned with autobiographical memories and often are influenced by the meaning and emotions the individual has assigned to that event. These memories perform a self-representative function by using personal memories to create and maintain a coherent self-identity, or narrative identity, over time. Autobiographical memories that have to do with important goals within a certain period of life and correspond with the concerns of the present self have been termed \\"self-defining memories\\",Singer, \\"The Integrative Function of Narrative Processing: Autobiographical Memory, Self-Defining Memories, and the Life Story of Identity\\", 2004, \\"\\", April 2012 and are especially important in narrative identity formation. When these memories contain recurring emotion- outcome sequences (see: content), together they give rise to \\"narrative scripts.\\" Development of a narrative identity that promotes psychological well-being requires combining autobiographical memory specificity, the ability to recall self-defining memories of specific instances in your past, with the narrative construct of meaning-making to attain insight from the narrative script. Storytelling process Beyond the content of people's stories, the storytelling process is essential to understanding narrative identity. The purpose of stories, the role of the listener, and storytelling patterns all influence the way stories are told, and thus narrative identity. Richard Bauman states that different forms of conversational genres (personal experience narrative, tall tale, practical joke), interrelatedly, add texture and flavor to one's life. The formats of the stories that we tell reveal truths about our own personal identity. Together, they provide the narrator with a toolset of means to figure him/ herself in a variety of alignments to a remarkably consistent and coherent set of epistemological and social- relational concerns.Bauman, Richard. 2004. 'Bell, You Get the Spotted Pup': First Person Narratives of a Texas Storyteller.\\" In A World of Others' Words: Cross- Cultural Perspectives on Intertextuality, 109-127. Malden, MA: Blackwell. Bluck has conceptualized several reasons people tell narratives. One reason is for directive purposes, which involves transmitting information regarding the future. Additionally, stories are told for social reasons, in particular communication, persuasion, and entertainment purposes. Finally, narrators can benefit by expressing themselves, in addition to giving life purpose and meaning. Listeners also possess power over the process of storytelling, and therefore the outcome of narrative identity. For instance, listener attentiveness elicits from the narrator more coherent stories, punchy endings, dynamic arcs over the course of the story, and overall, more specific and engaging stories. Themes in narratives can influence the listener's attitude toward the storyteller. For example, contamination sequences in bereavement narratives tend to elicit sympathy, while redemption sequences make the listener feel more comfortable and accepting of the narrator. Both positive moods and the act of telling the story can influence the narrator's relationship with the listener - and lead to more intimate sharing by the narrator. Storytelling patterns may also impact an individual's narrative identity. - for instance, untold experiences are more likely to be forgotten and considered less important. Research has shown that 90% of emotional experiences are disclosed within a few days of the event, and 62% of the \\"most memorable events of the day\\" are told by end of that day. Those events that get forgotten cannot be included in the narrator's story of the self, and therefore cannot play a role in their identity. Researchers focus on the storytelling process participants use in order to code the content the participants are showing. If a participant explains he or she participated in a sport not because he particularly liked it but because he could win, researchers would say he is using performance content to narrate his life. Storytelling is a very important piece to the methodology of narrative research for it provides variables the researchers can assess. Applications of narrative methods The concept of narrative identity, and its associated research techniques have been applied in a wide variety of fields. Below are just a few examples: =Gay and lesbian identity= Narrative identity has been studied as it impacts the lives of lesbian and gay individuals. Specifically, the concept of master narratives (story scripts common within a cultural context) has been investigated in this domain. Studies have found that gay identity is often shaped by master narratives of gay identity in American culture, which have evolved over recent history. One of the foundational papers asserts that a study of gay identity must take into account cultural and historical factors. The paper demonstrates that gay- identified individuals must navigate through a world where master narratives exclude their desires and experiences. =Psychotherapy= Empirical research has demonstrated that narrative identity changes over the course of psychotherapy. This change has been associated with improvements in clients' mental health. A prospective longitudinal study tracked clients' narrative identity from before they began treatment through the early phase of psychotherapy. The study demonstrated that clients told stories about their experiences with an increasing sense of agency over the course of treatment. This increase in the theme of agency was associated with improvements in psychological health. Analyses revealed that changes in clients' stories occurred before changes in their psychological health. This finding suggests that narrative change may precede changes in mental health. =Schizophrenia= Narratives written by individuals with severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, have been studied in order to determine the potential influence of treatment using therapy and/or antipsychotic medication on narrative formation. Studies have demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia develop more complex and dynamic narratives, but that the content of the narratives do not change a great deal over the course of treatment.Lysaker, P.H., Lancaster, R. S., & Lysaker, J. T. (2003). Narrative transformation as an outcome in the psychotherapy of schizophrenia. Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice, 76, 285-299. Other studies have indicated that people with schizophrenia are better able to confront their illness after time spent in therapy, and subsequently develop more coherent narratives. These findings provide more insight into this disorder, and suggest new, more effective methods of treatment. =Prisoners= Narrative identity has been explored in the stories of incarcerated individuals. For example, narratives have been used to understand the conversion experience among prisoners. Through these narratives, prisoner converts have been able to integrate their negative self (the one who committed the crime) into their larger sense of self. They have also been able to exert control over their seemingly uncontrollable life while in prison. Narratives have also been used to study the conversion stories of incarcerated women. For these women, imprisonment causes dissonance between a conflict-self and a respectable identity. Conversion narratives help free women to reclaim their identities and sense of self-worth. =Medical practice= Medical practice that embraces the importance of stories exchanged in the medical context has been termed \\"narrative medicine\\". Narrative medicine allows for more effective care by physicians and more comfort for patients by providing new ways to consider the relationships and practices involved in medicine. Some of these relationships include those between the physician and patient, physician and self, physician and colleagues, and physician and society. This form of practice allows patients to overcome their loss of identity and benefit their recovery process. Physicians help the patients find new connections between their narrative stories and identity for the patients to find different options and outlooks on their recovery. With new connections, the patient can lead a healthier life with a positive outlook instead of revolving their lives around their illness. =Athletes= When assessing an athlete it is beneficial to understand how one describes his or her life since it can determine how mentally healthy he or she is. If there is a strong athletic identity, like the performance narrative, sometimes severe psychological problems can form when the athlete is in a slump or injured. Observing an athlete's narrative can help one shift his or her attention away from only the performance narrative but combine it with others. One can reach the elite level of athletes without only focusing on the performance script. Some actually attempt to follow the script but it does not help them succeed due to the clash of the cultural norm and what is desired by the athlete.

Legends The story of Behula and Chand Sadagar appears to be common to both Bengal and Kamarupa. The ballads connected with this story must have been current in western Kamarupa and the rest of northern Bengal long before the verses were reduced to writing by Sukavi Narayan in the thirteenth century and by Durgabar in the early part of the sixteenth century. The ballads of Sukavi Naravan's composition are still sung in Kamrup and they are known as Suk Nanis or Suk-Narayanis to this day. Sukavi Narayan was very likely a poet of Kamarupa who described the sea-voyages of a Kamrupi trader named Chand Sadagar whose home was in Chaygaon in modern Kamrup, on the south bank of the Brahmaputra but, strangely enough, both Sukavi Narayan and Chand Sadagar have been claimed as natives of Bengal. The songs of Durgabar are still known as Durgabari. Further development There is much controversy as to the authorship and date of a work known as Dipiki Chanda. Internal evidence points to the compilation of the work after the death of Sankara Deva. The author is said to have been a king called Purusottama Gajapati. Several Assamese writers have attempted to locate him somewhere in Assam but all have failed to notice the fact that Purusottama Gajapati was a well-known powerful king of Odisha who ruled from 1476 to 1497 A.D. and whose kingdom, or rather empire, extended from the Hugli district in modern Bengal as far as the Guntur district of the Andhra Pradesh. He was the son of Kapilendra Gajapati and the father of Pratapa Rudra, the last powerful Gajapati who ruled from 1497 to 1541 A. D. and who was a contemporary of Sri Chaitanya. Purusottama Gajapati was a devout Vaisnava and he may have written the work known as Dipika Chanda in order to ridicule the later Buddhist sect and the Tantrik system. There was close connection between Kamarupa and Odisha in the sixteenth century on account of the existence, in the latter country, of the famous temple of Jagannatha at Puri. It is possible that an Kamrupi Vaisnava came across the book and translated it into Kamrupi verse. The title Gajapati could not have been assumed by an ordinary king. It was assumed by Kapilendra, the father of Purusottama, who possessed, according to the Muslim account Burhan-i-maasir, two hundred thousand war elephants.Banerji, History of Orissa Vol I, p.292 Preservation of literary material The Assam Government collection of Sanskrit and Assamese manuscripts now deposited in the library of the Kamarupa Anusandhan Samiti, includes quite a good number of works. These are mostly works on astronomy, astrology, mathematics, proverbs, riddles, mantras, medicine, history or traditions and also tantras. Nature of literary work The Yuddha Jayanava Dasa, Jyotisha Chakra, Jataka Chandrika, Kerali, Jyotisha Darpan, Jyotisha Ratnamala and the Jyotisha Muktavali are all astrological works pertaining to preparation of horoscopes. The Mantra Prakasa and the Mandaladhyaya are Tantrik works. The Samudrika is a treatise on palmistry. The Shatachakra by Purnananda Paramahamsa is also a Tantrik work dealing with astral physiology. Besides the above there are numerous works on Hindu religion and religious rites based upon the Smrita Sastras of the works in the vernacular language of Kamarupa the most important are Bhamvati, an astrological work by Kavirajt Chakravarti, the Ghora Nidana, a treatise on horse and treatment of equine diseases, Gukarati, a collection of mantras to ward off charms practised by Tantrik Buddhists who defy the authority of the Vedas, the Hara-Gauri Sambada, an important book which, like the Yogini Tantra, gives, in the guise of prophesies, the history of ancient Kamarupa, the Jyotish Churamani by Churamani Kayastha, a work on Arithemetic and land- Surveying, the Kamratna Tantra,\\" an Assamese translation of a Tantrik work of that name ascribed to Gorakshanath, a celebrated Buddhist Siddha who flourished in the fourteenth century and the Kitabata Manjari by Bakul Kayastha written in Saka 1356 equivalent to 1434 A.D.

Val de Cans (sometimes spelled Val de Cães) is the name of the neighborhood where the airport is located. Since 13 April 2010 the airport is named also after Júlio Cezar Ribeiro de Souza (1837–1887) a researcher of balloons. It is operated by Infraero. Some of its facilities are shared with Belém Air Force Base of the Brazilian Air Force. History In 1934 General Eurico Gaspar Dutra, then the Director of the Military Aviation, appointed Lieutenant Armando Sierra de Menezes to choose in Val de Cans a site where an airport was to be built. The Directorate of Civil Aeronautics, an agency of the Ministry of Traffic and Public Works, would be in charge of the work. Val de Cans began its history as land track running along the east/west axis with 1,200m. The facility comprised a courtyard, a hangar and a parking structure of concrete for military aircraft, which later became known as \\"Yellow Hangar.\\" With the outbreak of World War II air bases and airports located on the Brazilian coast became immensely important in the support of transportation of aircraft, personnel and equipment across the South Atlantic Ocean to Sierra Leone in West Africa. These facilities provided the necessary logistical support for the thousands of planes that, manufactured in Canada and the United States were moved to North Africa and Europe. After protracted negotiations between Brazil and the United States, airstrips were built at Belém for the Air Transport Command with two runways measuring 1,500 x 45 meters on a basis of concrete and asphalt and comprising modern airport facilities, able to meet efficiently civil aviation and military needs. Val de Cans and other air bases used by the Americans during World War II were returned to the Ministry of Aeronautics in 1945. Panair do Brasil, Pan American, and NAB – Navegação Aérea Brasileira began their activities at Val de Cans building their stations and providing services to passengers. In 1958, the Ministry of Aeronautics began building the first passenger terminal for general airline use, which was opened on 24 January 1959. It was then administered by the Department of Civil Aviation. In 1974 its administration was transferred to Infraero. The original passenger terminal complex underwent major renovation and expansion, which was completed in 2001: in 1999 a brand- new passenger terminal located at the side of the old terminal was built and after its opening, the old terminal was demolished to give place for an extension to the new terminal. This new extended terminal greatly increased the comfort and area available to passengers by adding 6 jetways.

In 1944, he was expelled from Nepal by the tyrannical Rana regime for promoting Theravada Buddhism and writing in Nepal Bhasa. He spent his exile in India and Sri Lanka. Early life Kumar Kashyap (alternative name: Kumar Bhante) was born in Tansen, Palpa, a district in western Nepal. His father was Sanat Kumar Shakya and mother Tej Maya Shakya. He was known as Asta Man Shakya before he became a novice monk in 1942.Bajracharya, Phanindra Ratna (2003). Who's Who in Nepal Bhasha. Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. . Page 75. After being ordained, Kumar Bhante moved to Kathmandu where he joined the small number of monks and worked to promote Theravada Buddhism. Into exile The government was suspicious of the activities of the Buddhist monks as they were becoming increasingly popular. The monks were called before the prime minister and ordered to stop preaching Buddhism and writing in Nepal Bhasa which the regime disapproved of equally. They refused, and on 30 July 1944, were ordered out of the country. The eight monks including Kumar Kashyap, Dhammalok Mahasthavir and Pragyananda Mahasthavir went to Kushinagar, India and then to Sarnath where they founded a Buddhist association named Dharmodaya Sabha (Society for the Rise of the Teaching). Kumar Kashyap later moved to Kalimpong and then to Sri Lanka.Mahasthavir, Bhikkhu Dharmaloka (1999). A Pilgrimage in China. Kathmandu: Bhikkhu Aniruddha Mahasthavir. Pages 124-125. Return to Nepal In 1946, the monks were allowed to return after a Sri Lankan goodwill mission visited Kathmandu and urged the government to withdraw the expulsion order. Page 7. Kumar Kashyap returned to Kathmandu and became a writer and teacher at Ananda Kuti Vidyapeeth in Swayambhu. He has published six books. His first book Gautam Buddha was published in 1956. He was editor of Anandabooumi, a Buddhist magazine published by Ananda Kuti Vihar. He was also named a patron of Nepal Lipi Guthi, an organization dedicated to preserving Nepalese scripts. Kumar Kashyap became abbot of Ananda Kuti Vihar and held the post of Deputy Chief Monk when he died.

It regulates left-right neuronal asymmetry in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Left-right asymmetry through the cog-1 gene ASEL and ASER are a pair of bilateral taste receptor neurons thought to be responsible for the asymmetrical pattern of chemoreceptor gene expression in C. elegans. These two gustatory neurons are bilaterally symmetric morphologically, as well as with regards to their connectivity, position and gene expression patterns. However, they are left-right asymmetric in their expression of specific signalling molecules. The ASE neuron is extremely sensitive to the correct dosage of cog-1, an Nkx-type homeobox gene, and extra copies of this gene will readily produce left/right asymmetry defects. lsy-6 is responsible for control of cog-1 expression, as transcriptional mechanisms alone are not sufficient for this regulation. lsy-6 and cog-1 are initially co-expressed by both ASEL and ASER after birth, but their expression later becomes restricted to one of the two ASE neurons (ASEL for lsy-6 and ASER for cog-1). lsy-6 codes for a 21-nt miRNA, which in turn binds to a single complementary site in the 3′ UTR of the cog-1 gene. This interaction is only seen in the ASEL cell type (not the ASER), thus causing an asymmetric cog-1 distribution. It has been observed that a removal of lsy-6 leads to an altered transcription of cog-1 in ASEL, indicating that despite expressing lsy-6, the ASEL neuron does not transcribe cog-1. Further expression lsy-6 is additionally expressed in several other neuron types, including labial sensory neurons and PVQ ventral cord interneurons. lsy-6/lsy-2 Feedback Loop The expression of lsy-6 is itself regulated by lsy-2, a zinc finger transcription factor. Interaction of lsy-2 with lsy-6 has been found to be cell-type specific and there is complete loss of lsy-6 expression in lsy-2 mutant animals. A bistable feedback loop required for ASE laterality is in place, consisting of miRNAs lsy-6, mir-273, and their respective transcription factors cog-1 and die-1. Whilst lsy-6 is expressed in ASEL but not ASER and regulates the expression of the downstream transcription factor cog-1, mir-273 expression is strongly biased towards ASER and exhibits complementarity to the mRNA of the die-1 transcription factor. die-1 is regulated at a post- transcriptional level and controls chemosensory laterality by activating the expression of lsy-6 in ASEL only. Expression of die-1 in ASER is downregulated through two sites in its 3′ UTR region.

Life  Friederike Charlotte was a member of the Brandenburg-Schwedt line of the Prussian royal family, the daughter of Frederick Henry, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt and his wife Leopoldine Marie of Anhalt-Dessau. After the breakup of her parents' marriage, King Frederick II of Prussia sent her mother to Kołobrzeg in Pomerania and Frederick Charlotte received a place in Herford Abbey. In 1755, she became coadjutor to Abbess Hedwig Sophie of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, whom she later succeeded. Friederike Charlotte was partly educated in Prussia, together with her sister Louise. Between 1760 and 1762, the mathematician Leonhard Euler sent her numerous letters in French about mathematical and philosophical subjects. These letters were published between 1769 and 1773 under the title \\"Letters to a German Princess\\" and were printed in Leipzig and St. Petersburg. The French edition alone enjoyed 12 printings. It was the Age of Enlightenment and Euler tried to explain physical issues and in particular their philosophical background in a generally understandable manner. Euler may have been employed as her teacher. On 13 October 1764, Friederike Charlotte became Abbess of Herford. As head of an imperial abbey, she ranked as an Imperial Princess. She administered the abbey and defended its rights against the city of Herford. She resided in Herford and maintained her court in a manner befitting a royal household. In 1766 Princess Christine Charlotte of Hesse-Kassel was appointed as coadjutor abbess, serving alongside Friederike Charlotte. In 1790, she donated an emblem to the St. Mary on the Mountain convent in her territory. Recent research suggests that the economic situation in her territory deteriorated during her reign.Gisa Kleinebenne: Die wirtschaftliche Situation der Fürstabtei Herford in den letzten Jahren ihres Bestehens bis zum Beginn der Säkularisation (1773–1802), in: Der Remensnider, vol. 1, 2005, p. 10 She also tried to preserve the right of her abbey against the Prussian state. However, in case of doubt, the King of Prussia had the last word. In 1798, criminal proceedings were initiated against leading officials of the abbey for forging a will and King Frederick William III appointed a mediatisation commission \\"to execute the guardianship over the assets of the Lady Abbess\\". The commission was disbanded in 1799. Although Frederike Charlotte claimed jurisdiction over her subjects, the defendants were convicted in a Prussian court in 1800. The abbey was secularized on 15 August 1802. Its assets were seized by the Kingdom of Prussia. The abbess and the collegiate ladies received a pension from the kingdom. Friederike Charlotte fled the advancing army of the First French Republic to Altona, where she died in 1808. She was buried in the collegiate church in Herford.

Early life He was born at Greenlaw, Berwickshire.http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1851MNRAS..11...86. Initially he was a schoolmaster. His pupil William Rutherford walked long distances to attend his school at Eccles. Subsequently he moved to Edinburgh, and graduated A.M. at the University of Edinburgh in 1821. Surveyor During the 1830s Galbraith became interested in the surveying problems of Scotland. In 1831 he pointed out that Arthur's Seat had a strongly magnetic peak.http://www20.us.archive.org/stream/topographicalsta01edinuoft#page/n145/mode/2up In 1837 he pointed out the impact of anomalies in measurement, work that received recognition; http://www26.us.archive.org/stream/almanachderkais03wiengoog#page/n654/mode/2up it was topical because of the 1836 geological map of Scotland by John MacCulloch, with which critics had found fault on topographical as well as geological grounds. A paper on the locations of places on the River Clyde was recognised in 1837 by a gold medal, from the Society for the Encouragement of the Useful Arts for Scotland. Galbraith followed with detailed Remarks on the Geographical Position of some Points on the West Coast of Scotland (1838). Having made some accurate surveys of his own, he lobbied for further attention from the national survey. Galbraith's pocket-box circle, an invention for portable surveying.

Golf is especially popular among the wealthier classes, but has not yet caught on with others due to the expenses involved in playing. The most successful Indian golfers are Jeev Milkha Singh and Anirban Lahiri. Singh won three titles on the European Tour, four on the Japan Golf Tour, and six on the Asian Tour. His highest world ranking was 28th in March 2009. Singh has won the Asian Tour Order of Merit twice. Meanwhile, Lahiri has two European Tour wins and seven Asian Tour wins. He qualified for the 2015 Presidents Cup. Other Indians who have won the Asian Tour Order of Merit are Jyoti Randhawa in 2002 (the first Indian to achieve this) and Arjun Atwal, who went on in 2010 to become the first India-born player to become a member of the US-based PGA Tour and win the 2010 Wyndham Championship. In golf at the Asian Games, India's men's golf team won gold at the 1982 Asian Games and silver at the 2006 Asian Games. Lakshman Singh won the individual gold at the 1982 Asian Games. There are numerous golf courses all over India. There is a Professional Golf Tour of India. The main tournament is the Hero Indian Open, co-sanctioned by the Asian Tour and European Tour. In addition to the commendable performances by the Golf players of India, the Indian Golf Union (IGU) is making earnest efforts to improve the standard of the game in the country. Established in 1955, IGU made a significant decision made in 1995, which gave rise to the birth of a separate body for the sport - Professional Golfers' Association of India (PGAI). Recent development in Indian Golf is commencement of Indian Pitch and Putt Union apex body of Pitch and Putt Golf in India and member of International Pitch and Putt Associations. Effort of IPPU to support golf infrastructure in India also appreciated by World Golf Foundation; In his letter to IPPU Secretary General Rakesh Purohit, Steve Mona, CEO of WGF given his support and encourage program of IPPU to develop Pitch and Putt Golf in India.

This leaves roughly 135 courses to cater for a civilian golf demand. The makeup of the golf course supply is split between 18-hole (39% share) and 9-hole (60% share) facilities, with three 27-hole clubs. Research collected for KPMG's Golf Benchmark Survey indicates that the average number of rounds played per annum at 18-hole facilities ranges from 25,000 to 30,000 (excluding military courses). At some of the busier clubs where floodlights are used, hours can be extended to accommodate a higher demand. Pitch and putt; suitable for Urban India Average annual revenues for both 9- and 18-hole courses range US$180,000–200,000 (excluding military courses) with some larger, more popular clubs reaching anywhere up to $800,000 per year. Another major challenge India faces today in developing golf courses is the inability to acquire land in both a cost- and time-efficient manner. Land parcels are generally small, and developers need to purchase multiple plots at a cost that can quickly inflate. The initial steps taken when planning a project with a golf component can be time-consuming, expensive and misunderstood, delaying developments and have, in some instances, resulted in the omission of golf from project master plans. India may need to build up to 100 new courses to satisfy the demand over the next decade. An increase in participation can be achieved by: # Building more affordable and accessible facilities # Increasing activity in junior and academy golf # Effectively promoting amateur golf to a wider audience by developing more Pitch and Putt courses. Future course development seems inevitable and may need to come, hand-in-hand with real estate opportunity. Provided that the challenges that exist in India can be overcome, there is great potential in this growing golf market.

The modern game of polo is derived from Manipur, where the game was known as 'Sagol Kangjei', 'Kanjai-bazee', or 'Pulu'. It was the anglicised form of the last, referring to the wooden ball that was used, which was adopted by the sport in its slow spread to the west.  History  = Origins = Qutubuddin Aibak, a Turkic slave from Central Asia who later became the Sultan of Delhi, ruled for only four years, from 1206 to 1210, dying an accidental death during a game of polo in Lahore (in present-day Pakistan) when his horse fell and he was impaled on the pommel of his saddle.Michaelson, Carol, Gilded Dragons, pp. 72-73, 1999, British Museum Press, ; Medley, Margaret, T'ang Pottery and Porcelain, pp. 49-50, 1981, Faber & Faber, The sport was also popular among Mughal emperors who called it Chaugan. Emperor Akbar introduced an official set of rules for the sport. The origins of the game in Manipur are traced to early precursors of Sagol Kangjei.The Guinness Book of Records. 1991 edition (page 288) This was one of three forms of hockey in Manipur, the other ones being field hockey (called Khong Kangjei) and wrestling-hockey (called Mukna Kangjei). Local rituals such as those connected to the Marjing, the Winged-Pony God of Polo and the creation-ritual episodes of the Lai Haraoba festival enacting the life of his son, Khori-Phaba, the polo-playing god of sports. These may indicate an origin earlier than the historical records of Manipur. Later, according to Chaitharol-Kumbaba, a Royal Chronicle of Manipur King Kangba who ruled Manipur much earlier than Nongda Lairen Pakhangba (33 AD) introduced Sagol Kangjei (Kangjei on horse back). Further regular playing of this game commenced in 1605 during the reign of King Khagemba under newly framed rules of the game. However it was the first Mughal emperor, Babur, who popularised the sport in India and ultimately made a significant influence on England. Old polo field in Imphal, Manipur In Manipur, polo is traditionally played with seven players to a side. The players are mounted on the indigenous Manipuri pony, which stands less than . There are no goal posts, and a player scores simply by hitting the ball out of either end of the field. Players strike the ball with the long side of the mallet head, not the end. Players are not permitted to carry the ball, although blocking the ball with any part of the body except the open hand is permitted. The sticks are made of cane, and the balls are made from the roots of bamboo. Players protected their legs by attaching leather shields to their saddles and girths.Sports and Games of the 18th and 19th centuries by Robert Crego. Page 26. Published 2003. Greenwood Press. Sports & Recreation. 296 pages. In Manipur, the game was played even by commoners who owned a pony.Sports and Games of the 18th and 19th centuries on 17th centuriesby Robert Crego.bring the polo game from India, manipur page 25. Published 2003. Greenwood Press. Sports & Recreation. 296 pages The kings of Manipur had a royal polo ground within the ramparts of their Kangla Fort. Here they played Manung Kangjei Bung (literally, \\"Inner Polo Ground\\"). Public games were held, as they are still today, at the Mapan Kangjei Bung (literally \\"Outer Polo Ground\\"), a polo ground just outside the Kangla. Weekly games called Hapta Kangjei (Weekly Polo) were also played in a polo ground outside the current Palace. The oldest polo ground in the world is the Imphal Polo Ground in Manipur State. The history of this pologround is contained in the royal chronicle \\"Cheitharol Kumbaba\\" starting from AD 33. Lieutenant (later Major General) Joseph Ford Sherer, the father of modern polo visited the state and played on this polo ground in the 1850s. Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India visited the state in 1901 and measured the polo ground as \\"225 yards long and 110 yards wide\\" . = Modern game = The first polo club in India was established at Silchar, Assam in 1834. In 1862, the oldest polo club still in existence, Calcutta Polo Club, was established by two British soldiers, Sherer and Captain Robert Stewart. This version of polo played in the 19th century was different from the faster form that was played in Manipur. The game was slow and methodical, with little passing between players and few set plays that required specific movements by participants without the ball. Neither players nor horses were trained to play a fast, nonstop game. This form of polo lacked the aggressive methods and equestrian skills to play. From the 1800s to the 1910s, a host of teams representing Indian principalities dominated the international polo scene. Prominent teams of the period included Alwar, Bhopal, Bikaner, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Patiala, Jodhpur, Kishengarh and Kashmir. The majority of the Cavalry regiments of the British Army and the British Indian Army also fielded teams, the most prominent amongst them were the Central India Horse (CHI), Prince Albert Victor Own Cavalry (PAVO’s Cav), the Inniskilling Dragoon Guards, the 10th Royal Hussars, the 15th Lancers, and the 17/21st Lancers. The Jaipur team won all the open tournaments in Britain and the Indian Championship in 1933 creating a record that is unlikely to be broken. The team also won the Indian Open Championship every year from 1930 to 1938. The Indian Polo Association (IPA) was founded in 1892. The outbreak of the second World War and the mechanization of cavalry units resulted in a decline in interest in Indian polo. The Calcutta Polo Club was the first polo club in the country to resume hosting tournaments post-independence. Polo clubs in Jaipur, Delhi, Bombay and Hyderabad subsequently began holding regular tournaments. The IPA invited the Argentine national polo team to visit India in 1950 and play an exhibition games across the country in a bid to revive interest in the sport. The Argentine team participated in tournaments in Jaipur, Delhi and Bombay. The Pakistan Army polo team visited India in 1955. The IPA also revived the Indian Polo Championship in 1956, after a gap of 17 years. The India national polo team participated in the 1957 World Championship in France and won the tournament. These events helped revive interest in polo in the country. Indian polo received another boost after the Indian Army officially adopted polo as a sport granting access to new grounds and stables of horses. Indian President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed consented to be the Patron-in-Chief of the IPA, resulting in the introduction of a new trophy called The President's Cup in 1975. The IPA marked its 100th anniversary in 1992. In the year 1992 the IPA completed 100 years and since then polo is on an upward trend in the country. Today we have 33 Polo Clubs registered with IPA. Polo has been revived at Leh in Ladakh, at Udaipur and Jodhpur in Rajasthan, Hyderabad and Bangalore in South India. Polo is now not only the domain of the Army but a number of corporate and industrial houses are supporting teams in the domestic polo circuit.

History  Baseball was played in Manipur as early as World War II when the US Army Air Force flew supplies to China over the Himalayas, known as \\"Flying the Hump\\", and the locals learned the game from the troops stationed there. The Amateur Baseball Federation of India was founded in 1983 and India's first national baseball championship occurred in 1985, taking place in New Delhi. That same year, it joined both the International Baseball Federation along with the Baseball Federation of Asia. In 2006, MLB International sent Envoy coaches to India to train local coaches and players in partnership with First Pitch, an India-based grass-roots baseball organisation. The first ballpark in India was opened on 5 February 2017 at a farmhouse on the Gurgaon-Delhi border by Grand Slam Baseball and recognised by WBSC President Riccardo Fraccari. Built by social entrepreneur and baseball enthusiast Raunaq Sahni, India's first and only regulation-size baseball ground is named Field of Dreams in homage to the 1989 American film of the same name. Sahni had set up Grand Slam Baseball in 2013 as a grass-roots sports initiative to help organise tournaments and coaching programmes for youths across the country. Before the birth of Grand Slam Baseball, the sport was mostly played among expats and among government school players. Grand Slam Baseball changed this by starting pay-for-play programmes at elite private schools in Delhi-NCR while also sponsoring an equal amount of government school players. In July 2019, Major League Baseball (MLB) announced plans to open an office in New Delhi to promote the growth of baseball in India. The league also announced to plans to stream one regular season game a week on Facebook in India. MLB also stated that it would relaunch Million Dollar Arm holding tryouts in India between September and December 2019. MLB also announced the launch of First Pitch, a grassroots program for primary school children from 300 schools across New Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai to learn baseball through workshops by MLB coaches.

When India goes to play cricket in the US, they play in baseball stadiums. So there can be synergy,\\" Small explained.\\"  Million Dollar Arm  In 2007, struggling MLB agent J.B. Bernstein decided to start a competition in India titled Million Dollar Arm, a talent search for the best throwing arms in India. He gained his inspiration after watching ESPN's broadcast of a cricket match featuring bowlers that bowled at speeds as high as 150 km/h and realising that India was one of the largest untapped environments for baseball. Despite being inspired by cricketers, the two winners were 19-year- old javelin throwers Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel. Although he did not reach the million-dollar mark, Singh won $1,00,000 for the fastest delivery of the contest and Patel won $5,000. They were also invited to the United States to train and try out for Major League Baseball teams. Eventually, both pitchers were signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates organisation and became the first two Indians to play professional baseball. Patel ended up having a successful 2009 season for Pirates' Gulf Coast League team, finishing with a 1–0 record and a 1.42 ERA in 6⅓ innings. His 2010 season was not successful with his ERA going up to 8.59 in 7⅓ innings. He was released after the season and returned to India where he now teaches baseball and has prepared kids for subsequent seasons of Million Dollar Arm. The screen rights to their story were purchased in 2009, and in 2014 Disney released the film titled Million Dollar Arm. It made $3.9 crore off a budget of $2.5 crore.

The game of snooker originated among British Army officers stationed in India in the latter half of the 19th century. Billiard champions like Wilson Jones, Michael Ferreira, and Geet Sethi have come out of India. Pankaj Advani is another successful Indian player. Training camps for identifying talent and providing them regional and state sponsorship have been organised by the Billiards and Snooker Federation in various parts of the country. History The origin of snooker dates back to the latter half of the 19th century. In the 1870s, billiards was a popular activity amongst British Army officers stationed in India and several variations of the game were devised during this time. One such variation originated at the officers' mess of the 11th Devonshire Regiment in 1875, which combined the rules of two pocket billiards games, pyramid and black pool. The former was played with fifteen red balls positioned in a triangle, while the latter involved the potting of designated coloured balls. The game developed its own identity in 1884 when its first set of rules was finalised by Sir Neville Chamberlain, an English officer who helped develop and popularise the game at Stone House in Ooty on a table built by Burroughes & Watts that was brought over by boat. The word \\"snooker\\" was a slang term for first-year cadets and inexperienced military personnel, but Chamberlain would often use it to describe the inept performance of one of his fellow officers at the table. The name instantly stuck with the players. The earliest contemporary reference to cue sports in India appears in a letter written by Captain Sheldrick from Calcutta on 2 February 1886. The letter gives a detailed account of a game called \\"Snookers\\". The letter also contains references to the game being played among members of the British Indian Army in 1884. British officer Ian Hamilton, who was stationed in Ooty from 1882–84, wrote a letter in 1938 in which he noted, \\"I have never doubted that my old friend Sir Neville Chamberlain invented the game of Snooker. I was in at Ootacamund in 1882-84 and there still must be some crowd left who can testify to the belief their current that Snooker owed its birth to Neville Chamberlain fertile brain. Could the game have existed in Ooty even before Chamberlain arrival just waiting for him to discover it and give it a new name. This is a certainly a possibility.\\" The Billiards and Snooker Federation of India (BFSI) states that Ooty is \\"the most credible birthplace for the game of Snooker\\", however, the federation rejects the theory that the game was already established in Ooty. The BSFI also states that, based on available evidence, the first snooker game in India occurred at Ooty \\"almost precisely\\" in December 1881.

It was built in 1945-46 to a design by architects Alexander A. and Mackenzie A. Cantin, replacing a theater that had burned two years before. It provided the only public stage in Tehama County until 1991, and was the only cinema until 1993. It is notable as one of the few theaters to be built in the United States during World War II. History The State Theatre was built as a replacement of a building that was first built in 1908 as the Orpheum Theatre, or the Opera House. After a 1928 renovation, the theater was renamed the State Theatre. This building burned in 1944, and a replacement was deemed vital for morale. Construction began in April 1945, but was delayed by wartime materials shortages. The new theater opened on May 24, 1946, complete with air conditioning. The front of the theater was not completed as designed, with a more elaborate marquee and facade deferred and finally cancelled. In 1980 the house was divided for two screens, then subdivided again in 1992. It closed in 1993, superseded by a newer multiplex cinema. It was purchased in 1998 for redevelopment as a community arts center. It was renovated and reopened as the State Theatre for the Arts with seating for about 750. Description The one story State Theatre occupies a corner lot at Oak Street and Washington Street, with the theater entrance and a tenant space fronting on Oak Street. The theater is built of cast-in-place concrete with a two-story plain concrete facade. Original plans called for a large faceted pylon sign and a larger marquee, which were never built. A freestanding box office stands in a recessed exterior lobby area, surrounded by a terrazzo floor. Four pairs of doors give access to the inner lobby. The inner lobby has been substantially altered. The auditorium was originally designed for more the 900 patrons in three areas. The orchestra seats in front of the stage are separated from a loge by half-walls, while a balcony-like area is actually a sloped stadium- style seating area at the rear. The house features elaborate murals of nymphs and horses that are its most distinctive feature. There are basements under the stage and lobby. The State Theatre was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 17, 2002.

Definition  A DPO graph transformation system (or graph grammar) consists of a finite graph, which is the starting state, and a finite or countable set of labeled spans in the category of finite graphs and graph homomorphisms, which serve as derivation rules. The rule spans are generally taken to be composed of monomorphisms, but the details can vary.\\"Double-pushout graph transformation revisited\\", Habel, Annegret and Müller, Jürgen and Plump, Detlef, Mathematical Structures in Computer Science, vol. 11, no. 05., pp. 637--688, 2001, Cambridge University Press Rewriting is performed in two steps: deletion and addition. After a match from the left hand side to G is fixed, nodes and edges that are not in the right hand side are deleted. The right hand side is then glued in. Gluing graphs is in fact a pushout construction in the category of graphs, and the deletion is the same as finding a pushout complement, hence the name.  Uses  Double pushout graph rewriting allows the specification of graph transformations by specifying a pattern of fixed size and composition to be found and replaced, where part of the pattern can be preserved. The application of a rule is potentially non-deterministic: several distinct matches can be possible. These can be non-overlapping, or share only preserved items, thus showing a kind of concurrency known as parallel independence,\\"Concurrent computing: from Petri nets to graph grammars\\", Corradini, Andrea, ENTCS, vol. 2, pp. 56--70, 1995, Elsevier or they may be incompatible, in which case either the applications can sometimes be executed sequentially, or one can even preclude the other. It can be used as a language for software design and programming (usually a variant working on richer structures than graphs is chosen). Termination for DPO graph rewriting is undecidable because the Post correspondence problem can be reduced to it., \\"Termination of graph rewriting is undecidable\\", Detlef Plump, Fundamenta Informaticae, vol. 33, no. 2, pp. 201--209, 1998, IOS Press DPO graph rewriting can be viewed as a generalization of Petri nets.  Generalization  Axioms have been sought to describe categories in which DPO rewriting will work. One possibility is the notion of an adhesive category, which also enjoys many closure properties. Related notions are HLR systems, quasi-adhesive categories and \\\\mathcal{M}-adhesive categories, adhesive HLR categories.Hartmut Ehrig and Annegret Habel and Julia Padberg and Ulrike Prange, \\"Adhesive high-level replacement categories and systems\\", 2004, Springer The concepts of adhesive category and HLR system are related (an adhesive category with coproducts is a HLR system\\"Adhesive categories\\", Stephen Lack and Paweł Sobociński, in Foundations of software science and computation structures, pp. 273--288, Springer 2004). Hypergraph, typed graph and attributed graph rewriting,\\"Fundamentals of Algebraic Graph Transformation\\", Hartmut Ehrig, Karsten Ehrig, Ulrike Prange and Gabriele Taentzer for example, can be handled because they can be cast as adhesive HLR systems.

February 2005 Two weeks after having been appointed Prime Minister, Alexander Ankvab's car was fired upon in the evening of 28 February 2005. The car was reportedly hit by 17 bullets, but Ankvab was not harmed as he was traveling in the car of his Vice-Premier Leonid Lakerbaia. No injuries were reported. Newly elected President Sergei Bagapsh blamed the attack on \\"criminal elements\\" opposed to reform \\"who do not want to live in accordance to the law”. On 1 March, Ankvab ordered Interior Minister Otar Khetsia to crack down on criminal gangs, blaming the assassination attempt on people discontent with his decision to raise the taxes on the export of scrap metal. April 2005 On 1 April, Ankvab's car was attacked again, near Sukhumi. Neither he nor Vice-Premier Lakerbaia was injured, but their driver was. The next day, the Interior Ministry offered a reward of 5000 dollars for information that would lead to the capture of the perpetrators. Interior Minister Otar Khetsia, declared that \\"the same forces\\" that had been behind the assassination attempt on 28 February were responsible . Head of the criminal investigation Jamal Gogia announced on 7 April that his team was considering three possible backgrounds for the organisers of the attack: corrupt businessmen unhappy with tighter government control, criminals dissatisfied with the announced step-up in crime fighting and the Georgian or some other special service wanting to destabilise Abkhazia. June 2007 On 20 June, during a remote-control bomb detonated during a thunderstorm near New Athos. On 27 June, a group of academics, writers and journalists released a statement in which they claimed that it was generally known the bomb had been aimed at Alexander Ankvab and that it was immoral and dangerous to keep silent about it. July 2007 On July 9, 2007, Ankvab and his driver were lightly injured when the back of their vehicle was fired upon from a grenade cup discharger near Gudauta, on the road to Sukhumi.PM of ex-Soviet Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region injured in attack. International Herald Tribune, July 9, 2007. Ankvab stated that he had suffered a concussion and several shrapnel wounds to the back. President Bagapsh cut short a visit to Moscow after the attack. He blamed people opposed to reforms and the fight against organised crime for the attack, and added on 10 July that the attack was political in nature and not a settling of scores between criminals. He warned the leadership of the law enforcement agencies that they would be fired if results were not obtained within two weeks, and stated that the attack was a logical result of the agencies' failure to resolve the previous assassination attempts.

The Interior Ministry proclaimed a 500,000-ruble reward for information leading to the capture of the attackers. Georgian MP Konstantine Gabashvili accused the Russian special services of trying to get rid of Ankvab, allegedly because he had suggested reexamining all illegal real estate transactions in Abkhazia, including those involving Russian companies.A Fourth Attack on the Abkhazian PM. Kommersant. July 10, 2007. On 16 July, Ankvab denied having given an interview to the Tbilisi-based newspaper Svobodnaya Gruzya, in which he allegedly accused the Georgian Ministry of Internal Affairs of being involved in the assassination attempts, and condemned the publication as unethical. On 2 August, President Bagapsh announced that there was serious progress in the investigation, but cautioned that the investigation should be conducted carefully and scrupulously, and that everything needed to be proven with \\"150%\\" certainty. September 2010 Alexander Ankvab was elected Vice-President in December 2009 along with President Bagapsh. On 23 September 2010, 2:15 am local time, a grenade was fired at Ankvab's house in Gudauta from a RPG-26 launcher. Ankvab received non-life-threatening injuries to his arm and leg. According to Deputy Chief Prosecutor Beslan Kvitsinia, the attack was related to Ankvab's work in government. August 2011 On 29 May 2011, President Bagapsh died and Ankvab successfully contested the subsequent Presidential election. According to prosecutors, an attack was planned on Ankvab during the 17 August 2011 meeting with voters in Alakhadzykh, Gagra District. November 2011 According to prosecutors, an attack was staged on Ankvab in November 2011, in the Gudauta District village of Primorskoe, on the road to Aatse. The attack was aborted because the perpetrators had insufficient confidence in their escape routes. January 2012 According to prosecutors, the same people then tried to kill Ankvab in January 2012 by letting a bomb explode in the Gudauta District village of Kulanyrkhua, but the bomb did not go off as planned. February 2012 On 22 February 2012, Ankvab survived a mine and gun attack on his convoy in Kulanyrkhua, on the road from Gudauta to Sukhumi, which killed two of his guards.Abkhazia Georgia leader Ankvab escapes deadly ambush. BBC News. 22 February 2012 Arrests and indictments =First arrests and suicides of Almasbei Kchach and Timur Khutaba= On 12 April, six suspects were arrested for the assassination attempt in February, including well-known businessman Anzor Butba. Two were quickly released while the remaining four (Alkhas and Timur Khutaba, Ramzi Khashig and Butba) were brought before court on 14 April, receiving 2 months of pre-trial detention. On 17 April, police attempted to arrest former Interior Minister and Vice Presidential candidate Almasbei Kchach at his home in Gagra, but found him dead in an apparent suicide by firearm.Presidential Assassination Suspect Dead in Abkhazia. RIA Novost. April 17, 2012. The same day, police also arrested Murtaz Sakania in the village of Khypsta, Gudauta District. Khypsta tried to cut his throat but received no life-threatening injuries from the act. In the night from 17 to 18 April, one of the original suspects in pre-trial detention, Timur Khutaba, hanged himself in his prison cell. On 20 April, the Sukhumi court issued pre-trial detention to Murtaz Sakania and the Supreme Court board of appeal confirmed the pre- trial detention of Anzor Butba. The lawyers of Alkhas Khutaba and Ramzi Khasig had withdrawn their appeals the eve before. On 24 April, a purported suicide note of Almasbei Kchach was published online, provoking heated discussions on social networks and blogs. The message had been written on a napkin and contained grammatical and typographical mistakes. One crucial passage was difficult to read, and opinions were divided over whether the note implicated Kchach's guilt. According to unofficial inquiries by journalist Vitali Sharia, the note, contained in a coat pocket, had not been found during the official search of Kchach's properties, but at a later time by family members. On 2 May, the family of Kchach published an open letter in the weekly newspaper Novyy Den, in which it protested Kchach's innocence, stating amongst other things that he had requested a traditional oath ceremony in which he was to swear to his innocence. Kchach's family also decried the searching of his apartment and the removal of his body and his possessions in the absence of any family members. =Arrests in Duripsh= On 19 April, the Attorney General's office indicted Duripsh resident Edlar Chitanava in absentia, whom they suspected of involvement in both the July 2007 and the February 2012 assassination attempts. On 20 April, the Prosecutor's Office declared Rushbey Bartsits wanted, also native to Duripsh, and co-owner of a scrap metal plant founded by Anzor Butba. On 28 April, Edlar Chitanava was arrested. On 4 May, police arrested Edlar's brother Edgar Chitanava in the woods of the village Duripsh in the Gudauta District. In his possession they found a TT pistol, ammunition and a sleeping bag. On 8 May, the office of the prosecutor general released a press statement that on 5 May, police had arrested Tamaz Bartsits, whom they suspected of organising the July 2007 assassination attempt. On 7 May, the Sukhumi Court granted his preliminary detention until 10 May. The prosecutor's office also declared wanted Astamur Khutaba, a native of Blabyrkhua, Gudauta District. On 10 May, it was made public that Rustan Gitsba, a cousin of the Chitanava brothers, had also been arrest in the night from 4 to 5 May in Duripsh in a joint operation by the Security Services of Russia and Abkhazia. In the course of Rustan's arrest, the investigation uncovered a very large stash of weapons, including grenade launchers, anti- aircraft guns, explosivers and a flame-thrower. Rustan Gitsba is a brother of the imam Hamzat Gitsba, who had fought under Shamil Basayev during the 1992–1993 war with Georgia, participated in the January 1996 hijacking of the MV Avrasya and who was assassinated in Gudauta in August 2007. =Indictments= On 15 May, Akhas Khutaba, Ramzi Khashig and Anzor Butba were officially charged with the attempted murder of the Head of State, the attempted murder of law enforcement officers and membership of a criminal organisation. The prosecutor office also made public that on 14 May, it had placed Pavel Ardzinba on an international wanted list because it suspected him of organising the February 2012 (together with Kchach) and July 2007 assassination attempts on Alexander Ankvab. On 15 May, the court ordered Ardzinba's preliminary detention in absentia. Based on testimonies from some of the arrested suspects, the Prosecutor's Office also indicted Pavel Ardzinba for two assassination attempts on Pitsunda Mayor Beslan Ardzinba in September 2007 and June 2009. On 22 May, police found six more weapons caches in the villages of Duripsh and Jirkhva, Gudauta District, based on the testimony of Rustan Gitsba. On 12 June, the Sukhumi City Court granted a six-month extension of the pre-trial detention of Anzor Butba, Alkhas Khutaba, Ramzi Khashig and Murtaz Sakania. It also became known that as part of the case, police had re-opened investigations into the sabotage of railway tracks in Sukhumi on 9 August 2009, the attempted assassination of the Muslim cleric Salikh Kvaratskhelia on 10 July 2010 and the assassination of R. Tsotsoria on 5 July 2011. =Alleged Sochi 2014 terror plot= The Russian National Counter-Terrorism Council stated that Rustan Gitsba and the Chitanava brothers had formed a branch of the Caucasus Emirate called the 'Jamaat of Abkhazia', and that Gitsba had been its head. It further claimed that the group had meant to target the 2014 Olympic Winter Games in Sochi, that the investigation had been prompted by the discovery of empty weapons caches in the Sochi suburb of Plastunka and that the group had planned to move the weapons stash later in 2012. An anonymous member of Abkhazia's Security Council declared to the newspaper Kommersant that it was too early to say whether the group really wanted to attack the Winter Olympics, although this was being looked into. They claimed that the Security Council had established a link between the group and Almasbei Kchach. On 12 May, Secretary of the Security Council Stanislav Lakoba stated that the February 2012 assassination attempt had been organised to facilitate a coup d'état. According to Lakoba, a number of weapons from the stash had previously been smuggled to Sochi. In April, three Abkhazians had been convicted to prison sentences for weapon smuggling by the District Court in Adler. The Russian National Counter-Terrorism Council further claimed that the group's operation had been directly coordinated by Caucasus Emirate head Dokka Umarov, in close cooperation with the Georgian Security Service. It also linked the group to the arrest in February 2012 (and subsequent conviction) of a courier who had smuggled 300 detonators from Georgia. The alleged Georgian involvement was dismissed as 'utterly absurd' by Georgia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergi Kapanadze on 10 May. =Finalisation of the indictments= On 5 July 2013, the Prosecutor's Office finalised its charges. It claimed that the February 2012 attack had been organised by Anzor Butba and Almasbei Kchach on behest of Pavel Ardzinba, that the latter had offered over 7 million ruble in reward, and that the accused had previously attempted to carry out their attack in November 2011 and January 2012. The Office also alleged that the July 2007 attack had been carried out by Edgar and Edlar Chitanava, and that Edgar Chitanava had been behind the August 2011 attempted attack on Ankvab and the June 2009 attack on Beslan Ardzinba, in both cases acting on orders of Pavel Ardzinba. Edlar Chitanava was accused of organising the September 2007 attack on Beslan Ardzinba. Moreover, Edgar Chitanava and Rustan Gitsba were accused of planting a bomb on railway tracks near Sukhumi in June 2009, on behest of the Caucasus Emirate. On 22 March 2016, the Prosecutor's Office announced the sentences it was calling for. It requested life sentences for Alkhas and Astamur Khutaba and for Ramzi Khashig, 20 years imprisonment in a penal colony for Anzor Butba and Edgar and Edlar Chitanava, 16 years for Rustan Gitsba, 11 years for Tamaz Bartsits and 8 years for Murtaz Sakania. 20 years is the maximum sentence Butba may receive as he is over 65 years old, otherwise the Prosecutor's Office would also have requested a life sentence for him.

The film is a satire on the fascination and obsession of the Patels' – a Gujarati farmer community – migration to the U.S. Over the last half century, thousands of Patels have migrated to the US and have come to dominate its motel industry. The film stars Divyang Thakkar, Veronica Kalpana-Gautam, Tejal Panchasara, Kenneth Desai, and Anang Desai. The success of the film started a \\"new wave\\" in the Gujarati cinema.https://m.economictimes.com/industry/media/entertainment/good- road-builds-bridges-with-city-audience/articleshow/22924968.cms Plot In a flashback, Bachu (Kenneth Desai) and Ishwar (Anang Desai) are close friends who dream of going to the USA together, illegally, though Bachu doesn't have enough money yet. One day, Bachu receives a telephone call from Ishwar saying he has managed to reach the US. Bachu feels betrayed and starts resenting his friend. In present, Bachu has two sons, Jignesh and Harish (Divyang Thakkar). Jignesh is married and expecting a child. The younger son, Harish, just like his father, dreams to go to the US, one way or another. Bachu wants to realize his own dream through his son. Harish applies for a visa, but is ultimately rejected due to his inability to give satisfactory answers to the visa officer, Derek Thomas (Tom Alter). Meanwhile, Ishwar returns to India with his daughter, Aayushi (Veronica Kalpana-Gautam). Ishwar is now very successful in the United States; he has a chain of motels and is now known as Motel King. His purpose is to invest in Gujarat and ultimately return to his motherland and settle there. Bachu still resents his old friend, but Harish falls in love with Aayushi, in spite of his father warning against it. Harish's friend, Raheel, introduces him to his acquaintance, Kaivan (who has changed his name to Kevin), who is soon going to the US, and introduces him to his travel agent, Daulatram Chainani (Rakesh Bedi). Chainani assures Harish and his father that he'll groom Harish and make sure he gets the visa, but will need money, to which his brother, Jignesh promises that he'll arrange for the money. Jignesh borrows money from anti-social elements, who are now threatening him unless he returns the money soon. In a party arranged by Kevin, one of his friends warns Aayushi about Kevin, saying that he is not a reliable man and is going to the US by using someone else's sponsorship papers. When drunk, Aayushi warns Harish about Kevin, but Harish dismisses her concerns. One day, Harish finds out about the illegal racket Chainani is running for illegal entry to the US. Chainani also reveals that Kevin used Harish's sponsorship papers to reach the US. When all hope is lost, one of Bachu's acquaintances informs him that he has managed a fake passport using which Harish can travel to the US; Bachu and Harish agree to that. Jignesh confronts his father for always shooting him down as dafol (stupid) and threatens to sever ties with the family and the same time there are complications in Jignesh's wife pregnancy and is admitted to the hospital. When Harish is travelling to the airport with his friends to leave for the US on the fake passport, they are assaulted by people from whom Jignesh had borrowed money. Harish manages to escape and reaches the airport and is bade farewell by his parents. When Bachu returns to his house, Ishwar confronts him and tell him about his life and struggles as an illegal immigrant and hardships he had to endure before being motel king. Bachu realizes his mistake and they rush to the airport to stop Harish, only to find that Harish, touched by the plight of an old lady (Rita Bhaduri), deliberately did not board the flight as he decided to stay with parents, friends, and Aayushi. Bachu apologizes to his son Jignesh and the family is reunited In epilogue, it's revealed that Harish and Aayushi are married and they're looking for their options for a honeymoon; Harish is still insistent on going to the US for it.

After finishing the course, he assisted Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Subhash Ghai on Saawariya and Yuvvraaj respectively. Then he moved to Ahmedabad and made a Gujarati film. Abhishek Jain approached Anurag Kashyap to produce the film; although Kashyap was impressed with the script, the collaboration did not work out for the film. Divyang Thakkar, the protagonist of the film, has mentioned it as \\"natural progression to do a local film, rather than try\\" his \\"luck in a Bollywood film immediately.\\" Veronica Kalpana Gautam (from Surat) was discovered as the lead female via Facebook and considered the film \\"path breaking\\". Anang Desai, although being a Gujarati, had never acted in a Gujarati movie until Kevi Rite Jaish as he said he \\"was waiting for a project that I can connect with\\". =Filming= The director of photography, Pushkar Singh, visited Ahmedabad a year before the principal shooting to understand the lighting conditions of the city and made a video as part of the pre-production. The film was filmed with a RED Camera in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. This is the first time a RED Camera has been used in India for regional films. The film is shot mostly in Ahmedabad at 34 locations. The shooting of the film was completed in 23 days. One of the scenes in the party sequence required more than 500 empty liquor bottles and Gujarat, where the principal shooting took place, has alcohol prohibition, so the art director Taj Naqvi and his team started scouting for it 8 days prior to the schedule. 'ravi vaari bajaar' to posh hotels, residence to open grounds they collected these bottles and on the day of the shoot managed to get 731 empty liquor bottles. To avoid any police suspicion, the bottles were transported during the night and the art director Taj Naqvi ended up doing a cameo as a bartender in the movie. The casting director, Abhinay Banker, ended up auditioning for the protagonist's friend, Raheel, and was selected to play the role. The female protagonist, Veronica Kalpana-Gautam, is introduced in the film in slow motion as a tribute to Martin Scorsese; he often introduces his blonde heroines in idealizing slow-motion shots, as a possible tribute to Alfred Hitchcock. Soundtrack Kevi Rite Jaish features songs sung by Roop Kumar Rathod, Suraj Jagan, Parthiv Gohil, Mehul Surti, Aishwarya Majmudar and Aman Lekhadia for the film. The sound track was launched on 26 May 2012 at Ahmedabad. The album was made available for free to download on the official website. The response to the music has been very positive, with the soundtrack being described as soulful and praised for lyrics, especially Pankhida, the rock version of a popular garba song of the same name, which was a viral hit. Release The official poster for the film was released on 28 April 2012. The first trailer was released online on 2 May 2012 and was received positively by the audiences. The film was released on 15 June in India. The film was initially released in major Gujarat cities, Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Surat as well as some small cities, and also in Mumbai. In the first week, the film was released with 34 prints and increased to 60 prints in the second week due to increasing demand. After the initial success in Gujarat, the film was planned to be released in USA, UK, Australia, New Zealand and some middle- eastern countries as well, subsequently it was released in USA (at New Jersey and Chicago) on 31 August 2012. =Marketing= The premier was held at Cinépolis, Ahmedabad and was attended by the whole cast and crew. As part of promoting the movie, special screenings were held along with crew at Rajkot, Vadodara, Surat and Ahmedabad. The makers have widely used social media for the promotion of the movie. They released a Facebook game as well. =Critical reception= Initial reviews of the movie were positive. Long live cinema called the movie a \\"glimmer of hope\\" for Gujarati cinema. Leading Gujarati newspapers reviewed the film positively. Divya Bhaskar rated the movie 3.5 out of 5 stars and called it a \\"truly urban film\\" and \\"revolutionary\\". Gujarat Samachar also reviewed it positively. DNA praised the movie saying \\"KRJ in all is a funny roller coaster ride with its own share of romance, drama, apprehension, desperation, exhilaration and insanity\\". Leading Gujarati blog Desh Gujarat also praised the movie calling it \\"paisa vasool\\". Leading Gujarat Samachar columnist, Jay Vasavada, called it the best Gujarati film since Bhavni Bhavai. =Boxoffice= The film ran more than for six weeks in Bharuch, and ten weeks in Ahmedabad, Vadodara and a few other cities.

Biography Hendrina Cornelia Hartong was born in Rotterdam on 23 February 1906. She studied modern dance with Mary Wigman in Dresden. Mary Wigman's Ausdruckstanz expressionist modern dance style inspired Corrie Hartong and others to start their own dance schools and to develop performances themselves. Between 1928 and 1931 she taught in Chemnitz and Magdeburg. She then returned to Rotterdam to teach. In 1931 Hartong set up the Rotterdam School of Dance along with the German dancer and teacher Gertrud Leistikow, who was 21 years older. The two disagreed over objectives, and after three years Leistikow left. In 1935 the dance school became part of the Rotterdam Conservatory under Willem Pijper, with Hartong as director. She was to remain in this position until 1967. She initiated creation of the dance library to the Amsterdam Theater Instituut Nederland. World War II broke out in 1939 and the Netherlands were invaded in May 1940. On 14 May 1940 the buildings of the dance school and the main building of the conservatory were destroyed by bombs, and it was decided to merge the two conservatories in one building on the Mathenesserlaan, where the music school had a branch. Soon they moved again to a big old house that had somehow been spared, totally surrounded by rubble, and managed to continue day classes and early evening classes before curfew throughout the remainder of the war. After the war ended in 1945 she held several administrative positions. In 1946 she was co-founder of the Dutch Association of Dance Artists, and for seven years was chairman. Corrie Hartong died in Rotterdam on 9 August 1991 at the age of 86. Legacy The Corrie Hartong Fonds is named in her memory. The fund awards an annual scholarship to exceptionally talented students at Codarts. Two former students of the Havo voor Muziek en Dans, a secondary school co-located with Codarts with a special focus on music and dance, received a Corrie Hartong scholarship for the 2011-2012 academic year. Joris Bergmans was funded for an internship at Introdans in Arnhem and Christopher Renfurm for a stint at Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in New York City.

It was shot by Jim Corbett in April 1937 who noted that the animal had a broken canine tooth and several gunshot wounds in various parts of his body. First attacks Before becoming a man-eater, the tiger used to frequent the firetrack running between the villages Chuka and Kot Kindri, frequently attacking travellers passing along the path. In the book Temple Tiger and more Man-Eaters of Kumaon, Corbett describes two such incidents which occurred in the winter of 1936–37. In the first incident, a villager was driving two bullocks along the path to Chuka when a tiger suddenly appeared in his path. The villager interposed himself between the tiger and his bullocks attempting to drive the tiger away. Taking advantage of the diversion created in their favour, the bullocks bolted away to the village. The tiger, however, attacked the man as he attempted to flee. As it sprang on him it gripped the plough and the provisions the man had been carrying across his shoulders. Relieved of his belongings the man sprinted towards the village. One of the tiger's claws had inflicted a deep wound on his right arm. Some weeks later two men from Tanakpur were using the same path while going to Kot Kindri. The tiger again appeared. However, the men ignored it and continued to walk shouting as they went. The tiger sprang on the first man who was a carrying a bag of gur (unrefined sugar). The bag of gur caught in the tiger's mouth as it went down the hillside, leaving the man unharmed. Start of man-eating On a day in early January 1937, seven men and two boys were herding cattle on the outskirts of Thak village. At 10 am the cattle began to stray towards the jungle and one of the boys was sent to herd the cattle back. The tiger was hiding in the jungle and killed a calf belonging to the herd. As he was about to carry it off the boy approached close to him and was promptly killed and half-eaten. Until midday, the tiger remained close to his kills when a kakar (muntjac) spotted him and raised an alarm. The men who were sleeping at that time were woken up by the alarm. Upon realizing that the cattle had strayed into the jungle, the second boy was sent to herd them back. The tiger promptly killed the second boy, which startled the cattle into chasing away the tiger and stampeding in the direction of the village. The tiger chased the stampeding cattle and killed one of them in full view of the men. The shouting of the men and the stampeding cattle attracted the attention of the villagers who came to the spot. The mother of the second boy found her son lying dead in the jungle. Close to his corpse the parents of the first boy found their half- eaten son and the dead calf. According to Corbett, the result of being disturbed on his first kill had turned the tiger from a cattle lifter to a man-eater. First hunt for the man-eater Following these first killings, many sportsmen and district officials sat over baits all night on machans (tree platforms). Unfortunately the man-eater was only wounded twice with buckshot and not killed outright. Still he took another victim from Thak, this time another herdsman. On a wheat field two hundred yards above Thak, two orphaned brothers, aged 10 and 12, were grazing their cattle. Towards afternoon a cow strayed towards the jungle on the far side of the field. The boys attempted to drive it back and in doing so passed a bush where the tiger was lying in wait. Instead of choosing the cow, the tiger sprang on the older boy, killed him and disappeared with him into the jungle. The younger boy ran towards the village and a search party was organized. The tracks of the man- eater led into the Suwar Gadh ravine. Since night was closing in, the search was continued the following morning and the villagers found the boy's red cap and a few bits of torn and blood stained clothing. This was the Chuka man- eater's last human victim. Second hunt for the man-eater In April 1937, Corbett set out to hunt the man-eater along with Ibbotson, the deputy commissioner of Kumaon. Six young male buffaloes procured from Tanakpur were tied out at various points near Thak village as bait for the man-eater for three nights before their arrival. Over the next four days Corbett and Ibbotson sat up over the baits but were unsuccessful. On the fifth day the buffalo tied at the edge of the jungle where the first two-human kills were made was carried off by the tiger. Avoiding two machans from where it had been shot at previously, the tiger passed over a rocky field where the horns of the kill had got stuck between two boulders. Unable to free it the tiger ate a meal of the hindquarters and left it. Corbett found the man-eater's paw prints in a nearby wallow and concluded that it was a big male tiger. He also got word from the villagers that the man-eater had a broken canine tooth. On all kills made by the man-eater one of the teeth had failed to penetrate the skin. Corbett sat up over a large jamun tree near the kill that night but could not kill the tiger. He along with his men covered up the kill the following day to protect it from vultures. Ibbotson meanwhile sat up over a bullock killed at Chuka by a tiger but had no success. Third hunt for the man-eater A few days later, a buffalo that had been tied up at the lower end of the Suwar Gadh ravine was carried away. As Corbett approached the ravine he heard the growl of the tiger. Leaving the ravine along with his men he entered open ground. One of his men spotted the tiger on the adjoining hill. Corbett fired at the tiger but the bullet missed, only clipping a few hairs from the ruff of the neck. Following the tiger he found the kill in a pool four feet deep, where it had been hidden to protect it from hornets and blowflies. Returning the next day he found the kill had been removed from the pool and had been fully consumed except for the head and the hooves. Returning to camp Corbett received news that a cow had been killed in a ravine on the far side of the Ladhya Valley. Corbett along with divisional officer MacDonald sat up over the kill. However instead of the man-eater a tigress with two young cubs appeared and led them towards the concealed kill. After the cubs had found the kill, she went asleep close to the tree where Corbett was concealed. After the cubs had finished feeding, she licked both of them clean and then the family left. This tigress was later to become known as the Thak man-eater and was shot by Corbett in November 1938. Final hunt for the man-eater The kill at Thak was uncovered to let the vultures eat it and another buffalo was tied up at the edge of the jungle. This buffalo was killed and carried away by the tiger into the Ladhya Valley. Corbett chose a fig tree close to the kill to wait for the maneater while Ibbotson decided to sit up over the first kill at Thak, which had not been consumed by the vultures. While sitting up over the kill, Corbett noticed the tiger coming towards it with the help of the alarms of monkeys. The man-eater eventually came to rest under the tree where Corbett was waiting for him. From the tree, Corbett could see his hind leg and tail. Corbett's first shot broke the man-eater's back and as he was sliding down, Corbett killed him by firing a second bullet through his chest. Post- mortem Corbett found the man-eater had a broken canine tooth in his lower jaw and several gunshot wounds over his body. He concluded that these injuries together with the accidental encounter with the first two boys had turned him into a man-eater.

Coffee is one of Angola's largest agricultural products; at its peak, while under Portuguese rule, Angola was the third-largest producer of coffee in the world. History Plantation and production of coffee contributed largely to the economy of Angola's northwestern area, including the Uíge Province. Coffee production was started by the Portuguese in the 1830s and soon became a cash crop; the first commercial coffee plantation in Angola was started by a Brazilian farmer in 1837. The most common crop grown on approximately 2000 Angolan plantations, owned mostly by the Portuguese, was robusta coffee. In the 1970s, Angola was one of the largest coffee-producing countries in Africa. However, the civil war for independence from the Portuguese rule devastated the coffee plantations and many coffee agronomists migrated to Brazil, with the coffee plants grown on plantations becoming wild bushes. Rehabilitation of the plantations has been ongoing since 2000, but the investment required to replace the 40-year-old unproductive plants are estimated to be US$230 million. With the opening up of new roads, industrial activity in the province is taking shape. Production The Angola National Institute of Coffee (INCA) has three research stations, mainly responsible for producing and distributing robusta seedlings, in Gabela, Kwanza Sul, and Uige; however, due to wartime damage, only one of them is functional. Actual coffee production predominantly occurs in Uige, Kwanza Norte, Kwanza Sul, Bengo, and Cabinda. Production of arabica coffee, which accounts for some 5% of Angola's coffee exports, takes place in Benguela, Bie, Huambo, Huila, and Moxico. Angola had its highest level of coffee production in 1973, recording a total yield of . According to a 2000 study by the International Coffee Organization, coffee production's contribution to the economy in Angola is negligible; coffee exports in 1997 accounted for only $5 million, with total exports valued at $4,626 million. Regulation The coffee industry in Angola is monitored and regulated by the Secretary of State for Coffee through the Secretariat of Coffee (established 1988), which in turn tasks INCA to oversee production on the ground. All coffee producers must obtain a license valued at around $40 and prove that they have the prerequisites to properly produce coffee, including having the capital to handle at least of coffee and a serviceable warehouse.

The murals were the creations of artist René Moncada, who was among the earliest residents of the neighborhood through its rise as the center of the 1980s New York Art World. René Moncada's I AM THE BEST ARTIST murals became icons not only of the neighborhood's art world associations but of the era in general, when art became a profitable commodity and SoHo became its Wall Street. The murals have been likened to effective advertising slogans and recognized as an early act of \\"art provocation\\". The murals placed René at the forefront of street artists of the era and helped transform the streets of the art district into an alternative exhibition venue. Background René has described the murals as a thumb in the nose to the art community he helped pioneer but by which he later felt ignored. The artist — a very vocal opponent of censorship, hypocrisy and oppression — explains some of his activities as stemming from a desire to liberate not only the art world but also the world at large. It is attributes such as that, he has reflected in hindsight, which may qualify him as \\"the best artist\\", having nothing to do with artistic skills. René's ubiquitous declarations, spelled out in large, capital letters punctuated by his signature \\"René\\" written in a flowing font, were a topic of conversation and debate at the time, and provided a backdrop to photographs taken by a multitude of tourists, art students and advertising layouts in magazines worldwide.  Locations Mural locations were centered along the stretch of West Broadway between Houston Street and Canal Street. The most prominent mural, near the corner of Broome Street and West Broadway (pictured above), measured 10 feet by 50. The largest of the murals was located on a wall along the southwest corner of West Broadway where Grand Street intersects. This location appears in a montage sequence of the 1987 movie The Secret of My Success, in which a young Cindy Crawford makes an un-credited appearance walking past the mural, catching the eye of the lead character played by Michael J. Fox. The mural was featured prominently among other iconic images of 1980s New York City in general, and SoHo in particular. Another prominent mural spanning the length of a parking lot wall on Wooster Street was painted at a height so that it would be visible above parked cars. René's gallery space and home was across the street from this lot.  Conflicts and criticism  René always insisted he obtained permission from landlords to paint the murals, but requests were also sometimes refused, with some SoHo residents commenting that although a mural would be welcome on their property, an I AM THE BEST ARTIST mural would not be welcome. In the case of one refusal, René painted the attendants' stand of the parking lot facing the declined property, getting permission from its owner instead. Another dispute involved a French artist named Le Pointre who tried to claim use of a wall for which René insisted he'd already obtained permission to paint a mural. Vandals often defaced these walls with sarcastic embellishment such as \\"I Am The Best Fartist\\" and \\"I Am The Best Anus\\", or added simplistic commentary such as \\"No No No\\" or \\"I hate you\\". Graffiti artists of the era also occasionally obscured the murals with their own work. IATBA murals which may have been defaced would be faithfully repainted by René. René claims the art critic Robert Hughes once assured him directly that he was not, in fact, the best artist. An Artforum writer used an unrelated art review to shine a negative light on The Best Artist, calling René \\"untalented\\" and \\"unchic\\". Loss of long-time artist friends was another unfortunate consequence. = Legal case = One of the murals located along West Broadway was across the street from a gallery owned by Lynn Rubin. René claimed to have obtained permission from the owner of the building to paint the mural at that location. When it came to his attention that Rubin was having her staff paint over the mural, René arrived to videotape them. Rubin tried to stop him from recording, and it was then, René alleges in a lawsuit filed against her, that she assaulted him by pushing the camcorder into his face, causing him hardship and suffering. The outcome of the lawsuit was not published, but René's murals, and the related legal proceedings, raised discussion about intellectual property, artist's rights, and the First Amendment. IATBA Gallery René opened his storefront space at 147 Wooster Street, SoHo, as \\"René's Gallery\\" in 1977. He opened it to showcase his own artwork — a \\"monument to himself\\", as described by John Strausbaugh in a New York Press article of the era — and also used the space to the rear of the gallery as his studio. As René's signature murals gained notoriety, his gallery was also called \\"I AM THE BEST ARTIST gallery\\". The gallery was also the site of fashion shows, events by performance artists such as Annie Sprinkle, and exhibitions of artwork by, among others, ballpoint pen artist Lennie Mace, whose exhibition publicity listed the gallery indistinctly as 147 Wooster Gallery. René naively thought opening his own gallery would earn entry into the burgeoning SoHo art set, and went about inviting neighboring gallery owners to come for studio visits or private viewings, but his invitations — and presence in general — went largely ignored.  End of the murals  As the neighborhood went upscale and the value of blank wall space rose with property values, I AM THE BEST ARTIST murals were one-by-one covered by billboards or otherwise destroyed in the 1990s. One was removed after the landlord demanded $500 per month to allow René's mural to remain. René later adapted the phrase's abbreviation (IATBA) into his signature - and a surname of sorts. René no longer occupies his long-time Wooster Street space.

A survey conducted in 2007 Gentil- Beccot, A., Mele S., Holtkamp, A., O’Connell, H., and Brooks, T. found that SPIRES database users wanted the portal to provide more services than the, at that time, already 30-year-old system could provide.

This method, Isherwood felt, lent a ship much greater longitudinal strength than in ships built in the traditional method, where a series of transverse frames were fit together closely from the keel upwards. Longitudinal framing was a known method of shipbuilding before Isherwood. Naval engineer J. Scott Russell, for instance, had built several longitudinally framed ships, including the SS Great Eastern. However, no one had made the process practical from a commercial standpoint, which was Isherwood's achievement. The first commercial vessel constructed with the Isherwood system, the oil-tank steamer Paul Paix, of some 6,600 tons deadweight in 1908, was scrutinized by other shipbuilders and owners. The success of it and the first general cargo liner to be constructed on the \\"Isherwood\\" system, the Gascony in early 1909, encouraged builders in a number of countries to use longitudinal framing as well. Traditional versus longitudinal In traditional framing, transverse frames are attached at right angles to the keel, spaced between apart. These are secured at the lower end to the keel or center keelson and at the upper ends to the deck beams. They are in two parts called floors and side frames and, while necessary, subtract from cargo space inside the ship. Longitudinal strength comes from the keel, keelson, intercostals (also called longitudinals), tank top and decks to resist stress caused by the rolling forces of the sea. The side plating also takes much of this stress. If there were insufficient longitudinal strength, the hull would bend and eventually \\"break its back.\\" In the days before steel ship construction, this was reportedly the only practical way to build a ship since the inside and deck planking had to be laid longitudinally, with the deck planking laid upon transverse beams connected to the timber heads. Even with the introduction of iron construction, this method allowed for simplicity in construction and transverse strength in short vessels. However, as ships grew in length, longitudinal strength became increasingly important. In longitudinal framing, very heavy transverse frames are spaced much further apart than in traditional framing--about A large number of longitudinal frames are then attached to hold the shell plating. The longitudinal frames at the sides fit into notches cut into the transverse frames, while the ones near the bottom of the ship are sometimes made continuous between transverse bulkheads. The transverses are connected to the shell plating at heavy angles and with a tank top are cut at the margin plate. Strong tie bars extend from the face angle on the transverses to the tank top plating. Under the tank top, except for notches cut for the bottom and tank top longitudinals, the transverses are much like ordinary floor plates. The deck longitudinals furnish ample strength, even when large hatch openings must be accommodated. References Bibliography * United States Navy, Proceedings, p. 302.

Lion's intention was to bring focus to how homophobic expressions, common in the hip-hop community, are part of a larger problem, and that leading voices of hip hop shouldn't turn their backs on their LGBT friends and family. One of the often quoted lyrics is \\"'Gay is OK' may be the No. 1 thing a rapper shouldn't say.\\" Equality Texas named Lion an Ally Award winner, recognizing people and businesses that advanced \\"equality for all Texans\\", as well as 'Miss West Texas' Kaylee Anne Keith, his former fiancée, who took her platform of “bullying awareness and prevention” to schools across the state. The popular culture reaction to \\"BEN\\" has been surprisingly supportive in the traditionally and notoriously homophobic hip-hop music industry, which, for example, uses \\"no homo\\" in lyrics. \\"BEN\\" went viral, racking up \\"tens of thousands of hits\\" on YouTube, and Lion's songs have increased exposure on \\"taste-making radio stations and websites.\\" Lion is also doing more live shows including gay pride festivals in Memphis (Mid-South Pride) and his hometown of El Paso. Conception and recording Lion, who earned a degree from the University of Texas at Austin in Music with an Emphasis on Vocal Performance and Concentration in Sound Engineering, conceived and wrote the song while researching music for his upcoming full length Michael Jackson tribute album.\\"How \\"Ben\\" song and video was born .\\" Adair Lion. AdairLion.com. May 26, 2012. He found an a cappella version of Jackson's \\"Ben\\" and centered that as the main hook, sped up the sample and made a hip-hop beat around the vocals. Ben \\"wouldn't be shunned\\" if everyone else knew him, as Jackson puts it, \\"like I do\\".Karen Smith Welch. \\"Amarillo rapper's viral video declares, 'Gay is OK'.\\" Amarillo-Globe News, May 8, 2012. Lion noted that in hip hop it is standard to bash gays and that on every rap album he's heard the singers calls each other faggot, \\"as the first attack point.\\" While Lion was in college, a friend of his came out, and it was confusing how to react to the news. The issue started to conceptualize how the Ben that Michael Jackson sings of could be seen as LGBT people being the best friends of the hip-hop community. In the movie, and song, Ben is the best friend and the metaphor is touched again when Lion raps \\"(and) to all the little dudes learning to mack, the hottest chicks got a gay in their clique, remember that.\\"'Gay Is Okay,' Adair Lion's Pro-LGBT Youth Rap, Samples Michael Jackson, Curtis M. Wong, May 1, 2012. Huffington Post. Lion thought of his gay friend and was inspired by the It Gets Better campaign, an Internet-based project founded September 2010 by columnist Dan Savage and his husband Terry Miller in response to an increase of suicide among LGBT youth who were bullied because they were gay or because their peers suspected that they were gay. The goal is to prevent suicide among LGBT youth by having LGBT adults convey the message that the teens' lives will improve. Lion sees \\"Ben\\" as a way to being a rap version for the It Gets Better effort. Composition Lion has stated, \\"After choosing the lyrics that most moved me I sped up the sample and made a hip-hop beat around the vocals. I loosely used the kick pattern and song layout of \\"All Falls Down\\" by Kanye West.\\" Lion is believed to be the first rapper to quote LGBT activist Harvey Milk, from his \\"Hope Speech\\", \\"I'm Harvey Milk and I'm here to recruit you.\\" to read \\"Hello, my name is Adair and I'm here to recruit you\\".Straight Rapper Takes On Homophobia (With Some Michael Jackson Mixed In), Tanene Allison, May 7, 2012. Huffington Post. The phrase was a play by Milk on the accusation that gay people recruit impressionable youth into their numbers. The song has a theological message with Lion rhyming \\"Being Christian, it's hard to say this, the Bible was wrong this time; It's in every species and every family I've met, so I don't see why to the world it's a crime\\".'Gay Is Okay,' Adair Lion's Pro-LGBT Youth Rap, Samples Michael Jackson retrieved 4 May 2012 Although the video is supportive of LGBT people Lion is himself hetero.Texas Rapper Adair Lion Releases MJ-Inspired “Gay Is Okay” retrieved 4 May 2012 He considers himself to be a straight ally.

He was criticized for being a \\"hater\\" for doing so but defended his actions and stated that those artists are among his heroes: Music video Lion uploaded \\"BEN - Adair Lion (Texas Rapper Makes \\"Gay is Okay\\" Song)\\", the music video April 30, 2012 to his YouTube channel.

In its first week the video has over 156,000. After thirteen days the video was blocked by Universal Music Group and a replacement video not using a modified sample from Jackson was reposted. In the music video there are many references to the line \\"queer as a three dollar bill\\" as a metaphor for homophobic places accompanied by images of a Ben Franklin three-dollar bill, but in the end of the video the bill is accepted [by hip hop] in exchange for rainbow-colored lollipops, a metaphor for acceptance of LGBT people. The name comes from the expression \\"Queer as a three dollar bill.\\" The Bureau of Engraving and Printing has never been authorized to print a $3 note. However, before the Civil War, banks operating under State charters issued notes of that denomination. These notes were printed by private contractors and were not obligations of the federal government. \\"Queer as a three dollar bill\\" dates back to the 1920s and refers to anything strange, suspicious, though it can also refer to homosexual.Robert Hendrickson, The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Words and Phrases Origins. Checkmark Books, 2000. pg. 558. The image accompanying the single is of a pile of three dollar bills.
