He was born in C√≥rdoba del Tucum√°n, Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata (now C√≥rdoba, Argentina), on 3 April 1808, and died at Monte Muro, Navarre, on 27 June 1874.  Biography  Manuel de la Concha was born in C√≥rdoba in present-day Argentina. His mother was Petra Irigoyen and his father was Juan Guti√©rrez de la Concha y Maz√≥n, brigadier de marina (naval officer), and later gobernador intendente (governor) of the province of Tucum√°n. His father was killed during the fighting that followed the May Revolution in 1810. In 1814 the family moved to Spain, where Manuel de la Concha began his schooling. He entered the Royal Guard as a cadet in 1820, was promoted to alf√©rez (second lieutenant) in 1825 and to lieutenant in 1832. He became a supporter of the Liberals, for which he spent some months in prison before the death of Fernando VII. He was released during the First Carlist War, and joined the supporters of Isabella II. He was posted to the Army of the North and distinguished himself in the actions at Durango, Alsasua and Z√∫√±iga, being awarded the Cross of San Fernando. In April 1836 he was given his first military command in recognition of his bravery in battle. He received further promotions and reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel after the conquest of Urrieta. The battle of Belasco√°in earned him a second Cross of San Fernando and promotion to colonel. He became mariscal de campo (a rank between brigadier and lieutenant-general) in 1840. He then took part in the campaign of Arr√≥niz, and won a third Cross of San Fernando. He supported the Moderate (moderado) party. In 1841 he was appointed comandante general (commanding general) of the provinces of Guadalajara and Cuenca. In October 1841, along with Diego de Le√≥n and other military men and moderado politicians, he took part in the failed attempt to end the regency of Espartero, and due to this he was compelled to go into exile in Florence. In the summer of 1843 he took an active part in the fall of Espartero, brought about by Narv√°ez, and this earned him promotion to lieutenant-general. The moderados who gained power appointed him inspector-general of the infantry, and later captain-general of Old Castile. Death of the Marquess of Duero, by Joaqu√≠n Agrasot, painted 1884 Mausoleum of the Marquess of Duero at the Pantheon of Illustrious Men, Madrid In 1847 he was ordered to lead an expedition to Portugal to help uphold the reign of Queen Maria II of Portugal, under the terms of the Quadruple Alliance. On 30 June 1847 he defeated the Septembrist forces led by Francisco Xavier da Silva Pereira, first Count of Antas, and restored by force the authority of the monarchy in Oporto. For this he received honours in both Spain and Portugal, in particular becoming Marqu√©s (marquis) del Duero and receiving the title of Grandee of the first class. As captain-general of Catalonia, in 1849 he put down the revolt of the matiners (Catalan) or madrugadores (Spanish) during the Second Carlist War. He worked with General Leopoldo O'Donnell during the bienio progresista (1854‚Äì56), when in addition to his post of captain-general of Catalonia, he served as deputy to the Cortes and chairman of the Junta Consultiva de Guerra (advisory war council). He was captain-general of the Two Castiles during the Uni√≥n Liberal government, and in the 1860s he was Speaker of the Senate through five consecutive terms. In 1872 the Third Carlist War broke out: and despite his age, on the request of General Serrano, Guti√©rrez de la Concha returned to both military and political activity, and became one of the strongest supporters of Alfonso XII of Spain. On the grounds of his great ability and military prestige he was considered the leading 19th-century Spanish strategist. This led the republican government in 1874 to give him command of the Third Corps of the Army of the North, a unit that was essential to the defence of the r√©gime. For three months he was responsible for the northern front opposing the Carlists, and won important victories including the relief of Bilbao, in May. During preparations for the attack on Estella, the symbolic Carlist capital, he was fatally wounded when struck by a bullet at Monte Muro, near the village of Ab√°rzuza, on the afternoon of 27 June 1874. Equestrian statue in Madrid With victory over the Carlists now imminent, Manuel Guti√©rrez de la Concha would probably have been chosen to proclaim the restoration of the Bourbons to the Spanish throne, with the support of Antonio C√°novas del Castillo. In the event it was one of his subordinates, General Mart√≠nez Campos, who was to proclaim this a few months later at Sagunto. Manuel Guti√©rrez de la Concha wrote T√°ctica de las tres armas (Tactics of the Three Forces) (1862), a work highly valued in its time, and recently re- published by the Spanish Ministry of Defence.  San Pedro Alc√°ntara  Guti√©rrez de la Concha was married to Francisca de Paula Tovar y Gasca, marchioness of Revilla, of Aguilares and of Castro de Torres, countess of Cancelada and of Lences, who had a substantial holding of farms and country estates. On one of these, on the outskirts of M√°laga, the marquis improved the yield of the cane sugar crop, and this may have encouraged him to start new agricultural enterprises based on cane sugar. For this purpose he began to acquire land holdings on the western coast of the Province of M√°laga at the end of the 1850s. Making use of legal provisions enacted in 1855, 1866 and 1868 to promote rural development, he set up an agricultural settlement at San Pedro Alc√°ntara; this was the origin of the present-day village. The settlement was a large estate of approximately 5,000 ha, including land around Marbella, Benahav√≠s and Estepona, where he introduced the latest agricultural techniques and machinery, in addition to a training farm and an up-to-date sugar processing plant.

Taylor (born 1947) is the former director of the Oregon Climate Service at Oregon State University in Corvallis, a position he held from 1989 until his retirement on 1 May 2008. Education and career Born in Santa Barbara, California, Taylor holds a B.A. in mathematics from the University of California, Santa Barbara (1969) and a M.S. in meteorology from the University of Utah (1975). In 1989, he became the director of the Oregon Climate Service at Oregon State University (OSU); in this capacity, he tracked weather and issued long-range weather forecasts for the state of Oregon. Beginning in 1991, he was popularly known as \\"Oregon's state climatologist.\\" However, in 2007, the then-governor of Oregon, Ted Kulongoski, said that there was no such position in the state and demanded that Taylor stop using such a title, saying \\"he's not my weatherman\\". Taylor was also the president of the American Association of State Climatologists from 1998 to 2000. In 2008, after he retired from OSU, he founded, and became the president of, the consulting firm Applied Climate Services, where he still worked as of February 2014. Views on global warming Taylor has expressed a skeptical position on global warming. While his position is at odds with the scientific consensus on the topic, he has argued that \\"consensus in science doesn't really mean much. What matters is the truth. Often consensus is wrong.\\" Taylor considers global warming to be primarily caused by natural variability, not human activity, though he acknowledges that both have played a role. In 2005, Taylor testified before the Environment Committee of the Oregon House of Representatives in opposition to a bill that would increase the fuel efficiency standards for automobiles in Oregon to match California's. In his testimony, he said, \\"I believe the effect of greenhouse gas is a relatively minor one,\\" and \\"I really believe natural variation and natural factors are a bigger cause of climate change than you and I.\\" Personal life Taylor is a vegetarian, rode a bike to Oregon State University when he worked there (as of 2007), and engages in many environmentalist practices.

The movie was first released in Taiwan under the title \\"Fart King Ëá≠Â±ÅÁéã\\". The movie was renamed and dubbed in Cantonese for all the Taiwanese actors to cater to the Hong Kong audiences. Hong Kong actors Ng Man-tat, Athena Chu and Gabriel Wong Yat-San (known by his nickname \\"Small Turtle\\") filmed their lines in Cantonese which was dubbed over by an actor for the Mandarin version. The movie was released in Taiwan on 25 March 1995 and then a week later on 1 April 1995 in Hong Kong. Plot Siao San (Steven Hao Shao Wen) is a mischievous little boy from a well off family, but he feels neglected by his father because of his marriage to a younger woman. After being punished by his father for playing a trick on his new step-grandmother, San decides to run away from home. Tat (Ng Man-tat) is a middle-aged High School grounds keeper who has a crush on a blind floral girl (Athena Chu). He takes advantage of her blindness by pretending to be a rich man who often buys her flowers only to give it back to her as a gift. One day while at the park, Tat is hit with a bat by a women chasing San for stealing candy from a baby. To retaliate, Tat uses the bat to throw at the women but hits a police officer instead. Both Tat and San fled from the officer and were forced to get familiar with each other to rid the officer. San decides to follow Tat after their run-in with the police officer and though Tat tries to get rid of him, San persists to following him home and even to the high school where he works. At the high school where Tat works at, Mo (Takeshi Kaneshiro) is the popular school boy who has a crush on Ah Jane (Chen Yu) and often attempts to get her attention through immature means only to be ignored by her. However, Mo and Jane are in the same class, class 5D, which also happens to be the infamous class full of misfits that Mo is the leader of. The misfits often pull dangerous pranks to scare off teachers. A new teacher arrives, but he falls into the pranks, causing him to pass out, and having to be carried out of the school in an ambulance. San sits outside of Tat's door that night in the rain until Tat decided to take him in, which he finally decides to care for him temporarily. Tat takes San out to the city the next day to do various jobs, even resorting to conning others, to earn some money so that Tat can continue to buy flowers from the blind girl again. He learns that surgery costing HKD 500,000 is required in order for her to see, which she works effortlessly to sell her flowers. Seeing how class 5D has gone through eight teachers already since the school year started, the school advertises in hiring another teacher while the deaf headmaster decides to personally teach the class temporarily. He gives them a pop quiz, threatening to expel anyone who fails the quiz. This prompted the class to cheat in which ever way they can to cheat while keeping him blinded and deaf. When this fails, the school decides to offer HKD $500,000 salary to anyone who is able to handle class 5D. Though San encourages Tat to take the job, Tat refuses due to class 5D's reputation with former teachers. San offers the solution of introducing him to someone who can teach him martial arts, but Tat is still skeptical. After school, Jen is being harassed by a biker; Mo jumps into the fight only to get beaten instead and then humiliated. After this event, Mo starts to lose respect from other students. Though Jane continues to ignore him, she acknowledges what he had done for her, after which he spontaneously tells her that he was Bruce Lee in his past life. That same night, San brings a monk apprentice to personally meet Tat, but Tat shrugs him off, thinking he was a homeless man instead. The monk apprentice then flies away, in which Tat was amazed and finally decided to pursue martial arts. The Head monk then takes him as an apprentice after his persistent presence at the temple's entrance. Through vigorous and somewhat foolish training, the Head monk decides both San and Tat are ready for hypnotism but decides to graduate the two even though the training was insufficient and incomplete. Tat takes on as the instructor of class 5D and counters all the pranks previously used on the last teacher. The next few days, Tat trains the student similar to boot camp using very severe methods to get the students to study to retake the quiz. Tat then goes to visit the blind girl and offers to pay for the surgery to fix her eyes. One night, Mo tries to convince Tat to hypnotize him to his past life but Tat refuses. Mo continues to be shamed by the biker, who is very persistent in asking Jane out on a date. When Jane continually refuses, he threatens to beat Mo until she changes her answer. When Tat stops the fight, Mo again persuades Tat to hypnotize him, which he then turns into Bruce Lee and finally defeats the biker. Although Jane and Mo ends being closer, Tat is fired from his teaching position by aiding in the fight and he loses the bonus to help the blind girl in her surgery. Seeing Tat sulking, San and Tat goes to San's previous home at night to get the money. He goes to his father's safe in the bedroom but paused to cry over him. When his father wakes up, San had no choice but to toss the money to Tat and Tat leaves San behind. After giving the stolen money to the blind girl, Tat returns to confess his crimes to San's father and promises to pay them back. Even though he was offered to stay with San, he refuses and takes on various jobs working as an honest homeless man. He happens upon the blind girl's floral shop, but she does not recognize Tat because of his refusal to speak. When he finally speaks, the blind girl is shocked to see his state of living. When her husband approaches them, Tat leaves them. Tat is reunited with San when he ran away from home again.

The movie was filmed around the Daan district of Taipei, Taiwan. Noticeable places in the movie are the \\"Shangri La Far Eastern Plaza Hotel\\", \\"The Mall\\", and \\"Daan Forest Park\\". Ng Man-tat, Athena Chu and Gabriel Wong Yat-San who were constant collaborators on Stephen Chow movies at that time were brought on the movie to cater to Hong Kong audiences for the Hong Kong release of the film since comedy movies starring Chow and Ng were a big hit in Hong Kong during that period. The storyline of the film is supposedly to be based in Hong Kong but noticeable things that differentiate Hong Kong and Taiwan can be seen in the movie (such as the taxi cabs in the movie are yellow instead of red and the currency has Sun Yat-sen on it instead of Queen Elizabeth II because Hong Kong was still a British Colony when the movie was filmed).

He became a vice-admiral and a member of the Admiralty board, then entered a career in politics. He was elected a deputy of the Constituent Assembly in 1848, served briefly as Minister of the Navy, and became a senator in the Second French Empire in 1852. Napoleonic era Joseph Gr√©goire Casy was born in Auribeau-sur-Siagne, Alpes-Maritimes, on 8 October 1787. His parents were Philippe Casy, a merchant, and Marianne Lambert. His parents planned that he would become a doctor. When Casy was 10 years old a squadron commanded by Admiral Pierre Martin came to anchor in Golfe-Juan. Casy and his schoolmates were taken on board the ship √áa ira. The boy at once decided that he would become a sailor. Two months later he ran away to Cannes to find a boat that would take him, but was soon found and brought back. His father realized that he was determined to go to sea, and made him study for a naval career. Casy joined the navy in 1803 and became a midshipman on 8 October 1804. In 1805 he served on the frigate Pomone when it took Prince J√©r√¥me Bonaparte to Algiers to reclaim Genovese slaves. He served on the Annibal in 1807 on the expedition to Corfu. When the Russian vessels Moscow and Saint Peter joined the French squadron, Admiral Honor√© Joseph Antoine Ganteaume assigned him to serve under the Russian commander. Casy was appointed a sub-lieutenant on 12 July 1808. He served under Admiral Julien Cosmao in operations off Barcelona and Tarragona and distinguished himself in the Mediterranean expedition of 1813. In 1813 he was detached to take 80 gunners to Cape Sepet, where they armed the batteries of Puy and Marduy. These batteries were attacked by English ships. They returned a fire so intense and well-directed that one of the ships had to be towed away. Restoration Under the Bourbon Restoration Casy was made a lieutenant on 16 July 1816. He embarked as second-in-command of the corvette Rhinoc√©ros and then the corvette Ciotad. In 1819 he was assigned to the Colosse, a 74-gun ship. That year he sailed on the Colosse in a group of ships under Rear Admiral Jurien dispatched to establish trade relations with the South American states. At the end of this long voyage he was made a knight of St. Louis. In 1821 he was transferred to the 46-gun Galath√©e in the Anglo-French squadron charged with watching the coasts of Africa. Casy participated in the Spanish Civil War in 1823, blockading the coast of Catalonia on the frigate Junon. Casy then was made chief of staff to Rear-Admiral Claude Charles Marie du Campe de Rosamel. In the three-year campaign he served on board the Marie-Th√©r√®se. He was appointed Knight of the Legion of Honour and attained the rank of Commander in April 1827. He published his book Extrait analytique de la tactique navale, an analysis of naval tactics, which was very well received. He took a few months leave, then embarked on the Breslau. Casy took part in the expedition to Greece in 1828 where he assisted in the capture of Navarino, Koroni, Methoni and the forts of the Peloponnese. He was assigned the Trident, under Admiral Rosamel. After the evacuation of the Morea this vessel assisted expeditions to Algiers, Tripoli and Portugal. Admiral Hugon, commanding a division of five ships, chose the Trident as his flagship. Admiral Roussin, commander-in-chief of the Portugal expedition, complimented Casy on his handling of his vessel during the Battle of the Tagus. July Monarchy Casy in old age Casy became a captain on 9 January 1831 after the July Revolution of 1830. He was assigned to the 52-gun Calypso (formerly the Marie-Th√©r√®se) in 1832. From 1833 to 1836 he commanded the 80-gun Duquesne. He served in the Atlantic and the West Indies. From 1837 to 1838 he was captain of the 100-gun Hercule, where he instructed the king's son, Fran√ßois d'Orl√©ans, Prince of Joinville, in naval matters. Casy was promoted to rear admiral on 14 February 1839. Two years later he led an operational squadron. In 1841 he was appointed maritime prefect of Rochefort. On 17 December 1845 he was promoted to vice-admiral and made a member of the Admiralty Board. Political career After the February Revolution of 1848, Casy ran for election on 23 April 1848 to represent Var, where he was maritime prefect, in the Constituent Assembly. He appeared to be a republican, and on 11 May 1848 the Executive Commission made him Minister of the Navy. He kept this post until General Louis-Eug√®ne Cavaignac took office. At first Casy voted with the left, and was in favor of banishing the Orleans family. Later he moved towards the right, and on 7 October 1848 voted against the Gr√©vy amendment. Casy then requested leave from the Assembly and took command of the maritime district of Toulon. He helped with the preparations for the expedition to Rome. and declared himself in favor of Louis Napoleon. After the coup of 2 December 1851, he was appointed to the Senate on 26 January 1852.

It is found in fairly deep waters in the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of Japan and around the Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is very unusual among starfish in that it broods its young on its upper surface. Its common name in Japanese is \\"Komochi-momiji\\". Description Trophodiscus almus is a five-armed pentagonal starfish growing to a diameter of about . It has a wide disc and short, bluntly pointed arms. The aboral (upper) surface is slightly convex and is covered in paxillae, umbrella-shaped structures with spiny margins. The paxillae are larger near the inter-arm areas and smaller at the centre of the disc and near the arm-tips. The madreporite is about half way from the centre of the disc to the margin, the anus is small, and there are respiratory structures known as papulae between and concealed by the paxillae. A notable feature are the 13 to 20 large calcareous plates, wider than they are long, that extend around the margins of each arm. There seem to be two different colour forms of this starfish. Some individuals have a bright red or orange- red aboral surface and a paler, reddish-brown oral (under) surface. Other individuals have a yellowish-green aboral surface and yellowish-brown oral surface. In both cases, the superomarginal plates are paler and contrast with the other parts. Distribution Trophodiscus almus was thought to be endemic to the Sea of Okhotsk from where it was first described by the American zoologist Walter K. Fisher in 1917 from material collected by the marine research vessel . More recently it has been discovered in the Sea of Japan and the waters around Hokkaido. Its depth range is and it is fairly uncommon. In the Sea of Japan it is found on muddy sand bottoms where the water temperature is . Biology Juvenile starfish of this species are brooded on the aboral surface of the female between the paxillae. Up to sixteen young have been found on one adult, the juveniles being either reddish-orange or greyish- green. The colour of the offspring does not always coincide with that of the parent, the greyish-green form sometimes being found on the red adults. Brooding the young in this location is very unusual among starfish, and the only other species known to do it are the sister species, Trophodiscus uber, from the Sea of Okhotsk, Leptychaster kerguelenensis from the extreme south of the Indian Ocean and Ctenodiscus australis from the Southern Ocean.

It has been classified as a Monument historique since 1975. The Villa is the seat of the European Audiovisual Observatory since 1992. History This ample villa was built for the owner of the Schutzenberger brewery , Louis-Oscar Sch√ºtzenberger (1866‚Äì1943), by Jules () Berninger and his brother in law, Gustave () Krafft, two prolific local architects who often worked together between 1895 and 1905. Work on the villa started in 1897 and it was finished in 1900. Inspired by Italianate architecture in its shape and the design of its garden, it is one of the most lavish and frequently cited examples of Art Nouveau architecture in Strasbourg. In spite of this, due to the financial decline of the Schutzenberger brewery, the villa was sold and threatened with demolition in 1972. It was ultimately saved by the municipality but stood empty until 1978. The ground floor was then rented by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which became renter of the whole building in 1989.

FCDI offers several terminally differentiated cell types as catalog products: iCell¬Æ Cardiomyocytes, iCell Neurons, iCell Endothelial Cells, and iCell Hepatocytes. CDI's MyCell¬Æ Products portfolio enables customer-provided donor samples to be reprogrammed, gene edited, and differentiated. The company also has several prototype products derived from pluripotent stem cells, including iCell Cardiac Progenitors, iCell Hematopoietic Progenitors, iCell Astrocytes, and iCell Skeletal Myoblasts. FCDI has two locations. Their corporate headquarters are located in Madison, Wisconsin and a second facility resides at the Buck Institute for Aging in Novato, California. In 2013, FCDI was awarded a contract from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine to reprogram and bank iPS cells from 3,000 individuals. , FCDI has more than 800 patents and licensed technologies as part of their technology portfolio.  Recognition  FCDI appeared on MIT Technology Review's \\"Disruptive Companies\\" list in both 2011 and 2012. FCDI was recognized by The Scientist for having among the year's \\"Top 10 Innovations\\" in 2010 for the iCell Cardiomyocyte product, and in 2012 for the MyCell Product. The iCell Cardiomyocyte product was also recognized in 2010 by MIT Technology Review as being among the year's \\"Top 10 Emerging Technologies\\". In 2011, the same product received Gold Winner status in The Wall Street Journal's \\"Technology Innovation Award\\". Application areas =Toxicity= FCDI began to develop drug compound safety applications early in the company's product development cycle. Several published studies have used FCDI products to investigate mechanisms of toxicity and have leveraged cellular models to identify toxicity earlier in the drug development process. Unexpected toxicity is one of the leading reasons that drugs are pulled from the market or from late stage clinical trials and toxicity issues greatly increase the cost of drug development. =Drug discovery= FCDI cells enable new strategies for disease modeling and drug discovery work. Because FCDI's MyCell Products are created using custom iPS cell reprogramming and differentiation processes, they provide biologically relevant human cells from donors with specific disease-associated genotypes and phenotypes. The company's iCell and MyCell cells are readily adapted to screening platforms and demonstrate functionality using widely accepted readout technologies. FCDI's products are used in high throughput screens, and have been used as supporting data in Investigational New Drug (IND) submissions to the FDA. =Regenerative medicine= Reprogramming technology enables new ways to study disease mechanisms and modeling. Researchers can reprogram diseased cells of interest to study how a particular disease affects those cell types and to discover methods of repairing the cells. FCDI's iCell and MyCell products are being used to research the development of regenerative medicine approaches, including: regenerative medicine compound screening, allogeneic and autologous cell therapy, tissue engineering, and transplantation. Specifically in the area of tissue engineering, FCDI's iCell and MyCell products are being employed across a variety of technologies, such as implantable devices, de-cellularized organ reconstitution and 3D bioprinting. =Stem cell banking= FCDI is actively engaged in a number of large-scale iPS cell reprogramming and banking projects, with the goal of creating broadly available resources of iPS cells that represent normal human diversity, disease states and adverse drug reactions. In 2013, CIRM awarded FCDI a grant to derive 3 iPS cell lines from each of 3,000 donors that represent a multitude of disease states. This project follows a $6.3 million grant awarded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to FCDI and the Medical College of Wisconsin to investigate the mechanisms underlying left ventricular hypertrophy. FCDI's role in this project is to generate iPS cell lines and cardiomyocytes from 250 donors selected from the Hypertension Genetic Epidemiology Network (HyperGEN) GWAS study. Product areas =Cardiac= The company's first product, iCell Cardiomyocytes, have been used extensively in pharmaceutical research and drug development applications. Other stem cell derived Cardiomyocytes are available commercially from GE Healthcare, Cellectis, Reprocell and others. iCell Cardiomyocytes have been found to display electrical properties similar to those of human cardiomyocytes. iCell Cardiomyocytes have also been used for drug safety testing, toxicology testing, drug screening and Investigational New Drug (IND) filings. iCell Cardiac Progenitor Cells (CPCs) are part of the FCDI Cardiac portfolio; these cells launched in 2014 for use in heart failure research. =Neural= iCell Neurons have been used across several different research areas, including Parkinson's disease, toxicity, autism, Alzheimer's disease, and virology FCDI expanded their neural product portfolio by launching iCell Astrocytes and iCell Dopaminergic Neurons. Other manufacturers of stem cell derived neurons include ArunA Biomedical and ReproCell. =Hepatic= iCell Hepatocytes are used in a variety of ways, including prediction of hepatotoxicity in drug development applications. Adverse and unexpected hepatic side effects are one of the most common reasons for drugs to be removed from the market after launch or in late phase clinical trials iCell Hepatocytes are used as a tool for better predicting hepatic toxicity earlier in the drug discovery process. Other companies that provide hepatocytes include Cellectis and Life Technologies. =Vascular and blood= At least 5 of the top 10 Leading Causes of Death in the United States have a vascular component related to their disease. Endothelial cells (cells that line the interior of blood vessels and allow nutrients to pass back and forth to the body's organs and tissues) play an important role in the study of vascular contributions of many leading causes of death. iCell Endothelial cells were launched as a tool to model vascular biology. Other types of endothelial cells are available from ATCC and Life Technologies. iCell Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells are multipotent progenitor blood cells that can give rise to many different types of blood cells that can then be used for a variety of research purposes, including cell therapy, autoimmune disease, and cancer research. =Donor cells= FCDI offers a family of products called MyCell Products that involve custom reprogramming, genetic engineering and differentiation of a customer's own cell samples. The technology driving MyCell Products enables customers to study their disease of interest or correct a genetic disease phenotype using genome editing technology. Studies have shown that disease cell reprogramming can result in cells that display the particular disease morphology, providing an opportunity to study the disease as never before.

He is most known as an author of gay literature; in 2010 he was reported by Czech Television to be the highest-selling gay author in the country. Career Georgiev received two nominations for the Book of the Year 2007 from a professional poll conducted by Czech newspaper Lidov√© noviny, for his book B√°sn√≠k Tr√Ωze≈à Kat (Poet Torment Executioner), a collection of verses from 1997 to 2007. One of the nominations from the poll was from Eva Kant≈Ørkov√°, the president of the Academy of Czech Literature, who praised \\"the defiant nature of the text, which resists not only the popular but also the literary mood of our day and age content with banality\\". The other nomination was from Polish journalist Mariusz Szczygie≈Ç, who compared the \\"metaphysics and spirituality\\" of the book to Ladislav Kl√≠ma. Literary theoretician Alexej Mikul√°≈°ek described the book as \\"one of best to come out of Czech literature this past year\\". Georgiev then released three books of prose, known as the \\"gay trilogy\\": Planeta sam√Ωch chlapc≈Ø (Christ Is Dancing) (2008), Bulv√°r slunce (Boulevard of the Sun) (2009) and Zabij mƒõ, Eliso (Kill Me, Elisa) (2009). The books are characterized by their openness towards homosexuality. A review in literary journal Liter√°rn√≠ noviny described Georgiev's writing as depicting the trauma of gay society. Excerpts from Boulevard of the Sun are included in the Czech anthologies, Kniha o ƒçur√°ku (Book About a Dick) and Kniha o mrd√°n√≠ (Book About Screwing) (both published in 2009). Georgiev's next work was in the form of fictitious letters from Paul Verlaine to Arthur Rimbaud, in the book Arthure, ty dƒõvko umƒõn√≠ (Arthur, You Whore of Art) (2010). Director Agnieszka Holland wrote the foreword to the book, which was described by Pr√°vo as \\"a testimony of bodily passion and literary creation\\".Pr√°vo, 12 May 2010 This was followed by a dark and controversial novel about evil in the name of love, T≈ôepetav√Ω zvuk ptaƒç√≠ch k≈ô√≠del (Fluttering Sounds of Birds Wings) (2011), which deals with the relationship between a soldier and a young boy. Georgiev described these two texts as \\"literary minimalism\\". Georgiev has also been published in Poland, by Krytyka Polityczna. A dissertation was written about Georgiev's work at Jagiellonian University, Krakow, in 2010. Some of Georgiev's works have also been translated into Bulgarian and Dutch. In 2013, the first translation into English was made, of Planeta sam√Ωch chlapc≈Ø (Christ Is Dancing). Georgiev has been compared to a number of other authors, including Milan Kundera and Fr√©d√©ric Beigbeder. Polish newspaper Dziennik Gazeta Prawna wrote that Christ Is Dancing is \\"as if Almod√≥var wrote We Children from Bahnhof Zoo\\". In 2012, Czech media reported that Agnieszka Holland had backed out of her original intention to christen Georgiev's social-critical prose Veƒçe≈ôe u spisovatelky (Dinner with the Authoress).

The headline reads \\"Veezhga Indhi\\" (Down with Hindi) during Anti-Hindi agitation of 1937-40 Kudi Arasu (also pronounced as Kudiyarasu; English: Republic) was a Tamil weekly magazine published by Periyar E. V. Ramasamy in Madras Presidency (present-day Tamil Nadu) in India.  History  Periyar started Kudi Arasu on 2 May 1925 in Erode with K. M. Thangaperumal pillai as the editor. Its initial publications were issued weekly on Sunday with 16 pages at a cost of one anna. In November 1925, Periyar quit the Indian National Congress after his failed attempt to bring reservation for non-Brahmins in educational institutions and government jobs. He started the Self-Respect Movement to propagate self-respect among Indians, especially Tamils. The magazine became the mouthpiece of the movement. The magazine circulated in the Tamil diaspora, for which Thamizhavel G. Sarangapani played a prominent role. It had Periyar's wife Nagammai, his sister Kannammal and his brother E. V. Krishnasamy as the publisher for a period of time when he was on tour or arrested. It ceased publication on 5 November 1949.  Publications  Periyar wrote several articles on women's rights, on atheism and against the caste system. Others like M. Singaravelu wrote many articles on socialism. In an editorial dated 29 March 1931, Periyar criticised Mahatma Gandhi for Bhagat Singh's death. He wrote, > There is no one who has not condoled the death of Mr. Bhagat Singh by > hanging. There is none who has not condemned the government for hanging him. > Besides, we now see several people known as patriots and national heroes > scolding Mr. Gandhi for the happening of this event. The Madras government of the British Raj banned the magazine at several occasions for various reasons including sedition and for propagating communism. In 1935, the Tamil version of Why I am an Atheist was banned, and translator P. Jeevanandham and publisher E.V. Krishnasamy were arrested.  In recent times  In 2010, works from between 1925 and 1938 were reproduced and published as books.

A graduate of the Moscow State Academy of Choreography in 1933, she was the principal dancer of the Bolshoi Ballet till 1959. In 1960, she became director of the Moscow Bolshoi Ballet School. For her work, Golovkina was awarded the Russian Order of Merit, People's Artist of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, and the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. She died in 2004 in Moscow. Biography Born in Moscow, Golovkina trained with Alexander Chekrygin at the Bolshoi Ballet School, joining the ballet when she was 17. There she danced the leads in the major classical works including Swan Lake, Raymonda, The Sleeping Beauty and Don Quixote. She also created roles as the Tsar-Maiden in Alexander Gorsky's The Little Humpbacked Horse and Zarema in Rostislav Zakharov's The Fountain of Bakhchisaray. In 1943, she danced Nikiya in Gorsky's La Bayad√®re and in 1947 she performed in Vasili Vainonen's Flames of Paris as Mireille de Poitiers in a work intended to show that the Russian Revolution had a more international context. Her dancing was characterized by a flamboyant virtuosity which was well suited to her patriotic roles during the Soviet era. After retiring from the stage in 1959, she became director of the ballet school from 1960 where she obtained considerable success with her students, especially Natalia Bessmertnova. Despite unpopularity resulting from her stern approach, she ran the school for 41 years, eventually becoming its rector. Following in the steps of Gorsky and adopting the method developed by Agrippina Vaganova, she contributed to important developments in the Bolshoi's style and repertoire while staging productions for her students including Copp√©lia (1977) and La Fille mal gard√©e (1979). Despite considerable financial difficulties after the end of the Soviet era, Golovinka managed to attract new students and set up a Bolshoi school in Tokyo, Japan as well as a summer school in Vail, Colorado, US. Golovkina also participated as a judge for the prestigious Prix Benois de la Danse.

In 1911, Enthoven began campaigning for the establishment of a theatrical section in one of the British museums. In 1924, the Victoria and Albert Museum accepted her private collection, at this time containing over 80,000 theatrical playbills and programmes.James Laver 'Gabrielle Enthoven and the Enthoven Theatre Collection' in Studies in English Theatre History (London: Society for Theatre Research, 1952), p. 3. The material became the founding collection of the museum's theatre and performance archives. Enthoven's unparalleled knowledge of the London stage and its history earned her the sobriquet 'the theatrical encyclopaedia'.The Lady's Realm, Vol. XXVI, pp.465‚Äì470  Early life  Gabrielle Enthoven was born at 21 New Street, Spring Gardens, Westminster, London to William Govett Romaine (1815‚Äì1893) and Frances Pheobe Romaine, n√©e Tennant (1822/3-1909). Enthoven's year of birth was incorrectly listed in the family Bible as 1870, a fact which Enthoven did not discover until her sixtieth birthday. On finding this out, Enthoven remarked: 'Such a shock darling. I was giving a lovely party and John Gielgud and everybody was coming, and suddenly I discovered that I was not sixty at all, but sixty-two. Wasn't it awful?''Gabrielle Enthoven' by Barbara Vereker in The Queen, 25 February 1942 Her father was Judge Advocate General in the Crimea and India, Legal Advisor to the Board of Admiralty, and Minister in Egypt.Dictionary of National Biography, 1885‚Äì1900, Volume 49, Romaine, William GovettThe Sphere, 30 April 1927 Much of Enthoven's childhood was spent abroad as she accompanied her father on trips to various postings in both India and the Middle East. In Egypt, Enthoven used to ride in her own carriage during state occasions and rode in the desert with Charles George Gordon On her father's retirement in 1879, the family returned to England, settling in a house named 'The Old Priory' just outside Windsor, Berkshire where Enthoven lived until her father's death in 1893. Enthoven had never been educated at school, nor had she been tutored by a governess. As a result, she was fifteen years old before she could either read or write. She could, however, as a result of her travels abroad, speak fluent Egyptian, Turkish, two Hindustani dialects, French, Italian, Spanish, and some German. There were occasions when a carriage was sent from nearby Windsor Castle to collect Enthoven and her friends to play with the young Princess Mary of Teck, later to become Queen Mary of Teck. Enthoven recalled slapping the young princess across the face on one occasion, an incident which the two women would recall in later years when the Queen visited Enthoven at the Victoria and Albert MuseumGabrielle Enthoven Biographical File, Theatre and Performance Department, Victoria and Albert Museum Enthoven was a small child when she first visited the theatre. She climbed out of her bedroom window clutching a shilling and made the journey to the Gaiety Theatre, London to see a production of The Forty Thieves. Climbing beneath the legs of the waiting crowd, Enthoven was picked up by a large navvy who placed her upon his shoulders and pushed his way through the throng of people to find them a seat on the front row of the gallery. Half-way through the performance, he took out an orange from his pocket, bit into it, pushed some sugar in the hole with his thumb, and gave it to Enthoven to suck.  Personal life  In 1893, Enthoven married Major Charles Henfrey Enthoven (1866‚Äì1910), who at various times, occupied the role of Staff Captain in the Royal Engineers, General Staff Officer at the War Office, and Chief Officer of London County Council's Parks Department. The couple had no children. Charles Enthoven died of pneumonia on 30 April 1910.The Times, 2 May 1910 Enthoven was not reported as being present at her husband's funeral.The Times, Thursday 5 May 1910 Enthoven was a recognised and well-known figure within London's theatrical society. She was an inveterate first-nighter and had friendships with many members of the theatrical elite including John Gielgud, Peggy Ashcroft, Marda Vanne, Edward Gordon Craig, Edith Craig and No√´l Coward. In 1921, Enthoven was staying in New York with Cecile Sartoris, with whom she had translated The Honeysuckle, a play by the Italian writer Gabriele D'Annunzio. The play was performed that year at the Lyceum Theatre. No√´l Coward stayed with Enthoven and Sartoris during this period. Recalling his stay with the two women, he wrote: ‚Äòthey said that when I sold a play, or made some money somehow, I could pay rent, but until then I was to be their guest [‚Ä¶] I accepted and moved in immediately, grateful not only for their kindness, but for their company.'No√´l Coward, Autobiography: Consisting of Present Indicative, Future Indefinite and the Uncompleted Past Conditional (London: Methuen, 1986), p. 92. During Enthoven's stay in New York, in a flat on Washington Square South, she spent time with many influential people within artistic and theatrical society. The American poet and playwright Mercedes de Acosta wrote about Enthoven's stay in New York in her 1960s memoir Here Lies the Heart. She described Enthoven as being 'a woman of rare culture, of heart, and remarkable intelligence. A woman, too, of great humour. There were few like her.'Mercedes de Acosta, Here Lies the Heart (New York: Reynal & Company, 1960), p.123 Enthoven knew Oscar Wilde very well and would visit him at his home as a young girl. After these visits she would return home and copy down the stories he had told her. In 1948, Enthoven presented the British Library with a pamphlet containing four prose poems of Wilde's that she had had printed and bound under the title Echoes.Rupert Hart-Davis (ed.), The Letters of Oscar Wilde (New York: Harcourt, Brace & World, 1962), p. 809n In 1889, Wilde dedicated a poem to Enthoven entitled Remorse. (a study in saffron).Bobby Fong, 'Oscar Wilde: Five Fugitive Pieces‚Äô in English Literature in Translation, 1880-1920, Vol. 22, No. 1 (1 January 1979), pp. 7-16, pp. 13-14. It is possible that Enthoven engaged in lesbian relationships after the death of her husband. She was a central member of London's lesbian haut monde. This group included women such as the writer Radclyffe Hall, best known for writing the banned lesbian classic The Well of Loneliness, the sculptor Una Troubridge, the painter Romaine Brooks, and the tennis player and fencer Toupie Lowther. The group referred to themselves as 'The Circle' and would regularly meet to have dinner parties at their homes in the exclusive London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, visit the theatre, or dance at clubs in Soho such as the 'Cave of Harmony' and 'The Orange Tree'.Sally Cline, Radclyffe Hall: A Woman Called John (London: Faber and Faber Ltd., 2010), p. 122 The women lived a privileged lifestyle of grand houses, villas in the sun, inherited incomes, successful careers, and stylish lovers.Diana Souhami, The Trials of Radclyffe Hall (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1998), p. 167 In the 1930s, however, Enthoven was dropped by her friends Radclyffe Hall and Una Troubridge, with Troubridge accusing Enthoven of 'repudiating her own kind when opportune to do so' and adding 'she's a rat and we have no use for her'.Diana Souhami, The Trials of Radclyffe Hall (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1998), p. 242 Enthoven had played the leading role in a production of Colette's novel Ch√©ri which had been adapted by Troubridge. The play was an unequivocal failure, and this may have contributed to the demise of the women's friendship. In 1923, Enthoven was instrumental in bringing the Italian actress Eleonora Duse over to England for her farewell engagement.'Obituary: Mrs Gabrielle Enthoven' in The Times, Saturday 19 August 1950  Theatrical Activities  Enthoven was a keen playwright and had her first play, Montmartre, produced at the Alhambra Theatre, London in 1912 as part of a revue called Kill That Fly! The Observer gave a favourable review of the sketch, writing: ‚Äòthe little wordless thrill, \\"Montmartre\\", by Gabrielle Enthoven, is the most thrilling thing of its kind we have seen'.The Observer, 19 January 1913 She was the president and founding member, alongside her close friends Edith Craig and Christopher St. John, of the Pioneer Players, a London-based theatre society founded in 1911. The company was formed from members of the Actresses' Franchise League. The Pioneer Players engaged heavily with socio-political issues of the era. The society 'acknowledged an interest in women's suffrage and in any other current movement of interest'.Katharine Cockin, Women and Theatre in the Age of Suffrage: The Pioneer Players, 1911‚Äì1925 (Hampshire: Palgrave, 2001), p. 7 In 1916, the company produced the play Ellen Young, written by Enthoven and Edmund Goulding. It was performed at the Savoy Theatre on 2 April 1916. In 1921, Enthoven and Cecile Sartoris's translation of Gabriele D'Annunzio's The Honeysuckle played at the Lyceum Theatre (Broadway) in New York, as well as at 'Playroom 6' in Soho, London on 9 May. 1927.Play Pictorial, 10 May 1927 In 1930, The Confederates, a play written by Enthoven in collaboration with H. M. Harwood was produced at the Ambassadors Theatre.'Mrs. Enthoven, 82, British Dramatist', The New York Times, 19 August 1950 Enthoven was an enthusiastic amateur actress and appeared with the 'Windsor Strollers', the 'Old Stagers' and other prominent amateur companies. The Belgian playwright Maurice Maeterlinck asked Enthoven to appear in Paris in a production of his play Pell√©as and M√©lisande, although she never did. Sarah Bernhardt and Mrs Patrick Campbell eventually performed together in this play after being introduced to one another by Enthoven. Enthoven was a councillor of the Stage Society and, in 1933, the vice-president of the newly formed 'Passing Theatres Association', a society with the aim to collect records and visit sites of old theatres. Shortly before her death in 1950, Enthoven became the first Chairman of the Society for Theatre ResearchJean Scott Rogers, Stage By Stage: The Making of the Theatre Museum (London: HMSO, 1985), p. xv  Theatre Collection  After her marriage in 1893, Enthoven began to regularly attend the theatre and to paste various press cuttings relating to the London theatre into scrapbooks.'Obituary: Mrs Gabrielle Enthoven', The Times, Saturday 19 August 1950 Her great interest in theatre and theatre history led Enthoven to start collecting memorabilia and ephemera related to the stage. She recalled: 'It started when, in 1900, I noticed an inaccuracy in some book of stage history. Being passionately interested in the theatre, I wrote to the author who admitted a mistake. There the matter might have stopped; but soon afterwards I happened to find some old playbills that proved my point. That was when the \\"collecting\\" flea bit me.'The Evening News, 15 September 1938 A chance purchase of two-hundred playbills became the foundation of Enthoven's vast collection, and, after her husband's death in 1910, Enthoven's collecting increased.'Obituary: Mrs. Gabrielle Enthoven', The Times Saturday 19 August 1950 In 1911, Enthoven mounted a national campaign to establish a permanent theatre collection in a British institution. Writing to The Observer she advocated for: A comprehensive theatrical section in an existing museum to comprise specimens of all the different branches necessary to the working of a play from the construction of the theatre, the designing of the scenery and costumes to the smallest workings necessary in the house. Also a library and collection of playbills, prints, pictures and relics, etc. I want the section to be the place where the producer, actor, author and critic will naturally go for information, both of what is being done in this and other countries at present and what has been done before.Jean Scott Rogers, Stage By Stage: The Making of the Theatre Museum (London: HMSO, 1985), p. xii National theatre collections had been established in America at the Harvard Library, in Rome, Milan, Stockholm and Paris, but not in England.Gabrielle Enthoven Nominal File, Theatre and Performance Department, Victoria and Albert Museum The British Museum contained a valuable collection of 600,000 playbills from across Britain and abroad. This collection was, however, considered incomplete.The Referee, 19 November 1911 Enthoven's campaign continued to gain momentum with numerous letters and comments of support appearing in the national press. Enthoven's connections with well-known and celebrated members of theatrical society contributed to the success of the campaign, with people such as Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Sir George Alexander, and Sir John Hare publicly declaring their support.The Referee, 12 November 1911 In November 1911, it was announced that the London Museum was to devote a section to a permanent exhibition of theatrical objects that would chart the developments and phases of theatre both in Britain and abroad.The Morning Advertiser, 22 November 1911 It was to be the first time that a British museum had a recognised theatrical section. The project was overseen by Guy Francis Laking, the keeper of the London Museum. Enthoven's vast collection of playbills would remain at her home, but she asked the public to lend or give any theatrical objects they possessed to the museum to ensure the exhibition's success.The Standard, 27 November 1911 The exhibition was, however, unsuccessful. A visitor to the museum wrote to the Pall Mall Gazette to declare that 'those looking for enlightenment must go away sadly baffled, and those who, having a regard for the sentiment and charm of what such a collection should be, must blush indeed as they see this scanty, mediocre, and careless assortment.'Pall Mall Gazette, 24 December 1912 A lacklustre response from the public and a lack of space at the museum were blamed for the exhibition's poor reception. Undeterred, Enthoven continued to write to museums to establish a permanent theatrical section. Her first choice of a home for her collection and theatrical section was the Victoria and Albert Museum. However, she continued to face difficulties and received a letter from the museum stating that 'there is so little chance of your scheme being adopted that we should scarcely be justified in asking you to come here, as you suggest, to discuss it.'Jean Scott Rogers, Stage By Stage: The Making of the Theatre Museum (London: HMSO, 1985), p. xiii In 1922, the Victoria and Albert Museum held the International Theatre Exhibition: Designs and Models for the Modern Stage and displayed a number of items from Enthoven's enormous collection. This gave Enthoven the motivation to continue her campaign.Jean Scott Rogers, Stage By Stage: The Making of the Theatre Museum (London: HMSO, 1985), p. xiii In the 1920s, Enthoven's collection had increased to such an extent that it could no longer remain in her home. In 1924, after more than a decade of campaigning, the Victoria and Albert Museum finally agreed to house her collection, at this time containing more than 80,000 playbills, prints, books and engravings.'Obituary: Mrs. Gabrielle Enthoven', The Times, Saturday 19 August 1950 The collection was named the Gabrielle Enthoven Theatrical Collection. The playbills were housed in the Department of Engraving, Illustration and Design. In 1925, Enthoven and three members of staff arrived at the museum to begin to catalogue, index and arrange the collection. Enthoven received no payment for her work and paid the wages of her staff from her own funds.The Daily Telegraph, 21 April 1927 An appeal for financial aid to contribute to the cataloguing of the collection was launched in the national press, with theatrical personalities such as Sybil Thorndike supporting the campaign.The Times, 16 December 1926 After the Second World War, the government provided Enthoven with two paid assistants, though she herself never received a salary.Jean Scott Rogers, Stage By Stage: The Making of the Theatre Museum (London: HMSO, 1985), p. xv Enthoven had substantial offers from American institutions to purchase her collection. She was once offered ¬£9,000 by an American collector but refusedDaily Mail, 22 April 1927 and upon her death it became known that she had once turned down an American offer of ¬£30,000. The collection was to remain in England. Enthoven continued to add to the collection up until her death. At the age of 81, the 'Grand Old Lady of London theatre first-nighters' still arrived at the Victoria and Albert Museum at 10 o'clock every morning to sort and index her playbills.The Evening News, 1 April 1949  First and Second World War  During the First World War Enthoven was one of the first eleven people to join the War Refugee Committee and became the head of the Correspondence and Indexing Department. In 1915 she began to work for the Red Cross in dealing with missing soldiers and prisoners of war and, in 1916, she eventually became head of the Records Department of the Central Prisoners of War and Missing Persons Committee dealing with the welfare of British prisoners of war in Germany, Russia and Turkey. This work ceased in 1920 owing to Enthoven's ill health. In 1921, Enthoven visited New York as a Red Cross representative to raise funds to build schools for children in devastated areas of France. Enthoven was awarded an OBE in recognition of this work. Radclyffe Hall was said to be 'frankly envious' about Enthoven's activities during the war and the subsequent recognition of her endeavours. Hall had attended Red Cross lectures, learnt first-aid, and transported library books to casualty wards but felt this was not as heroic as the work undertaken by Enthoven.Sally Cline, Radclyffe Hall: A Woman Called John (London: Faber and Faber Ltd., 2010), p. 163 On the outbreak of the Second World War, Enthoven suspended her work at the Victoria and Albert Museum and returned to the War Office to work as the head of the Records Department of the Central Prisoners of War. Enthoven, in one of her scrapbooks at the museum, wrote: 'Work ceased here on declaration of War Sep.3 1939. I started work here alone on 13 August 1945.'  Death  Enthoven died at her home in Cadogan Gardens, London aged 82 on 18 August 1950. An obituary appeared in both The Times and The New York Times. Before her death Enthoven confirmed: 'I desire that my body shall be cremated without the celebration of any funeral service in the cheapest possible manner as my Trustees shall decide [and] that my ashes shall be scattered and I desire that none of my friends shall attend my funeral nor wear mourning for me of any kind and they shall be requested not to send any flowers'.Nominal File: Enthoven, Gabrielle (purchases made from the Enthoven Fund) Part 2, 1930-1950, Ref: MA/1/E732/2, Victoria and Albert Museum, Theatre and Performance Department. Enthoven bequeathed the residue of her estate to the Ministry of Education who, at the time, were responsible for the Victoria and Albert Museum's finances. The bequest states that Enthoven's money would be used to ensure that ‚Äòproper accommodation for the Gabrielle Enthoven Theatrical collection continues to be provided and for the cataloguing, maintenance arrangement, and description of the Playbills, Prints, Printed Tickets, and other material‚Äô.

Article Consisting of 50,000 Cardboard Boxes More or Less, Each Containing One Pair of Clacker Balls, 413 F. Supp. 1281 (D. Wisc. 1976), is a 1976 United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin decision regarding a requested order from the United States government to seize and destroy a shipment of approximately 50,000 sets of clacker balls under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act because children could hit themselves with the balls. The form of the styling of this case ‚Äî the defendant being an object, rather than a legal person ‚Äî is because this is a jurisdiction in rem (power over objects) case, rather than the more familiar in personam (over persons) case.  Background  In 1974 in Mequon, Wisconsin, the United States Marshals Service seized a shipment of clacker balls‚Äîtoys comprising two hard acrylic balls connected by a piece of string‚Äîfrom a dock and published a public notice of the seizure in a local newspaper. Ace Novelty Company in Seattle, Washington, declared an interest in the shipment and filed a complaint against forfeiture. The complaint was that the shipment was not a banned hazard as defined by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA).  Litigation  Clacker balls (not necessarily of the style of those in this case) The claimant initially stated that the case was titled incorrectly as the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission had not been named on the caption. The court dismissed this as without merit, pointing out that Section 9 of the FHSA stated that all proceedings regarding enforcement would be done in the name of the United States. The claimant then stated that the law had been applied unconstitutionally by breaching the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the right of \\"due powers \\". The judge stated that he was unsure of the intent of this defense as it was not initially filed in the summary judgement and thus the court was unable to make a ruling on it. The United States' counsel stated that clacker balls were hazardous under section 2 of FHSA, as clarified by regulations of the Consumer Product Safety Commission in 16 C.F.R. ¬ß 1500.18(a). The claimant argued that they were not hazardous under FHSA and that there was an exemption made for clacker balls under 16 C.F.R. ¬ß 1500.86(a)(5). The court then made the judgment that the United States had the right to seize the shipment under section 15 of FHSA as mechanical hazards and might cause a risk of injury if used by children, that 16 C.F.R. ¬ß 1500.86(a)(5) merely provided the opportunity to the claimant to prove that the toy was not hazardous (which was not done), and therefore the exemption from FHSA did not exist. The court then ruled that there was no legal issue and granted the United States the seizure and destruction order for the shipment.  Legacy  Because of the title, it has been viewed as an amusing case and has notoriety in American legal circles for suggesting that the United States sued cardboard boxes with clacker balls. It was one of three cases mentioned in the television show Last Week Tonight with John Olivers civil forfeiture episode, alongside United States v. $124,700 in U.S. Currency and United States v. Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins. It also set a precedent that clackers were classed as hazardous, and is cited in cases regarding the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. It has been opined by legal editors that this case could be used as precedent if other toys were to be classed as illegal.

Believed to be a part-Bichon Frise mixed- breed of about two or three years of age, Hank was rescued by the Brewers when he wandered into their spring training facility before the start of the 2014 MLB season. Background Hank was a stray dog when he wandered around the fields of the spring training facility of the Milwaukee Brewers, located at Maryvale Baseball Park in Phoenix, Arizona, on February 17, 2014. Hank was first spotted by security guards, and was then taken inside the facility by Brewers coach Ed Sedar. Hank weighed , had been run over by a car, and had two chipped teeth. Team officials attempted to find an owner, and when one could not be found, they rescued Hank. They took him to a veterinarian, where he was treated for a laceration. The organization named him Hank in honor of Hank Aaron. Hank competed in a Sausage Race during a spring training game wearing a hot dog costume on February 26. Reactions Hank's story went viral on social media, and was covered by many news outlets. The Brewers received over 1,000 requests to adopt Hank. Towards the end of spring training, the Brewers announced that Hank would remain with the team. He was included on a charter flight to Milwaukee in March; its arrival at Mitchell International Airport was attended by Chris Abele, the County Executive for Milwaukee County, and Tom Barrett, the Mayor of Milwaukee. Fans met Hank at Miller Park in Milwaukee. The team unveiled official Hank-themed merchandise. Over a thousand shirts, bearing the name \\"Hank\\" and the number \\"K9\\", were sold on the first day. The Brewers will donate 20% of the proceeds to the Wisconsin Humane Society at the end of the 2014 MLB season. Hank was adopted by Marti Wronski, who works as the team's vice president and general counsel, and her family, who live in Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin. Hank is believed to be between two and three years old and a bichon frise mixed-breed. The Brewers intend to have him attend many, but not all, home games.

The solution reduces to the static Whittaker metric in the limit of zero rotation.

Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher founded it in January 2014, after they left Dow Jones and the similar website they had previously co-founded, All Things Digital. Vox Media acquired Recode in May 2015, and in May 2019, Recode was integrated into Vox.  History  In September 2013, technology journalists Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher left All Things Digital, the technology news site they had founded and developed for Dow Jones and News Corp. Mossberg left The Wall Street Journal at the end of the year, leaving behind a popular, weekly technology column. The two launched their new, independent technology news website, Recode, on January 2, 2014. Its holding company, Revere Digital, received minority investments from NBCUniversal and Terry Semel's Windsor Media. The total investment was estimated between and 15 million. Mossberg and Swisher held the company's majority stake and noted its comfortable financial stance. Recode also provided breaking technology coverage for NBCUniversal, and received video resources and exposure in return via a formal partnership. Mossberg saw the investment as an opportunity to implement new ways of covering the technology field, and planned to add six employees on technology policy and mobile beats. The CNBC partnership also explored new advertising efforts and shared office space. At launch, the 23-person team included all former members of All Things Digital. The staff also received equity in the company. Mossberg and Swisher planned to continue their prominent, annual All Things Digital conference, which they renamed the \\"Code\\" conference and scheduled for the same time and location: late May at Terranea Resort in Rancho Palos Verdes, California. Recode also kept plans to continue their separate mobile and media conferences. CNBC became a partner in these conferences. A part-time team of 12 employees runs the conferences. The site developed a reputation for breaking tech industry news but ultimately did not reach the level of popularity it expected, with just 1.5 million regular monthly visitors. Vox Media acquired the website in May 2015 in a move that The New York Times described as a reflection of tumult in online technology journalism. Vox purchased all of the company's stock, but the details of the transaction were not released. At the time of the acquisition, Recode had 44 employees and three additional employees by contract. They were expected to join Vox. Mossberg and Swisher planned to stay with the website. The two were impressed with Vox Media's audience reach. Vox's technology news website, The Verge, had eight times the traffic, in comparison. The scopes of the two sites were not expected to overlap with Recode emphasis on technology industry business and The Verge on \\"being a new kind of culture publication\\". An internal study found a three percent overlap in content between the two sites. Recode started publishing podcasts in July 2015. On May 8, 2016, Recode relaunched with a new design under editor-in-chief Dan Frommer. In May 2019, Recode was integrated into Vox Media's flagship website, Vox, becoming the column Recode by Vox.  Content  As continued from All Things Digital, Recode focuses on technology and digital media news, particularly pertaining to the business of Silicon Valley. The site also reviews new enterprises, and consumer hardware and software, and conducts original reports.

He joined the LCC the following year. Stephenson became an associate of the RIBA in 1896, sponsored by Blomfield (as well as the Scottish architect, John Slater).http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=205148 retrieved 20 March 2014 (1:38), DSA Architect Biography Report (20 March 2014, 1:38 pm), also Directory of British Architects, 1834‚Äì1914: Vol. 2 (L-Z), p.695 At this time (that is, between its formation in 1893 and the First World War), the work of the 'Housing of the Working Classes' branch of the LCC's Architecture Department has been said to have \\"the right to be counted among the highest achievements of the Arts and Crafts movement in English Architecture\\".Beattie, p.9 Some propose William Riley, the chief architect of the LCC, as the original architect of the Estate, and 'Rob' Robertson (1866‚Äì1939) declared on his application to the RIBA that he had \\"taken a leading part in designing all the large housing schemes for the LCC ‚Äì for example [‚Ä¶] Caledonian Estate\\".Beattie, p.53  Style  Housing for the Working Classes-107 The Estate consists of five blocks built in a mixture of Victorian Gothic and Arts and Crafts styles. The five blocks, Carrick House, Irvine House, Burns House, Scott House and Wallace House, are named for Scottish locations and writers (including Robert Burns, Sir William Wallace and Sir Walter Scott). Two blocks, Carrick and Irvine, are parallel to the road (these blocks were originally called Bruce and Knox) and the remaining three, Scott, Burns and Wallace, are organised around a large courtyard. The entrance arch is described in Pevsner as \\"bold\\".Pevsner, London, Volume 4: North, (1998) p.698 Pevsner further describes the estate thus: \\"The access to the flats from iron balconies is typical of this phase. Serious five-story blocks in red brick and glazed terracotta, enlivened with Arts and Crafts details, e.g. the parapet curving up over the octagonal end bays and the pointed relieving arches over the windows filled with herringbone brick, as favoured at the same time by Holden at the Belgrave Hospital. Playful but vandal-proof steel gates throughout by Hutchinson and Partners.\\"Pevsner, p.698 An image of the central courtyard in 1913 The block forming the quadrangle is built on the open access balcony plan (somewhat unpopular at the time). The buildings themselves are, as Susan Beattie states, \\"the basis for a masterly exercise in Arts and Crafts design\\". She states: \\"the grid of horizontal and verticals established in the balconies and living-room bays is reinforced in the ground floor arcades and massive buttressed entrance blocks. Its severe geometry serves to heighten each contrast of solid with void and light with shade and to sharpen the effect of each modest flourish of decoration in the iron and brickwork\\" Beattie, p.77 She goes on to note that the specially designed garden gates and balcony railings \\"play an important part in creating a sense of place\\" and are \\"among the finest examples of architectural ironwork to have been produced in London at this period\\".Beattie, p.77 The buildings were granted Grade II Listed status on 30 September 1994.  * * References Category:Housing estates in the London Borough of Islington Category:Grade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Islington Category:Grade II listed residential buildings Category:Arts and Crafts architecture in England ","title":"Caledonian Estate"},{"id":"42257765","text":"Kojo Antwi, also known as \\"Mr. Music Man\\", is a Ghanaian Afro pop, highlife and reggae musical artist.

She was built in 1865 to trade between Britain and China, and competed with tea clippers before and after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. She brought together three improvements in steamship design: higher boiler pressure, an efficient and compact compound steam engine, and a hull form with modest power requirements. Before Agamemnon, steamships were not a practical commercial option for trade between Britain and the Far East. The amount of coal that they needed to carry left little space for cargo. Agamemnon could steam at , consuming only 20 tons of coal a day. This was substantially less than other ships of the time ‚Äì a saving of between 23 and 14 tons per day was achieved. This enabled her to steam to China with a coaling stop at Mauritius on the outward and return journey. Building and performance Agamemnon was the first of three sister ships, the others being Achilles (1866) and Ajax (1867). Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company of Greenock, Renfrewshire built the three ships for Alfred and Phillip Holt's Ocean Steam Ship Company, later called the Blue Funnel Line. Each was and . Overall length was and beam . Agamemnon (and her sister ships) combined three key features. The first was a higher boiler pressure than was normally used on British merchant ships. Alfred Holt had experimented with a boiler pressure of 60 psi in the Cleator, a ship he used as a floating testbed. Holt overcame the Board of Trade's objections to boiler pressures above 25 psi in seagoing vessels. The second feature was her compound steam engine, designed by Alfred Holt. As well as being more efficient than others of the time, it was a relatively compact engine, so used less cargo space. The third was a hull that was strong in relation to its weight and cost and with modest power requirements ‚Äì again developed by Alfred Holt. Agamemnons fuel efficiency enabled her to compete successfully with tea clippers between Britain and China. She could steam from London to Mauritius, a distance of 8,500 miles (roughly half the distance to China via the Cape of Good Hope) without coaling. Her normal journey time from Foochow to Liverpool was 58 days, whereas clippers could take anything from a record-breaking 88 days to 140 or more, and averaged 123 days in 1867‚Äì68. Further, her cargo carrying capacity was two or three times as much as these sailing ships. Maiden voyage The newly built Agamemnon arrived in Liverpool, her home port, from Greenock on 1 April 1866, the year of the clippers' Great Tea Race. She sailed for China on 19 April. column 4 Her outward passage was the quickest recorded to date, reaching Mauritius in 40 days and Singapore in 60. The whole journey from Liverpool to Hong Kong took 65 days. column 1 This beat the fastest tea clipper outward passage of 77 days by the Cairngorm in 1853. Later voyages The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 guaranteed the success of Agamemnon and her sister ships by shortening the route that a steamship could take from Europe to China whilst sailing vessels still had to travel via the Cape of Good Hope. In a few years the predominance of tea clippers in the China trade had ceased. Associates and competitors of Alfred Holt built similar ships and the nature of long-distance maritime trade had taken a major technological change. Fate In 1897 Agamemnon was transferred to Alfred Holt's Dutch subsidiary Nederlandsche Stoomboot Maatschappij Ocean. She was scrapped in 1899.

The language implementation is open-source, licensed under the MIT License. Hack allows programmers to use both dynamic typing and static typing. This kind of a type system is called gradual typing, which is also implemented in other programming languages such as ActionScript. Hack's type system allows types to be specified for function arguments, function return values, and class properties; however, types of local variables are always inferred and cannot be specified. History Hack was introduced on March 20, 2014. Before the announcement of the new programming language, Facebook had already implemented the code and \\"battle tested\\" it on a large portion of its web site. Features Hack is designed to interoperate seamlessly with PHP, which is a widely used open-source scripting language that has a focus on web development and can be embedded into HTML. A majority of valid PHP scripts are also valid in Hack; however, numerous less frequently used PHP features and language constructs are not supported in Hack. Hack extends the type hinting available in PHP 5 through the introduction of static typing, by adding new type hints (for example, for scalar types such as integer or string), as well as by extending the use of type hints (for example, for class properties or function return values). However, types of local variables cannot be specified. Since Hack uses a gradual typing system, in the default mode, type annotations are not mandatory even in places they cannot be inferred; the type system will assume the author is correct and admit the code. However, a \\"strict\\" mode is available which requires such annotations, and thus enforces fully sound code.  Syntax and semantics  The basic file structure of a Hack script is similar to a PHP script with a few changes. A Hack file does not include the \` opening markup tag and forbids using top-level declarations. Code must be placed in an entrypoint function. These are automatically executed if they are in the top-level file, but not if the file is included via \`include\`, \`require\`, or the autoloader. Like other functions in Hack, the function names must be unique within a project ‚Äì i.e. projects with multiple entrypoints can not call both \`main\` : <<__EntryPoint>> function main(): void { echo 'Hello, World!'; } The above script, similar to PHP, will be executed and the following output is sent to the browser: Hello, World!

Fictional history The Ace o' Clubs was a public drinking establishment located on 1938 Simon Street, Hob's Bay, better known as the Suicide Slum neighborhood of Metropolis. It was owned and operated by Bibbo Bibbowski, who purported himself to be Superman's biggest fan. Bibbo becomes a more significant part of the comic when he finds a winning lottery ticket dropped by Gangbuster and uses the money to buy the Ace o' Clubs bar and help those living in the Slum. In fact, Bibbo maintained a zero-tolerance attitude against any patron who dared to bad-mouth the Man of Steel. It was not uncommon for Bibbo to personally toss such an individual out on their ear. Like most bars and pubs, the Ace o' Clubs was no stranger to violence. To keep the peace, Bibbo always had his trusty double-barrel shotgun at the ready should things ever get too wild. The Ace o' Clubs was occasionally victimized by various citywide threats, all of which involved Superman in some way. During the \\"Battle for Metropolis\\", a group of looters began vandalizing the front window, but Bibbo drove them away.

It is situated approximately west from Sheffield City Centre. The hall is a Grade II listed building which stands within the Peak District National Park at a height of above sea level. History The exact date of construction of Sugworth Hall is unknown, English Heritage and some publications list it as 17th century but it was first mentioned in the will and testament of Robert Hawksworth who was the resident of a building on the site in the 1560s. It is likely that the hall looked completely different at that time with the core of the building being considerably reworked in the 19th century. After the death of Robert Hawksworth the hall passed to his son Henry who was known to be living there in 1585 along with his mother. The Hawksworths were still in residence in the 1630s but by the early part of the 18th century the hall had become the property of the Gould family. The hall was extended during the latter part of the 19th century.Castle, Joe. A Look At Life In Bradfield Dale And The Surrounding Area, J W Northend Ltd (2008), p. 50\\\\. . History of hall. The hall became the home of civil engineer Charles Boot (1874‚Äì1945) early in the 20th century. Boot was the son of Henry Boot and would become Chairman of Henry Boot Ltd. in 1921. Boot changed and extended the hall adding a tower and battlements designed by the architect E. Vincent Harris who was working on the construction of Sheffield City Hall at the time. During his time at the hall Charles Boot constructed Boot's Folly to the north, overlooking Strines Reservoir. In the 1930s the Boot family moved to Thornbridge Hall at Great Longstone although Charles' son Henry Matthew Boot continued to live at Bents House in the valley below Sugworth Hall until his death in 1974. During the 1980s and 1990s some of Sugworth Hall's outbuildings were converted to residential use.Redfern, Roger A. \\"Portrait Of Bradfield Dale\\", The Cottage Press (2005), p. 43\\\\. .

With a construction history dating to about 1780, and its later association with the nearby Fasnacloich estate, it has more than two centuries of ownership by just two families. The house and a small plot of land around it were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Adams Farm is located in southern Harrisville, on the southwest side of MacVeagh Road north of Howe Reservoir. The farmhouse is set high on a ridge, with commanding views of Mount Monadnock to the south. It is a three-story wood-frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, with a projecting polygonal bay to the left of the centered entrance. Attached to the west side of this structure is an older 1¬Ω-story frame structure, which has two gabled dormers in its gabled roof. Its western end is attached to a small barn. The basic styling of the exterior is Greek Revival, although the window bay and main entrance are later Victorian modifications, and the window shutters, which exhibit a pine tree cutout pattern, are a 20th-century Colonial Revival addition. The oldest portion of the house is the ell, at least part of which dates to c. 1780 and was built by Moses Adams, Jr. The property remained in the Adams family until about 1910, when it was purchased by Charles MacVeagh, who owned the nearby Fasnacloich estate, one of Harrisville's finest early 20th-century summer estates. MacVeagh used the Adams Farm as an extension of Fasnacloich, stabling horses there and using his farming staff to work the land.

Treinen (, born June 30, 1988) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). The Oakland Athletics selected Treinen in the seventh round of the 2011 MLB draft, and he made his MLB debut in 2014. He previously played in MLB for the Washington Nationals and Athletics. Treinen was an All-Star in 2018. Amateur career Treinen attended Osage City High School in Osage City, Kansas. He played for the school's baseball team as a freshman, but quit during his sophomore year as he developed prediabetes. He returned to the team in his junior year, with his fastball reaching . He enrolled at Baker University, where he played college baseball for the Baker Wildcats in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics in 2007. He transferred to the University of Arkansas in 2008, but did not play for their baseball team. He attempted to walk on to the Arkansas Razorbacks baseball team in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), but was denied the opportunity to try out. He began weight training. During Christmas break, Treinen participated in a baseball training camp led by Don Czyz, a retired Minor League Baseball pitcher. Czyz recommended Treinen to Ritchie Price, the head coach of the South Dakota State Jackrabbits baseball team. Treinen transferred to South Dakota State University to continue his college baseball career with the Jackrabbits. He had to sit out in 2009 due to the NCAA's rules on transfers. By the time he was able to pitch for the Jackrabbits, his fastball averaged . The Miami Marlins selected Treinen in the 23rd round of the 2010 MLB draft. Though Treinen was willing to sign, an MRI revealed shoulder inflammation, and the Marlins withdrew their offer. In 2011, his senior year, Treinen had a 7‚Äì3 win‚Äìloss record and a 3.00 earned run average (ERA). During the season, his fastball reached . Professional career =Oakland Athletics (2011‚Äì2012)= The Oakland Athletics selected Treinen in the seventh round of the 2011 MLB draft. He signed with Oakland, receiving a $52,000 signing bonus. Pitching for the Stockton Ports of the Class A-Advanced California League in 2012, Treinen had a season he called \\"subpar\\" and \\"mediocre\\", in which he had a 4.37 ERA in 24 games pitched, 15 of which were starts. =Washington Nationals (2012-2017)= Before the 2013 season, the Athletics traded Treinen to the Washington Nationals in a three-team deal, in which Washington also received A. J. Cole and Ian Krol, Oakland received John Jaso, and the Seattle Mariners received Michael Morse. With the Harrisburg Senators of the Class AA Eastern League, Treinen had a 3.64 ERA during the 2013 season. Major Leagues The Nationals invited Treinen to spring training in 2014, where he impressed Nationals' coaches. He began the season with the Syracuse Chiefs of the Class AAA International League, and was promoted to the major leagues on April 12. He earned his first career win on June 29, making a spot start against the Chicago Cubs and out-dueling Jeff Samardzija in a 7‚Äì2 win. During the 2014 Washington Nationals season, Treinen appeared both as a starting pitcher and out of the bullpen, with his fastball clocked as high as . Splitting the season between the Nationals and the Chiefs, Treinen had a 2.49 ERA in 15 major league games and a 3.35 ERA in 16 minor league games. For the 2015 season, Treinen started the year in the Nationals bullpen, with the off-season acquisition of Max Scherzer creating a crowded rotation picture. Manager Matt Williams, dealing with injuries to his veteran relievers, began inserting Treinen into high-leverage, late-game situations in early April, occasionally setting up for closer Drew Storen. He also reached with his sinker for the first time in his major league career during the first half of the season. Treinen remained with the Nationals for much of the year, posting a 3.86 ERA with a 2‚Äì5 record with 65 strikeouts for the season. He was optioned back to Syracuse on June 20 after struggling with command for the first half of the season. Upon being recalled the next month, Treinen told The Washington Post that being sent down \\"was probably the best thing that could have happened\\" in allowing him to work on his approach. However, even late into the season, Treinen was noted for struggling to retire left-handed batters, ultimately giving up the final run of the Nationals' season on a solo home run by left- hitting New York Mets outfielder Curtis Granderson in a 1‚Äì0 loss to the eventual World Series runners-up on October 4. In the Nationals' 2016 season, Treinen posted a 2.28 ERA on the year and narrowed his platoon splits versus left-handed hitting. He credited veteran teammate Matt Belisle and the Nationals' new pitching coach, Mike Maddux, for helping him improve his craft, while Maddux described Treinen's progress over the course of the season as \\"puppy dog to bulldog\\". Treinen led the National League in groundballs induced with 65.9% on the season and ranked highly in inherited runners stranded and soft contact created, among other metrics. Treinen was frequently used in situations in which another Nationals pitcher had allowed one or more baserunners and manager Dusty Baker was seeking a double play ball, a role in which he excelled with his high-90s sinker. He remained with the Nationals for the entire year, working exclusively out of the bullpen, and made his first playoff appearance for the team, being credited with the win in Game 2 of the Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers and taking the loss in Game 4. With the departure of Mark Melancon to free agency, the Nationals named Treinen their closer for the 2017 season. On Opening Day, Treinen pitched a perfect inning in the top of the ninth against the Miami Marlins with two strikeouts to end the game, earning the save, the second of his career. However, the Opening Day performance was the first and last clean inning Treinen would pitch in the entire month of April. He gave up an earned run while notching his second save of the season on April 5 against the Marlins before blowing a save against the same team the following day. After just a couple of weeks as the closer in which he posted a 7.11 ERA, Treinen was removed from the role in favor of Shawn Kelley and later Koda Glover. In June, Treinen's batting average on balls in play against him gradually regressed toward his career norms. However, with both Kelley and Glover on the disabled list, fellow setup men Enny Romero and Matt Albers unavailable, and acting manager Chris Speier in need of a reliever to close out the ninth inning of a 4‚Äì2 game against the Chicago Cubs on June 29, Treinen was called upon for his first save opportunity since being demoted from the position of closer. He proceeded to give up three earned runs for a blown save loss as the Cubs came back to win 5‚Äì4. =Second stint with Athletics (2017‚Äì2019)= On July 16, 2017, the Nationals traded Treinen back to the Athletics, along with Sheldon Neuse and Jesus Luzardo, for Sean Doolittle and Ryan Madson. At the time of the trade he was 0‚Äì2 with a 5.73 ERA and three out of five in save opportunities converted over 37 appearances. As the Athletics' closer, he converted 13 of 16 save opportunities after the trade. In early September, Treinen took three losses in a row, and was on the hook for a fourth, but the A's rallied for two runs in the bottom of the ninth to walk off the Houston Astros 9-8, and Treinen got credited with the win instead. Treinen recorded 13 saves with the A's in 2017, including his last 12 opportunities in a row after blowing three of his first four. In the first half of the 2018 season, Treinen had a 5‚Äì1 record with an 0.79 ERA and 23 saves. He was named an All-Star. He finished the season with a 9-2 record, 38 saves (3rd in the NL), and an 0.78 ERA. Treinen and the Athletics went into salary arbitration before the 2019 season, and Treinen won, earning a $6.4 million salary for the season. On June 21, 2019, Treinen was placed on the 10-day injured list with soreness in his right shoulder after an appearance against the Tampa Bay Rays in which he gave up three runs without recording an out. He was activated on July 3, after which he ceded the role of closer to Liam Hendriks. In 2019 he was 6-5 in 57 relief appearances with 16 saves and a 4.91 ERA, as he struck out 59 batters in 58.2 innings. On December 2, Treinen was non-tendered by Oakland and became a free agent. =Los Angeles Dodgers= On December 15, 2019, Treinen signed a one-year, $10 million, contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The start of the 2020 season was delayed to late July by the COVID-19 pandemic, but Treinen appeared in 27 games for the Dodgers (3rd in the NL), with a 3‚Äì3 record with one save and a 3.86 ERA. Personal life Treinen is married to Kati Treinen and owns a bulldog named Maxx. He is a devout Christian.

Characters in the anime Humans * : He's the \\"Kaze no Saga\\" or \\"Saga of Wind\\". A very absent-minded, irresponsible 11-year-old boy who loves baseball (which he's bad at) and cute girls (which upsets Meg greatly). Shu seems to be an unlikely hero but proves his worth in the later episodes. His Legendz is Shiron the Windragon. * : She's the \\"Mizu no Saga\\" or \\"Saga of Water\\". A pink- haired girl who is a friend of Shu. Her Legendz is Zuou the Bigfoot. Originally, she was comfortable with the idea of Legendz existing (normally Shiron hanging around with the kids) but as the series progresses, Meg begins to develop an intense dislike of them and fighting, because she feels that those are ruining the normal life she and her friends once had; she also admits to Legendz being physically frightening. She has a tendency to take pictures of people and things. Her most noteworthy trait is that she possesses a great deal of common sense among the three friends. As an intended running gag throughout the anime, whenever Shu does something that irritates Meg to the limit of her patience, she delivers her \\"Meg Chop\\" to Shu's head (in one case, she has used the chop on the Maze Octopus \\"Rapper King\\"). * : The \\"Saga of Earth\\". An obese boy who likes hamburgers and is a very perceptive friend of Shu and of most situations the group gets into. His Legendz is Garion the Griffin. Mac is very kind and isn't particularly upset by anything. He possesses a verbal tic that has him say \\"you know\\" at the end of nearly every sentence. * : The \\"Saga of Fire\\". A rich, but lonely boy who always carries a rose with him. His Legendz is Greedo the Blazedragon. Despite his status as a wealthy person, he is not arrogant or looks down on others as most stereotypical upper class are portrayed. He is very bitter towards his father and accuses of him of being the reason his mother left. * : A 25-year-old woman who has a life-long interest in all Legendz. She also fronts as a teacher at Shu's school. Her life is deeply entwined with Legendz more than she knows. She is particularly infatuated with Shiron, whom she flips out around every time he appears. At one point, she professes she is in love with Shiron. She spends a lot of her time researching her father's old books, where she discovers some startling and dark secrets about Legendz. Later in the anime (around episode 20) she joins forces with Ranshiin trying to stop the children (the sagas) and their legendz from being together. BB/Bouchou * : A purple-haired woman sent to retrieve the Wind Talispod from Shu. Though she works hard to steal it from him, she is not an unkind person as seen later on. She eventually comes to question the methods of DWC and quits, along with J1 and J2. Her actual name is Bunny Brookmeyer, as revealed in Episode 46. J1 and J2 * Voiced by: Eiji Takemoto (J1) and Tsuyoshi Maeda (J2) : Two agents who work under BB. They are referred to as J1 and J2 as they have the same name \\"Jack Johnson\\". President of DWC * : A small, pitiful man who \\"controls\\" DWC in place of the CEO. He is constantly bullied and intimidated by Ranshiin in just about every episode they are together, most often due to either Ranshiin being unhappy with the electric fans he uses to air himself or because of the constant failures to retrieve Shu's Talispod. * : Shu's dad who works at DWC. He gives Shu the Wind Talispod. A seemingly typical Japanese father who just wants his son to be happy. * : Shu's mother. Despite a seemingly minor role in the anime, her involvement in the story becomes deeper toward the end after getting hit by Jabberwock's dark crystal and crystalizes, much to Shu's shock and regret. However later she returns to normal after Jabberwock's defeat. Much like Shu's father, she simply wants Shu to be happy with things. * : Dino's father, who was the president of the Duck Mind Company. He and Sasuke develop the Talisdam, an upgrade of the Talispod, with three Soul Doll docking bays. Legendz * : A wind-type Legendz who can't remember his past. His attack is \\"Wing Tornado\\". The main Legendz character. He is fond of windy days and is actually quite social, despite the fact he spends a great deal of his time in his lesser form, a hamster-like animal (nicknamed \\"Nezuccho\\" or '„Å≠„Åö„Å£„Å°„Çá') that can't say anything beyond that of \\"ga ga ga.\\" During parts of episodes, Shiron's form is also mistaken for a \\"white mouse\\" or \\"white mouse with wings\\". Shuu's Legendz. * : A fire-type Legendz, he transforms into a rose which Dino takes around with him. Greedo is part of a three-Legendz team called G-W-Nicole. Despite his rebel appearance and tough personality he slowly grows to befriend Dino and is actually quite friendly. He is a stark contrast to Dino in many ways. It is eventually revealed that he had lost his previous Saga in the past because of Killbeat the Bicorn, and as such does not want to endanger the life of another soul he believes he won't be able to protect, causing him to push Dino away for a time. * : Earth-type Legendz. A member of Greedo's group, G-W-Nicole. * : Wind-type Legendz. A member of Greedo's group, G-W-Nicole. * : An earth-type Legendz. Wise and powerful, frightening when provoked, she can be set in her ways. She was sealed away inside her saga's body. Mac's Legendz. * : A water-type Legendz (though his attacks actually consist of ice and snow). He is young and na√Øve, but cares for Meg and will protect her at all costs, despite Meg's initial desire for him to stay away from her. Meg's Legendz. * : A mysterious black-winged Windragon who seems to be the one in true control of DWC (he bullies and intimidates the President of the company constantly) and has an interest in Shiron as he is very similar to him. Shiron isn't as bad-hearted or superior in every way as Ranshiin is and loses every fight with him. He is malevolent, aggressive, black-hearted, psychopathic, and spends his time harassing, teasing, and bullying the president of DWC or Shiron. He seems to be rather easily annoyed by the lack of wind where he's staying and uses electrical fans often. Ranshiin is physically and mentally an antithesis to Shiron in every way. The idea of him being such a mysterious character stems from the fact that his bio always appears as a series of question marks in the opening theme. In addition, it seems he is prone to small fits of insanity. Towards the end of the show, it is revealed that he and Shiron are actually two halves of the same Windragon. It is also shown at the end of the series that he, like Shiron, also has a lesser, hamster-like form (nicknamed \\"Waruccho\\" or '„Çè„Çã„Å£„Å°„Çá'). Minor/miscellaneous characters in the anime Goblin : Summoned by BB to attack Shu in the first episode so he will surrender the wind talispod. While at DWC, he seems to be a file clerk. Big Goblin : Formed by multiple goblins merging, Shiron's 1st opponent. Storm Worm : Shiron's 2nd opponent. Does not put up much of a fight. Giant Crab : Shiron's 3rd opponent. It only really wants to return to the sea. Dandy the Devour Crocodile : First appears in episode 4. A water-type Legendz who is hired by DWC to negotiate with Shu for his Talispod, but is reformed and does good deeds. He calls Shiron his \\"aniki\\", which means \\"older brother\\" among yakuza. Later in the series, Dandy opens up a bar for Legendz to hang out at called \\"Cafe Wani no Ana\\", meaning \\"Crocodile Cave Cafe\\". He snaps at people when he is called a crocodile. He apparently knows Salamander, as he mentions him by name in episode 4, but exactly how they met is unknown (their friendship is unusual in that they are both opposite elements). Voice Actor: Kouji Ishii Anna the Harpy : First appears in episode 5. A caring, free-spirited wind-type Legendz who disguises herself as a young girl to steal Shu's Talispod. However, she realizes that she cares for Shu. She manages to preserve her consciousness and does not participate in Legendz War, because Dandy protected her from the wind. Anna also convinces Shu to save his friends during Jabberwock's awakening and takes care of his mother while he saves his friends. Fire Giant : He belongs to Ed, the self proclaimed Fire Saga. Though he knows Ed isn't very reliable, he supports him as best he can. In later episode, Fire Giant gains his consciousness back because of Ed and escapes the fate of participating in Legendz War. Cait Sith : An intelligent cat Legendz working for DWC. However, his weakness is that he can behave very much like an ordinary cat (chasing mice, lying in sunlight, etc.) though that was due to Shu's constant attempts at proving he was literally a cat. Later episodes, he is one of the Legendz who does not participate in Legendz War (he says that this is because he is bad at fighting). He is seen helping the parents of the Sagas and the other Legendz. Hellhounds : Five dog Legendz that combine into one. They greatly endangered Meg's life. Rapper King the Maze Octopus : A water-type Legendz who has more of a desire to sing instead of fight. Despite his name, what he sings can't be considered rap. Willowisp : Fire Legendz, used as a distraction to get Shiron's attention (the target at that time wasn't Shu's talispod, instead the target is Mac). Chimera : Shape shifting Legendz, one of Shiron's first difficult opponents. This legendz can split into fiery forms of a goat, lion, eagle, and a snake. Kraken : Water Legendz, attacks Shiron when he goes off on his own. Zombie : Dark Legendz, able to reform no matter their damage. Skeleton : Sent by Ranshiin to test Shiron, he summons zombies to fight him. He is actually quite irritating and more of a nuisance than anything due to his exasperating tone of voice. He escapes the fate of participating the Legendz War as he is sleeping in the sewer, avoiding the wind. He helps the parents of the Sagas and other remaining Legendz. Golem : Earth Legendz. Assassin Bug : Wind Legendz. Gargoyle : A powerful dark Legendz summoned by Skeleton to deal with Shiron. Bicorn : A dark unicorn Legendz who goes by the name \\"Kirubito\\" (Killbeat), she delights in the suffering of others. Her strongest ability is making anyone relive their worst fear, which she particularly enjoyed subjecting Greedo to. Lesser Gargoyle : Summoned by Bicorn to cause panic amongst the people. Yeti : Ice-Type Legendz similar to Zuou who happened to interrupt a baseball game and fights Zuou. He is difficult for a few minutes but then Zuou suddenly transforms to his second form and takes Yeti down. Salamander : Appears in episode 20 disguised as a hotdog vendor at Coney Island. A fire-type Legendz summoned by BB to capture Shu's talipod, but fails. A few episodes later, he reunites with Dandy and works at his bar, \\"Cafe Wani no Ana\\". Voice Actor: Eiji Takemoto Jin : A wind- type Legendz that tries to steal Shiron's cap, summons Cloud Giant when he is outmatched.

Hydra : Water Legendz, this monster appeared in the Legendz War, he has nine heads spewing bursts of acid. Trolls : Earth Legendz. Minotaur : Earth Legendz. Rock Birds : Wind Legendz. One of them helps Halca to destroy Jabberwock's dark talispod after it is freed from the influence of the Jabberwock's dark crystal. Mr. English (Eigo A-ta) : A strange carrot- nosed character who randomly appears in the show and speaks in English. Eigo assumes the role of narrator, though it is not consistent narration. Ms. General Affairs (Soumu-san) : A polite-speaking employee of DWC who appears randomly to assist BB. Perkins : An absentminded scientist working for DWC. Richard/Robert/Steve : A strange little man, who is constantly changing his name and hunting profession. Ed : The self proclaimed Fire Saga, but he is actually a timid man with few talents. Meg's parents : Meg's mother and father, who have a small role in the anime. They are concerned for their daughter's happiness, but they know Meg makes the right choices. Mac's parents : Mac's mother and father, who have relatively minor roles in the anime despite their concern for their son. Mac's father seems to be a pottery maker. Important storyline characters in the anime Selba : Greedo's past Saga, who was killed by Greedo's archrival Killbeat, a bicorn. Tornado Elemental Legion (Blue) : Fusion of Shiron, Zuou, and Garion Volcano Elemental Legion (Red) : Fusion of Greedo, Wolfie, and Leon Spiritual Elemental Legion (Gold) : Fusion of Shiron, Garion, and Greedo CEO of DWC : As his name implies, he is the one who pulls all the strings at DWC (he wields more authority than Ranshiin). His entrance into the series is late, but his role is one of the most important. Tornado King Dragon : One of the four Dragon Kings. Governs all wind-type Legendz Storm King Dragon : One of the four Dragon Kings. Governs all water-type Legendz Volcano King Dragon : One of the four Dragon Kings. Governs all fire-type Legendz Earthquake King Dragon : One of the four Dragon Kings.

The Legendz gods : Mysterious divine Legendz that appear near the end of the series, their only interest is in speaking to Shiron. The leader of these gods (a being cloaked in bright light so you can't make out his face) tends to go off subject and the others interrupt him before he goes off on a tangent, or interrupt him if he tries to explain a relevant subject that they know will likely not be understood by the one he's speaking to. An example of this is when he tried to explain the purpose of the Legendz War to Shiron, the others interrupted and explained they've tried telling that to multiple other Legendz before, but the point always flew over their heads. Wind-Maker?/Kanerudo Windragon : An incredibly powerful Legendz of \\"legend\\" who had the power to wield all the elements. He was once the general of the army of Legendz and the heir to the throne of Tornado King Dragon. He nearly brought the world to ruin long ago and has not been heard from since, becoming no more than a legend. He is depicted in the removed and hidden final pages of the \\"Book of Legendz\\", along with many pages worth of undeciphered text. He is later revealed to be Shiron himself when he and Ranshiin combine as one. Characters in the manga : A normally aloof kid who takes Legendz seriously. His Legendz is the . He is the Wind Saga.

The oldest portion of the farm's main house is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure built in the 1770s. It is one of the least-altered examples of early Cape style architecture in Harrisville, lacking typical alterations such as the additions of dormers and changes to the window sizes, locations, and shapes. The farmstead, including outbuildings and an area of roughly distinct from the larger farm property, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Description and history The John Adams Homestead is located in a rural setting of western Harrisville, on the west side of Sunset Hill Road accessed via a drive north of Wells Lake Road. The main house is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is three bays wide, with sash windows on either side of the center entrance. The entrance is topped by a transom window. The gable ends on the sides each have two small sash windows. The house was probably built in the early 1770s, and is one of Harrisville's oldest surviving buildings. The only notable alteration is to the front door surround, made c. 1825 when an ell was also added to the house. One of the upstairs rooms also has stencilwork on its walls that may be the work of folk artist Moses Eaton, Jr., a Harrisville resident. Among the surviving outbuildings is a barn dating to the early 19th century. The property's name, Wellscroft, derives from an early 20th century summer residence that was built on the property, and torn down in the 1970s.

The statue, of Sir Rowland Hill, is now in Aston Royal Mail Delivery Office, the city's main postal depot. Victoria Square House, is an office building on the south side of Victoria Square, Birmingham, England. It was formerly Birmingham's Head Post Office, designed in the French Renaissance style by architect for the Office of Works Henry Tanner for the General Post Office. The building was constructed between 1889‚Äî1891 and operated as the city's head post office until the 1972 when administrative and sorting office facilities were moved to a new, larger building on Severn Street (since rebuilt as The Mailbox). There were plans to demolish the building in 1973; however after a seven-year campaign by The Victorian Society it was saved. In 1989 the former sorting office was demolished and in 1991 an office development was opened with the former public counter building forming its entrance lobby. The building now provides 160,000 sq ft of Grade A office space over six floors with a floor plate of 27,000 sq ft. History of the site Corbett's Temperance Hotel in 1887 The Head Post Office under construction in 1890. Before the site was cleared in 1888‚Äî9, it contained a number of smaller buildings including Corbett's Temperance Hotel, Joe Hillman's dining rooms, the Theatre Royal, Christ Church School associated with the nearby church and the 'London Hatters', a small hat shop, amongst many other small shops and Georgian terraces. These buildings were most probably the first buildings built on the site as Birmingham began to expand during the 19th century. Corbett's Temperance Hotel which stood at the corner of Hill Street and Paradise Street was opened in 1842 in a Georgian building which probably dated from 1750. The boarding house and coffee shop was opened by Joseph Corbett to provide an alternative venue for socialising and relaxation other than public houses and inns. Joseph Corbett was a local activist who worked to improve the lives of the poor of Birmingham, he often provided the hotel as a venue for charities to hold meetings and events. In July 1830 the plot was considered as the site for the new Town Hall. The E. & C. Robins valuation shows the 60 by 30 square yard Town Hall occupying the northern part of the plot defined by Hill, New and Pinfold Streets. The surveyors' valuation of the site allowed for the construction of a new road across the plot, effectively extending Swallow Street eastward. The total cost of purchasing the full site, minus potential resale values of material saved from demolition of existing buildings, was estimated to be ¬£9500. These buildings were most probably the first buildings built on the site as Birmingham began to expand during the 19th century. The site was cleared of all these buildings in 1888‚Äî9 to make way for the construction of the large post office. The Post Office opened for business on 3 August 1891. Demolition Proposal The building was given Grade II protection as a listed building on 25 September 1972. However, in 1973 a plan by the Midlands Postal Board to demolish the building and replace it with a high rise scheme by R. Seifert and Partners was granted permission. After a seven-year campaign by the Victorian Society, joined in 1976 by the Green Ban Action Committee, led by Pete Carter, the building was saved from demolition.Jon Bloomfield, \\"Pete Carter\\", The Guardian, 25 October 2011 The Victorian Society broke new ground in conservation tactics by submitting for planning permission an alternative scheme which retained the post office. The postal board adopted this scheme as a basis for the future development of the site. The future development involved the demolition of the red brick sorting office at the rear of building. The adjacent parcels office which was connected by a link bridge over Hill Street was also demolished, and was replaced in 1985 by One Victoria Square, designed by Watkins Grey Woodgate International. The preservation of the Post Office was one of the first and most important victories for architectural conservation by the Victorian Society. After the Post Office The old Post Office in 1983, after cleaning and before demolition of the rear building. Note that the central arch is not yet a doorway. One Victoria Square is visible to the right. In 1990-91 the former Royal Mail sorting office was demolished and replaced with a six-storey modern office block bounded by Pinfold Hill, Hill Street and the tracks of New Street railway station. The office block was financed by John Laing Developments and SC Properties Limited, built by John Laing Construction and designed by Seymour Harris Partnership. The listed part of the building was retained, forming the entrance lobby to the offices beyond. The new building was completed on 23 December 1991 at a cost of ¬£25 million. In 1992, TSB Bank plc made the building its national headquarters taking a lease of all six floors. The Post Office maintained a presence in the building with a branch office on the ground floor of the office block with entrances on Pinfold Street and Hill Street. TSB commissioned Antony Gormley's Iron: Man statue to stand outside the entrance of the building in 1993 during the redevelopment works to Victoria Square. TSB vacated the building in 1998 following its merger with Lloyds Bank. The building now provides 160,000 sq ft of Grade A office space over six floors. The Grade II listed building, with a new doorway cut into the central arch of its facade, forms the entrance lobby to the offices which are located in the modern extension which overlooks New Street station. The building is managed by GVA Bilfinger. F&C; Reit Asset Management put Victoria Square House up for sale for ¬£40m in October 2013. Irish investment firm Ardstone Capital bought the property for the asking price in November 2013.

The house is located at the top of a hill at the end of Aldworth Road, formerly the estate's access drive, and was one of the premiere estate houses of the early 20th century in the town. The house was originally built and located in Worcester, Massachusetts, to a design by Worcester architects, the Fuller & Delano Company. The house was inherited by Arthur E. Childs, a Worcester native from a wealthy family, in the early 20th century. Childs had the house transported in pieces to Harrisville by train on seventeen railroad cars, and then hauled to the Chesham Hill Farm, where it was reassembled and restyled into a Renaissance villa. In addition to moving the house, Childs extensively landscaped the farm property, which was at its greatest extent. The entry drive is flanked by rhododendrons Childs had imported, and built an elaborate terraced garden east of the house. Beyond the terraced garden is a reflecting pool and pergola supported by Tuscan columns. South of the pergola is a garden house with tile roof and brick flooring. A carriage house from c. 1914 (architects Kilham and Hopkins) stands to the northwest of the main house. The property has seen a variety of uses in the years since Childs built it. The property has been reduced in size, and the main house has had mainly institutional owners. It has been used as a sanatorium, served as campus for several educational institutions, including Thomas More School, a boys' boarding school, in the 1960s, Antioch University New England, and as a missionary publishing house. These uses, necessitating alterations of the main house's interior, have to some extent compromised its integrity. The Mountain Missionary Society undertook some restorative work in the 1980s.

She held the 5-year-term Ann Whitney Olin Professorship of Political Science at Barnard College from 2013 to 2018, and has now returned to chair the Barnard Political Science Department for a second time. She was the director of the Program on U.S.-Russia Relations at Columbia University‚Äôs Harriman Institute (2015‚Äì2019), and the Harriman Institute published a profile of her career. She is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the International Institute for Strategic Studies, and a frequent media commentator. Early life and education Marten was born and raised in Minnesota. She was on her high school debate and speech team, and competed in the nationals tournament. She earned her A.B. in Government at Harvard University (she graduated magna cum laude and was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society) in 1985 and her Ph.D. in political science at Stanford University in 1991. She held a post-doctoral position at Stanford's Center for International Security and Arms Control (since renamed the Center for International Security and Cooperation).  Career  Marten was an assistant professor in the Political Science Department at the Ohio State University from 1991 to 1997, where she was also affiliated with the Mershon Center. During her time there, she spent a year as a visiting scholar at the Olin Institute at Harvard University. She then moved to Barnard College, where she was tenured in 2000. She received a Hitachi International Affairs Fellowship in Japan from the Council on Foreign Relations, and was a visiting fellow at the Institute for International Policy Studies in Tokyo. Marten became a full professor at Barnard in 2005. She served as the Political Science department chair from 2006 to 2009 and was chosen for the position again in 2018. While at Barnard she has also held a variety of positions at Columbia University's Harriman Institute for Russian, Eurasian, and East European Studies. Books and major publications Kimberly Marten's research uses case studies, based mostly on primary sources and her own interviews with policy makers around the world. Her recent work analyzes Russian foreign and security policy, including a special focus on Russia's Wagner Group private military company and Russian intelligence agencies. Her 2018 article in International Politics explains President Vladimir Putin's decision to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election; another in the European Journal of International Security reexamines the causes and effects of NATO enlargement on Russia's relationship with the West, using counterfactual analysis. She wrote a 2017 Council on Foreign Relations report, Reducing Tensions between Russia and NATO, as well as articles on Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to intervene in Ukraine and his actions towards pre-war Syria and Iran. Her first book, Engaging the Enemy: Organization Theory and Soviet Military Innovation (Princeton University Press, 1993, published under her former name of Kimberly Marten Zisk), received the Marshall Shulman Prize from the Association for Slavic, Eurasian, and East European Studies. The book shows that Soviet military officers from the late 1950s onward engaged in lively debates about how to respond to changes in U.S. and NATO military doctrine in Europe, and spearheaded innovations that led to a doctrine race with the West. Her second book, Weapons, Culture, and Self-Interest: Soviet Defense Managers in the New Russia (Columbia University Press, 1997), explored why Russian defense industrial enterprises struggled so badly when faced with the end of Soviet central planning. She demonstrated that what appeared to be poor decisions in the face of Soviet cultural overhang were actually remarkably adept reactions by defense industrial managers to the incentives of the new market economy; they simply put their own individual interests above the health of their enterprises. She wrote a related article about conflicts in the formerly closed Soviet nuclear city of Arzamas-16 as it adapted to the market economy. Marten's next book, Enforcing the Peace: Learning from the Imperial Past, stepped away from Russia. It argued that UN Security Council authorized peace enforcement operations led by Western countries (in Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, and East Timor) bore a remarkable resemblance to the colonial activities of Great Britain, France, and the United States at the turn of the twentieth century. At a time when it was fashionable to say that militaries can't do peacekeeping, she demonstrated that well designed military missions could restore peace to insecure regions and even do policing well; success depended on how they were trained and how missions were prioritized. In a related article she argued that ensuring stability in the target state was necessary before political reforms could be cemented.Kimberly Marten, \\"Is Stability the Answer?\\" in Crocker, Chester A.; Hampson, Fen Osler; Aall, Pamela R. (2007). Leashing the Dogs of War: Conflict Management in a Divided World. US Institute of Peace Press. . Her most recent book, Warlords: Strong- Arm Brokers in Weak States (Cornell University Press, 2012, in the Cornell Studies on Security Affairs series), showed why and how ‚Äúwarlords‚Äù (armed local power brokers) undermine state sovereignty rather than being state- builders, and explained how states that need to cooperate with warlords (for example, on peace operations) should proceed. The book examines warlordism in the tribal areas of Pakistan, post-Soviet Georgia and Chechnya, and in Iraq during the U.S. intervention. This project led to a number of spin-off pieces. In an article in International Security she compares modern warlords in Somalia and Afghanistan to feudal lords in medieval Europe. In a later book chapter she debunks the ‚Äústationary bandit‚Äù myth, arguing that legal norms always limited and shaped European state-building in a way far different from modern warlordism.Kimberly Marten, \\"Debunking the Stationary Bandit Myth: Violence and Governance in Statebuilding History,\\" in Ruzza, Stefano; Jakobi, Anja P.; Geisler, Charles, eds. (2015-10-22). Non-State Challenges in a Re- Ordered World: The Jackals of Westphalia (1 edition ed.). London New York, NY: Routledge. . In an article in International Peacekeeping Marten details how Israeli and U.S. support for Palestinian Authority security forces has unintentionally entrenched corrupt warlordism there, and in another book chapter she describes a similar situation that limited the effectiveness of the Afghan Local Police. She has also written about warlordism and militias in Ukraine, analyzing their dangers with co-author Olga Oliker.

The only species in the genus is Copula sivickisi, a very small gelatinous, bell-shaped organism with four tentacles that is active only at night. It is unusual among box jellyfish in having a mating ritual and internal fertilisation. The specific name honours the Lithuanian zoologist Pranci≈°kus Baltrus ≈†ivickis. Description Copula sivickisi is a very small species of jellyfish, the medusa growing to about in diameter. The bell is a more \\"boxy\\" shape than that of the umbrella-like true jellyfishes. The eight gonads can be seen inside the transparent bell. In males these are orange hemispherical structures near the apex of the bell, and in females they are white-speckled, leaf-like structures. There is a central manubrium, a transparent tubular structure hanging down from the centre of the underside of the bell and there are four slender tentacles hanging from the rim, each banded with orange. In mature females, the edge of the bell is patterned with orange-brown markings. Distribution Copula sivickisi is found in shallow warm waters in the Pacific Ocean and one Indian Ocean location (the west coast of Sumatra). Its range extends from Japan and Taiwan to the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand, northern Australia, New Zealand, Micronesia and Hawaii. Behaviour Copula sivickisi is nocturnal and hides during the day. There are adhesive pads on the top of the bell and it can secure itself with these to objects. On sinking to the seabed soon after dawn it spends a few minutes selecting a good location and preferentially chooses the underside of a coral, stone or blade of seagrass. It then folds its tentacles inside the bell and flattens itself, making it very difficult for humans to observe it in its natural environment. It reactivates soon after dusk and rises in the water column before starting feeding. Most jellyfish liberate sperm and eggs into the sea and fertilisation is a chancy business, but this jellyfish has been observed to have a more elaborate mating ritual. A male will grab a female by one tentacle and start to pull her around. The pair entwine and place their manubria close together. The male then passes a red spermatophore (bundle of sperm) to one of the female's tentacles which thrusts it into her manubrium. Females have been observed mating in this way with several different males, up to eight times in a two-hour period. Eggs inside the female's bell are fertilised by the sperm, and a mucous strand of embryos is produced and released into the sea some two or three days later. Here they develop into polyps, another stage in the complex life cycle of Cnidaria. Copula sivickisi has twenty-four eyes grouped on four stalked rhopalia situated on the rim of the bell. It is attracted to light and feeds on zooplankton including phosphorescent organisms. Its typical feeding mechanism is to rise to the surface and then sink through the water with its tentacles extended to catch prey. Typical prey items are copepods, hooded shrimps, zoea larvae and the bioluminescent dinoflagellate Noctiluca, all of which are present near the water surface at night.

Established in 1921 with a $120,000 gift from benefactor and University alum Paul Goodloe McIntire, it is now used for a variety of outdoor gatherings including concerts, speakers, and other events. History Paul Goodloe McIntire contributed several sizable gifts to the University of Virginia in the early 1920s. Along with gifts to establish the McIntire School of Commerce and the McIntire Department of Music, he contributed $120,000 to fund the amphitheatre. The theatre was part of an existing plan, drafted starting in 1911 by Warren H. Manning, as part of a master plan for a new quadrangle including Common Hall (now Garrett Hall) and Minor Hall. The theatre was intended as an open air space for \\"concerts, debates, and the like\\". At the time it was built, the amphitheatre was only the seventh Greek-style outdoor theatre in the United States. The amphitheatre was designed by Fiske Kimball, who also supervised the building of Memorial Gymnasium and the campus of the Woodberry Forest School. It was first used as the site of the 1921 commencement and the celebration of the university's centennial. It was the site of commencements until the mid-1940s. The amphitheatre was less used in the mid-20th century and was threatened with demolition in the 1960s. During the 1970s, the grassy portion was converted to a parking space. This was converted back in the 1980s as the space became used again for outdoor performances, including visits from hypnotist Tom DeLuca, a 1991 concert for first-years by the Dave Matthews Band featuring Boyd Tinsley's first appearance with the group, and an album release concert for the Dave Matthews Band's Under the Table and Dreaming. In the 1990s, the visual aspect of the amphitheatre changed as the row of maples that previously served as the backdrop was blocked from view by the construction of Bryan Hall. The amphitheatre is still used for large public gatherings. In recent years, it has notably been the site of vigils for slain UVa lacrosse player Yeardley Love and for the victims of the Virginia Tech mass shooting, as well as for addresses by celebrities including UVa alum Tina Fey. =Organ= As built, the amphitheatre included an outdoor organ in a chamber to the left of the amphitheatre stage. The organ, designed by M.P. M√∂ller, was constructed explicitly for \\"open air\\" use. According to a booklet published by the builder: > One wing of the stage group was constructed to house the organ. This > concrete chamber is divided into four separate sections or sub-chambers. Two > of these house the organ proper. The openings, for tone egress, are filled > with bronze screens, back of which are the expression shutters for the > various departments, and, in addition, there have been provided rolling > steel shutters to fully protect the organ from the weather. In a third room > is located the large electric blower ... to which is directly connected the > low voltage compound electric generator which produces the current for the > organ action ... The console, or keyboard, is of movable type, permanently > mounted, together with the player's bench, on a special platform on rollers > ... When the organ is not in use, the entire console unit is housed in the > fourth chamber. The specifications of the organ were jointly designed by the builder and by Arthur Fickenscher. Reports from university faculty indicate that the organ could be heard \\"a mile away\\" and that it was designed for playing loud music, many of the traditional quieter stops not being included in its construction. The organ was still in use and playable in the early 1960s, but the organ and console had sustained damage due to mismanagement of the weather shutters. In the early 1980s the organ was removed and presumably destroyed. Physical plan and location The McIntire Amphitheatre is located to the south and west of The Lawn. It is bordered on the east by Cocke Hall, to the west by Minor Hall, to the north by Garrett Hall and the West Range and gardens, and to the south by Bryan Hall. The amphitheatre has a 60 foot stage backed by a neoclassical structure that once contained the outdoor organ and now houses offices for the UVa Facilities Management team. A semicircular grass patch, surrounded by gravel, faces the stage, and is surrounded by concrete steps offering seating for approximately 1,500 people. A sidewalk surrounds the steps, from which steps ascend to Minor Hall and Garrett Hall.

The distribution of historical returns of most asset classes and investment managers is negatively skewed and exhibits fat left tail (abnormal negative returns). Asset classes tend to have strong negative returns when stock market crises take place. For example, in October 2008 stocks, most hedge funds, real estate and corporate bonds suffered strong downward price corrections. At the same time vehicles following the Holy Grail distribution such as US dollar (as a DXY index), treasury bonds and certain hedge fund strategies that bought credit default swaps (CDS) and other derivative instruments had strong positive returns. Market forces that pushed the first category of assets down pulled the latter category up. Protection of a diversified investment portfolio from market crashes (extreme events) can be achieved by using a tail risk parity approach, allocating a piece of the portfolio to a tail risk protection strategy, or to a strategy with Holy grail distribution of returns. A financial instrument or investment strategy that follows a Holy Grail distribution is a perfect hedge to an instrument that follows the Taleb distribution. When a \\"Taleb\\" investment vehicle suffers an unusual loss, a perfect hedge exhibits a strong return compensating for that loss (both outliers must take place at the same time). Practitioners tend to distinguish between a Holy Grail distribution and investment returns that are generated from an inverted Taleb distribution, a ‚Äúminus-Taleb‚Äù distribution. The return series of the former has a positive while returns from the latter have a negative mean. For example, maintaining protection from market crashes by maintaining an exposure to an out-of-the-money put option on a market index follows a ‚Äúminus-Taleb‚Äù distribution because options premiums have to be paid to maintain the position and options tend to expire worthless in most cases. When a market sells off strongly these options pay back and generate a strong positive outlier that ‚Äúminus-Taleb‚Äù distribution features.

Edward Manson Stevenson (May 13, 1906 ‚Äì December 2, 1968) was an Academy Award-winning American costume designer. His film and television credits number well over two hundred, including Citizen Kane (1941) and It's a Wonderful Life (1946), both frequently cited as being among the greatest films of all time. In his later years, he worked for Lucille Ball as costume designer for I Love Lucy, The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour, The Lucy Show, and Here‚Äôs Lucy. A large collection of his costume sketches are housed in the Department of Special collections at Eli M. Oboler Library in Pocatello, Idaho.  Early life  Edward Manson Stevenson was born in Pocatello, Idaho on May 13, 1906 to Jennie Uhland Stevenson (n√©e Dolly) and Andrew Burtner Stevenson. Jennie, a widowed former schoolteacher, had two sons from her first marriage to Frank Uhland, Sr. who died in Denver in 1904. Andrew worked for the Oregon Shortline Railroad, a subsidiary of Union Pacific, rising from dispatch clerk to division superintendent. He served a term in 1903 as senator from Bannock County in the Idaho state legislature and was the Republican nominee in 1907 for Pocatello mayor. Andrew's political activity was often limited by the time spent fulfilling his duties with the railroad, including a great deal of travel. Andrew and Jennie married July 23, 1905 and Edward was born the following year. Stevenson was educated at St. Joseph's Catholic school and also took correspondence courses in art. He suffered from significant respiratory difficulties, and sometime in 1915, Jennie took him to California in hopes that the change in climate would provide some relief. They stayed in California into the following year and then returned to Idaho. In December 1919 when he was 13 years old, Stevenson's father died. By 1922, Stevenson and his mother had again taken up residence in California.  Apprenticeship and early career  Sources disagree regarding Stevenson's entry into the Hollywood film community, though the various stories all relate one of two distinct paths, both involving connections with people in the film industry. One version asserts that his mother, while traveling on a train between California and Idaho, met the friend of a Hollywood designer, possibly from the Robert Brunton studios. She impressed her new acquaintance so profoundly with some of Stevenson's artwork that she gained for her son a letter of introduction to the designer. Through this letter, Stevenson was able to get jobs as a sketch artist during school breaks, impressing those he worked with sufficiently that he was able to begin building his career. The other story relates that Stevenson and his mother lived next door to Lova Klenowsky, a cousin of Gloria Swanson. Klenowsky became aware of Stevenson's artistic abilities and interest in design, and she introduced him to Cl√©ment Henri Andreani, known professionally as Andr√©-ani.Chierichetti, David. \\"Edward Stevenson.\\" Film Fan Monthly, May 1969, pp. 20-23 The designer was impressed and tutored the young man in costume design for approximately two years. = Silent Film Work = In 1924, Stevenson began working as a sketch artist for Norma Talmadge‚Äôs production company, and he was also allowed to submit his own designs. One Stevenson design mentioned in numerous accounts is a silver gown worn by Barbara LaMarr in The White Moth (1924). When Andre-an√≠ was hired to replace Erte at MGM in 1925, he brought in his young prot√©g√© to sketch for him. Andre-an√≠ designed for Greta Garbo, Norma Shearer, Louise Fazenda, and Joan Crawford during that time. In May 1925 and April 1926, Stevenson executed costumes for stage productions presented at Pocatello High School, allowing him to gain experience designing for an actual production in a low-profile location. The productions were Once in a Blue Moon and Bizet‚Äôs Carmen, respectively. When Andre-ani and MGM parted ways, Stevenson found work as a sketch artist and occasional designer at Fox. In the 1927 film Seventh Heaven, Janet Gaynor wore a white lace wedding gown of Stevenson's design, the only known example of a Stevenson design from this period in his career. = Warner Brothers/First National = Stevenson's first contract as a designer was signed in 1928 with First National Pictures, Inc., then one of the largest theater chains and movie studios in the United States. Warner Brothers had recently gained controlling interest in First National and installed one of their production executives, Hal Wallis, as studio head. It was Wallis's wife, comic film actress Louise Fazenda whom Stevenson had met while at MGM, who convinced Wallis to give the aspiring designer a chance. Warner Brothers purchased First National in November of the following year, bringing in their own designer, Earl Luick. There was plenty of work for both of them, but when Stevenson's contract was up, Orry-Kelly was hired in his stead. Stevenson's name was also excluded from the credits of many of the Warner/First National films on which he had worked, so after his departure he filed suit on the company. = Independence = From August 1931 through August 1932, Stevenson worked independently, costuming five films for Columbia Pictures, as well as Hotel Continental for Tiffany Pictures. Three of the five Columbia movies were Frank Capra films and included Platinum Blonde (1931) with Jean Harlow and Loretta Young. Stevenson was also brought in to Hal Roach Studios to design clothes for Thelma Todd, whom he had likely met while designing for Broadminded (1931) at Warner Bros./First National. During this period, Stevenson established his own design salon, Blakely House, creating personal wardrobes for many of Hollywood's stars and social elite, as well as costumes for studios without their own designers.  The RKO Years  = A Second Beginning = 1935 marked Stevenson's return to employment with a major Hollywood studio, though it meant he had to return to sketching the ideas of other designers. Walter Plunkett, who later went on to design the costumes for Gone With the Wind (1939), had been creating costumes and managing wardrobe at RKO and its predecessor, FBO Pictures, since the mid-1920s. During his ten years there, RKO had sometimes assigned screen credit to designer Max Ree for work Plunkett had done. They had also brought Bernard Newman over from Bergdorf Goodman department store in New York to dress Ginger Rogers, one of their biggest stars. Plunkett and Newman did not get along. After failing to obtain a contract from RKO that guaranteed him screen credit for the films on which he worked, Plunkett decided to go elsewhere. When Plunkett departed, Newman was required to deal with the more mundane costuming chores in addition to his exclusive designing assignments and he hired Stevenson to sketch out his ideas. However, Newman soon proved unable to work as quickly as was needed and he decided to return to the retail world. On his way out, Newman convinced the RKO executives that Stevenson should be his replacement and in September 1936, Stevenson inked his first contract as an exclusive designer with RKO. = The House Designer = Stevenson toiled as the nominal head of RKO's costume and wardrobe department from late 1936 to early 1949, enduring the same difficult conditions that Plunkett had before him. Although he was considered RKO's house designer, he was frequently passed over for high- profile assignments to satisfy a star performer's reliance on or preference for a particular designer. For instance, Walter Plunkett's special relationship with Katharine Hepburn ensured his return to RKO as a guest designer for all three of her films shot in 1936. Ginger Rogers also routinely requested outside designers. Stevenson's fortune wasn't all bad. It was during this time that he forged deeply respectful relationships with budding stars Marueen O'Hara and Lucille Ball, relationships that would prove crucial to his later career. He also dressed the Metropolitan Opera's star coloratura soprano Lily Pons in the final two of her three films for RKO. Additionally, he was assigned to films destined to become classics, films such as Gunga Din (1939), Love Affair (1939), and Alfred Hitchcock's Suspicion (1941). In August 1939, RKO signed 24 year-old Orson Welles to write, direct, and star in three projects, the first films he would ever make. Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons (1942), two highly influential and respected movies in classic American cinema, were the eventual results of his efforts. Welles chose Stevenson to costume the films. Both pictures required thorough research to accurately represent the periods depicted, though Stevenson faced many difficulties in carrying out his original intentions. In Citizen Kane, he was required to hide Dorothy Comingore‚Äôs pregnancy which became increasingly difficult as the pregnancy and filming progressed. He coped by supplying her with a muff to carry and by letting out many of her waistline seams, though both of these solutions compromised the integrity of his designs. Wartime fabric shortages hampered Stevenson‚Äôs design efforts for The Magnificent Ambersons, and he was also asked to make modifications to some to make them more glamorous. = A New York Minute = By 1942, RKO was on the brink of total financial collapse. Stevenson had weathered RKO‚Äôs volatile leadership culture for six years and was hungry for something different and potentially more stable. He had learned from his predecessors that the ready-to-wear market could provide more security and money so like Plunkett and Newman before him, he left RKO to try his fortunes elsewhere, staying until his contract ended with the completion of filming on Journey Into Fear (1943) in March of 1942. Stevenson was in New York in May, 1942 to participate in Bernard Waldman‚Äôs fashion show, an event that adumbrated the first New York fashion \\"Press Week\\" a year later. That effort didn't bear the fruit Stevenson had hoped for and by January 1943, he was back at RKO. = Homecoming = Stevenson resumed his duties as head of RKO's costume and wardrobe at a time of both relative stability and dynamic creativity. These were the years of Val Lewton‚Äôs famous ‚Äúhorror‚Äù unit, Shirley Temple‚Äôs attempt to transition from child star to ing√©nue roles, heavy borrowing of star performers from other studios, and the rise of film noir. Stevenson was involved in all of this, costuming The Curse of the Cat People (1944), The Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer (1947), Government Girl (1944), and Out of the Past (1947), among others. Stevenson also costumed The Spanish Main (1945) with Maureen O‚ÄôHara, RKO's first all-Technicolor film since Becky Sharp (1935).

The university was chartered in 1819, and classes commenced in 1825. 19th century =Background= Father of the University of Virginia, Thomas Jefferson was the first and only President of the United States to found an institution of higher learning. On January 18, 1800, Thomas Jefferson, then the Vice President of the United States, alluded to plans for a new college in a letter written to British scientist Joseph Priestley: \\"We wish to establish in the upper country of Virginia, and more centrally for the State, a University on a plan so broad and liberal and modern, as to be worth patronizing with the public support, and be a temptation to the youth of other States to come and drink of the cup of knowledge and fraternize with us.\\"Noble E. Cunningham, Jr., In Pursuit of Reason: The Life of Thomas Jefferson, p. 336. John Hartwell Cocke, 1850s In 1802, while serving as President of the United States, Jefferson wrote to artist Charles Willson Peale that his concept of the new university would be \\"on the most extensive and liberal scale that our circumstances would call for and our faculties meet\\".Alf J. Mapp, Jr., Thomas Jefferson: Passionate Pilgrim, p. 19. Virginia was already home to The College of William & Mary, but Jefferson lost confidence in his alma mater, partly because of its religious stances and lack of courses in the sciences.Phillips Russell, Jefferson, Champion of the Free Mind, p. 335. Although Jefferson flourished under the tutelage of College of William & Mary professors William Small and George Wythe, his concerns with the College became great enough by 1800 that he wrote: \\"We have in that State, a college just well enough endowed to draw out the miserable existence to which a miserable constitution has doomed it.\\"Circular of Information, State Board of Education, United States Bureau of Education. Washington (State) Superintendent of Public Instruction. Published by State Board of Education, 1888. p. 48. Thus, he began planning a university more aligned with his educational ideals.John Seiler Brubacher, Willis Rudy. Higher Education in Transition: A History of American Colleges and Universities, Transaction Publishers, 1997, p. 148. =Founding= The University of Virginia stands on land purchased in 1788 by an American Revolutionary War veteran (and eventual fifth President of the United States), James Monroe. The farmland just outside Charlottesville was purchased from Monroe by the Board of Visitors as Central College in 1817; Monroe was beginning the first of two terms in the White House. Guided by Jefferson, the school laid its first building's cornerstone in late 1817, and the Commonwealth of Virginia chartered the new college on January 25, 1819. John Hartwell Cocke collaborated with James Madison, Monroe, and Joseph Carrington Cabell to fulfill Jefferson's dream to establish the university. Cocke and Jefferson were appointed to the building committee to supervise the construction. In the presence of James Madison, the Marquis de Lafayette toasted Jefferson as \\"father\\" of the University of Virginia at the school's inaugural banquet in 1824. The university's first classes met on March 7, 1825. Other universities of the day allowed only three choices of specialization: medicine, law, and religion. Under Jefferson's guidance, the University of Virginia became the first in the United States to allow specializations in such diverse fields as astronomy, architecture, botany, philosophy, and political science. Jefferson explained, \\"This institution will be based on the illimitable freedom of the human mind. For here we are not afraid to follow truth wherever it may lead, nor to tolerate any error so long as reason is left free to combat it.\\"Dumas Malone, Jefferson and His Time: The Sage of Monticello, p. 417-418. The non-denominational chapel near the Rotunda of the university was established in 1890, beyond the original scope of Jefferson's plans. Inside the UVA Chapel An even more controversial direction was taken for the new university based on a daring vision that higher education should be completely separated from religious doctrine. One of the largest construction projects in North America up to that time, the new Grounds were centered upon a library (then housed in the Rotunda) rather than a church ‚Äì further distinguishing it from peer universities of the United States, most of which were still primarily functioning as seminaries for one particular religion or another.Joseph J. Ellis, American Sphinx, p. 283. Jefferson even went so far as to ban the teaching of theology altogether. In a letter to Thomas Cooper in October 1814, Jefferson stated, \\"a professorship of theology should have no place in our institution\\" and, true to form, the university has never had a divinity school; it was established independent of any religious sect. Replacing the then-standard specialization in religion, the university undertook groundbreaking specializations in scientific subjects such as astronomy and botany. (However, today UVA does maintain a strong religious studies department. A non-denominational chapel, notably absent from Jefferson's original plans, was constructed in 1890.) =Early years= Jefferson was intimately involved in the university, hosting Sunday dinners at his Monticello home for faculty and students until his death. So taken with the import of what he viewed the university's foundations and potential to be, and counting it amongst his greatest accomplishments, Jefferson insisted his grave mention only his status as the author of the Declaration of Independence and Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, and father of the University of Virginia. Thus, he eschewed mention of his presidency and national accomplishments in favor of being remembered for the newly established university. Until the 1890s students were all male, and until 1950 all were white. In 1826, the nation's fourth president, James Madison, became Rector of the University of Virginia, at the same time America's fifth President James Monroe made his home on the Grounds (at Monroe Hill) and was a member of the Board of Visitors. Both former Presidents stayed at the university until their deaths in the 1830s. The same year, 1826, poet Edgar Allan Poe enrolled at the university, where he excelled in Latin. The Raven Society, an organization named after Poe's most famous poem, continues to maintain 13 West Range, the room Poe inhabited during the single semester he attended the University (he left because of financial difficulties). The School of Engineering and Applied Science opened in 1836, making it the first engineering school in the United States to be attached to a comprehensive university. Initially, some of the students arriving at the University matched the then-common picture of college students; wealthy, spoiled aristocrats with a sense of privilege which often led to brawling, or worse. This was a source of frustration for Jefferson, who assembled the students during the school's first year, on October 3, 1825, to criticize such behavior; but was too overcome to speak. He later spoke of this moment as \\"the most painful event\\" of his life. The irresponsible behavior of the students culminated in the shooting of Professor John A. G. Davis, Chairman of the Faculty, in 1840.\\"Bad Boys\\", Virginia, Carlos Santos =American Civil War= At the onset of the American Civil War the University of Virginia was the largest in the Southern United States and second nationwide only to Harvard University in its scope.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, University of Virginia, retrieved June 20, 2006. The University was a center of pro-slavery thought: \\"In the 1850s, many justified southern universities‚Äîand especially the University of Virginia‚Äîbecause they defended slavery as a core part of southern values.\\" When Harriet Beecher Stowe's sister Catherine came to the campus in 1855, she was burned in effigy. The university was a \\"hotbed of the Confederacy\\". Most of the students at the time supported secession, and some who opposed it believed that maintaining the Union was the best way to keep slavery intact. About 90% of the student body enrolled in Confederate military units. Unlike many other colleges in the South, the university was kept open throughout the conflict, although in 1863 and 1864 there were only about 50 students, most of them wounded Confederate soldiers. In March 1865, Union General George Armstrong Custer marched his troops into Charlottesville, bringing with them the Emancipation Proclamation and freeing all the enslaved. Faculty and community leaders convinced Custer to spare the university. Though Union troops camped on the Lawn and damaged many of the Pavilions, Custer's men left four days later without bloodshed and the university was able to return to its educational routines. 20th century The Lawn during winter, with tracks through the snow. At center is the Rotunda, which was the original library building at the head of Jefferson's Academical Village. =The university's first president= Jefferson, ever the skeptic of central authority and bureaucracy, had originally decided that the University of Virginia would have no President. Rather, this power was to be shared by a Rector and a Board of Visitors. As the 19th century waned, it became obvious this cumbersome arrangement was incapable of adequately handling the many administrative and fundraising tasks that had become necessary to support the growing University.Encyclopedia Virginia, \\"President Edwin Alderman\\": \\"By the turn of the 20th century the administrative affairs had grown to such an extent that the old form of government became too cumbersome. The appointment of Alderman brought a new era of progressivism to the university and service to Virginia.\\" Retrieved 25 January 2012. In 1904, Edwin Alderman resigned as President of Tulane University to take the same position at the University of Virginia. As the university's first president, he embarked on a number of reforms for both the university and the state of Virginia's public educational systems in general. A reform specific to the University of Virginia was one of the first school- sponsored financial aid programs in all of higher learning and, though primitive by today's standards, it included a loan provision for needy men who were unable to pay. Initially controversial and opposed by many at what had become a very traditional school, Alderman's progressive ideas stood the test of time. He remains the longest-tenured president in the university's history, having served for twenty-six years until his death in 1931. Alderman Library is named in his honor. =World War II= During World War II, Virginia was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. =William Faulkner= Pulitzer and Nobel Prize winner William Faulkner became a writer-in-residence at the university in 1957, keeping open office hours until his death in 1962. He was named a Professor of English and had the title of \\"Consultant on American Literature to the Alderman Library\\". Faulkner donated a large collection of his manuscripts, typescripts, and correspondence to the William Faulkner Foundation, which he created, and the foundation in turn donated the manuscripts to the library upon his death. These and many further Faulkner-related materials reside in the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library today.William Faulkner Collections at the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library =Desegregation and the admission of women= The University of Virginia began the process of integration even before the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision mandated school desegregation for all grade levels, when Gregory Swanson sued to gain entrance into the university's law school in 1950. Following his successful lawsuit, a handful of black graduate and professional students were admitted during the 1950s, though no black undergraduates were admitted until 1955, and UVA, like other Southern schools, continued to resist full integration until well into the 1960s. The university was \\"later than even most southern universities\\" in admittng Black students. The university first admitted a few selected women to graduate studies in the late 1890s and to certain programs such as nursing and education in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1944, Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, Virginia, became the Women's Undergraduate Arts and Sciences Division of the University of Virginia. Until that time, the University of Virginia had not admitted women as undergraduates. In 1970, the Charlottesville campus became fully co-educational, and in 1972 Mary Washington became an independent state university.University of Mary Washington: History and Development of the University. Women were officially allowed to matriculate at UVA in 1970 after a court suit forced the Board of Visitors to adopt full coeducation over a two-year period. In 1970, the first class of 450 undergraduate women entered UVA (39 percent), while the number of men admitted remained constant. By 2003 women comprised 55 percent of the undergraduate student body. =Creation of the first and only branch campus= The University of Virginia established its first and only branch campus, at Wise, Virginia, in 1954. The UVA Wise campus currently enrolls 2,000 students. As a public, four-year residential college located in the mountains of southwestern Virginia, The University of Virginia's College at Wise is recognized as one of the top public liberal arts colleges in the nation. UVa‚ÄìWise is home to Virginia's only undergraduate degree program in software engineering. UVa‚ÄìWise offers 30 majors, 32 minors, seven pre-professional programs, and 24 teaching licensures. For several consecutive years, students at UVa‚ÄìWise have graduated with the lowest debt load of any public liberal arts college in the nation, according to U.S. News & World Report. 21st century =Decline in state support= In 2004, as the result of a stark decrease in state support, the University of Virginia became the first public university in the United States to receive more funding from private sources than from the state with which it is associated. Thanks to a Charter initiative that passed the Virginia General Assembly and was signed into law by then-Governor Mark Warner in 2005, the university ‚Äî and any other public universities in the state that choose to do so (currently Virginia Tech and William & Mary) ‚Äì will have greater autonomy over its own affairs. The university was subject to an audit by the state, which found that while the school met most of the goals established by the deal, the number of minority students enrolled in the university declined. President James Madison served as the second Rector of the University of Virginia until his death in 1836. Also in 2004, at the 100th anniversary of Alderman becoming President, UVA announced the AccessUVa financial aid program. This program guarantees the university will meet 100% of a U.S. student's demonstrated need. It also provides low-income students (up to 200% of the poverty line ‚Äì as of 2009, about $44,000 for a family of four) with full grants to cover all of their educational needs, and it caps the level of need-based loans for all other students. This program was the first to guarantee full grants to students of low-income families at any public university in the United States. Today, minority students are particularly successful at the University of Virginia. According to the Fall 2005 issue of Journal of Blacks in Higher Education,Comparing Black Enrollments at the Public Ivies. The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education. 2005 UVA \\"has the highest black student graduation rate of the Public Ivies at 86 percent\\". The journal goes on to state that \\"by far the most impressive is the University of Virginia with its high black student graduation rate and its small racial difference in graduation rates\\". The University of Virginia, together with Harvard University and Princeton University, ended its Early Decision and Early Action programs in September 2006, stating that such policies limit poor and middle-class students from competing on an equal footing with wealthier applicants. Alt URL For its part, UVA noted that of 947 Early Decision acceptances for the Class of 2010, fewer than 20 of those students had applied for financial aid. Non-binding early action was instated for the first time for the class of 2016 as \\"early action did not have the same impact on students of lower socioeconomic means because it is not binding\\". =Removal and reinstatement of President Sullivan= In 2010 the university welcomed Teresa A. Sullivan as the university's first woman President.de Vise, Daniel, \\"Teresa Sullivan Is First Female President to Lead University of Virginia\\", Washington Post, January 19, 2010. Two years later, during the Spring of 2012, the first woman Rector Helen Dragas decided to remove President Sullivan. Instead of convening the Board of Visitors to discuss firing the President, Ms. Dragas secretly lobbied Board members in one-on-one phone calls, and then surprised President Sullivan in her office on June 8, 2012, with a demand for her resignation. Rector Dragas convened a three-member Executive Committee meeting to accept the forced resignation, and then required Sullivan's subordinates to report directly to the Rector's office, effectively removing President Sullivan from any remaining management role. President Sullivan in a subsequent New York Times interview said she does not know why she was removed. Professor Larry Sabato in the UVA Alumni Magazine called it \\"a midnight knifing\\", a \\"palace coup\\" to be reversed by \\"a grassroots rebellion\\". The resignation elicited strong protests, including a faculty Senate vote of no confidence in the Board of Visitors and Rector Dragas, and demands from the student government for an explanation for Sullivan's ouster. In the face of mounting pressure, including alumni threats to cease contributions, and a mandate from Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell to resolve the issue or he would remove the entire Board, the Board unanimously voted to reinstate Sullivan as president. In December 2012 the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools put UVA \\"on warning\\" that it risked losing its accreditation because President Sullivan's removal violated their standards for board governance and faculty role in decisionmaking. After the Board of Visitors changed its operating procedures so a minority of members could no longer control the board, the threat to U Va's accreditation was lifted. Visitors and gatherings at the university On June 10, 1940, United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt came to the university's Memorial Gymnasium to watch his son Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr. graduate, and to give the commencement address. Instead, \\"in this university founded by the first great American teacher of democracy\\" he made his impromptu \\"Stab in the Back\\"Roosevelt, Franklin D. \\"Stab in the Back\\". Scripps Library and Multimedia Archive. June 10, 1940. speech denouncing the act of Italy joining beside Nazi Germany to invade Italy and France on that day. (Graduation ceremonies are traditionally held on the Lawn, but rain had forced a move to \\"Mem Gym\\" for the Class of 1940.) In the early 1960s, civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr., James Farmer, Aaron Henry, Bayard Rustin, and others spoke at the university under the sponsorship of the Virginia Council on Human Relations, a student organization which presented speakers on Grounds who opposed the state's prevailing policy of racial segregation. John Lewis, Chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee spoke in 1965 while his head was still bandaged from a police beating he received leading the first march from Selma to Montgomery. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s speech at Old Cabell Hall in 1963 met with no resistance of any kind among the student body or administration. He called for a doubling of black registrations at universities in the South. African-American enrollment has since been increased tenfold at the university. Five years later in 1968, when King was shot, the Rotunda flag was flown at half-mast and then-President of the University Edgar Shannon, Jr., led a UVa memorial service in Cabell Hall. All classes at UVa were made optional during the service. To commemorate the United States Bicentennial in 1976, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II strolled the Lawn and lunched in the Dome Room of the Rotunda, one of five American sites she publicly visited. The Dalai Lama, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and several other Nobel Peace laureates stayed on Grounds for one week in 1998 while attending the university's historic Nobel Laureates Conference.Highbeam Research, 30 September 1998 Nobel Peace Laureates Gather at UVA Retrieved 25 January 2012 On September 27 and 28, 1988, President George H.W. Bush convened the Charlottesville Education Summit. The discussions on furthering national education goals were led by then Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, who would later be elected President in 1992 on a platform that promised economic and education reforms. The conference led to several reform proposals for the higher education system, which became the basis for Goals 2000 legislation, introduced into Congress in 1994 and signed into law by President Clinton on March 31, 1994.http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/negp/reports/negp30.pdf On August 25, 2012, the university refused an offer by President Barack Obama to hold a campaign speech on the Grounds. The reason cited was that the day the event was scheduled was the second day of classes for the 2012‚Äì13 school year, and would be too disruptive to the students and their class schedules. President Obama ended up speaking at the Downtown Mall Amphitheater located in downtown Charlottesville, well away from the university. This refusal did cause a bit of controversy and made some feel that the university was being disrespectful of the President, while others felt that the action was appropriate, and in the best interest of the students.UVA Declines Obama Campaign Request ‚Äì NBC29 WVIR Charlottesville, VA News, Sports and Weather.

(They should not be confused with the similarly named Lightning Bolt Brigade (Sawaiq Brigade) which is part of the Zintan Brigades.) Prominent al-Saiqa commander Mahmoud al-Werfalli was indicted in 2017 and 2018 by the International Criminal Court for the war crime of murdering and ordering the murders of non-combatants, remaining at large . Origins The pro-government force emerged from a militia in 2010, during the Muammar Qaddafi government. In the 1990s, al-Saiqa helped to suppress the rebellion of Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. Composition and hierarchy , al-Saiqa numbered about 5000 soldiers and reported to the Ministry of Defence. In 2013, the Al-Saiqa commander was Colonel Wanes Abu Khamadah. From 2011 to at least 2017, Mahmoud al-Werfalli was a member of al-Saiqa. Since December 2015, he held positions of command responsibility. , his title was Axes Commander and he held responsibility for at least one detention centre. In 2017 and 2018 he was indicted for the war crime of murdering and ordering the murders of non-combatants by the International Criminal Court (ICC) under Article 8(2)(c)(i) of the Rome Statute. , the ICC warrants for his arrest remained outstanding. Benghazi Clashes Al-Saiqa came to prominence after its deployment in Benghazi in summer 2013, in an attempt to control the growing disorder. As a result, it came under repeated attacks and several of its officers killed. The force is reportedly popular in Benghazi, particularly in light of its stance against the Islamist Ansar al-Sharia group and because it is seen as a symbol of the reborn Libyan armed forces. The Al-Saiqa Brigade reportedly has had frictions with the Libya Shield Force, a government-sanctioned powerful militia; despite these frictions, between November and December 2013 the Al-Saiqa Brigade fought the Ansar al-Sharia militia, suffering some losses. At the end of July 2014 the Brigade was pushed out of its main base in Benghazi's Buatni district by Islamist fighters from the Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries. A senior Saiqa official later claimed to the Libya Herald that Saiqa losses in Benghazi between the 21 and 30 July totaled some 63 dead and 200 wounded. Whilst the official was unsure of the number of Islamist dead, he claimed that it was in the dozens. By 13 August 2014 the Saiqa presence in Benghazi was almost entirely limited to Benina Airport; the base of Operation Dignity's helicopter unit. Many of the forces top commanders were in turn operating out of the Operation Dignity stronghold of Tobruk.

Career After completing his doctorate, Clark was a practising clinical psychologist and psychology lecturer at South Africa's Vista University, where he was an associate professor at the Centre for Cognitive Development. In order to join SABMiller in 1990, Clark was interviewed by Graham Mackay, who he succeeded 23 years later as CEO.

From there, he sailed to Yerba Buena (the early name of San Francisco) arriving in 1849. He made a return trip in 1850, and he is listed in the 1850 census living in Poughkeepsie on August 20. He returned again to California, arriving in Sacramento in 1851. We know he practiced his trade there, presumably relieving miners and prospectors of gold, in exchange for watches and jewelry. He is believed to have made at least two more return trips to New York before finally bringing his wife Rebecca and now, three children, to California in late 1857 or early 1858, again by ship/land/ship crossing. He chose to relocate to Marysville, setting up his shop there. The 1860 Census lists him with three children, in Marysville, Yuba County. He was still in Marysville at the time of Abraham Lincoln's assassination in April 1865. A letter to the Governor, with his signature, is in the California Archives. He was serving as the Adjutant to the Colonel in charge of the Marysville Rifles, a unit of the California Militia. The letter states the Militia's allegiance to the Union following the assassination, that they were wearing black armbands in mourning and would control and suppress any rabblerousing perpetrated by Confederate sympathizers. The 1870 Census lists him as residing in Chico. The Charles Ball House (later called the International House) was built in 1869, and is one of the oldest extant structures in the city of Chico. It is one of the Third Street Language Houses located at 536 West Third Street and used to be owned by California State University, Chico. It was moved this location in the 1920s.

She, along with Augusta D√©jerine- Klumpke, was one of the first women to intern at a hospital in Paris. Early life Edwards-Pilliet was home-schooled by her well-educated British father, Doctor George Hugh Edwards. She grew up speaking both French and English and learning mathematics, science, and the classics. After taking the baccalaur√©at-√®s-lettres in 1877 and the baccalaur√©at-√®s-sciences in 1878, she was able to enroll in the faculty of medicine in Paris at the age of 19. Career and later life In 1885, when Edwards-Pilliet applied to be a hospital intern, over 90 doctors and interns signed a petition against it because she was a woman. However, the Paris municipal council allowed her case to be heard. On July 31, French lawyer Eug√®ne Poubelle signed her case, allowing her to work in Parisian hospitals on the condition that she did not use their intern title to enter the final exams to be a doctor. She did. Edwards-Pilliet's specialty was surgery. Despite fierce competition, especially since she was a woman, her prize-winning dissertation helped her create her first consulting room in 1889, where she worked for the next 50 years. In 1892, she married, and she would go on to have three children. She also taught school medicine, despite receiving low pay. In fact, she was the only woman of her time offered a medical teaching post by the Assistance Publique (Public Hospital System). During 40 years she has been a professor at the School for the Training of Male and Female Nurses in the Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital and Bic√™tre Hospital. She died in 1941 at the age of 82.  Social Advocacy  An outspoken feminist, Edwards-Pilliet spent much of her time advocating for social reform, principally for women and children. Examples of her In 1901, Edwards-Pilliet founded The Ligue des M√®res de Famille, one of the first Nongovernmental Organizations (NGOs) from which many of France's social organizations later developed. She was also a member of the Parti radical, which advocated for women's suffrage, and in 1930, she was elected vice president of one of their Paris sections. She also became Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur (National Order of the Legion of Honour) in 1924.

Its 451 staff support 1,153 rooms, North America's first legal supervised-injection site, known as Insite, a Downtown Eastside credit union branch (Pigeon Park Savings),in partnership with Vancity CU. a food service that feeds people in Single-Room Occupancy residences (Downtown Eastside Central Kitchen) and a pest control service (Bugs Be Gone). In 1991, the Downtown Eastside Residents Association (DERA) converted a local hotel to housing for homeless people and named it after the American city of Portland, Oregon due to its reputation for aiding homeless people. A co-founder of the society was former Vancouver city councilor Jim Green. Housing As of 2019, PHS operates over 24 supportive housing facilities across Vancouver and Victoria for community members who have experience with mental illnesses, challenges with substance use, a history of homelessness, past experience with the criminal justice system and other encounters with oppressive or structural violence. The program is funded by the BC Housing Management Commission (a provincial Crown corporation) and the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority. Approximately 40 percent of residents remain in PHS housing for about 10 years, while the balance of residents stay 4 to 6 years. This contrasts dramatically with the prior history of residents, who typically registered 6 to 8 addresses ‚Äì or none at all ‚Äì in the year before moving to the Portland Hotel. It currently operates several buildings owned by BC Housing, including the Washington Hotel, the Rainier Hotel, the Roosevelt Hotel, the Beacon Hotel and the Sunrise Hotel. Insite In September 2003, the PHS forced Vancouver Coastal Health to found Insite by constructing and opening the site illegally. Insite became North America's first supervised injection site. The Government was forced through the pressure of public opinion to issue a special exemption to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. On August 13, 2007, the Portland Hotel Society and two citizens filed suit in the BC Supreme Court to keep the centre open, arguing that its closure by the federal government would be a violation of the Charter right of Insite users to \\"security of the person\\". On September 29, 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled unanimously in Canada (AG) v PHS Community Services Society that the federal government's failure to renew Insite's exemption under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act was > arbitrary, undermining the very purposes of the CDSA, which include public > health and safety. It is also grossly disproportionate: the potential denial > of health services and the correlative increase in the risk of death and > disease to injection drug users outweigh any benefit that might be derived > from maintaining an absolute prohibition on possession of illegal drugs on > Insite's premises. The Court ordered the federal government to grant an exemption to Insite forthwith, allowing the facility to stay open.Canada (Attorney General) v PHS Community Services Society, 2011 SCC 44, p. 150 Although the Court noted the government could later withdraw this exemption, \\"where [...] the evidence indicates that a supervised injection site will decrease the risk of death and disease, and there is little or no evidence that it will have a negative impact on public safety, the [government] should generally grant an exemption.\\"Canada (Attorney General) v PHS Community Services Society, 2011 SCC 44, p. 152 Governance According to filings with Revenue Canada, PHS revenue for 2013 exceeded $35.5 million, with 61 percent provided by the provincial government of British Columbia. For that year, management costs accounted for nine percent of expenses. In 2013, six full-time employees received compensation between $120,000 and $159,000. In early 2014, the provincial minister responsible for housing Rich Coleman disclosed that an external audit by accounting firm KPMG found concerns about administration costs.

Background Margaret was a daughter of John de Vere, 7th Earl of Oxford and his wife Maud de Badlesmere. Her date of birth is uncertain. First Marriage and family Margaret's first marriage was to Henry de Beaumont, 3rd Baron Beaumont. They had one child: * John Beaumont, 4th Baron Beaumont (1361-1396). Henry died on 25 July 1369, leaving extensive property in Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and Warwickshire.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 12, No. 321. On 26 October 1369, the escheator of Lincolnshire was ordered to deliver to Margaret the manors of Heckington and Stewton along with two messuages at Lincoln, which the King had assigned to her as her dower. The King had taken Margaret's oath that she would not remarry without his licence.Calendar of Close Rolls, Edward III, Vol. 13, 1369-1374, pages 62-3. It appears that Margaret's claims to a share of Henry's assets were not fully resolved until much later, as on 14 October 1375 her attorneys were instructed in relation to her claims for dower.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 12, No. 321, page 296.

As their son Nicholas was described as aged ‚Äú5 years and more‚Äù in 1375,Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol. 14, No. 172. his parents had presumably married at the end of 1369 or early in 1370.

Death  Margaret died in 1398. Contemporary sources differ about the precise date. One of the writs that were issued on 20 June for an Inquisition Post Mortem stated that she had died on the Tuesday after the Nativity of John the Baptist (i.e. on 25 June 1398, which is later than the date of the writ itself).Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol.17, No. 998. However, another two writs also dated 20 June give her date of death as Saturday after St Barnabas (i.e. 15 June 1398), which is clearly the more credible version.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, 1st series, Vol.17, Nos. 999 & 1000 Margaret was buried at Greyfriars, London, along with her third husband, in a raised tomb between the Common and Jesus altars.

Purpose  The bill would change the benchmark used by a current federal pilot program for treatment from \\"assisted living\\" to \\"community-integrated rehabilitation (CIR)\\" services. The change would expand the treatment options available to veterans to include neurobehavioral, residential programs, day treatment, and home-based programs. The bill would authorize the pilot program for 8 years (up from 5). Additionally, the bill would require that the program is accessible in each VA region that contains a polytrauma center.  Background  Between 2004-2014, over 280,000 American military service members (equivalent to approximately 18 percent of total military members) were diagnosed with tramautic brain injury.  Related legislation  On August 8, 2012, President Obama signed into law the Veterans' Traumatic Brain Injury Rehabilitative Services' Improvements Act of 2011. Before that date, tramautic brain injury treatment at the VA hospitals focused on physical restoration. The legislation added some expansion to the focus of care to include more comprehensive and holistic rehabilitation plans. In 2011, Senator Max Baucus introduced S. 666, the Veterans Traumatic Brain Injury Care Improvement Act of 2011, which would have directed the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to study the feasibility of creating a treatment center in the northern Rockies or the Dakotas and specifically evaluate Montana as a site for the center. At the state level, a bill was introduced in March 2014 in the Oklahoma State Senate to provide free hyperbaric oxygen treatment for veterans suffering from traumatic brain injury.

Following the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, he joined the Yugoslav Partisans and distinguished himself during the initial uprising against NDH authorities by capturing Mrkonjiƒá Grad in August 1941. Drenoviƒá subsequently led Serb-chauvinist agitation within the Partisan 3rd Krajina Detachment. After some vacillation, he eventually sided with the royalist Chetniks and became a Chetnik commander (vojvoda). In April 1942, he was defeated by the Partisans and fled to Banja Luka, where he concluded an alliance with the Usta≈°e to fight the Partisans. He continued to oppose the Partisans until his death during an Allied bombing raid on Banja Luka in May 1944. Early life Uro≈° Drenoviƒá was born in Sitnica, Ribnik near Mount Manjaƒça in 1911. He finished teachers' college in Sarajevo, and became a schoolmaster in the Banja Luka area. Prior to the outbreak of World War II, he was a reserve officer in the Royal Yugoslav Army (, VKJ). World War II =Bosanska Krajina uprising= A matter of months after the German-led invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, uprisings began to occur throughout the newly created Axis puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia (, NDH). On 4 July, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (, KPJ) decided to launch a general uprising against the occupying forces across Yugoslavia, and rebellion broke out in Bosnia on 27 July. This included local uprisings in southwest Bosnia, which spread across the NDH, but the KPJ organisation was initially swept along rather than leading the rebellion. On 29 August, Drenoviƒá distinguished himself by planning and leading the capture of Mrkonjiƒá Grad by the rebels, but when the town was recaptured by NDH forces four days later, the KPJ blamed him and his troops, citing their poor discipline and anti-Muslim chauvinism. In September, four battalions of fighters were formed in the Ribnik, Janj and Pliva region. One of these, the 3rd \\"Petar Koƒçiƒá\\" Battalion, was commanded by Drenoviƒá, who unlike the other battalion commanders in the region, did not allow the KPJ to appoint political commissars to his companies. In an area largely free of KPJ activity, but under the sway of the sectarian Serb elite of Mrkonjiƒá Grad, Drenoviƒá arrested Muslim communists in the area, even confronting senior members of the Partisan staff for Bosanska Krajina. On 26 September 1941 at the Partisan conference in Stolice in German-occupied Serbia, the leadership decided to standardise its military organisation across occupied Yugoslavia. As result, during October and November, three detachments were formed in the Bosanska Krajina from existing units such as the 3rd \\"Petar Koƒçiƒá\\" Battalion, and Drenoviƒá was appointed as deputy commander of the 3rd Krajina Detachment responsible for the territory of central Bosnia. This region had strong pro-Chetnik currents, and of the 34 companies in the detachment, only 13 had KPJ organisations, only 11 had commanders that were members of the KPJ, and only 18 had a political commissar. Many KPJ activists in the region were Muslims or Croats, not easily accepted by the mass of the rank-and-file who were Serb-chauvinist peasants. Drenoviƒá himself was the leading exponent of Chetnik ideology in Central Bosnia. He despised Muslims and Croats but, according to the historian Marko Attila Hoare, was \\"diplomatic enough to keep his feelings in check when necessary\\". In October, the Staff of the 3rd Krajina Detachment attempted to win over the Muslim village of Crljeni by gaining the agreement of the headman to contribute five armed men to the detachment. When the headman reneged on the deal, the bulk of the detachment attacked the village, but the rest of the detachment had to prevent Drenoviƒá's battalion from burning and looting it. On 26 November 1941, at a meeting of the Staff of the 3rd Krajina Detachment, Drenoviƒá advocated collaboration with the Italian occupation forces on the basis that the Italians were protecting Serbs from the Usta≈°e. This was rejected by the senior KPJ members of the staff, but they were not in a position to force him to abandon the idea. At the same meeting, Drenoviƒá refused to commit the 3rd \\"Petar Koƒçiƒá\\" Battalion to fight the Italians. Under pressure, he agreed to advise neighbouring battalions if the Italians moved through his territory. In return, the Staff of the 3rd Krajina Detachment agreed that Drenoviƒá could refer to his force as a \\"Military-Chetnik Detachment\\". On 10 December, the senior KPJ members of the 3rd Krajina Detachment concluded that 50 percent of their command staff did not support the leading role of the KPJ in the uprising. The Partisan staff for Bosanska Krajina later observed that the Staff of the 3rd Krajina Detachment had made no effort to remove Chetnik elements from its ranks or stop their Serb- chauvinist agitation. In early February 1942, Drenoviƒá took a leading role in a conference intended to bring the 7th Glamoƒç Battalion, which had declared itself as \\"Chetnik\\", back into the Partisan structure. Drenoviƒá argued for the Chetnik side, and was expelled from the meeting along with his supporters, and the battalion returned to the fold. On 6 February, a meeting of the leaders of the 1st, 2nd and 4th battalions of the 3rd Krajina Detachment met and decided to bring Drenoviƒá back into the Partisan movement by organising an attack on the Italian and Usta≈°e garrison of Mrkonjiƒá Grad. Under pressure from his own rank-and-file, Drenoviƒá formally participated in the attack, but he was able to prevent its success through allowing the Italians to move past his battalion and attack the Partisan rear. According to Partisan sources, he forewarned the Italians and Usta≈°e forces, and divulged the Partisan plan to them. =Alliance with the NDH= alt=a black and white photograph of uniformed males seated around a table, several are holding glasses In response to highly effective pro-Chetnik agitation from within, many Partisan units defected to the Chetniks. In the second half of April 1942, the Partisans responded with aggressive military action against the defectors. The unit that led this offensive was the Grmeƒç Shock Anti-Chetnik Battalion, formed earlier that month from wholly loyal and reliable troops. This offensive spelt the end of Drenoviƒá's \\"Petar Koƒçiƒá\\" Chetnik Detachment, and Drenoviƒá took refuge with the Usta≈°e in Mrkonjiƒá Grad. On 27 April, he and other defeated Chetnik commanders signed an agreement with the NDH. The agreement had eight points, requiring that hostilities between the Usta≈°e and Drenoviƒá's Chetniks come to an end, that NDH forces protect Serb villages from the Partisans and that Usta≈°e units assist the Chetniks in fighting the Partisans. The agreement also required the Usta≈°e to restore religious and civil rights to Serbs of the Krajina. In turn, Drenoviƒá issued a declaration in which he recognised the sovereignty of the NDH. The historian Enver Red≈æiƒá argues that the agreement was reached out of military and political necessity. He writes: \\"The Usta≈°e‚ÄìChetnik accords were driven neither by a confluence of Serbian and Croatian national interests nor by mutual desire for acceptance and respect, but rather because each side needed to obstruct Partisan advances. The Usta≈°e and Chetniks, two long-time foes, sought help from one another at a time when the Usta≈°e were facing national political disgrace among the Croats and the Chetniks were losing the support of the Serbs.\\" Drenoviƒá's grave at the Church Klisina in alt=a grey polished stone grave with a stone-walled church in the background The NDH authorities considered that the alliance would mean that the Chetniks could continue to subvert Partisan units. On 30 April, the NDH authorities recognised the rights of Drenoviƒá and his troops to remain armed in order to fight the Partisans. The agreement between the NDH and Drenoviƒá's Chetniks was soon made public by the entire Usta≈°e press; Serb public opinion remained divided. By May, Drenoviƒá had a force of about 350 Chetniks. At mid- month, he signed an agreement with a Croatian general staff officer in Banja Luka agreeing to cooperate with the NDH in fighting the Partisans. Drenoviƒá soon emerged as one of the most important Chetnik leaders in western Bosnia. That summer, when order had been established in significant parts of the Italian occupation zone, Drenoviƒá and other Chetnik detachment leaders and their principal political spokesmen with Italian Second Army headquarters were recognised by the Italians as auxiliaries and early in the summer Italian commander Mario Roatta allowed for the delivery of arms, munitions, and supplies to the Chetniks. Other Chetnik leaders in Bosnia who had concluded alliances with the NDH by June 1942 included Mane Rokviƒá, Branko Bogunoviƒá, Stevo Raƒëenoviƒá and Momƒçilo ƒêujiƒá. The political scientist Sabrina P. Ramet observes that this co-operation must be seen as a function of their mutual fear of the Partisans, and emphasises the uncertainty and distrust that accompanied it. By June, Drenoviƒá's Chetniks numbered about 600 men. In 1943, Drenoviƒá was awarded the Order of Karaƒëorƒëe's Star by King Peter, based on a recommendation by Chetnik leader Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá. Following the Italian capitulation, Drenoviƒá agreed to all the actions of his Chetniks being performed in close cooperation with local German units, and was informed at the end of the year that Usta≈°e units would again be stationed in Serb- inhabited areas. In October 1943, a team from the 1st Battalion of the 4th Brandenburg Division under Oberleutnant Hermann Kirchner began working alongside Drenoviƒá's Chetniks in northwest Bosnia, operating forward reconnaissance groups and developing contact with anti-communist farmers to keep an eye on Partisan troop movements. There were about 950 Chetniks serving under Drenoviƒá that year, positioned around Manjaƒça and Glamoƒç. Drenoviƒá had about 400 Chetniks under his command by the following year. His was the only Chetnik band that the Usta≈°e trusted fully during the war. According to BN Televizija, Drenoviƒá is considered a Chetnik vojvoda. =Death= On 29 May 1944, Drenoviƒá was killed in an Allied bombing raid on Banja Luka. The Ravna Gora Movement and Serbian Orthodox Church in Klisina organise a ceremony each year to commemorate Drenoviƒá's actions in 1941. In 2014, the ceremony was not attended by any officials of the Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

When he was 19 years old, Mr. Kaul started work at his father's lumber company, and in 1888 put in charge of the operation of the hardwood mill of the company. In 1889 he moved to the south to locate a yellow pine tract for operation, and he settled in Hollins, Alabama in 1890. He later moved to Birmingham, where he served as the president of Kaul Lumber Company. Kaul served as president of the Southern Pine Association and was a pioneer in the activities to assure conservation of the national timber supply. He worked with Gifford Pinchot, then United States Forester, to greatly reduce practices that wasted wood. He also belonged to the National Lumberman's Committee on Forestry and was chairman of the Southern Pine Forestry Committee. Kaul was a consistent Democrat, but he did not seek public office that would have distracted from his lumber manufacturing and sales interests.

He was the first to report, though brief manner on such findings on the site. Pacopampa was related to the Chavin culture when Tello made his theory about the origin of the Peruvian. In 1966, Pablo Macera traveled to the archaeological site and investigated. Anxious to protect it, in 1970 succeeded Dr. Emilio Choy made a donation to the University of San Marcos so that it could acquire the land so that the excavations would start.

The tomb, shaped like a boot, is very deep and had been in all that time free from looters or grave robbers. The woman, now named \\"The Lady of Pacopampa\\" measured 155 cm and when she died she must've been between 30 and 40 years of age.

He lost the final in straight sets to Robert Abdesselam. Until 1954 he played a further eight times in the singles event at Wimbledon but did not make it past the second round. He reached the third round in both the doubles (1946) and mixed doubles events (1957). Spycha≈Ça won the Welsh Championships singles title in July 1946 as well as the doubles title with compatriot Ignacy T≈Çoczy≈Ñski. The same year he also won singles titles at tournaments in Bognor and Chiswick. In April 1947 he won the singles title at the Tally Ho tournament in Birmingham and in July successfully defended his Welsh singles and doubles title. In August 1948 he won the singles titles at Cranleigh and New Malden and in September he defeated T≈Çoczy≈Ñski in the final of the South of England Championships in Eastbourne and together they won the doubles title. The titles at the Cranleigh and New Malden tournaments were successfully defended the following year. In 1949 he won the singles event at the Surrey Grass Court Championships in Surbiton, defeating Geoffrey Paish in the final. The following year, 1950, he lost this title to Narendra Nath but in 1952 regained it after a win in the final against David Samaai. In 1950 Spycha≈Ça and T≈Çoczy≈Ñski were to play the doubles final of the Midlands Counties Championships in Birmingham against Jaroslav Drobn√Ω and Bill Sidwell but rain prevented play and the prize was shared with their opponents. Spycha≈Ça was decorated by the Polish government in exile with the Gold Cross of Merit in 1966. In 1971 he received the Lawn Tennis Writers award for his services to the game. He was married to Gladys Pilkington.

It is not only related to 'Right to Vote', but simultaneously relates to participation in: decision-making process, political activism, political consciousness, etc. Women in India participate in voting, run for public offices and political parties at lower levels more than men. Political activism and voting are the strongest areas of women's political participation.PDownload Mp3olitical empowerment of women To combat gender inequality in politics, the Indian Government has instituted reservations for seats in local governments. Women turnout during India's parliamentary general elections was 65.63%, compared to 67.09% turnout for men. India ranks 20th from the bottom in terms of representation of women in Parliament. Women have held the posts of president and prime minister in India, as well as chief ministers of various states. Indian voters have elected women to numerous state legislative assemblies and national ministry for many decades.  Constitutional rights of women  The Constitution of India establishes a parliamentary system of government, and guarantees its citizens the right to be elected, freedom of speech, freedom to assemble and form associations, and vote. The Constitution of India attempts to remove gender inequalities by banning discrimination based on sex and class, prohibiting human trafficking and forced labor, and reserving elected positions for women. The Government of India directed state and local governments to promote equality by class and gender including equal pay and free legal aid, humane working conditions and maternity relief, rights to work and education, and raising the standard of living. Women were substantially involved in the Indian independence movement in the early 20th century and advocated for independence from Britain. Independence brought gender equality in the form of constitutional rights, but historically women's political participation has remained low. Female Participation = Voting = The movement for women‚Äôs suffrage began in the early 1900s in response to a national movement for suffrage, even though vast majority of neither men nor women had a right to vote the British colonial rule before 1947. After Indian independence from Britain, the Indian Constitution in 1950 officially granted women and men suffrage. Prior to universal suffrage, provincial legislatures had granted women the right to vote. Madras was the first to grant women‚Äôs suffrage in 1921, but only to those men and women who owned land property according to British administration's records.Mithra, H.N. (2009). The Govt of India ACT 1919 Rules Thereunder and Govt Reports 1920, The rights granted in response to the movement towards suffrage were limited to qualifications of literacy and property ownership, including property ownership of husbands. This excluded vast majority of Indian women and men from voting, because they were poor. This changed in 1950 when universal suffrage was granted to all adult Indian citizens. In 1950, universal suffrage granted voting rights to all women. This is enshrined in Article 326 in their constitution. India is a parliamentary system with two houses: Lok Sabha (lower house) and Rajya Sabha (upper house). Rates of participation among women in 1962 were 46.63% for Lok Sabha elections and rose to a high in 1984 of 58.60%. Male turnout during that same period was 63.31% in 1962 and 68.18% in 1984. The gap between men and women voters has narrowed over time with a difference of 16.7% in 1962 to 4.4% in 2009. Voter turnout for national elections in the past 50 years has remained stagnant with turnout ranging between 50 and 60%. State elections have seen a growing trend in women's participation, and in some cases women's turnout is exceeding male turnout. Increased turnout of women was reported for the 2012 Vidhan Sabha elections (legislative/state assemblies) with states such as Uttar Pradesh reporting 58.82% to 60.29% turnout. In the 2013 assembly elections, women‚Äôs overall turnout was reported to be 47.4%, and male turnout was 52.5%. Indian states of Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Kerala, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Daman and Diu, and Puducherry all reported higher turnouts among women than men in 2013. Increased participation is occurring in both rich and poor states in India. The sex ratio of voters has improved from 715 female voters for every 1,000 male voters in the 1960s to 883 female voters in the 2000s. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has sought to increase voter turnout by cleaning up electoral rolls and removing missing or deceased members. Voter outreach has included door-to-door voter registration, and in 2014 elections, voters will be issued a photo id with polling station information to increase voter turnout. Increased voter turnout in India is also partially due to the women voters. ECI has sought to encourage voter registration among women and participation through education and outreach on college and university campuses. Growing participation has also been attributed to increased security at polling stations. 2014 elections Women turnout during India's 2014 parliamentary general elections was 65.63%, compared to 67.09% turnout for men.State-Wise Voter Turnout in General Elections 2014 Government of India (2014) In 16 out of 28states of India, more women voted than men. A total of 260.6 million women exercised their right to vote in April‚ÄìMay 2014 elections for India's parliament. = Running for public office = India has a federal form of government, with devolved powers. The electorate votes to elect a national parliament as well as state assemblies. In 2012, India had a minimal percentage of 10.9% women elected representatives in the national parliament, which is, but relatively higher than Hungary (8.8%), Brazil (9.6%), China (9.1%), and Malaysia (9.8%). A broader measure of political participation includes number of women candidates who compete for elections and women in state assemblies. According to World Economic Forum's annual global gender gap index studies, which considers such a broader scale, India has ranked in top 20 countries worldwide for many years, with 9th best in 2013 - a score reflecting more women's participation in India's political process than Denmark, Switzerland, Germany, France and United Kingdom.The Global Gender Gap Report 2012, World Economic Forum, Switzerland, page 16The Global Gender Gap Report 2013, World Economic Forum, Switzerland, Table 3b and 5, page 13 and 19 To remedy low participation of women electors, India in 1994 established quotas (reservations) in constitutional amendments (73rd and 74th) to reserve 33% of seats in local governments for women. The Women‚Äôs Reservation Bill (108th amendment) has been introduced in the national parliament to reserve 33% of Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha seats for women. The bill has yet to be passed by Lok Sabha and signed into law. The discussion of women‚Äôs reservations began in the 1920s and continued into the 1930s until a compromise was reached with Britain to allow women in urban areas to vote. Discussion of women‚Äôs reservations were again introduced in 1974 by the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women in India, but India did not fully establish quotas in local government until 1994. Local governing bodies in India are called Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI) and one-third of seats and leadership positions must be reserved for women. States such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Kerala, Maharashtra, Orissa, Rajasthan, Tripura, and Uttarakhand have increased reservations to 50%. The national government has also proposed to raise the level of reservations in PRIs to 50%. Seats reserved for women are rotated for assurance that each seat has an equal chance of being reserved. After the establishment of women's reservations, political participation went from 4-5% to 25-40% among women, and gave millions of women the opportunity to serve as leaders in local government. Odisha, an Indian state, established reservations prior to the 73rd amendment and they had 28,069 women elected in 1992 and 28,595 women in 1997. Class differences have manifested with poorer women gaining presence in panchayats, but women of a higher class being elected as chairpersons (sarpanch). Concerns remain in reserving seats for women in elected positions. The issue of training has become an increasing concern with preparing women for the role of leadership. It was found in Tamil Nadu that women lack the education and training to understand procedures in panchayats. Family also plays a significant role in women's participation in government. Familial influence can be a barrier or a support system for female elected officials in terms of connections. Family connections can help women seek elected positions at both the national and local government level. There has been concern over the role of women as proxies for male family members, but women may still have important effects on policy decisions. The effect of reservation for women has been increased in the number of public goods, including water and roads. Drinking water and road improvements are issues that are most frequently raised by female elected officials. The most significant issues for men are roads, irrigation, education, and water. Women are also likely to bring welfare issues such as violence against women, childcare, and maternal health to consideration.  Political parties  Pratibha Patil India has a multi-party system with the 7 registered parties at the national level. The three largest parties in India are the Indian National Congress (INC), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the Communist Party of India (CPI). Political parties have increased outreach among women voters as India's party system has become more competitive. This has included the creation of women's wings in the largest parties. The BJP's wing is the BJP Mahila Morcha, the INC's wing is All India Mahila Congress, and the CPI's wing is the National Federation of Indian Women. Women's involvement in political parties is tied to the increasing demand for equal rights. The INC held power until the 1990s. As the INC moved away from welfare politics, other parties arose to challenge the INC using poverty as the center of their agenda. The INC regained power in 2004 with the help of women's participation. The INC has increased women's participation by instituting a 33% quota for women in all levels of the party. In June 2009, the INC nominated a woman to become first speaker of Lok Sabha, and also supported the election of Pratibha Patil, India's first female president. Women were involved in the early establishment of the BJP. The BJP has encouraged greater representation of women by developing women's leadership programs, financial assistance for women candidates, and implementing a 33% reservation for women in party leadership positions. BJP has received women's support by focusing on issues such as the Uniform Civil Code to extend equal rights to women and men regardless of religion. They have also spoken out against violence against Indian women. The CPI has also supported gender inequality issues including addressing issues of violence nikita ekta ullu through the National Federation of Indian Women. Women's participation in political parties remained low in the 1990s with 10-12% membership consisting of women. Indian women have also taken the initiative to form their own political parties, and in 2007, the United Women Front party was created, and has advocated for increasing the reservation of seats for women in parliament to 50%. Women only govern four of India's political parties. From 1970-1980, 4.3% of candidates and 70% of electoral races had no women candidates at all. As of 2013, it has been reported of the members of parliament 11% were women in Lok Sabha and 10.6% in Rajya Sabha.  Political activism  Women's organisations in India first began to emerge in the early 1800s, and later in the 1970s after a period of limited activity from the 1950s to 1970s. One of the earliest women's organisations, Bharat Stree Mahamandal, formed in 1910 and focused on helping women escape oppression from men. Women's associations had traditionally began with the help of men giving few women access to work and education, while limiting the expansion of traditional gender roles. In 1927, the All India Women's Conference (AIWC) was formed to advocate for women's education and was helpful in the passage of the Hindu Code of Bills between 1952 and 1960. Women were also active in the freedom movement in protesting British colonial rule over Indian holding protests and public meetings in support of independence. Women at farmers rally The new wave of feminism in the 1970s was in response to gender inequality issues and stagnant development in India. The Committee on the Status of Women in India released a report in 1974, and had a significant influence in the reemergence of activism towards gender equality. The report highlighted the significant differences between men and women in India, including the disparity in the sex ratio, mortality rates, employment, literacy, and wage discrimination. The report fueled the women's movement by signifying the ongoing discrimination towards women in India. Gender inequality has remained the focus of the women's movement with specific emphasis on issues such as the Uniform Civil Code, Women's Reservation Bill, and sexual violence against women. Women's organisations both informal and formal have developed at the rural, urban, national, and state levels in India. Women's organisations in India address a variety of issues from the environment, poverty, empowerment, and violence against women. One of the most prominent women's organisations in India is the AIWC, which was established in 1927, focusing on empowering and educating Indian women. The AIWC has over 100,000 members and 500 branches in India, and has helped with the passage of the Sarda Act, Maternity Benefit Act, and Hindu Code Bills. Indian women are significantly involved at the grass roots level of activism. The Chipko movement that arose in the 1970s is one example of success among the women's movement in India, as women protested the deforestation in Uttarakhand leading to the protection of the region. Since the Indian independence, women's organisations have focused on issues of violence towards women. Women's movements have focused on rape, female mortality rates, female foeticide, dowry deaths, sati, and domestic abuse. Tragedies such as the Mathura rape case in 1972, the dowry death of Tarvinder Kaur in 1979, the death of Roop Kanwar by practice of sati in 1987, the gang rape of Bhanwari Devi in 1992, and the New Delhi gang rape case in 2012, have kept the movement focused on women rights and given rise to many women's organisations at the local and national level.

He was born in Pavia. He is cited as a painter in Genoa in 1426. In 1433, he painted an altarpiece of the Crucifixion with the Magdalen and Saints for the Cathedral. Another Crucifixion with Saints was painted for the Ospedale di San Paolo in Savona. A Maesta was completed after his death by Giovanni Giorgio in 1451. His work shows some Flemish influences. His brother Boniforte was also a painter.Italian Paintings: A Catalogue of the Metropolitan Museum of Art by Federico Zeri and Elizabeth E. Gardner, page 1. Biography He trained in the workshops of international Gothic in Lombardy, with the first works related to the style of Giusto de 'Menabuoi or Michelino da Besozzo. His early contacts with Flemish culture helped him develop a more personal and unique style. Some have suggested a direct trip to Flanders, but his presence in Genoa, the center of Proven√ßal and Flemish painting in Italy, would be enough to explain his knowledge. Among the first works by Donato de 'Bardi that recorded the change in style there were a Madonna of Humility with Saints Philip and Agnes (1440), now at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, from 1445 to 1451 four tablets are known of a dismembered altarpiece (St. Jerome at the Brooklyn Museum in New York, St. John the Baptist in the Pinacoteca di Brera, St. Stephen and St. Ambrose in a private collection in Milan) and a Crucifixion (1448) to the civic Art Gallery of Savona. A document dated 1450 discovered by Federico Zeri in the seventies shows how his brother Boniforte ask a reduction in taxes by the Republic of Genoa because of their status as refugees, exiled from their native town for political reasons. This document also mentions Brother Donato, who exercised the art \\"only for the pleasure of the spirit\\", as a testimony to their high social status.

Indicators of senescence include a decelerated division rate and an increase likelihood of death. The fundamental cause of aging in bacteria is thought to be the accumulation of deleterious components (aging factors). Asymmetrically dividing bacteria, such as Caulobacter crescentus, show signs of replicative aging. The results for symmetrically dividing bacteria are more nuanced. For example, Escherichia coli, under certain experimental conditions, may exhibit signs of replicative aging caused by subtle asymmetries in its division.  Factors contributing to aging Aging factors can be defined as irreparable damages to cellular components which ultimately contribute to the decreased fitness of the individual harbouring them. Putative aging factors include damaged DNA strands, old cell-surface material, and mis-folded or aggregated protein. The cell poles of replicating E. coli are often used as a proxy for aging factors as each bacterium inherits an old cell-pole (mother's pole) and a newly synthesized new cell-pole. Inclusion bodies, masses of aggregated damaged or mis-folded proteins, have recently been shown to contribute to the aging of cellular organisms . Senescence in single celled organisms is thought to arise via the asymmetric partitioning of aging factors between daughter cells. It has long been argued that, on theoretical grounds, the preferential segregation of damage in unicellular organisms would contribute to the fitness of the overall population.Kirkwood, T. B. L. (1981). Repair and its evolution: survival versus reproduction. Physiological Ecology ; an Evolutionary Approach to Resource Use. The single celled eukaryotic organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, retains deleterious aging factors in the mother cell leading to rejuvenation of the daughter. Aging in Asymmetrically dividing Bacteria A well established example of bacterial aging is Caulobacter crescentus. This bacteria begins its life as a motile swarmer cell. Once it has found a suitable substrate, the swarmer cell will differentiate into a non-motile stalked cell. The stalked cell then becomes reproductively active and gives rise to new swarmer cells. The number of progeny produced per hour by individual swarmer cells was shown to decrease with age. This was the first evidence of bacterial aging. Aging in Symmetrically dividing Bacteria Organisms which replicate via symmetric division, such as E. coli, are thought to be immortal. However, by tracking the inheritance of both the new and old cell pole, evidence of aging was found in E. coli. A cell which has consecutively inherited the old cell pole has been shown to exhibit a significantly decreased growth rate. The decline in growth rate in Stewart et al. appears to be at least partially attributed to the preferential localization of inclusion bodies near the old cell wall. This localization is thought to be the passive result of the slow diffusion of the large aggregate, and the exclusion of the aggregate by the nucleoid. A similar mechanism of aging has been found to occur in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which divides via symmetrical binary fission. However, the original findings of E. coli aging have been partially refuted by more recent microfluidics-based studies, in which individual E. coli showed a constant growth rate for hundreds of consecutive cell divisions, although the death rate increased in each cell division. This discrepancy may be due to the different culturing methods used in the two studies, i.e., growth on agar pads vs. in a microfludic device.

Plot After the Wicked Witch of the West is melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy is sent back to her world, Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, decides to revive the Wicked Witch and remove her powers by storing them in a magic broom. Glinda then gives the magical broom to Dorothy's friends, Tin Woodman, Cowardly Lion, and Scarecrow, and they become the guardians of the broom. Evilene, the Wicked Witch, conspires with her Flying Monkeys to retrieve her broom. However, a friendly little monkey named Ozzy forgets to close the gate of the castle and a battle ensues between the flying monkeys and the 'Bums of Oz.' Evilene retrieves her broom and repels the Champions of Oz from the castle. She then punishes Ozzy's father, transforming him into a chicken. Angered by the witch's spell on his father, Ozzy steals the broom from Evilene and runs away from the palace. Ozzy reaches Glinda to find she has been paralyzed by accidentally drinking a magic potion created by her niece Gabby, who is unable to create an antidote without a vital ingredient based on wood. Gabby and Ozzy set off to find the Champions of Oz. They are pursued by the other Flying Monkeys. They soon find Cowardly Lion, who is out of sorts due to the witch's spell, but with some effort they guide him to the north town, where they find the Tin Woodman, who is extremely depressed by the spell. The spell-raged Lion smashes the Tin Man to bits, but calms down when Ozzy accidentally hits him with the magic broom. Ozzy, Gaby, and the Cowardly Lion take the Tin Man's parts to the Library of Oz where (due to the spell) Scarecrow is obsessively reading books in an effort to become more intelligent. He quickly repairs Tin with the help from a clue. However, the group is attacked by the Flying Monkeys, and in the chaos Ozzy cures Scarecrow of the spell's effects, but they are unable to save Gabby from being whisked away by the Flying Monkeys. The group arrives in Emerald City where the Wicked Witch gives an ultimatum to Ozzy to return the broom. The Guardians of Oz challenge the Witch but they are quickly defeated. Ozzy decides to break the broom in order to remove Evilene's powers for good, and tells the rest of the winged monkeys that they obey Evilene due to their dumb and cowardly mindset. The Monkeys rebel against Evilene who discovers there is some power left in the broom and tries to defeat Ozzy who escapes with a part of the broom. A chase through the streets of Emerald City ends with a crash in the fountain dedicated to Dorothy Gale, and the wicked witch is melted for good. As the story ends, Glinda breaks Evilene's spell on Ozzy's father and Ozzy learns how to fly on his own, being recognized as a hero by all of Oz.

McIvor, a key position player, came to Essendon from local side Don Rovers. (archived) He played two games late in the 1940 VFL season, then did not reappear in league football until 1944 due to the war. During the conflict, McIvor served in the Middle East and New Guinea. He returned to the VFL in round 17 of the 1944 season and kept his spot in the side for round 18 and both of Essendon's finals, including a preliminary final. McIvor's six other appearances for Essendon all came in 1946, a year he would finish in the Victorian Football Association (VFA), after moving to Camberwell mid-season, without a clearance. Despite limited appearances, McIvor was second in Camberwell's 1946 best and fairest award and was also runner-up in the VFL seconds best and fairest, from just four games with Essendon earlier in the year. McIvor played in Camberwell's seven-point loss to Sandringham in the 1946 VFA Grand Final. He remained with Camberwell in 1947 and was appointed club captain in the 1948 VFA season. His performances in 1948 were good enough for him to finish fifth in the J. J. Liston Trophy. In 1949 and 1950, McIvor was captain-coach of VFA club Brunswick. He won Brunswick's best and fairest award in the 1949 VFA season. Late in the 1950 season, McIvor played a part in a controversial finish against his former club Camberwell. Brunswick trailed by a point when the bell rung, but the umpire did not hear it ring and 15 seconds later McIvor kicked a goal, which gave his side a five-point win. A protest by Camberwell was successful and the VFA declared the game as having \\"no result\\". He captain-coached the Euroa Football Club in 1951 and took them to the grand final, which they lost to Mansfield.

An art critic for Art in America likened her style to that of Moholy-Nagy and James Welling. Early life and education Quinlan received her Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1996 from the School of The Museum of Fine Arts, Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts. She received her Master of Fine Arts in 2005 from Columbia University. Eileen did street photography, portrait photography, and landscape photography before getting into the photographic style she is in now. After graduating she learned that she no longer wanted to take pictures out in the world but wanted to construct photography in the studio. Still, she was unsure of what the subject would be. A lot of her early smoke studies she considered tests, but it did pave a path for her current style of photography. Work Quinlan is often regarded as one of many contemporary artists revisiting late Modernism, alongside Tomma Abts, Mark Grotjahn, Wade Guyton, Sergei Jensen, and her husband Cheyney Thompson.Roberta Smith (September 22, 2006), Art in Review; Mark Grotjahn New York Times. Also she is considered one of several contemporary photographers ‚Äî among them Michele Abeles, Liz Deschenes and Sara VanDerBeek ‚Äî who are extending the innovations of the earlier Pictures Generation into new territory.Roberta Smith (May 16, 2013), Art in Review; Michele Abeles: ‚ÄòEnglish for Secretaries‚Äô New York Times. Quinlan uses medium and large format analog cameras to create abstract photographs, and then agitates the film via steel wool or long chemical processing. Some of her photographic subjects are smoke, mirrors, mylar, colored lights, and other photographs. The result is photographic images that are reminiscent of color field painting and op art thus furthering the contemporary conversation between photography and painting. Her political leanings, boundary pushing processes and resulting images are part of why Quilan has gained notoriety in exhibitions such as \\"\\"What is a Photograph?\\"\\" curated by Carol Squiers in 2014 at the International Center for Photography in New York City, New York and \\"\\"Outside the Lines: Rites of Spring\\"\\" curated by Dean Daderko in 2014 at the Contemporary Art Museum in Houston, Texas. Eileen Quinlan spoke at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston discussing her exhibit, Momentum 13: Eileen Quinlan. Most of the time she spends doing photography is in the studio arranging objects. Eileen Quinlan was experimenting with objects coming into the picture and adding gels for color. She was rather interested in the construction of the photograph from the ground up. This led to a lot of her photographs having an abstract quality to them while also being a representational image before the lens. The printing process is very straightforward. A lot of the prints she makes are traditional analog prints and are not manipulated during the printing process. They are also not manipulated digitally after the fact. The effects, the colors, and the quality of lighting are all manipulated in the studio. She physically makes the manipulation before taking the pictures and playing around with the space of the objects she is shooting. A lot of what is seen in the prints is actually what she sees while she is shooting and putting the pictures together. For example, she took a few mirrors propped up against one another and then uses a strobe light that has a red gel on the light. The shadows moving in her images is actually a shadow from her moving the lights around the space. When she shoots she spends a lot of time arranging objects, looking back at the lens to see how the composition is coming together. Once she finds an interesting composition she is content with and wants to continue working with it she locks down the camera to not move the setup. Then she plays around with the lighting. Looking through the lens is no longer important, but rather the lighting around the space. This allows her to get an idea of where the shadows are falling. In studio lighting there's a light to see where the arrangements are but the strobe light itself fires off lighting in a different manner really quickly, so she is somewhat aware of what she will get but not entirely. This allows her to work with dramatic shadows and get a sense of light.

The campaign attempted to shed light on misconceptions about feminism and to explore the continued need and relevance of feminism in today's society. The campaign was most successful in its outreach with Tumblr, but the campaign received attention of Facebook and Twitter as well. Origin The Who Needs Feminism? campaign was conceived by sixteen Duke students as the final project for a class called \\"Women in the Public Sphere: History, Theory and Practice\\" taught by Dr. Rachel Seidman. The students wanted to address what they saw as misconceptions on Duke's campus about the feminist movement and its relevance in today's society. They also hoped to promote a dialogue on the topic within the Duke community, \\"hoping to address relevance of feminism to all different types of people,\\" according to an interview done with GOOD worldwide. According to their website, the members wanted to \\"explain what feminism is by allowing everyone to create their own definition.\\" They started by creating posters which they placed around campus, showing young men and women from a variety of backgrounds holding up whiteboards with the words \\"I need feminism because...\\", to show that there is no \\"typical feminist,\\" with the title of the campaign imposed on the poster. Subjects were chosen to demonstrate the importance of feminism to individuals from different genders, races, sexual orientations and backgrounds, reflecting the students' beliefs that \\"'typical feminists' don't exist\\" and that feminism is important for everyone, not just women. In addition to designing and hanging the posters, the students also wrote an Op-Ed piece for The Chronicle, Duke's student-run newspaper, explaining the project and their motivations. The students also relied on social media as \\"the most popular way to get the word out right now.\\" The students created interactive Tumblr, Facebook, and Twitter accounts for the project. Although they expected the Facebook account to serve as the main social media outlet for promoting the project, the Tumblr account \\"really took off.\\" One student suggested that the site encouraged discussion without the moderation that the Facebook page required. The Who Needs Feminism? team reported that the Facebook page received over 4,200 likes within 36 hours of the project's launch, while the Tumblr account was viewed by almost 13,000 people in over 2,000 different cities. =Reactions= The campaign that began at Duke University spread to many colleges across the nation. But while the campaign did spark interest, it also experienced backlash. On Duke's campus, many of the posters were torn down or vandalized. Some of the vandals added signs to the posters reading \\"I need feminism because sandwiches can't make themselves,\\" or \\"I need feminism because it's funny watching them try to play sports.\\" The online outlets also experienced significant backlash in the comments made on the movement in general and individual submissions. One of the largest incidents of backlash was the Women against Feminism campaign that was created. This group took the original campaign's ideas of creating posters and changed the words to \\"I don't need feminism...\\" and posted them. Spread After its start at Duke, a number of different colleges, universities, and other organizations instituted their own campaigns. The original Duke campaign created a start up guide to assist the efforts of other institutions to carry out a Who Needs Feminism? campaign. In addition to colleges and universities, Who Needs Feminism has been adopted by a number of other institutions and organizations. For instance, feminists in India started their own Tumblr account to encourage submissions. The Feminism in India Project was founded by Japleen Pasricha, a research scholar at Jawaharlal Nehru University. Pasricha claimed that the movement was required to \\"unravel the F-word and demystify all the negativity surrounding it.\\" Pasricha organized a campaign at Indira Gandhi Institute of Technology and Ambedkar University Delhi on April 15, 2014, which exceeded its goal of 100 photographs. Organizations such as the National Council of Women of New Zealand, North York Women's Centre, and National Young Feminist Leader Conference have started campaigns and shared the images through the original Who Needs Feminism? Facebook page. The group UK Feminista started their own Tumblr and Facebook page, soliciting submissions at events such as the Glastonbury Festival and encouraging people to start their own campaigns at schools and colleges. As with the original campaign, these spin-off campaigns have received criticism and backlash. The efforts of students at Altrincham Grammar School for Girls to participate in the campaign led to what one student described as a \\"torrent of degrading and explicitly sexual comments\\" when their pictures were published online; some of the participants received threatening messages. Student Jinan Younis accused the school of failing to take action against the perpetrators and thus failing to support the participating students, while the school issued a statement recommending that students remove words or images they had placed online \\"that could compromise their safety or that of other students at the school.\\" See also * Domestic violence * Glass ceiling * Rape culture * Sexual harassment * Women Against Feminism * YesAllWomen * Me too (hashtag) References External links * Who Needs Feminism? on Tumblr Category:Feminism in the United States Category:Duke University Category:Social media ","title":"Who Needs Feminism"},{"id":"42261452","text":"XXXXVI Panzer Corps was a tank corps of the German Army during World War II that participated in the invasion of Yugoslavia.

The chapel is a natural stone amphitheatre located by Chain Rock Battery on the Northwest Arm at Point Pleasant Park. There are numerous notable people interred in the burial grounds around the chapel and it is also the location of the Mi‚Äôkmaq celebration of the Feast of St. Aspinquid (St. Aspinquid's Day), which was conducted through much of the 18th century. During the French and Indian War two Mi'kmaw chiefs fought each other in a battle near the chapel (1760).  St. Aspinquid  Tradition indicates Thury named the chapel after a Mi‚Äôkmaq Chief Aspinquid (Aspenquid), who converted to Catholicism and drew many others into the faith. Thury arrived at Acadia in 1684 and travelled with St. Aspinquid throughout the region, including present-day Nova Scotia.Don Awalt.The Mi‚Äôkmaq and Point Pleasant Park. 2004 Unaware of the Nova Scotia connection to St. Aspinquid, New England tradition has erroneously asserted that St. Aspinquid was Chief Passaconaway (For example, see Charles Beal. Passaconaway in the White Mountains. 1916. pp.47-48). There is a statue to Chief Passaconaway in Llowell Massachusetts that is erroneously labeled St. Aspinquid. Because of this confusion, the story states that he died at the age of 117 years. Because they had not found any reference to St. Aspinquid prior to the 19th century, some Maine antiquarians asserted that St. Aspinguid did not exist and was simply an invention of Americans of European descent. (See J. Dennis Robinson. White man invented St. Aspinquid)p.172 (During much of the 17th and early 18th centuries, Norridgewock on the Kennebec River and Castine at the end of the Penobscot River were the southernmost settlements of Acadia.); John Ried.

Beamish Murdoch. History of Nova Scotia. Vol. 1, p. 217 As a result, Aspinquid was made a martyr and became a saint. He is buried at Mount Agamenticus in present-day Maine.Hubbard, Rev. William. \\"History of the Indian Wars in New England .....1677.\\" b. ii 154 St. Aspinquid is usually associated with Mt. Agamenticus, where local legends claim he is buried under a great pile of stones. There is another possibility near Saco and the sea, Hubbard relates; \\"the other Town is called York, formerly known by the name of Agamenticus, from a high Hill of that Name.\\" Thury and his native flock, including possibly Aspinquid, were involved the attack on York.The Mi'Kmaq and Wabanaki recognize Aspinquid as a Saint but he has not been officially canonized by the Roman Catholic Church. After the death of St. Aspinquid, Father Louis-Pierre Thury officially became the missionary to the Mi'kmaq people at Shubenacadie and Chibouctou (Halifax) (1698).Journal d'une exp√©dition de d'Iberville, p. 26Acadia at the end of the 17th Century, p. 198Acadia at the end of the 17th Century, p. 199 Thury was the first missionary assigned to Halifax.  Feast of St. Aspinquid  Tradition indicates Thury celebrated Easter with the Mi'kmaq to coincide with their ancient spring festival. He renamed the Old Spring Feast the Feast of St. Aspinquid.Don Awalt.The Mi‚Äôkmaq and Point Pleasant Park. 2004 Historically the feast was the great social event of the year in the Mi‚Äôkmaq community, attracting various tribes of different native groups from all over the northeast region.In 1770, the Feast was held on May 31 and was hosted by two fishermen of European descent and attended by 12 tribes across the North including Mohawk and Penobscot (See Nova Scotia Chronicle and Weekly Advertiser, No. 32, Vol. 2, June 5, 1770,p. 8) The festival was celebrated on or immediately after the first quarter of the moon in the month of May.Akins indicates that the date is on or immediately after the last quarter, however, the evidence of the dates from the contemporaneous newspapers always fall on the evening of the first quarter of the moon. Raddall indicates the feast is seven days after the new moon. See Akins, Thomas History of Halifax, footnote 94For other references see Halifax Gazette, May 25, 1773, June 1, 1773 and May 10, 1774 (as cited by Raddall, p. 2) Throughout Father Le Loutre‚Äôs War the feast is reported to have ceased until after the Burying of the Hatchet Ceremony (1761).Akins, Thomas B. \\"History of Halifax City\\" Oral tradition indicates Michael Francklin convinced the Mi‚Äôkmaq to continue their tradition at St. Aspinquid's Chapel.Franklin is also said to have died in Chief Paul‚Äôs arms (See Memoir of Michael Francklin Collections of the Nova Scotia Historical Society, p. 38) But in 1786, evidence of Mi‚Äôkmaq support for patriots in the American Revolution alarmed the local authorities and further celebration of the old feast was forbidden.Raddall, Thomas H. \\"Halifax, Warden of the North\\": pg. 94-95Akins. History of Halifax, footnote 94, p. 225  Battle at St. Aspinquid's Chapel  Tradition indicates that at St. Aspinquid‚Äôs Chapel in Point Pleasant Park, Halifax, Lahave Chief Paul Laurent and a party of eleven invited Shubenacadie Chief Jean-Baptiste Cope and five others to St. Aspinquid's Chapel to negotiate peace with the British.Awalt bases his account on stories from 17 separate Mi'kmaq accounts from 11 different locations in Nova Scotia (See Don Awalt.The Mi‚Äôkmaq and Point Pleasant Park. 2004 ). This oral tradition was also recorded by Harry Piers from elders who heard the story in the 19th century (See Ruth Whitehead. The Old Man Told Us. Nimbus Press. 1991. p. 140). Chief Paul Laurent had just arrived in Halifax after surrendering to the British at Fort Cumberland on 29 February 1760.See Beamish Murdoch, Vol. 2, p. 385Massachusetts Historical Society In early March 1760, the two parties met and engaged in armed conflict.None of the oral accounts give the exact date of the battle. Awalt is left to speculate about the date of the battle, which he asserts might be in May 1758 just before siege of Louisbourg. The evidence contradicts this assertion and suggests that the date was more likely March 1760. The two main players of the conflict - Paul Laurent and Jean-Baptiste Cope - both could not have been in Halifax in 1758 as indicated. Laurent was not seeking peace in 1758. Throughout the war Laurent fought the British and did not surrender until 29 February 1760 at Fort Cumberland. The only evidence of Chief Paul being in Halifax after 1755 is when he travels there over the following weeks to sign a peace treaty on March 10, 1760 (See Beamish Murdoch, Vol. 2, p. 385; also see March 10, 1750. Chief Paul and Governor Lawrence. Andrew Browns Manuscripts. British Museum. Nova Scotia Archives as cited by Daniel Paul. We were not the Savages). Further, Cope could not have died before the Siege of Louisbourg because French Officer Chevalier de Johnstone indicated that he saw Cope at Miramichi after the Siege of Louisbourg when Johnstone was en route to Quebec (See Johnstone, p. 46). Chief Larent's party killed Cope and two others, while Chief Cope‚Äôs party killed five of the British supporters. Shortly after Cope's death, Mi'kmaq chiefs signed a peace treaty in Halifax on 10 March 1760. Chief Laurent signed on behalf of the Lahave tribe and a new chief, Claude Rene, signed on behalf of the Shubenacadie tribe.See Beamish Murdoch, Vol. 2, p. 385Daniel N. Paul erroneously asserts that \\"the record shows Cope was still alive in the 1760s, which indicates he may have lived to a ripe old age\\" (See Daniel Paul). The last record of Cope is by Johnstone (1758). The Chief of the Shebenacadie was replaced in 1760, indicating that Cope was dead. Paul Laurent's biographer Michael Johnston notes that another chief from La Heve signed another treaty with the English on 9 Nov. 1761. (During this time of surrender and treaty making, tensions among the various factions who were allied against the British were evident. For example, a few months after the death of Cope, the Mi'kmaq militia and Acadian militias made the rare decisions to continue to fight in the Battle of Restigouche despite losing the support of the French priests who were encouraging surrender.) Chief Joseph Labrador of Lunenburg supported Chief Cope. He survived the battle and continued his raids on British settlers (See History of Lunenburg County, p. 343)  Burial ground  Some of the notable people interred in the burial ground are Thury (3 June 1699), the first recorded burial in Halifax; Shubenacadie Chief Jean Baptiste Cope (1760); and Halifax Chief Paul the last Mi‚Äôkmaq chief of the Chebucto tribe.French botanist Diereville arrived in 1699 to obtain plants for the royal gardens. At his arrival at Chebucto on the ship La Royale Paix, three Mi'kmaq chiefs greeted him in canoes, declared themselves Christians and showed him Father Thury's grave at the St. Aspinquid's chapel burial ground.Paul Laurent's party included Halifax Chief Saylen Paul's two sons. While one of the Chief Paul's sons killed Cope, another of Chief Paul's sons was killed. Chief Paul and Chief Cope were brothers-in-law. Chief Paul indicated he was not part of his sons' battle against Chief Cope and to prove his innocence chose to be buried beside Cope.Diereville, sieur de.

Toronto: Champlain Society, 1933, p.77-78 The Duc d'Anville Expedition arrived with the crew dying of typhus, which spread to and devastated the Mi‚Äôkmaq who were at Chebucto, many of whom are interned at the burial ground (1746).

It can be a folk song, musical proverb or modern pop music. The general term for music in Lugbara is ongo. Traditional Lugbara musical instruments Lugbara music can be performed using various traditional instruments. Adungu is a multi-stringed and bow-arched wooden instrument that is usually covered with animal hide at the base and made in various sizes, the smaller ones are handheld while the bigger ones rest on the ground or floor for easy play. Most tribes in Northern Uganda use it. Agwara is a local trumpet. Guke, a trumpet is used by men and boys in most of their dance. Luru is the Lugbara end blow trumpet made from a bottle shaped gourd. Mare is the side-blown trumpet made from a gourd and a wooden tube. It is blown through the hole in the gourd with the wooden tube pointing downward or under the left arm. Bees wax is smeared inside the gourd which is wetted before it‚Äôs played, only at death dances. Naito is the special drum used in union with this funeral trumpet, but the general Lugbara name for a drum is ari. Other instruments used for Lugbara music include shaker, bells, tube fiddle and xylophone. Lugbara dances There are various kinds of Lugbara dances. Agwara is a dance from the Lugbara and Kebu in the West Nile, bordering the Congo and the Sudan. The dance got its name from agwara, a local trumpet. The men play these horns as the women dance. Duluka which means 'dance' in Nubian language, is considered another Lugbara dance, a community and tourist attraction where music can even be played on banana stems. Gaze is a traditional dance of the Lugbara people. This youthful dance reflects the transition of the bodily movements into the style of their neighbors in the Congo and is spreading across Uganda. Mbiri is known among the Madi. Nambi is performed mostly by young people during traditional marriage. Oseke is for the Kebu.Suburb2suburb Otwenge which literally means 'elbow' is another folk dance among the Kebu and Lugbara.Tour of Light 2006 It involves the raising of elbow joints, also performed by Alur. Costumes used in these dances include animal skins, feathers, grass skirts and shells. Modern Lugbara pop music With the advent of radio technology and music videos, Lugbara music has grown steadily. Songs are composed regularly with two or more verses and a chorus accompanied by foreign instruments such as guitars, pianos and mixers. Gospel in Lugbara has always had a widespread presence but other foreign genres like hiphop and reggae have also been incorporated. The growth has witnessed the emergence of producers like Papa Muzamil; production studios like Audio Wave, Chuchu Records, (Papa's) Jomic, Swag Beat Records, New Orleans Studio, F-Records, Fireworks Films, Benchmark Films, Bajack Entertaiment, Thunder Films plus music stars like Leku Culture, Innocent Nyakuta, Leila Chandiru, (UK-based) Betty & Gladys, Marteen, Daniel Kaweesa,Daniel Kaweesa Goes Home A Millionaire Ginuham, Ragga Python, Loveson Controlla, Pingoman, Fingerman, Dogman, Lady Abiria, P.I.G.

Sennett had a penchant for working with and showcasing real-life daredevils and public personalities and hired a real-life pilot, Phil Parmelee, who was a national hero at the time. He would employ Barney Oldfield in a similar fashion a year later in Barney Oldfield's Race for a Life.

She served as the president of both the American Ethnological Society (1967) and the American Anthropological Association (1974‚Äì1975). Friedl was also the first female Dean of Arts and Sciences and Trinity College at Duke University, and was a James B. Duke Professor Emerita. A building on Duke's campus, housing the departments of African and African American Studies, Cultural Anthropology, the Latino/Latina Studies program, and Literature was named in her honor in 2008. Her major interests included gender roles, rural life in modern Greece, and the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin. Early life Born in Hungary in 1920, Ernestine Friedl emigrated to the United States with her parents at the age of two years. They settled in the West Bronx neighborhood of New York City. Her father had been a railway functionary in Hungary but in the U.S. became a salesman, while her mother was a garment worker. Education Friedl attended Hunter College, a public women's college in the Upper East Side of New York, from which she graduated in 1941 with a Bachelor of Arts in pre-social work. Friedl went to graduate school at Columbia University from 1941 to 1950, earning a Ph.D. in anthropology in 1950. Influences While in attendance at Hunter College, Friedl met three influential figures in her life: Dorothy L. Keur and Elsie Steedman, both professors of anthropology who taught and inspired Friedl to pursue the same field, as well as her future husband Harry Levy, who studied classics. It was Levy who encouraged Friedl to continue on with post-graduate studies in order to become an anthropologist. Other influences include Columbia professors Ralph Linton and Ruth Benedict. Fieldwork In 1942 and 1943, under the tutelage of Columbia professor Ralph Linton, Friedl studied the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Wisconsin. She published a dissertation concerning the Chippewa political organization and leadership. After receiving her Ph.D. at Columbia, she and her husband Harry Levy traveled to Greece in 1954 where they engaged in anthropological fieldwork. She had been awarded a Fulbright grant to study life in a Greek village Vasilika, a small agricultural town with a population of 216 people. She returned to the area from 1964 to 1965 to do fieldwork with migrants. In 1971 and 1972, Friedl and Levy spent time in Athens working on her book Women and Men, which is when Friedl's interest in gender roles began. Career Friedl began teaching in at Brooklyn College in the fall of 1942. Other than a brief intermittent stint at Wellesley College and some courses taught at Queens College, she continued teaching at Brooklyn College until 1973 when she became a professor of anthropology at Duke University. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1976. While at Duke, she was the chair of the Department of Anthropology from 1973 to 1978, and the Dean of Arts and Sciences and Trinity College from 1980 to 1985. She served as the secretary and later the president of the American Ethnological Society in 1967. In 1970, Friedl participated in the Committee on the Status of Women in Anthropology as part of the American Anthropological Association, later serving as its president from 1974 to 1975.

Products The company's lead product is obeticholic acid, OCA, also known as 6-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid or INT-747, marketed as Ocaliva. OCA is a potent first-in-class farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist. As of March 2017, Ocaliva is approved in the US and the EU for use in primary biliary cholangitis. It is in phase III studies for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and phase II studies for primary sclerosing cholangitis. Other products in the development pipeline include INT-767, a dual FXR/TGR5 agonist, and INT-777, a TGR5 agonist. On June 29, 2020, the company released a statement announcing that FDA had rejected its lead product obeticholic acid, OCA, because FDA officials had determined that \\"the predicted benefit of the drug does not sufficiently outweigh the predicted risks\\". https://www.statnews.com/2020/06/29/fda-rejects-intercept-pharmas- drug-for-nash/ Initial public offering and stock history Intercept trades on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol ICPT. The initial public offering of the stock on October 16, 2012 was at $15. A follow-on public offering at $33 took place on June 24, 2013. On January 9, 2014, the stock skyrocketed from $72.39 to $275.49, or about 280%, after a planned interim analysis by the independent data safety monitoring board showed that Obeticholic acid met the main goal (improvement of liver histology) at the mid-stage in the FLINT trial in NASH, sponsored by NIDDK. The stock continued to climb to $497 over the next few days before falling back to around $317 on March 29, 2014, giving a market capitalization of around $6.2 billion. In March 2014, the company released the results of the POISE study of Obeticholic acid in PBC, which showed the drug met the trial's primary endpoint of a reduction in serum alkaline phosphatase, a biomarker for the disease. These results were presented at an international liver meeting in April 2014. As of 31 December 2014, the company has 136 employees.

Neointimal hyperplasia is the major cause of restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions such as stenting or angioplasty. The term neointima is used because the cells in the hyperplastic regions of the vascular wall have histological characteristics of both intima and normal artery cells.  Causes  Neointimal hyperplasia first develops with damage to the arterial wall, followed by platelet aggregation at the site of injury, recruitment of inflammatory cells, proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells, and collagen deposition. Mechanical injury of arterials due to stretching of arterial walls with a balloon catheter results in the recruitment of cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils to the site of injury. Macrophages in particular express many growth factors, cytokines, and enzymes that facilitate vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. C-reactive protein is a systemic inflammatory mediator correlated with neointimal hyperplasia, but it is still unknown if this protein is a marker of increased risk or a causative agent of the condition.  Prevention  P radioactive Œ≤-emitting stents were used in coronary artery lesions with results showing inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia in a dose- dependent manner. A 6-month follow up post-implantation of the radioactive stents showed little adverse side-effects in the patients. However, more recent studies have shown that patients have a late progression of in-stent neointimal hyperplasia after 1 year of radioactive stent implantation, suggesting a delay in the development of neointimal hyperplasia rather than a prevention or decline of the condition. Drug-eluting stents coated with anti- proliferative chemicals are used to counteract neointimal hyperplasia after stents placement. Drug-eluting stents that release resveratrol and quercetin show promise with marked reduction in intimal hyperplasia compared to bare, metal stents.  Treatment  Anti-inflammatory treatment is effective in limiting the development of neointimal hyperplasia. In rabbits, the use of IL-10 to reduce function of circulating monocytes and inhibition of leukocyte adhesion with antibodies reduced formation of neointimal hyperplasia after angioplasty and stenting. Nitric oxide-based treatment for the treatment of cardiovascular pathologies has shown promise in the treatment of neointimal hyperplasia. However, the difficulty in controlled, local release of nitric oxide has limited its clinical use for neointimal hyperplasia. Polymer-based perivascular wraps are attracting growing interest for their potential use to deliver nitric oxide and other drugs in the treatment of neointimal hyperplasia. Exendin-4, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1) agonist used as drug treatment for type 2 diabetes inhibits neointimal hyperplasia. The use of PKA inhibitors reverses the inhibitory effects of exendin-4, suggesting that the anti-proliferative effects of exendin-4 involves the cAMP- PKA pathway. Exendin-4 inhibits TNFŒ± production by macrophages to reduce inflammation, which may play another role in inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia.

Patrick Edward Fallon (born December 19, 1967) is an American businessman and politician. A Republican, he has represented the 30th District in the Texas Senate since 2019. Previously, Fallon was a member of the Texas House of Representatives for District 106. Early life and education Fallon was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Both of his parents were public school teachers, and he was raised in rural areas. Fallon earned his bachelor's degree in government and international relations from the University of Notre Dame. At Notre Dame, Fallon played varsity football under coach Lou Holtz and was part of the 1988 national championship team. He ran a t-shirt business as a student and participated in campus political activities. He was a cadet in the Reserve Officers Training Corps of the United States Air Force. Subsequently, he served as a second lieutenant for four years, during which he received the Air Force Achievement Medal.  Career  After college, Fallon relocated to Denton County, Texas in the early 1990s. He is the president and chief executive officer of Virtus Apparel, a company that specializes in clothing of military and patriotic design. Based in Prosper, Texas, it has a dozen national locations and about one hundred total employees. =Politics= In 2009, Fallon launched a grassroots campaign which netted him 57 percent of the vote to defeat three opponents for an at-large seat on the Frisco City Council. In the Denton County portion of Frisco, which consists of about one- third of the voters in House District 106, Fallon polled 65 percent of the vote. In his first year on the city council, Fallon voted against a tax rate increase. In 2010, he voted against a city budget that would have increased the municipal debt. In May 2011, his council colleagues selected him to serve as Mayor Pro Tem. In 2012, Fallon won the Republican nomination in the reconfigured District 106, in which incumbent Republican Rodney Anderson of Grand Prairie did not run. Instead, Anderson waited two years unseated incumbent Republican Linda Harper-Brown in the 2014 primary election in neighboring District 105. Fallon won the general election on November 6, 2012, 41,785 (83.2 percent) against Libertarian Party nominee Rodney Caston's 8,455 votes (16.8 percent). Fallon faced no Democratic Party opponent in the election. Fallon was the co-author of a 2013 Texas law which allows students and employees of independent school districts to say, \\"Merry Christmas\\", rather than the nonsecular \\"Happy Holidays.\\" Fallon ran unopposed for the Republican nomination in 2014 and defeated Democrat Lisa Osterholt and Libertarian Rodney Caston in the general election, winning 24,419 votes, almost 70 percent of the popular vote. In the 2016 Republican primary, Fallon defeated challenger Trent Trubenbach with 16,106 votes (82.9 percent) to Tubenbach's 3,327 votes (17.1 percent). He went on to win the general election with 80.8 percent of the vote. In July 2017, Fallon announced that he would challenge incumbent state Senator Craig Estes for the Republican nomination in Senate District 30. Fallon defeated Estes and Nocona businessman Craig Carter in the primary on March 6, 2018, with 53,881 votes (62 percent). In the ensuing general election on November 6, Fallon defeated the Bridgeport Democrat Kevin Lopez. With 233,949 votes (73.9 percent), Fallon overwhelmed Lopez, who drew 82,449 votes (26.1 percent). Fallon served on the House committees on Human Services and Technology. =Legislative positions= Fallon defended his \\"Merry Christmas\\" law in an appearance on David Barton's WallBuilders Live radio program. Fallon told co-host Rick Green, a former member of the Texas House from Hays County in suburban Austin, that those offended by public schools hosting Christmas parties should examine their own hearts to evaluate their attitudes. Both Fallon and Green said that no citizen has a constitutional right \\"not to be offended\\" Fallon vowed to make T-shirts with a Christmas theme for pupils to wear on the day before the holiday break. A pro-life legislator, Fallon supported in 2013 the ban on abortion after twenty weeks of gestation; the measure passed the House, 96-49. He co- sponsored companion legislation to increase medical and licensing requirements of abortion providers, a measure which opponents claim will cause some abortion clinics in the state to close their doors. These issues brought forth an unsuccessful filibuster in the Texas State Senate by Wendy R. Davis of Fort Worth who in 2014 was the Democratic nominee for governor opposite the Republican Greg Abbott, the choice of Fallon. The Texas Right to Life Committee rated Fallon 100 percent favorable. Fallon opposed the bill to establish a taxpayer-funded breakfast program for public schools; the measure passed the House, 73-58. He co-sponsored legislation to provide marshals for school security as a separate law-enforcement entity. He co-sponsored the successful bill to extend the franchise tax exemption to certain small businesses. He voted to require testing for narcotics of those individuals receiving unemployment compensation. Fallon co-sponsored the measure to forbid the state from engaging in the enforcement of federal regulations of firearms. He co-sponsored legislation to allow college and university officials to carry concealed weapons on campus and in vehicles in the name of security. He voted to reduce the time required to obtain a concealed-carry permit. Fallon voted for term limits for certain state officials. To protect election integrity, Fallon supported legislation to forbid an individual from turning in multiple ballots. =Interest group ratings= In 2013, Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum, managed in Texas by Cathie Adams, a former state chairman of the Texas Republican Party and a Fallon supporter, rated Fallon 95 percent. The Young Conservatives of Texas scored him 92 percent. The Texas League of Conservation Voters rated him 25 percent; Environment Texas, 28 percent. Texans for Fiscal Responsibility rated Fallon 98 percent; the Texas Association of Business, 80 percent. The National Rifle Association rated him 92 percent.  2020 congressional campaign  In May 2020, Fallon launched a campaign for Texas's 4th congressional district to replace former U.S. Representative John Ratcliffe, who was successfully nominated to serve as the Director of National Intelligence. On August 8, 2020, Fallon was selected to replace Ratcliffe on the November ballot by the 16 county Republican Party chairs in the district, winning the nomination with 82 votes to his nearest opponent's 34. Fallon will face Democrat Russell Foster in the November general election. However, according to the Texas Tribune, the district is so heavily Republican that the county Republican chairs effectively chose Ratcliffe's successor when they chose Fallon to replace Ratcliffe as the Republican nominee. Fallon's state senate district includes much of the eastern portion of the congressional district. If he wins, he will be only the sixth person to represent this district since its creation in 1903.  Personal life  Fallon is married to Susan Kimberly Garner. The couple have two sons and live in Prosper, an outer suburb of Dallas. He lives in the Denton County portion of Prosper, which is just outside the 4th's boundaries. While candidates for the House are only required to live in the state they wish to represent, longstanding convention holds that they live either in or reasonably close to the district they wish to represent. He is affiliated with the Holy Cross Catholic Church in The Colony. He is a donor to Dallas Baptist University, Frisco Family Services, and the Boys and Girls Club of America.

C. DiCarlo is an American politician who served in both houses of the Massachusetts General Court. He was expelled from the Senate in 1977 after he was convicted of extortion. He was the first Massachusetts State Senator to be expelled. Early life DiCarlo was born on March 21, 1936 in Somerville, Massachusetts. He grew up in Revere, Massachusetts and graduated from Immaculate Conception High School, Boston College, and Boston University. Prior to entering politics, DiCarlo was a junior high school history teacher in Revere. Political career In 1964, DiCarlo was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. During his first term he was named chairman of the education committee. In 1968 DiCarlo challenged incumbent State Senator Harry Della Russo in the 1st Suffolk District (later known as the Suffolk, Essex, and Middlesex District), which consisted of Revere, Winthrop, Saugus, and Everett. He upset Della Russo in the Democratic primary and went on to win the general election. From 1971 to 1973 DiCarlo was the Assistant Majority Leader. In this role he gained a reputation as being fiercely loyal to Senate President Kevin B. Harrington. In 1973 Harrington promoted DiCarlo to Senate Majority Leader, which made him the second ranking person in the Senate. DiCarlo was seen as Harrington's prot√©g√©e and eventual successor. At the 1970 state Democratic Convention, DiCarlo was considered a possible compromise candidate for Lieutenant Governor if the convention was deadlocked. However, there was no deadlock and the nomination was won by Michael Dukakis. =MBM scandal and expulsion= On August 13, 1976 a grand jury indicted DiCarlo and fellow Senator Ronald C. Mackenzie on charges that they extorted $40,000 from a consulting company. According to the indictment, DiCarlo and Mackenzie threatened McKee-Berger-Mansueto, Inc. (MBM), the consulting company supervising construction of the University of Massachusetts Boston campus at Columbia Point, with an unfavorable report from the legislative committee investigating their contract unless they were paid. DiCarlo and Mackenzie were charged with violating the Hobbs Act, which forbids extortion by public officials, and the Travel Act, which forbids crossing state lines for the purpose of extortion. On February 25, 1977, DiCarlo and Mackenzie were found guilty after a 23-day trial. He was sentenced to one year in prison and fined $5,000.

He was succeeded by William M. Bulger. Despite his conviction, DiCarlo maintained his innocence and refused to resign his Senate seat. On April 1, the Senate Ethics Committee recommended that DiCarlo be expelled from the Senate. On April 4 the Senate voted 28 to 8 to expel DiCarlo. It was the first time in the Senate's 196-year history that a member had been expelled. After his expulsion, DiCarlo announced that he would run in the special election to regain his seat. He lost the Democratic primary to Frank J. Mastrocola, Jr., a 24-year-old one-term Alderman from Everett who ran on the slogan \\"If DiCarlo Wins, Massachusetts Loses\\". Post-political life DiCarlo served nine months at the Federal Correctional Institution in Allenwood. After his release from prison, DiCarlo was unable to find employment for six months. Rather than work at his family's North End furniture store, he eventually accepted a job with a Revere construction company. He started out hauling wheelbarrows of cement, but was later moved to doing estimates. On April 7, 1980, DiCarlo testified before the Special Commission Concerning State and County Buildings (also known as the Ward Commission after its chairman, John William Ward). He admitted to accepting $11,500 from MacKenzie in exchange for altering the report on MBM. Notes :1. The district (renamed the 17th Suffolk District in 1969) sent two representatives to the House at this time. DiCarlo and Raymond Edward Carey were succeeded by William Reinstein and Joseph Del Grosso.

Prominent honorary members include Dr. Larry Squire (University of California ‚Äì San Diego), Dr. Robert Sapolsky (Stanford University), Bruce McEwen (Rockefeller University) and the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet. Nu Rho Psi is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) public charity incorporated in the state of Ohio, US. The Honor Society has a small part-time staff housed at Baldwin Wallace University (Berea, Ohio, US) and is managed by a member-elected national council consisting of student and faculty volunteers from many colleges and universities throughout the United States of America.  Mission, Greek letter designation, and insignia  The official mission and purpose of Nu Rho Psi is to: (1) encourage professional interest and excellence in scholarship, particularly in neuroscience; (2) award recognition to students who have achieved such excellence in scholarship; (3) advance the discipline of neuroscience; (4) encourage intellectual and social interaction between students, faculty, and professionals in neuroscience and related fields; (5) promote career development in neuroscience and related fields; (6) increase public awareness of neuroscience and its benefits for the individual and society; and, (7) encourage service to the community. The Greek letters of the honor society, ‚ÄúŒùŒ°Œ®‚Äù, designates the interdisciplinary science that engages its members in the study of the brain and the rest of the nervous system. The Greek letter Nu (Œù, ŒΩ) stands for the noun Nous (pronounced ‚Äúnoose‚Äù), meaning ‚ÄúMind‚Äù. The letter Rho (Œ°, œÅ) stands for the verb Œ°ueaoai (pronounced ‚Äúhruesthigh‚Äù) meaning, ‚Äúto cure‚Äù. The letter Psi (Œ®, œà) stands for the noun Psyche (pronounced ‚Äúpsuke‚Äù), meaning ‚Äúlife.‚Äù  History  Nu Rho Psi, the National Honor Society in Neuroscience, was founded in 2006, but its history can be traced to the early 1990s with the founding of the Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience (FUN). In its formative years, Nu Rho Psi was governed by the FUN Council but, as the society grew, FUN decided that Nu Rho Psi would be better served by its own separate council. In 2006 Nu Rho Psi became an independent tax-exempt [501(c)(3)] public charity incorporated in the state of Ohio, US. The first Nu Rho Psi National Council was elected in 2011. The first charters were awarded in 2006 to Baldwin Wallace University (application dated 16 Jun 2006), Baylor University (application dated 6 Nov 2006) and Macalester College (application dated 8 Dec 2006). A full history of Nu Rho Psi can be found here.  Membership requirements  Membership is by invitation and is open to undergraduate and graduate students who are making the study of neuroscience one of their major interests and who meet the other academic qualifications. Nu Rho Psi is also open to qualifying neuroscience faculty and alumni of neuroscience programs. Requirements for membership include: * Major, minor, other emphasis in neuroscience * Completion of at least 3 semesters of the college course * Completion of at least 9 semester hours of neuroscience-related courses * Undergraduate cumulative GPA of 3.2 and a minimum GPA of 3.5 in neuroscience courses The National Council of Nu Rho Psi awards charters to colleges and universities in the United States that have qualified based on their neuroscience curriculum, faculty expertise, and student research opportunities ‚Äì among other factors. Students and faculty are elected to membership by the chapter at participating institutions, according to the provisions in the national Nu Rho Psi Constitution and locally adopted by-laws. Any chapter, at its discretion, may establish higher academic standards for eligibility, but may not require lower standards for eligibility. Membership in Nu Rho Psi is open to qualified candidates regardless of age, sex, sexual orientation, race handicap or disability, color, religion, or national or ethnic origin. The current one-time membership induction fee is $40.00 for students and $50.00 for faculty. At the discretion of individual chapters, there may be additional chapter dues which are determined at the local level. No further fees go to the national organization as membership is for life.  Membership benefits  Nu Rho Psi membership provides recognition of verified academic excellence in the interdisciplinary field of neuroscience. Students who become members of Nu Rho Psi are selected based on their superior scholarly accomplishments as well as their excellent work in the laboratory. Nu Rho Psi membership is for life and it is often a springboard for the networking and collaboration of like-minded colleagues throughout the U.S.A. interested in the study of the brain. Nu Rho Psi members are provided opportunities to form professional relationships that carry them through their careers in neuroscience. There are both regional and national Nu Rho Psi meetings where young neuroscientists from around the United States gather to share scientific findings. Nu Rho Psi offers competitive travel awards for members to attend and present their research at the annual Society for Neuroscience meeting. Nu Rho Psi also offers competitive small grants to facilitate member's senior theses or summer research projects. Nu Rho Psi mentors members through publications (e.g. The Nu Rho Psi Guide to Graduate School in Neuroscience ) and other outreach activities of the society. News and additional information about benefits are available to members via the Nu Rho Psi online newsletter. Members receive membership certificates and lapel pins as an indication of the honor they have earned.  Activities and regional/national meetings  As documented in the Nu Rho Psi News, individual Nu Rho Psi chapters organize a variety of service and educational activities throughout the year. Regional Vice-Presidents provide leadership of the federation of chapters in the region where they reside and represent their region through service on the national council. They are also responsible for promoting Nu Rho Psi activities during the regional undergraduate neuroscience meetings (e.g. mGluRs, NEURON, SYNAPSE, MIDBRAINS). Nu Rho Psi holds an annual National Membership meeting during the Society for Neuroscience conference. In 2014 the national council established an annual theme for its chapters. Nu Rho Psi chapters use this theme as a focal point in planning educational and service activities for the academic year.  List of current chapters  Nu Rho Psi chapters are divided into four regional areas in the United States (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West), each with their own representative vice-president. * Agnes Scott College * Atlanta University Center Consortium (Morehouse College, Spelman College, Clark Atlanta University, and Morehouse School of Medicine) * Baldwin Wallace University * Baylor University * Binghamton University * Boston College * Boston University * Bradley University * Carnegie Mellon University * Carthage College * Centenary College of Louisiana * Central Michigan University * Centre College * Christopher Newport University * College of Wooster * Colorado State University * Concordia College * Connecticut College * Denison University * DePaul University * Dominican University * Drake University * Drew University * Emory University * Florida State University * Georgia State University * Gustavus Adolphus College * Johns Hopkins University * Knox College * Lake Forest College * Loras College * Loyola University Chicago * Macalester College * Miami University * Millsaps College * North Central College * Northeastern University * Oberlin College * The Ohio State University * Pioneer Valley (Smith College; University of Massachusetts, Amherst) * Regis University * Rhodes College * Rutgers University * Skidmore College * St. Mary's College of Maryland * St. Olaf College * Stonehill College * Susquehanna University * Syracuse University * Temple University * Thiel College * Transylvania University * Trinity College - Connecticut * Tulane University * Union College * University of Arizona * University of California - Irvine * University of Cincinnati * University of Colorado - Boulder * University of Delaware * University of Evansville * University of Georgia * University of Illinois at Chicago * University of Kansas * University of Kentucky * University of Massachusetts Amherst * University of Miami * University of Nebraska, Omaha * University of Nevada, Reno * University of Notre Dame * University of Pennsylvania * University of Pittsburgh * University of Scranton * University of Southern California * University of St. Thomas * University of Tennessee * University of Virginia * University of Vermont * Ursinus College * Wartburg College * Weber State University * Wesleyan College  National council  Members of the national council are elected by the Nu Rho Psi membership. * President: Shubhik K.

He won the Academy Award for Best Film Editing at the 34th Academy Awards for the film West Side Story (1961), which was only his second credit as an editor. Long afterwards, West Side Story was listed as the 38th best-edited film of all time in a 2012 survey of members of the Motion Picture Editors Guild. The film's editing is also featured in Louis Giannetti's textbook Understanding Movies. Stanford's first credit as an editor was for Suddenly, Last Summer (1959), which was a major production by the independent producer Sam Spiegel. Excepting a 1955 film version of the opera Don Giovanni, any earlier work as an assistant editor wasn't credited. This was typical in the 1950s. Stanford edited three films with director Sydney Pollack, including Pollack's first feature The Slender Thread (1964). Stanford's work on Pollack's feature Jeremiah Johnson (1972) drew the attention of critic Gene Siskel, who wrote \\"Oddly enough, it is the violent scenes, the ones that don't work within the story, in which Pollack excels. Jeremiah's battle with a pack of wolves, and, later, a pack of Crow Indians, are stunning examples of direction and editing.\\" In the 1960s, Stanford edited two films directed by Mark Rydell, including his debut The Fox (1967). Stanford's last film before his retirement was Born to Race (1988). Stanford died at the age of 93 in 2017.

It has a history of premiering cutting-edge contemporary plays and musicals that have never before been produced in the area. History In 1974, three UMKC Theatre graduates ‚Äì Rohn Dennis, Liz Gordon, and Jim Cairns - turned a rented warehouse in Kansas City's River Market area into a locally based theatre company named \\"Theatre Warehouse.\\" The group's name was changed to the Unicorn Theatre in 1981, after letterhead paper was donated to the nascent company with a unicorn printed at the top.The Unicorn joined Actors' Equity Association, the national union for professional actors and stage managers, in 1984. The theatre draws its company of actors largely from the greater Kansas City area, but its productions also frequently feature performers from regional theatre communities in Chicago, St. Louis, and various other cities across the United States. The Unicorn moved to its current location on Main Street in 1986, when it transformed an 80-year-old parking garage into a functional, intimate theatre space with a thrust stage. The space underwent renovations in 1996 to include a new box office, lobby, rehearsal space, administrative office, and a Main Street entrance. The structure itself houses two performance spaces: a 152-seat Mainstage theatre, and the Jerome Stage, a second 122-seat theatre. A $2 million Next Stage Capital Campaign was launched in 2004 to renovate and expand the theatre, and the Unicorn opened the Jerome Stage in 2008, naming it after Norge W. Jerome, a nutritional anthropologist and former Unicorn theatre board member. In 1981, Cynthia Levin became Producing Artistic Director of the theatre. Levin announced at the start of the theatre's 40th-anniversary 2013‚Äì2014 season that the Unicorn will be launching a Longevity Campaign to raise the funds necessary to make the theatre the only of its kind in Kansas City to purchase and own its performance space. New play development The Unicorn is a founding member of the National New Play Network (NNPN), an alliance established in 1998 to support the development of new plays. As a part of their membership with NNPN, the Unicorn produces Rolling World Premieres, part of the Continued Life of New Plays Fund, to support production of a new play within a 12-month period. Since 1981, each season at the Unicorn has featured at least one world-premiere production. To date, the theatre has produced 58 world-premiere productions during the span of their 40 years of operation.

Later, from 1896, at Victoria Works, Rugby, Warwickshire, England. They were manufacturers of stationary reciprocating steam engines then steam turbines, Diesel motors and generators. They also ran their own foundry. During World War I it became necessary to sell control of the business to Dick, Kerr & Co. They soon went into the English Electric grouping but Willans & Robinson retained its identity and some independent shareholders until 1935 when it was liquidated. In the 21st century Willans & Robinson's business is represented by Alstom where it was taken by GEC in 1989 along with English Electric. Ferry Works, Thames Ditton High speed reciprocating steam engine The business was founded by Peter William Willans (1851-1892) and Mark Robinson (1844-1923) in the 1870s at their Ferry Works site to manufacture high speed reciprocating steam engines for launches. The major advance was that Willan's engines had all working parts enclosed and they were splash-lubricated, this was new. They soon employed some 400 people. The rise of the Electricity industry created a new demand for their engines. Their engines were designed to operate at a constant speed and were ideal for electricity generation. At their peak their central valve engines provided 68% of Britain's installed capacity for generation of electricity. In this period of prosperity Willans was able to improve his designs and develop better manufacturing techniques, particularly the use of standardised interchangeable components. His research into the performance of his engines won him the reputation of having a scientific approach.Peter Turvey, ‚ÄòWillans, Peter William (1851‚Äì1892)‚Äô, rev. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Willans was the engineer, Robinson found the capital. Their new buildings at Thames Ditton (1888), Queensferry (1899) and Rugby (1896) were all of high quality and distinguished design. Son of a General and by profession a military engineer H Riall Sankey joined the board in 1889 and was appointed chief engineer following Willans' death shortly after being thrown from his dog cart on the way to Brookwood Station.

He was instrumental in the enthronement of Later Jin's second emperor Shi Chonggui, and therefore became a powerful chancellor early in Shi Chonggui's reign. Under his advocacy, Shi Chonggui turned away from the peaceful, submissive relationship that Later Jin had with its northern neighbor Liao (whose Emperor Taizong's support had been essential in the establishment of Later Jin by Shi Chonggui's uncle and predecessor Shi Jingtang), and became confrontational against Liao. The adversarial relationship continued even after Jing's removal as chancellor, such that Later Jin was eventually destroyed by a Liao invasion. Emperor Taizong took Jing captive, intending to deliver him to Liao proper, but Jing committed suicide.  Background  Jing Yanguang was born in 892, during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang. His family was from Shan Prefecture (ÈôùÂ∑û, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), but all that is said about his family in traditional sources is that his father Jing Jian () was a capable archer and trained Jing Yanguang to be one as well.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 29.  During Later Liang  During the time of Tang's successor state Later Liang, Zhu Youhui () the Prince of Shao, a nephew to Later Liang's founding emperor Zhu Quanzhong,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. served as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhenguo Circuit (ÈéÆÂúã, headquartered at Shan Prefecture). He took Jing to be an officer under him. Later, after Zhu Youhui was accused of plotting a rebellion and was put under house arrest, Jing fled to avoid arrest. He later served under Yin Hao (), who commanded the army at Hua Prefecture (ËèØÂ∑û, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi). Yin was apparently impressed with him sufficiently to recommend him to be transferred to the Later Liang imperial guard corps at Bian Prefecture (Ê±¥Â∑û, i.e., the Later Liang capital Daliang). Jing later served under the prominent general Wang Yanzhang in resisting the army of Li Cunxu, the prince of Later Liang's archrival Jin. Later, after Li Cunxu claimed the title of emperor of a new state of Later Tang and launched a surprise attack into Later Liang territory, Wang made a futile attempt to try to stop him at Zhongdu (‰∏≠ÈÉΩ, in modern Jining, Shandong). Wang's army was crushed, and Wang was captured and executed after refusing to surrender. Jing suffered several serious wounds during this battle, and was captured by the Later Tang army and taken by them to Daliang, which fell to Li Cunxu. (Later Liang's last emperor Zhu Zhen committed suicide as the city fell, ending Later Liang, whose territory was taken over by Later Tang.)  During Later Tang  After Later Liang's fall, Jing Yanguang apparently returned to serve in the army at Bian (which Later Tang converted back to the Tang-established Xuanwu Circuit (), as Later Tang placed its capital at Luoyang, not Daliang). In 927, by which time Li Cunxu's adoptive brother Li Siyuan was emperor, Li Siyuan decided to visit Bian. Then-military governor of Xuanwu, Zhu Shouyin, believed that Li Siyuan was intending to act against him, rebelled, but was quickly defeated, and he committed suicide.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. Many of Zhu's officers, including Jing, were set to be executed. These executions were set to be carried out by Li Siyuan's son-in-law Shi Jingtang. When Shi saw Jing, however, he took pity on Jing, and secretly released him and told him to flee. Later, apparently after Shi became the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), Jing came to serve under him as a \\"guest general\\" (ÂÆ¢Â∞á, kejiang). When Shi rebelled against then-emperor Li Congke (Li Siyuan's adoptive son) in 936, Li Congke sent the general Zhang Jingda to siege Hedong's capital Taiyuan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. Jing participated in the city's defense and had much accomplishment during the siege, during which Zhang almost, but was never able to, capture the city. Subsequently, Emperor Taizong of Later Tang's northern rival Khitan Empire came to Shi's rescue and defeated Zhang. He then declared Shi the emperor of China (as emperor of a new state of Later Jin).  During Later Jin  = During Shi Jingtang's reign = Shi Jingtang commissioned Jing Yanguang as the commander of his infantry. He was also given the honorary titles of acting Situ () and military prefect (ÂúòÁ∑¥‰Ωø, Tuanlianshi) of Guo Prefecture (ÊûúÂ∑û, in modern Nanchong, Sichuan, then ruled by Later Shu). Later (it is unclear whether this was before or after the Khitan/Later Jin forces destroyed Later Tang later in the year, allowing Later Jin to take over Later Tang's territory), he was given the honorary titles of acting Taibao () and military governor of Ningjiang Circuit (ÂØßÊ±ü, headquartered in modern Chongqing, then also ruled by Later Shu). In 939, Jing was sent out of then- capital Daliang to serve as the military governor of Yicheng Circuit (Áæ©Êàê, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan). In 940, he was given the honorary title of acting Taifu () and transferred to Baoyi Circuit (‰øùÁæ©, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, i.e., the same circuit formerly known as Zhenguo during Later Liang). In 941, he was recalled to serve as the disciplinary officer for the imperial guards. He was also made the military governor of Heyang Circuit (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan). In 942, Shi Jingtang fell deathly ill. He initially entrusted his young (and only surviving) son Shi Chongrui () to the senior chancellor Feng Dao, intending that Feng support Shi Chongrui in succeeding to the throne. However, after Shi Jingtang died shortly after, Feng discussed the matter with Jing, and they decided that as the realm was troubled at the time, the state needed an older emperor. They thus supported Shi Jingtang's biological nephew and adoptive son Shi Chonggui the Prince of Qi as emperor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. = During Shi Chonggui's reign =  Chancellorship  It was said that Jing Yanguang considered Shi Chonggui's ascension to the throne to be his doing, and used that to become involved in the key decisions in Shi's administration. Shortly after Shi took the throne, he was made the commander of the imperial guards, as well as chancellor (with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). He was also apparently given the military governorship of Tianping Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), but remained at Daliang. One of the immediate diplomatic decisions was how Shi Jingtang's death and Shi Chonggui's ascension was to be reported to Khitan (which has renamed itself Liao by this point). Most officials suggested submitting a report to Emperor Taizong and having Shi Chonggui refer to himself as \\"your subject\\" in the report, to show submission. Jing, however, advocated a letter (to show equality between the states) and having Shi Chonggui refer to himself as \\"your grandson\\" and not \\"subject.\\" (The reference to being \\"grandson\\" was based on the fact that Shi Jingtang referred to himself as \\"your son\\" when corresponding with Emperor Taizong). Fellow chancellor Li Song argued that Jing's suggestion would eventually lead to war, but Jing insisted. With Feng neither agreeing nor disagreeing with Jing, Shi Chonggui accepted Jing's proposal. This caused Emperor Taizong to be angered. He sent an emissary rebuking Shi Chonggui for taking the throne without first seeking his approval. Jing wrote back an impudent response, although the text of the response was not recorded. With this apparent break in relations, Jing persuaded Shi Chonggui to arrest Liao's trade liaison officer at Daliang, Qiao Rong (), and seize all of property owned by the Liao liaison office. Further, all of the other Liao-authorized merchant officers within the Later Jin realm were seized and executed, and their property was seized. With the other officials pointing out that it was Liao aid that led to Later Jin's establishment, Shi released Qiao in 943, comforted him with kind words, and returned him to Liao. However, before Qiao's departure, Qiao went to bid Jing farewell. Jing, arrogantly, stated to him: As Qiao feared that Emperor Taizong would blame him for the loss of the Liao wealth, he flattered Jing and requested that Jing write his words down on paper. Jing had his secretary write down the words and give them to Qiao. When Qiao presented them to Emperor Taizong, Emperor Taizong was incensed, and therefore became resolute that he would attack Later Jin. He had the Later Jin emissaries detained at You Prefecture (ÂπΩÂ∑û, in modern Beijing) and refused to see them himself. Even though Sang Weihan (who negotiated the original alliance between Shi Jingtang and Emperor Taizong) repeatedly suggested that Shi Chonggui revert to subservience to Liao to avoid a war, Jing repeatedly stopped Shi from doing so. Meanwhile, while Shi Jingtang was alive, he had lent 300 horses from the imperial guards corps to Yang Guangyuan the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, headquartered in modern Weifang, Shandong). Jing demanded them back. Yang became angry and believed that the imperial government was suspecting him, and therefore secretly summoned his son Yang Chengzuo () back to Pinglu's capital Qing Prefecture (), and then prepared to rebel. In spring 944, Yang rebelled, and Emperor Taizong led a Liao army south to support him. Shi Chonggui mobilized the Later Jin troops to counter the Liao and Pinglu troops, with Jing in charge of the overall operations. It was said that Jing, impressed with his own power, was insulting to the other generals, such that even the emperor was unable to curb him. The Later Jin forces were able to repel the Liao aid force, and Yang was eventually defeated by the Later Jin general Li Shouzhen. Yang's son Yang Chengxun () put his own father under arrest, and then surrendered, ending Yang Guangyuan's rebellion. (Under imperial orders, Li Shouzhen had Yang Guangyuan secretly executed.) However, this campaign would be Jing's downfall as well, as during the resistance against Liao, Jing had issued an order that generals were to defend their positions and not to aid each other. As a result, Liao forces put three key Later Jin generals, Gao Xingzhou, Fu Yanqing, and Shi Gongba (), under siege at Qicheng (ÊàöÂüé, in modern Puyang, Henan), and the city nearly fell. Despite the seriousness of the situation, Jing did not report this to the emperor quickly. When Shi Chonggui realized this, he himself led an army to lift the siege on Qicheng. The three generals accused Jing of not taking the situation seriously. With other generals all resenting Jing's power, and Shi himself apprehensive of Jing, Sang suggested that Shi use the Qicheng incident as a reason to remove Jing. In summer 944, Shi commissioned Jing as the defender of Luoyang and sent him away from Daliang, although Shi gave him the greater chancellor title Shizhong () as an honorary title. He was replaced by Gao as the commander of the imperial guards.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284.  After chancellorship  It was said that the demotion from chancellorship depressed Jing Yanguang, who was also beginning to realize that Liao's strength would eventually endanger both himself and the state. He began drinking heavily. Meanwhile, as the campaign that repelled Liao drained the imperial treasury, Shi Chonggui sent out 36 emissaries to the various regions of his realm to have the local governments extract wealth from the people forcibly. Jing's Henan Municipality (Ê≤≥Âçó, i.e., the Luoyang region) was to submit 200,000 coins. Jing, wanting to extract more, offered 370,000 coins, but his assistant Lu Yi () rebuked him for benefitting himself at the people's expense, and he stopped. In 945, Emperor Taizong made another major incursion into Later Jin territory, advancing to the vicinity of Yedu (ÈÑ¥ÈÉΩ, in modern Handan, Hebei). During this incursion, as part of the overall Later Jing defense efforts, Jing took his position at Huliang Ford (ËÉ°Ê¢ÅÂ∫¶, in modern Anyang). After a series of attacks and counterattacks on both sides, the main Later Jin army, under the command of Shi's uncle by marriage, Du Wei, defeated the Liao army near Yangcheng (ÈôΩÂüé, in modern Baoding, Hebei). Still, under Sang Weihan's advice, Shi Chonggui sent the emissary Zhang Hui () to Liao, seeking peace. Emperor Taizong demanded to see Sang and Jing and to have Shunguo (È†ÜÂúã, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) and Yiwu (Áæ©Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Baoding) Circuits ceded to him before there could be peace. Shi, finding the demands insulting, cut off negotiations. In 946, Emperor Taizong laid a trap for Later Jing. He had Zhao Yanshou write to Du, offering to surrender Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered at You Prefecture) to Later Jin. Shi's then-chiefs of staff, Li Song and Feng Yu, believed in Zhao's letter, and advised Shi to accept. Shi commissioned another army, with Du in command and Li Shouzhen serving as Du's assistant, to advance north. Once they entered Liao territory, however, Emperor Taizong's army was ready to face them. They tried to retreat, but were surrounded at Zhongdu Bridge (‰∏≠Â∫¶Ê©ã, in modern Baoding). During this crisis, Jing was, per Shi's orders, stationed at Heyang to prepare for emergency operations. However, Emperor Taizong was then able to persuade Du and Li Shouzhen to surrender their army. He then advanced quickly toward Daliang. Finding the situation hopeless, Shi surrendered, ending Later Jin.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285.  After Later Jin's destruction  Even before Emperor Taizong could arrive at Daliang to accept Shi Chonggui's surrender, he notified Shi, again, that he wanted to see Sang Weihan and Jing Yanguang. When he reached Xiang Prefecture (Áõ∏Â∑û, in modern Anyang), he sent soldiers to Heyang to arrest Jing. Jing was surprised by this move and believed that he could not flee, so he went to see Emperor Taizong, meeting the Liao emperor at Fengqiu (Â∞Å‰∏ò, in modern Xinxiang, Henan). Emperor Taizong rebuked him, \\"Your actions were what led to the discord between the two emperors. Where are your 100,000 sharpened swords?\\" Emperor Taizong also summoned Qiao Rong to list 10 things that Jing did that he believed led to the enmity between the states. Jing initially denied them, but once Qiao showed the papers that his secretary had written, he admitted to them. Emperor Taizong read off the things he was accused of, and gave him one ivory chip as each one was read. When the eighth ivory chip was given, Jing fell prostrate and begged for death. Emperor Taizong then had him locked up in chains. Emperor Taizong then prepared to have Jing delivered back to Liao proper. As the jailers and he stopped at Chenqiao (Èô≥Ê©ã, in modern Xinxiang) one night, he found a time when the jailers were not watching him. He then strangled himself to death with his hands. After Liao eventually withdrew from Later Jin's former territory, and the territory was taken over by a new state of Later Han founded by the former Later Jin general Liu Zhiyuan, Jing was given posthumous honors.

With the Annika Bengtzon series, Marklund introduced a female tabloid journalist as the protagonist, in a genre where the main characters had often been men. Current events, like political scandals or women's issues, are often intertwined with the plot, or introduced in subplots.Ahola, Suvi. Big, blonde, and always promoting women's issues Helsingin Sanomat, January 17, 2001. Character Bengtzon works as a journalist for the fictional Swedish newspaper Kv√§llspressen (\\"The Evening News\\"). She hails from H√§lleforsn√§s in S√∂dermanland but now lives on Kungsholmen island in Stockholm. Alternately described as \\"courageous and compassionate\\" as well as \\"dark\\" and possessing a \\"destructive streak within her\\", she is a career woman juggling a husband and children while facing her employer's tough colleagues. Working as a crime reporter, Bengtzon stumbles into one dangerous situation after another. The character appears in the novels Spr√§ngaren (The Bomber), Studio sex (Studio 69/Exposed), Paradiset (Paradise/Vanished), Prime time, Den r√∂da vargen (The Red Wolf), Nobels testamente (Last Will), Livstid (Lifetime), and En plats i solen (The Long Shadow). She has obvious similarities to the author, with Liza Marklund herself pictured on the book covers. Bengtzon also appears briefly in Jan Guillou's book The Enemy Within. In the book Studio sex, Bengtzon's diary describes how she was beaten so badly by her first husband that she was forced to kill him in self-defense. The children, Kalle and Ellen, are figured in the novels and films, and Bengtzon becomes pregnant in Paradiset. In novels As of 2012, there were nine novels which featured the character Annika Bengtzon. The novels were not written in the chronological order of the events depicted in the heroine's life. Starting with Spr√§ngaren, in which Annika is already a deft professional, the story then moves back in time several years, to the start of her career and the meeting with her future husband Thomas. By the fifth installment, Den r√∂da vargen, the reader is back in the present.

As the modern British monarch remains politically neutral by tradition, the letters are controversial because of the Prince of Wales's position as the eldest child of the British monarch Queen Elizabeth II and heir apparent to the British throne. The letters are sent by Charles in a private capacity, but concerns have been raised that they may represent the exercise of undue influence over British government ministers. Issues about which Charles has expressed public views include farming, genetic modification, global warming, social deprivation, planning and architecture. This led the press to label Charles as a \\"meddling prince\\". The content of the \\"black spider\\" letters, named after Charles' distinctive handwriting, was known only anecdotally and from memoirs and leaks, until 13 May 2015 when the Information Tribunal ordered the release of most of the correspondence. These events were set in motion in 2010, when The Guardian journalist Rob Evans made an application under British Freedom of Information legislation to see the Prince's 2004 and 2005 letters to ministers. After several legal cases the application was eventually refused by the Attorney General Dominic Grieve in October 2012, and the case was the subject of an appeal in the Supreme Court which, in March 2015, ruled against the government's decision, and allowed for the later publication of the letters. Upon their release, the memos were variously described in the press as \\"underwhelming\\" and \\"harmless\\", and The Daily Telegraph claimed that their release had \\"backfired on those who seek to belittle him\\". Background Charles' letters are written by hand before being sent to be typed up. After the letters are returned to Charles to sign, he often adds additional comments in flowing black or red ink across the page using underlining and exclamation marks. It is these additions and his distinctive spirally handwriting that have given his letters their nickname. Charles has written to ministers on the understanding that his remarks are private. Letters to ministers have also been sent from the Prince's charities, foundations and campaign groups. These letters have been described as \\"advocacy correspondence\\", written by the Prince to advance the work of his charities or in an attempt to promote his views. The principal private secretary to the Prince of Wales, Sir Michael Peat, said in 2007 that the Prince \\"...is always very careful to ensure he is not politically contentious or party political, and as far as I am aware even his most ardent critic has never suggested he is.\\" The \\"dissident\\" prince In 2006, the former deputy private secretary and press adviser to the Prince of Wales, Mark Bolland, said that the Prince had referred to himself as a \\"dissident\\" who worked against the prevailing political consensus. Concerning Charles's views, Bolland said that he \\"...routinely meddled in political issues and wrote sometimes in extreme terms to ministers, MP's and others in positions of political power and influence...The prince used all the means of communication at his disposal, including meetings with ministers and others, speeches and correspondence with leaders in all walks of life and politicians. He was never party-political, but to argue that he was not political was difficult...These letters were not merely routine and non-controversial...but written at times in extreme terms...containing his views on political matters and individual politicians at home and abroad and on international issues...I remember on many occasions seeing in these day files letters which, for example, denounced the elected leaders of other countries in extreme terms, and other such highly politically sensitive correspondence.\\" In 2009, a spokesperson for the Prince said that his role as a privy counsellor gave him the right to communicate confidentially with ministers on matters that concern him, adding that communication between the Prince and ministers should be treated as private and confidential on all sides. In 2002, the Prince's office issued a statement defending his right to privately correspond with government ministers. The 2002 statement said that the Prince \\"...takes an active interest in all aspects of British life and believes that as well as celebrating success, part of his role must be to highlight problems and represent views in danger of not being heard...this role can only be fulfilled properly if complete confidentiality is maintained...It is proper and right that he should take an interest in British life. It is not about exerting undue pressure or campaigning privately.\\" In 2008, the Prince's friend and biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby, said that royal aides had informally started to consider redefining the role of the monarch to allow a future King Charles \\"...to speak out on matters of national and international importance in ways that at the moment would be unthinkable\\". The 'Cumbrian farmer letter' and letters to Blair and Irvine A letter from Charles to the then Prime Minister Tony Blair was leaked on the day of the Countryside Alliance's 'Liberty and Livelihood' protest march in September 2002. In the letter, Charles associated himself with the views of a farmer from Cumbria, who, complaining of the British government's treatment of rural workers said that \\"If we, as a group, were black or gay we would not be victimised or picked on.\\" Charles also wrote that if rural people were \\"any other minority\\" the government would make greater efforts to protect them. The government was also blamed for \\"destroying the countryside\\". Charles was believed to have written the letter in April 2002, and advisers were said to have attempted to persuade him not to send it, and suggested that Charles raise the issue with Blair when next they met. It was not known who \\"leaked\\" the letter, with speculation falling on a variety of sources including 10 Downing Street, the Labour Party, sources close to the Charles's household, or the Conservative Member of Parliament Nicholas Soames. The allegation was denied by 10 Downing Street and Soames. Charles wrote regularly to Blair and they would meet at least four times a year when Blair was Prime Minister. It was said that the Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine, had complained \\"bitterly\\" about being \\"bombarded\\" by letters from Charles, but this was denied by Irvine. Letters to Irvine in June 2001 had complained about the Human Rights Act and were critical of the \\"degree to which our lives are becoming ruled by a truly absurd degree of politically correct interference\\". Charles also complained to Irvine that the United Kingdom was \\"sliding inexorably down the slope of ever increasing, petty- minded litigiousness\\" and wrote in 2002 about \\"ever-more prescriptive laws - for example, health and safety at work legislation, the blame culture...and the bureaucratic red tape which accompanies new rules\\". Qatari letters, Chelsea Barracks scheme The Prince of Wales has occasionally written about architectural projects that utilise styles that he is aesthetically opposed to, such as modernism and functionalism. In 2009 the Prince wrote to the Qatari royal family, the developers of the Chelsea Barracks site in west London, labelling architect Richard Rogers's design for the site \\"unsuitable\\" and the plans \\"a gigantic experiment with the very soul of our capital city\\" Rogers was subsequently removed from the project and The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment was appointed to propose an alternative. Rogers claimed the Prince had also intervened to block his designs for the Royal Opera House and Paternoster Square, and condemned Charles's actions as \\"an abuse of power\\" and \\"unconstitutional\\". Lord Foster, Zaha Hadid, Jacques Herzog, Jean Nouvel, Renzo Piano, and Frank Gehry, among others, wrote a letter to The Sunday Times complaining that the Prince's \\"private comments\\" and \\"behind-the-scenes lobbying\\" subverted the \\"open and democratic planning process\\". Piers Gough and other architects condemned Charles's views as \\"elitist\\" in a letter encouraging colleagues to boycott a speech given by the Prince to RIBA in 2009. 2004-05 letters: FOI campaign by The Guardian In 2010, Rob Evans, a journalist for The Guardian newspaper, applied under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 to see copies of correspondence between Charles and ministers in seven government departments. The government refused to grant the request. The ministerial recipients of the letters and the dates which they were received were also deemed to be secret by the government. The 27 letters concerned were written between September 2004 and April 2005. The Guardians challenge was the first of its kind to attempt to obtain royal correspondence. Evans wished to see letters between Charles and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Department of Health, the Department for Children, the Department for Education, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Northern Ireland Office and the Cabinet Office. = 2009: Further letters revealed, Prime Ministerial block on disclosure = In addition to the letters sent in 2004 and 2005 sought by The Guardian, the same paper had revealed in 2009 that Charles had written directly to eight government ministers since 2006. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for International Development, HM Treasury, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Education and Skills, the Department for Communities and Local Government, and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport all received personal letters from Charles between 2006 and 2009. The government refused to release the content of the letters sent between 2006 and 2009. In addition to Charles's letters, his advisers had also written to five government departments and to members of the cabinet seeking to bring the government's policy into line with Charles's beliefs on matters such as the building of hospitals and ecotown design. Aides from the Charles's architectural charity had written to the then Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Hazel Blears, urging the government to adopt his positions on ecological design and planning. The Secretary of State for Health, Patricia Hewitt, also received letters from Charles's aides, who recommended the adoption by hospital trusts of design techniques devised by his architectural charity. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Andy Burnham, also received letters concerning the sustainable increase of the housing supply in a way \\"which provides support for the [prince's] Foundation's mission to promote timeless and ecological ways of planning, designing and building\\". In December 2009, Prime Minister Gordon Brown ordered a block on the disclosure of correspondence sent to ministers by members of the royal family at the same time as the information commissioner, Christopher Graham, blocked the release of an earlier set of correspondence which involved Prime Minister Blair. =2010: Initial FOI appeal= At the FOI appeal tribunal in September 2010, Paul Richards, a former special adviser to the former communities secretary Hazel Blears and health secretary Patricia Hewitt, said that it was clear to him that Charles regularly corresponded with ministers and these letters went \\"to the top of the pile\\" and are \\"treated with great reverence.\\" This is in contrast to letters from ordinary citizens, which \\"...go through a centralised mailroom and which are normally dealt with by departmental staff and rarely seen by ministers or their advisers.\\" Richards had been a special adviser from 2005‚Äì09 and said that Charles wrote on issues including planning applications and government health policy. Richards believed that lobbying from Charles had contributed to a ¬£1.1m grant awarded to his Foundation for Integrated Health. Richards believed that the grant arose after \\"behind-the-scenes lobbying\\" from Charles, and occurred at the same time as a reception hosted by the prince at his London residence, Clarence House, attended by at least one health minister and an adviser to Prime Minister Blair. Richards said that Charles had complained to education secretary Ed Balls about changes to the primary school syllabus and had lobbied Yvette Cooper over the design of ecotowns. Housing in the village of Poundbury, Dorset Charles had written to Blears after she had suggested that Poundbury, in Dorset, a village built according to the prince's architectural precepts, was \\"little more than a royal ego trip\\". The letter from Charles subsequently invited Blears to Poundbury, with Richards describing the letter as \\"...treated with great reverence and went straight to the top of the pile in the red box containing the minister's business for the day, over and above letters from other ministers and even cabinet papers.\\" The appeal also heard evidence from Rodney Brazier, a professor of constitutional law at Manchester University, who said that Charles corresponds with ministers \\"to a much greater extent than his predecessors\\". Brazier said that the quantity of Charles's letter writing amounted to a \\"constitutional innovation\\" but that he considered the process to be part of \\"the apprenticeship convention\\" served by the heir to the throne, in which Charles educates himself in the nature of state affairs. The hearing was subsequently adjourned until 2011 for reasons that the panel \\"could not go into\\". =2010: FOI amendment= The Freedom of Information Act was amended in 2010 to provide more protection over the communications with senior members of the British royal family, communications with the monarch, the heir to the throne and second in line to the throne would all be subject to an absolute exemption for twenty years or five years after the death of the individual, whichever occurs later. The changes were described as the \\"Prince Charles amendment\\" by Tony Wright MP. =2012: Successful Upper Tribunal appeal, Attorney General's veto= In September 2012 the Administrative Appeals Chamber of the Upper Tribunal, in a unanimous decision, ruled that the letters should be published, overturning the previous ruling of information commissioner from 2010. The appeals chamber found that the commissioner had given \\"insufficient weight to the public interest\\", when he chose to deny the disclosure of the letters, and found that it was in the public interest \\"for there to be transparency as to how and when Prince Charles seeks to influence government\\". The tribunal also found evidence of \\"Prince Charles using his access to government ministers, and no doubt considering himself entitled to use that access, in order to set up and drive forward charities and promote views, but not as part of his preparation for kingship...Ministers responded, and no doubt felt themselves obliged to respond, but again not as part of Prince Charles's preparation for kingship.\\" The tribunal also ruled that \\"it was fundamental\\" that Charles's lobbying \\"cannot have constitutional status\\" and must not be protected from disclosure. In evidence given to the tribunal, Stephen Lamport, who was the private secretary to the Prince of Wales from 1993 to 2002 said that Charles will stop writing to ministers were he to be crowned King, and that his letters formed part of his \\"apprenticeship convention\\", in which the \\"cardinal principle\\" of not commenting on public policy did not apply to him while heir. Lamport believed that if what the Prince \\"...says or writes to ministers were not to be confidential their exchanges would be 'bland and denuded' of any useful content\\" and that Charles viewed the \\"urging of opinions\\" to government ministers to be part of his role as heir. Dominic Grieve, Attorney General for England and Wales, 2010‚Äì14 The Upper Tribunal's decision was subsequently vetoed in October 2012 by the Attorney General for England and Wales, Dominic Grieve, who was supported in his decision by the Cabinet of the United Kingdom. The attorney general's veto placed an absolute block on the publication of the letters, which Grieve described as containing the \\"particularly frank\\" and \\"most deeply held personal views and beliefs\\" of the Prince of Wales. Grieve detailed the letters as containing \\"...remarks about public affairs which would in my view, if revealed, have had a material effect upon the willingness of the government to engage in correspondence with the Prince of Wales, and would potentially have undermined his position of political neutrality....my decision is based on my view that the correspondence was undertaken as part of the Prince of Wales's preparation for becoming king. The Prince of Wales engaged in this correspondence with ministers with the expectation that it would be confidential. Disclosure of the correspondence could damage the Prince of Wales's ability to perform his duties when he becomes king.\\" Grieve concluded his justification of his veto by stating that \\"It is a matter of the highest importance within our constitutional framework that the monarch is a politically neutral figure able to engage in confidence with the government of the day, whatever its political colour.\\" Grieve also said that any perception that Charles had disagreed with Blair's government \\"would be seriously damaging to his role as future monarch because, if he forfeits his position of political neutrality as heir to the throne, he cannot easily recover it when he is king\\". The Guardian announced its intention to challenge the attorney general's veto in the High Court of Justice. =2013: The Guardians legal challenge dismissed= The Guardians challenge to the attorney general's veto in the High Court was dismissed by the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Judge, accompanied by Lord Justice Davis and Justice Globe in July 2013. Lord Judge found the attorney general had acted in the public interest in a \\"proper and rational way\\". The ability of government ministers to issue a veto under the FoI act and override a decision that had been reached by judges raised \\"troublesome concerns\\" for Lord Judge. The veto means that potentially a ruling by the Supreme Court could be overridden. This legal situation was described by Lord Judge as a \\"'constitutional aberration\\". Lord Judge wrote that barristers could find no equivalent in any other British law, and that it was \\"an understatement to describe the situation as unusual\\". Lord Judge added that the necessary safeguards for the constitutionality of the process were guaranteed by the ability to challenge the ministerial override in court. The Guardian announced its decision to appeal against the High Court's decision. =2014: Appeal court rules attorney general's decision unlawful= In March 2014, the three judges of the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, under the Master of the Rolls, Lord Dyson, heard The Guardians appeal against the High Court decision, and ruled that the attorney general's 2012 decision to block the publication of the letters was unlawful. The court ruled that the attorney general's veto on the letters publication should be quashed as Grieve had \\"no good reason\\" for overriding the Upper Tribunal's decision and that Grieve had acted in a way incompatible with European law. Lord Dyson said that Grieve had \\"no good reason for overriding the meticulous decision of the Upper Tribunal reached after six days of hearing and argument\\", adding that Grieve \\"could point to no error of law or fact in the [tribunal's] decision and the government departments concerned did not even seek permission to appeal it.\\" In addition, Lord Dyson ruled that Grieve's veto was unlawful under European Commission law. Grieve was also ordered at the appeal to pay The Guardians legal costs of ¬£96,000. The government also delayed disclosure of amount of money spent on legal proceedings in their attempts to resist publication of the letters. Grieve announced his decision to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court, with his spokesperson saying that he was appealing to \\"protect the important principles which are at stake in this case... [his] argument is that it is better to pretend Charles is impartial than to prove he is not.\\" Following the judgement, the editor of The Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, said that Charles was a \\"powerful person\\" who should be \\"above politics\\". Rusbridger said that \\"...if the Prince of Wales is going to try and influence public policy in a particularly frank way then I don't think he is acting as a private citizen and therefore like any other lobby group there ought to be transparency about what he's trying to do.\\" =2014: Supreme Court hearing= The Supreme Court heard the case on the black spider memos on 24 and 25 November 2014, before Lord Neuberger and six other senior judges. On the first day of the hearing, James Eadie QC, acting for the government, said that it had been acceptable for the attorney general to veto the Upper Tribunal's (UT) decision, stating that \\"It is clear that parliament decided...that the highest level of government should be permitted to have the final say as to whether information, the disclosure of which it considered to be damaging to the public interest, should be disclosed.\\" Eadie said that parliament had given the attorney general the power to override rulings by the UT \\"to protect the public interest where real and significant issues arise\\". On the second day of the hearing, Dinah Rose QC, acting for The Guardian, said that in contrast to the UT, Grieve was \\"...neither independent nor impartial but is a member of the government which is seeking to prevent disclosure of the documents. He has not conducted any hearing, or heard representations by [The Guardian].\\" Additionally Grieve had not identified any error by the UT and had simply disagreed with its conclusions for \\"...reasons which had already been advanced by the government departments, considered and rejected by the tribunal.\\" Rose said that Grieve's use of the veto \\"significantly undermines the rule of law and the principle of the separation of powers\\". =2015: Supreme Court verdict and publication= The Supreme Court dismissed the Attorney General's appeal on 26 March, and by a majority of 5 to 2 'considered that the Attorney General was not entitled to issue a certificate under section 53 of FOIA'. Clarence House expressed disappointment. The letters were subsequently published by the Cabinet Office on 13 May 2015. Reception The reception of the memos met with little criticism, and public support for the Prince of Wales. Dina Spector of Business Insider called the publication of the memos \\"underwhelming\\" and gave three reasons why Britain would feel the same way. According to her, firstly, Charles and his staff were reportedly \\"sanguine\\" about the decision to publish the letters and there were claims by those who had read the letters that they were mostly harmless. Additionally, even if they did contain some damaging material, the letters would be published with some redactions to avoid naming third parties. Furthermore, fewer than 10 of the 27 published letters were personally authored by Charles and all of them are typed out rather than handwritten in the \\"black spider\\" handwriting. Historian Andrew Roberts wrote in The Daily Telegraph that the publication of Charles' letters \\"backfired on those who seek to belittle him, and revealed the idiocy of the human rights industry\\". Roberts further felt the memos exposed Charles' \\"passion and dignity\\". Simon Jenkins of The Guardian wrote: \\"The black spiders are harmless creatures compared with the multimillion-pound tarantulas of big-time political pressure, uncharted and undisclosed.\\" An editorial in The Guardian stated that \\"The letters show that behind that curtain, most of the time, Prince Charles behaves more as a bit of a bore on behalf of his good causes than as any sort of wannabe feudal tyrant.\\" Clarence House issued a statement defending Charles, saying that he cared deeply about the country and had tried to use his unique position to help others. Furthermore, it stated that he had raised issues of public concern, and tried to find practical ways to address them. It also defended Charles' right to communicate privately stating that the publication of his letters \\"inhibits his ability to express the concerns and suggestions\\" put forward to him by people at meetings and engagements.

Background The Donselaar family had a long running family dispute, culminating in John Donselaar trespassing on his brother Andrew's property. Not happy with his brother's trespass, Andrew hit his brother over the head with a hammer. As a result, John sued Andrew for damages for this assault. As section 5 of the Accident Compensation Act [1972] prohibits suing for damages for physical injury, John sued for exemplary damages for the hammer attack. Decision The court ruled that the Accident Compensation Act [1972] did not prohibit damages for exemplary damages. However the court rules that it was the conduct of the defendant was the deciding factor on whether special punishment of exemplary damages should be awarded, and not the nature of the plaintiff's injury. Which was unfortunate for the plaintiff here, as the court referred to him here as the \\"principal irritant\\", as amongst other things, he was trespassing at the time of the assault, and as a result, the court declined to make an award for exemplary damages to the plaintiff.

In STEP, by making cuts in the intestine and creating a zigzag pattern, surgeons lengthen the amount of bowel available to absorb nutrients. The procedure was first performed in 2003 and more than 100 patients had undergone the surgery by 2013. Background Necrotizing enterocolitis, a potential cause of SBS Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is the condition in which a patient cannot absorb adequate nutrients because a portion of the small intestine is damaged or absent. SBS commonly affects pediatric patients who have undergone surgery, such as premature infants with necrotizing enterocolitis and infants with gastrointestinal defects such as gastroschisis. In adults, Crohn's disease is a possible cause of SBS. If they are unable to absorb nutrients in the gut, patients must be given parenteral nutrition (PN) intravenously, but long-term PN can be associated with liver failure. History The procedure was studied by researchers in Boston utilizing a group of ten young pigs. Five of the pigs underwent removal of 90 percent of the bowel followed by STEP. The other pigs underwent the bowel resection without the STEP procedure, serving as control subjects. STEP was shown to lengthen the bowel from 105.2 ¬± 7.7 cm to 152.2 ¬± 8.3 cm. STEP was first performed on a human patient, a two-year-old who had been born with gastroschisis, in 2003. By 2010, it had been utilized by more than 20 hospitals, mostly in the United States.\\"Serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP) for patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS).\\" Horizon Scanning in Surgery: Application to Surgical Education and Practice. American College of Surgeons, December 2010. In addition to its use in treating SBS, STEP has been utilized to treat bacterial overgrowth in a dilated bowel loop and to prevent SBS upon the initial repair of certain types of intestinal atresia. In 2004, the International Serial Transverse Enteroplasty (STEP) Data Registry was created to serve as an online database to study outcomes following STEP. By 2013, 111 patients had been entered into the database, though 14 had been lost to follow-up. At that time, 11 patients had died and five had received intestinal transplants. 47% had attained enteral autonomy (sufficient bowel function). Pre-STEP bowel length was found to be inversely proportional to the likelihood of transplant or death. Pre-STEP direct bilirubin levels were found to be proportional to the likelihood of transplant or death. Procedure In STEP, the bowel is dilated and then partially transected (cut) at certain points, creating a zigzag pattern to the bowel that results in lengthening of the surface area available for digestion. Longitudinal intestinal lengthening and tapering (LILT), also known as the Bianchi procedure, is a surgical alternative to STEP. LILT and STEP have similar outcomes. With each procedure, more than half of patients gain the ability to absorb sufficient nutrients in the intestine. A single-center study compared STEP and LILT, reporting fewer complications with LILT.

(WWR), is an explorer and developer of US-based mineral resources essential to clean energy production. The company has operated some uranium facilities in the past, however they have recently been exploring lithium and graphite, anticipating a rise in demand of battery related materials due to accelerating electric vehicle production. Company History In 1977, the company was founded in Southern Texas solely operating in uranium. In 2003, the company proposed to mine in traditional Navajo territory. In 2012, the EPA was considering a permit for the Church Rock mine, which had a large uranium spill contaminating the Puerco River and washing downstream to the Navajo Nation in 1979 when it was owned by the United Nuclear Corporation.The Church Rock Uranium Mill Tailings Spill, Environmental Protection Agency, 1983 An online petition received over 15,000 supporters standing against the re-permitting of the Church Rock mine. On April 8, 2016, the company sold its subsidiary, Hydro Resources, Inc. (which holds the Church Rock and Crownpoint uranium properties in New Mexico) to Laramide Resources, Ltd. In August 2012, the company merged with Neutron Energy, Inc. In August 2017, the company changed its name from Uranium Resources to Westwater Resources, Inc. The company previously traded under the ticker symbol URRE. Westwater Resources acquired Alabama Graphite Corp. in April 2018. Uranium The company owns uranium properties in South Texas, where they have two licensed in-situ recovery processing facilities: Kingsville Dome near Kingsville, Texas and Rosita. The company also has of mineral holdings in New Mexico, where they hold a NRC license to produce up to of uranium annually. The mineral properties in New Mexico have not undergone development. It's estimated that the mineral claims in New Mexico contains more than one hundred million pounds U3O8 of in-place mineralised uranium material.https://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/companyProfile?rpc=66&symbol;=URRE.O In 1985, the United States Department of Energy's contracts for the purchase of uranium thrown out by a United States district court, in favor of the company. Production ceased in 2009 after the fall of uranium prices, and has remained idled following the wake of the April 2011 Fukushima earthquake. However, with 50 nuclear reactors currently under construction worldwide, a sustained rise in uranium prices could make these facilities economically viable in the future. Since 2007, Westwater Resources has invested in the exploration and development of its uranium projects in Turkey, namely in Temrezli and Sefaatli. Unfortunately, the government of Turkey is upholding that all permits granted to the company for Uranium exploration were \\"issued by mistake.\\" Experts have estimated that the Temrezli mine alone would generate revenues of up to $644 million over its life, resulting in a net ROI of $267 million. However, after repeated attempts to make contact with the Turkish government, the company filed a request for arbitration with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) as a result of Turkey's unlawful actions. Their request was registered, and as of May 1, 2019, a three-member ICSID panel was formed. The proceedings will take place in Washington, DC. On Monday, January 27, 2020, Westwater, the claimant, filed a Memorial on the merits of their case to the panel. The Republic of Turkey must move to bifurcate the proceedings by March 9, 2020, or alternatively, file a counter-Memorial by June 15, 2020. The first hearing will be sometime between March and September, in 2021, depending on how the case progresses. Lithium In 2016, the company was able to obtain over 30,000 acres of lithium brine properties, including the Sal Rica Project in Utah and the Columbus Salt Marsh (or Columbus Basin) project in Nevada (near Tesla's Gigafactory). Values ranging from 60 to 170 ppm were common across all three properties, although some anomaly-type samples indicated up to 392 parts per million of lithium concentrations. However, the company currently only has mineral and water rights for their Columbus Basin project (14,220 acres). Graphite In early to mid 2018, Westwater Resources completed the acquisition of Alabama Graphite. Part of that acquisition included the Coosa Graphite Project, held under a long-term lease. It lies about 25 miles southwest of Sylacauga, Alabama and covers 41,900 acres of land at the southern end of the Appalachian mountain range. As of September 2018, Westwater successfully produced approximately 4 kg of battery grade graphite. Since then, Westwater has received a request for from an undisclosed battery manufacturer for one metric tonne of purified micronized graphite for further testing. To meet this request, as well as any others that may come in the future, the Company has decided to outsource their natural flake graphite until Westwater's Coosa Graphite Mine is permitted and operational. The Company anticipates a full scale mining rate of 577,000 short tons per year, at an average grade of 3.2% graphite. Westwater plans to use bulldozers, excavators, loading equipment, and 45-ton haul trucks to bring the material to the processing plant, by which point they will have replaced the outsourced graphite supply with their own. Once at the processing plant, the metallurgical process of flotation processing will be employed to remove impurities, without damaging the graphite flakes. From there, the graphite will go through multiple rod and ball mill grinders as well as additional flotation units. As for turning the natural flake graphite into a battery- ready product, Westwater Resources has turned Dorfner Anzaplan (based in Hirschau, Germany) to define the method, equipment, and operating parameters for graphite purification to the 99.95% threshold. On November 25, 2019, Dr. Reiner Haus, Managing director of Dorfner Anzaplan said, ‚ÄúWe are pleased to provide our expertise to the most advanced natural flake graphite project in the United States and bring the project to the next level. Participating in the development processes of Westwater Resources‚Äô Coosa Graphite Project is a privilege.‚Äù One potentially lucrative aspect of the Coosa Graphite project is that that graphite has been declared a critical strategic mineral by the Department of Defense contractors. Whenever possible, the US military is legally required to use US sourced materials. Therefore, the company has a strong chance of attracting those contractors as customers.

He was a businessman before he was ordained a priest. Since 2014 he has served as the fifth bishop of the Diocese of Pueblo in the state of Colorado. Early life and education Stephen Berg was born the eldest of ten children to Connie and Jeanne Berg in Miles City, Montana. He was educated in the local Catholic schools and graduated from Sacred Heart High School. He earned a bachelor of music degree from the University of Colorado and a master of music degree from Eastern New Mexico University. Berg taught music at Tarrant County College in Fort Worth, Texas and worked in the retail nursery industry for 14 years. He started studies for the priesthood at Assumption Seminary in San Antonio and completed a master of divinity degree at the Oblate School of Theology also in San Antonio.

He was installed as its president on October 24, 1946, and served until his retirement in 1969. Yochum was born on June 7, 1903 in Fostoria, Ohio. to William H. Yochum and Ida (Heiserman).Biographical Directory of Clergymen of The American Lutheran Church, Augsburg Publishing House 1972 (p. 1020) After graduating from Capital University in 1923 and then earning a master's degree from Ohio State University in 1924, he became a teacher and high school principal in Attica, Ohio, from 1924 to 1925. From 1925 to 1928 he taught Latin and English at Capital University. He obtained his Bachelor of Divinity degree from the Evangelical Lutheran Theological Seminary in Columbus, Ohio, in 1928. In 1943, he obtained his Doctor of Divinity degree from Capital University. He served as pastor of Emmanuel Lutheran Church in Hessville, Ohio, from 1928 to 1934 and pastor of Holy Trinity Lutheran Church in Detroit, Michigan, from 1934 to 1939. He was also a former president of the Michigan District of the American Lutheran Church (ALC) from 1937 to 1946. Yochum was elected Vice President of the ALC, a commissioner to the National Lutheran Council, and president of the American Lutheran Conference. He wrote extensively for the church papers and published two books of sermons. Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters degrees were awarded from Central State College (1959), Pacific Lutheran University (1960), Denison University (1969), and Ashland College (1970). In August 1948, Yochum was appointed a delegate of the American Lutheran Church to the World Council of Churches in Amsterdam, where his travels included England, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Germany. The board of regents provided trips for him and his wife to Europe in the summer of 1962 accompanying the chapel choir, and in 1966, to the Holy Land to celebrate his twentieth year of service to the university as president. In June 1967, the Yochums journeyed to Europe to celebrate the 450th anniversary of the Reformation. They traveled to Eisleben, Wittenberg, and the Wartburg Castle, and on to Athens, Corinth, and Ephesus. On July 5, 1928, he married Agatha Amelia Pfeiffer and subsequently had three daughters: Doris, Marilyn and Faith. In the summers they enjoyed being at the family cottage, Cedar Haven, in the Les Cheneaux Islands of northern Michigan. Yochum died on September 1, 1974, in Columbus, Ohio.

It was produced in the 1980s, and had an operational range of at least 780.5 km. History During the 1980s, due to expenses, then-modern Smerch MLRS and late-variant Tochka-U tactical ballistic missile systems could not be purchased for the Bulgarian People's Army, so the development of a Bulgarian cruise missile began. The development was initiated at the Institute for defense research at G. S. Rakovski National Defence Academy (which is state owned and still holds the blueprints/schematics/production instruction/design of the missile), the project was code named \\"wild dream\\", and was being carried out by a team led by Prof. Evgeny Gindev, who was at the time the manager of the institute. The missile was designated Bulgarian fire. The missiles were likely produced in VMZ Sopot (it is classified where most locally produced missiles in use with the Bulgarian People's Army were produced, with a possibility that parts may have also been produced in Samel 90 factories which are privatized, though it is unlikely because far more missile technology is produced at VMZ Sopot which has far greater technological capabilities when it comes to missile manufacturing) (which is still mostly state owned)(the reason why it does not show up as an export option with VMZ-Sopot may be because of its use of a prohibited warhead and termination of project after 1990) so production for the missile is still possible. =Characteristics= The missile has a range of at least 780.5 km (given the fact that it was almost used in an operation to hit Ankara, and this is the distance between the Bulgarian border and Ankara), and uses the VSU-10 engine. It is a medium-range supersonic missile, but could possibly be long-range. The missile primarily used a Thermobaric warhead which was apparently capable of engulfing the entire Istanbul in flames (the explosive radius would not necessarily need to be large, but the incendiary factor makes it so that the fire from the explosion could be carried throughout the city) (but also had the ability to carry a small Soviet-made nuclear warhead). Operational use The missile had entered service by 1989 and had a range of at least 780.5 km as that is the distance between the Bulgarian border and Ankara, the operation where the missile was utilized being intended to destroy Ankara with strategic rockets, and no other surface to surface rocket was taken along for the operation. The missile was deployed during the Bulgarian- Turkish border crisis of June 1989 (also known as \\"Operation Han Tervel\\") when a 736-man-strong group of soldiers was sent to the Bulgarian-Turkish border to respond to threats being made that the Turkish army would enter Sofia. These soldiers were armed with highly advanced Soviet made S-300 SAM systems and Bulgarian produced ‚ÄúBulgarian Fire‚Äù cruise missile systems(which were stationed in Sliven and Kotel in hidden bunkers referred to as ‚Äúdungeons‚Äù (by Bulgarian People's Army intelligence) before being sent out to the Turkish border). The cruise missile launch steps were raised from \\"false\\" and brought up to \\"warming up\\" (literal translation of launch phase titles in Bulgarian). The \\"Bulgarian Fire\\" cruise missiles were likely withdrawn from service in 1990 possibly due to the fact that the conventional warheads used in the missile were incendiary warheads (which were apparently capable of engulfing the entire area of Istanbul in flames, and the use of these kinds of weapons in a populated area are prohibited) and were considered incendiary weapons (many Warsaw pact countries signed treaties that they did not abide until the fall of socialism, such as chemical and biological weapons treaties that Bulgaria signed and ratified during socialism but refused to abide until the fall of socialism, this was the case here, where Bulgaria ratified the Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Incendiary Weapons on 15.10.1982 but did not abide it until socialism officially stopped being the economic system of Bulgaria in 1990).

The park urban planning release date is May the forth, 1956, designed number is no. 71, Zhongzheng. In 1964, the park finished and open to the public. Due to the location is just beside the Jieshou Road (now is Ketagalan Boulevard), so the park was named Jieshou park. The name of the park Jieshou means celebrating Chiang Kai-shek birthday in Mandarin, which the officials want to please the president Chiang Kai-shek. When the park open to the public, the city official held a Chrysanthemum exhibition for one week. In 1968, the former President of Republic of China Lin Sen was 100 years birthday, the authorities decided to place Lin Sen statue in Jieshou park for celebration. They use the foundation of the Governor-General of Taiwan Kabayama Sukenori statue for displaying Lin Sen Statue.

It originally aired on March 20, 2014 on NBC. The episode was written by Matt Roller, and directed by Joe Russo. The episode marked the series writing debut of Roller and the final episode directed by Russo. Critics gave the episode generally positive reviews, praising the exceptional sound design and action sequences that helped evoke a fantasy world. The episode received a 1.1/4 in the 18-49 rating/share, increasing slightly from the week before. 3.32 million American viewers watched this episode, increasing from the previous week's audience of 2.77 million viewers. Plot At a Save Greendale committee meeting, Professor Hickey (Jonathan Banks) learns that he was not invited to his 3-year-old grandson's birthday party. Hickey becomes irate that his son, Hank Hickey (David Cross), continues to limit visiting time with his grandson, while spending all his time playing the role-playing game, Dungeons & Dragons. The group then decides to help father and son reunite through a rousing game of Dungeons & Dragons. The group and a reluctant Hank meet at Abed's (Danny Pudi) apartment, where Abed reprises his role as the Dungeon Master. Abed describes the eight adventurers arriving in the troubled realm of Galindor, where they must vanquish an evil Necromancer who rules in a dark tower across a bridge. Hank, seeing through the group's contrived plan to reconcile father and son, mixes and redistributes each character's sheet. His character is now Tristram Steelheart, a Holy Cleric; Hickey is named Tiny Nuggins, a Halfling Thief; Britta (Gillian Jacobs) is Fibrosis, a Ranger; Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) is Crouton, a Half-orc Druid; Annie (Alison Brie) reprises her role as Hector the Well Endowed; Chang (Ken Jeong) is a Troll named Dingleberry; and Jeff (Joel McHale) is Sir Riggs Diehard, much to the delight of Dean Pelton (Jim Rash), who is his son, Joseph Gordon Diehard. Hank rejects the group‚Äôs given mission and decides to head South instead. Annie attempts to lift Hank and carry him to the bridge, but Hank casts a fire spell in self-defense, dealing damage to Annie and also setting the bridge's rope supports on fire. The bridge is unable to hold the weight of the party and they plummet into a raging river below, splitting the group apart with Jeff, Hickey, Shirley, and Annie washing up on the left fork of Skull river, and the remaining party on the right. Hank threatens to quit. To prevent Hank from quitting the game, Hickey wagers that if he kills the Necromancer first, he is allowed to come to his grandson's birthday. Hank accepts, stating that if he wins Hickey will not go to the family's Christmas or Thanksgiving. The parties then go into separate rooms. After being washed ashore, Hickey's impatience and new-found motivation to win the game leads him to delve into the neighboring jungle alone, encountering a hostile patrol of Hobgoblins. Shirley, Jeff, and Annie follow while the Hobgoblins, alerted to Hickey's presence, charge at him with spears. Shirley uses a spell to entangle four of the charging Hobgoblins. The two remaining Hobgoblins, however, fire arrows at Crouton, fatally wounding her. Shirley blames her character's death on Hickey and leaves the apartment. Hickey's group follows the fleeing Hobgoblins to the Gob Shack and ambush them, taking two alive. Hickey interrogates the two Hobgoblins, both of whom are played by Abed. Hickey manages to wear down their resolve and one of the Hobgoblins confesses the location of the Black Tower. Meanwhile, Hank casts a healing spell on Fibrosis, attempting to coax her into helping him. He reveals that he resents his father because he was absent during his birthdays. Hank's party then encounters giant, flying, Sky-spiders. Hank casts a spell to speak with the spiders and successfully achieves a non- combative resolution. The sky spiders fly his party closer and give them directions to the Tower. Both parties simultaneously arrive at the Black Tower and attempt to intimidate the other party into yielding. An emotional Dean attempts to defect so that he can reunite with his father, Jeff, who draws his sword. The Dean nevertheless approaches to hug Jeff and impales himself on Jeff's sword. The Dean's death breaks the standoff. The parties decimate each other in a combination of spells, sword-fighting, and Chang's loud, confused Troll noises, with only Hank and Hickey surviving the melee. Hank and Hickey enter the Tower while still fighting each other, reaching the Necromancer's workshop. The Necromancer, however, has fled while the parties spent an hour fighting over who gets to kill him. Hank and Hickey complain to Abed over the lack of a resolution, but Abed says it is their own fault for delaying the battle by infighting. Continuing to fight with each other, Hank and Hickey attempt to divide the Necromancer's loot before following him out of the Black Tower. With only the two of them remaining in the game to work together, Jeff and the group leave the apartment saying \\"that's the best most fathers and sons can do.\\" The end-credits scene shows Abed angrily Dungeon-Mastering a game among four of Annie's stuffed animals. The implication is that Abed is attempting to confront his grief of Troy's loss by proxy as the fluffy adventurers arrive at the Chamber of Grief. Cultural references The episode used the popular role-playing game, Dungeons & Dragons, to drive its plot. It borrowed heavily from its lore, characters, and creatures as in the first installment where the group played D&D; to save Fat Neil's life. The Dean's character, Joseph Gordon Diehard, is an homage to Joseph Gordon- Levitt's portrayal of a younger Bruce Willis in the film, Looper. The character is also an homage to the film, Die Hard starring Bruce Willis, which is often referenced in the series. Likewise, the character of Sir Riggs Diehard is a dual reference to both Lethal Weapon and Willis. The Elvish song sung by Hank spoofs a similar song sung in the first installment in The Hobbit trilogy. Hank's spamming of the \\"lightning bolt\\" spell during the ultimate battle parodied the viral video of a live-action role-playing game battle (LARP) from 2005. Reception =Ratings= Upon airing, the episode was watched by 3.32 million American viewers, receiving a 1.1/4 in the 18-49 rating/share. The show placed fourth out of fifth in its time slot, behind Hell's Kitchen, the 2014 NCAA Basketball Tournament, and Once Upon a Time in Wonderland; and ninth out of thirteenth for the night. =Critical reception= The episode received generally positive reviews but was considered a less-than-worthy sequel to its predecessor, \\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\\". Emily Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club rated the episode at a \\"B+,\\" writing how this episode had a \\"high hurdle to clear\\" because of the standard set in the original when it demonstrated how the show does everything it does well. VanDerWerff wrote how the episode \\"sort-of\\" measured up to the original and criticized how the episode struggled to wrap up the story. Despite her reservations, she wrote how the episode worked even in spite of these flaws because it was fun to see all the characters playing the game together. She criticized how the conflict between Hank and Hickey felt generic and given less weight when compared to the previous vital conflict between Pierce and saving Fat Neil's life. He praised the casting of David Cross (Arrested Development, Mr. Show with Bob and David) as Hickey's son, Hank, and said he liked \\"the idea [of] having the two of them in the same room ‚Äî even if they couldn‚Äôt stand each other ‚Äî talking through their issues via the proxy of the game.\\" She also praised the interrogation sequence between Hickey and the Hobgoblins (giving a taste of how Hickey operated as a cop) and praised the sound effects and camera movements that depicted the action in the game. Ultimately, she concluded that the \\"first D&D; episode was much better at telling a compelling story about these characters and what they went through to save someone who wasn‚Äôt even one of their own.\\" Rather, this episode \\"was better at capturing the feel of what it‚Äôs like to gather with friends and roll some dice, then laugh about how much fun something so silly can be.\\" Joe Matar of Den of Geek gave the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars, saying how it was \\"an unabashed redux [of the original], taking the same basic premise of having the characters sit around and play a D&D; game that happens to be a framework for healing real emotional issues.\\" He wrote how this installment did not compare as well because the stakes were lower, the characters didn't feel well defined, and there was no villain. Matar criticized the basic premise of the sequel: > \\"When the game was being played for Fat Neil, it was obviously a very grave > situation: Neil might be suicidal. Furthermore, it was tied heavily back to > one of our main characters, Jeff, who inadvertently coined the 'Fat Neil' > nickname and therefore felt tangentially responsible for Neil‚Äôs suicidal > tendencies. The trouble with Neil was introduced in the episode in such a > way that it felt like this D&D; game was an absolute necessity to avert a > tragedy. Here, the group just forces the game into being when they learn > that Hank is into Dungeons & Dragons. To use a Home Alone analogy (proven to > be the most effective of all analogy types), it‚Äôs like how in the first Home > Alone, Kevin had no choice but to protect his house, but in Home Alone 2: > Lost in New York, he went out of his way to lure the robbers into a house of > traps. The premise is shoehorned into working rather than organically > feeling like the right thing to do.\\" Matar wrote how Hickey being prevented from spending time with his grandson \\"doesn‚Äôt quite work because the problems between Hank and Buzz feel vague and undefined.\\" In the first installment, Matar wrote, the character traits (like Britta's liberalism) of each member shone through. Here, only Hickey's interrogation sequence and Abed's proclivities to act out characters in his universe were displayed, while Shirley was killed off quickly and David Cross was underused. Despite this pronouncement, Matar praised Jim Rash's performance, saying that \\"his death scene is almost irrefutably the best bit of the episode.\\" He also praised the episode for mixing up the setting. Matar wrote, however, that the lack of a strong villain like Pierce was a severe shortcoming: > \\"Everybody always hated on Pierce during Season 2 when he was at the height > of his dickishness, but I absolutely loved how well the character functioned > as a villain, and his role in the original D&D; episode was a lynchpin in > how awesome that episode ended up being. Of course, it‚Äôs both wise and > completely necessary that 'Advanced Advanced Dungeons & Dragons' doesn‚Äôt > have the same exact setup. There‚Äôs no clear villain and, almost from the > start, everyone‚Äôs divided into two factions and two separate rooms.\\" Brian Collins of Badass Digest starts by saying he was disappointed with the episode \\"aping one of the series' best\\" but then qualified his criticism by saying Dan Harmon undertook this sequel as a \\"fuck you\\" to NBC, who hated the original episode in Season 2. Collins recounts Harmon's interview in Rolling Stone where Harmon \\"admits that the episode was not organic, difficult to write, and it would be all his fault if it was the worst episode ever.\\" Despite this qualification, Collins said how this episode \\"never really gelled\\" for him. He initially praised the episode for delivering on enough laughs, but said the lack of a real conflict and a lukewarm resolution soured the episode for him. He said the stakes were not high enough when compared to the original, and found it difficult to become invested in a vague conflict between Hickey and his son. Unlike many other reviews, Collins was not amused by the Dean and Jeff's subplot saying it was \\"rather annoying\\" where the Dean \\"takes his role as Jeff's son a bit too seriously.\\" He calls the Hickey interrogation of an NPC as a \\"fun bit,\\" hedging that statement by saying that \\"scattered moments aren't enough to overcome the fact that the episode has no reason to exist beyond 'let's do D&D; again.'\\" Despite his harsh treatment of the episode, Collins said that the episode \\"LOOKS good,\\" praising the direction of Joe Russo, who infused the battle \\"scenes some much needed energy, with his soaring and oft-moving camera giving us a few peeks at previously unseen areas at their apartment.\\" Sarah Shachat from Screen Crave rated the episode 8 out of 10, praising Joe Russo's direction at expertly angling dramatic shots to \\"evoke the sense of imagining a fantasy world.\\" She wrote how the camera shots contributed to the humor, especially in the interrogation scene where \\"different angles [were] used as Hickey interrogates the hobgoblins (both played by Abed by oddly splitting his lip).\\" Shachat lauded the literary device of splitting-up the parties, facilitating competition, homing in \\"on the father/son motivations and issues for that race.\\" She \\"loved how completely Jim Rash committed to his filial devotion, and his dreamy sequence of trying to contact his lost father via sparrow was a great interlude. The pile of failed notes sitting in Abed‚Äôs trashcan made the gag too.\\" Her main criticisms came at the premise of the episode, i.e., the conflict between Hank and Hickey, which she called \\"generic.\\" Shachat also criticized the abrupt resolution of the episode, but concluded that the show \\"put together another convivial roleplaying quest.\\" Eric Goldman from IGN rated the episode 8.5 out of 10, saying it was a \\"solid sequel that delivers plenty of great entertainment, even if it can‚Äôt quite mach [sic] the heights of its predecessor.\\" Goldman applauded Jim Rash's performance saying there \\"were some clear standouts though, including Dean Pelton, who was oh-so eager to embrace his role as Jeff‚Äôs son in the game ('FATHER!') in increasingly amusing ways. Jim Rash was hysterical showing all the different ways the Dean got into character and I loved his earnest 'Me too!' response to Buzz‚Äôs son‚Äôs sarcastic comment about loving being told exactly what to do while role- playing.\\" He also praised the interrogation sequence where \\"Buzz interrogated the two different hobgoblins (both Abed, naturally)...as we cut back and forth between the two angles of Abed, as Buzz‚Äôs tough cop persona broke his 'prisoners.'\\" He also praised the direction of Joe Russo, as well as the sound FX throughout, which he said was \\"incredibly well-timed.\\" Ultimately he tempered his praise by saying that although this was a really funny episode of Community, the first D&D; episode was a classic: > \\"Perhaps inevitably, it was hard not to recall what an emotionally powerful > place the first D&D; episode went to and find this somewhat lacking by > comparison.

Heins discusses the case of Nancy Richardson, dean of student affairs at the Boston University School of Theology, who was removed from her position by the school's administration in 1981. Heins represented Richardson in an unsuccessful lawsuit against Boston University for wrongful termination and sexism. Cutting the Mustard recounts the case, interspersing reflections on the lawsuit with a discussion of relevant case law, decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States related to affirmative action and multiple criticisms of contradictory court decisions in affirmative-action cases. The book was positively received by the Harvard Law Review which recommended From Midterms to Ministry for further information. It was also reviewed by the Women's Review of Books, Women's Rights Law Reporter and California Lawyer. A review in Library Journal by a Harvard Law School librarian criticized the book for lacking a substantive analysis of the case. Background Heins at a 2009 National Coalition Against Censorship event Marjorie Heins is an attorney with a focus on civil liberties. She received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Cornell University in 1967 and graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, receiving her juris doctor degree in 1978. Before Cutting the Mustard, Heins' book Strictly Ghetto Property: The Story of Los Siete de la Raza was published in 1972. Cutting the Mustard: Affirmative Action and the Nature of Excellence was first published in 1987. Content summary Cutting the Mustard describes an unsuccessful case in which the author was involved as an attorney. Boston University School of Theology dean of student affairs Nancy Richardson was removed from her position by the school's administration in 1981. Heins (at the time, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney) represented Richardson in a lawsuit against the school alleging sexism. Richardson and the school had differing views on affirmative action; she supported the concept, opposing the administration's hiring strategy for minority candidates. Heins provides background, including management's failure to hire several key candidates. One was Beverly Harrison, a professor at Union Theological Seminary in New York who was supported by the majority of the school's professors. Boston University President John Silber and nine other faculty members interviewed Harrison for two hours, criticizing her support for feminism. School of Theology dean Richard Nesmith told the school's professors that Harrison's replies to questions from the ten faculty members in her interview were inadequate and she did not \\"cut the mustard\\". After the school did not hire Harrison, Richardson perceived a lack of support by school administration for women and minority faculty candidates. Associate Dean Nelle Slater was fired by Nesmith, who explained that the two did not \\"dance well\\". Silber vetoed the appointment of Stephen Brech Reid, an African American academic supported by professors at the School of Theology. Nesmith and Silber then created a faculty position for white male sociologist Peter L. Berger, requesting input from students and professors (satisfying affirmative-action requirements) after deciding to give the job to Berger. Silber and Nesmith, who felt that affirmative action would lower academic hiring standards, triggered strife among students and faculty (including then-dean of students Nancy Richardson) at the School of Theology. Their opponents believed that affirmative action helped increase equality in a system developed by white men. Richardson advocated affirmative action to Nesmith, arguing that it would not lower academic standards and the school's administration should reexamine its assumptions about race, women and minorities. Richardson was fired in 1981, with Nesmith attributing her termination to \\"pedagogical and ideological differences\\" with the administration. Richardson sued, claiming discrimination by Boston University. Heins provides a background of precedent established by prior cases (some of which contradict each other), interspersed with discussions of Supreme Court decisions concerning affirmative action. =Minority student admissions= Heins discusses the Supreme Court case Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, a landmark on affirmative action for minority students in university and college admissions. The case (decided in 1978) upheld affirmative action in the admission of minority students as one of several factors to consider, not the primary one. In the lawsuit, the affirmative-action standards at UC Davis School of Medicine were challenged; the school had a policy of holding 16 out of 100 slots for minorities in the incoming class of students, regardless of qualification. Potential student Allan Bakke, a qualified white applicant, challenged the practice after he was rejected by the school. In an opinion written by Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., the court ruled against racial quotas at the school while allowing minority status to remain one of several criteria in the admissions process. =Minority hiring= The author contrasts Regents of the University of California v. Bakke with the Supreme Court's 1971 decision in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., which ruled that employers did not have to willfully discriminate against employees to violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote that certain standardized tests given by employers could be discriminatory, even if that was not the employer's intent. Another case discussed by Heins is the 1980 Supreme Court decision in Fullilove v. Klutznick, wherein the court ruled constitutional a federal law requiring a percentage of funds for a building project to be used for minority workers. =Sexual discrimination= The final Supreme Court cases discussed by Heins include the 1987 ruling in City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co. and the court's 1988 opinion in Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust. The former was ruled unconstitutional as an affirmative-action structure in a business to support female employees, a decision with which Heins disagreed. Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust followed that decision, finding that subjective employee analysis is subject to bias and requiring an explanation from the employer of how such analysis directly relates to job performance. =Heins' verdict= After discussing Supreme Court precedent, Heins recounts the jury verdict which decided against her client by ruling that Richardson's firing was not illegal. Heins describes the trial chronologically, including the evidentiary process and testimony by witnesses. The jury's decision is examined; it found that Richardson sincerely believed that her school's administration practiced employment discrimination, and her criticism was made in good faith. However, the jury also determined that the administration did not fire Richardson because of this criticism. Heins critiques the compromise decision, contending that it reflects the bias of individual jurors rather than an interpretation of the law as applied to Richardson's firing by the school's administration. In post-trial interviews, the jurors explained they felt that it was the duty of employees (such as Richardson) respect their superiors and Nesmith was one such superior in his capacity as dean of the school of theology. Reception The Harvard Law Review said, \\"In this timely book, the author uses her experiences in that trial to examine issues that still vex university faculties and presidents\\" (including academic qualifications for a position). In the Tennessee Law Review Stephanie A. Levin wrote that Cutting the Mustard provided \\"a disturbing look at how ... standards are wielded to enforce conformity in the workplace\\", citing the book in a discussion about nurturing and aggressive values and their respective places in the work environment. The Women's Rights Law Reporter gave the book a generally positive review, saying that its major drawback is an inadequate analysis of the jury's decision in the Richardson case. The review concluded: \\"... Cutting the Mustard succeeds in presenting the debate over affirmative action by questioning traditional assumptions about merit through an absorbing account of personnel decisions at Boston University's School of Theology\\". Although Heins describes Richardson's trial, the reviewer felt that she does not analyze the case in the larger political context. Traci C. West discussed the Richardson case in a section of the book, From Midterms to Ministry, criticizing it for insufficient information about conflicts at Boston University. A review of Cutting the Mustard also appeared in the Women's Review of Books. California Lawyer criticized Heins' objectivity, noting that she did not adequately explain why Richardson's case was lost. In a Library Journal review, Harvard Law School librarian Susan E. Parker wrote that the book was \\"essential for followers of the case, but others [cases] deserve more substantive discussion.\\" See also * Affirmative action in the United States * Fisher v.

They were published in 1826, together with a cycle of love poems called the \\"Odessan Sonnets\\" (Sonety Odeskie), in a collection called \\"Sonnets\\" (Sonety). Importance The Crimean Sonnets is an expression of Mickiewicz's interest in the Orient, shared by many of the students of the University of Vilnius. Involuntarily residing in Russia, Mickiewicz left Odessa and went on a journey, which turned out to be a trek to another world, his first initiation into \\"the East\\". The Crimean Sonnets are romantic descriptions of oriental nature and culture of the East which show the despair of the poet‚Äîa pilgrim, an exile longing for the homeland, driven from his home by a violent enemy. The Crimean Sonnets is considered the first sonnet cycle in Polish literature and a significant example of early romanticism in Poland, which gave rise to the huge popularity of this genre in Poland and inspired many Polish poets of the Romantic era as well as the Young Poland period. The Crimean Sonnets were published in an English translation by Edna Worthley Underwood in 1917. A classic Russian rendition of one of the sonnets belongs to Mikhail Lermontov.

The team changed its traditional colours, moved to Pacasmayo, La Libertad and became a clone of Chavelines Juniors in everything but name. It once again reached the fifth place in the overall table for the year. For 2016, Jean Acevedo Cerna unfused Willy Serrato who then reacquired its old colours but did not move back to Pimentel. It lost the season's first match by walk-over to Sport Victoria but was able to compete in the rest of the tournament which much uncertainty. The club finished 13th, only four points away from relegation. In an effort to distance themselves from the politician Willy Serrato and to gain more popularity with its new home location, the club changed its name to Serrato Pacasmayo on social media in the last months of 2016 and officially in 2017 before the start of the season. Colours and badge Since its foundation, Willy Serrato's colors and badge were very similar to those of the English clubs Manchester City F.C., to the point of including the Premier League and UEFA Champions League badges on the left and right shirt sleeves respectively during the 2013 season. In 2015, the club changed its colours to match those of Sport Chavelines Juniors, who was its owner. For 2016, Willy Serrato used its traditional blue colors but adopted a new badge that represented its new locality. The current badge displays the Pacasmayo Lighthouse which has a black and white checker pattern inside two circles with the words \\"Willy Serrato P.\\" on top and \\"Pacasmayo\\" on bottom between the circles. For 2017 the badge was modified again after the club changed its name. The new badge now reads \\"*SERRATO**PACASMAYO*\\" and \\"2017\\" on a white background. A blue motto of the words \\"Valle Jequetepeque Per√∫\\" was added at the bottom of the badge. Stadium Willy Serrato currently plays its home matches at Estadio Carlos A. Olivares in Pacasmayo, La Libertad, which has a capacity of 2,000 spectators. Supporters The club has many local supporters within the districts of Olmos and Pimentel. One of the biggest organized groups is the Banda D' Willy.

The dissociation of Fus3 from scaffold protein Ste5 results in the switch-like mating decision observed in yeast. During this process, Fus3 competes with a phosphatase Ptc1, attempting to phosphorylate 4 key phosphorylation sites on Ste5. When all 4 sites on Ste5 have been dephosphorylated by Ptc1, Fus3 dissociates from Ste5 and trans locates to the nucleus. One regulator of Fus3 is Ste5. Ste5 causes autophosphorylation of one of two locations modulated by the MAPK kinase Ste7 (the main activator of Fus3). This single phosphorylation causes Fus3 to phosphorylate Ste5 leading to a decrease in signal. However, Ste5 also selectively catalytically unlocks Fus3 for phosphorylation by Ste7. Both the catalytic domain on Ste5 as well as Ste7 must be present in order to activate Fus3, which helps to explain why Fus3 is only activated during the mating pathway, and remains inactive in other situations which use Ste7. When binding to Ste5 is disrupted, Fus3 behaves like its homologue Kss1, and the cells no longer respond to a gradient or mate efficiently with distant partners. Fus3 is activated by Ste7 and its substrates include Ste12, Far1, Bni1, Sst2, Tec1, and Ste5. It can be localized to the cytoplasm, the mating projection tip, the nucleus, and the mitochondrion. Fus3 also serves to phosphorylate repressor proteins Rst1 and Rst1 (Dig1 and Dig2 respectively) which results in promotion of Ste12 dependent transcription of mating-specific genes. It also activates Far1 which goes on to inhibit the cyclins CLN1 and CLN2 leading to cell-cycle arrest.  Kss1  Kss1, a functional homologue of Fus3, is not involved in the production of a shmoo. Kss mutants behave similarly to wild-type yeast cells with respect to their ability to shmoo. It has been shown that while Fus3 and Kss1 are functionally redundant, the substrates of the Fus3 protein may or may not be shared with Kss1. Instead, it has been found that the function of Fus3 is to regulate mating, while the function of Kss1 is to regulate filamentation and invasion. In the absence of Fus3, there can be errors in pathway communication which can result in Kss1 being activated by the mating pheromone. Kss1 does not exhibit the ultrasensitivity that Fus3 does, but instead is activated rapidly and has a graded dose-response profile.  Biological Processes  Fus3 is involved in the following biological processes: *Cell cycle arrest *Invasive growth in response to glucose limitation *Negative regulation of MAPK cascade *Negative regulation of transposition *Pheromone-dependent signal transduction involved in conjugation with cellular fusion *Positive regulation of protein export from the nucleus *Protein phosphorylation The closest human homolog to Fus3 is MAPK1 (ERK2)  References  Category:Cell signaling Category:Protein kinases ","title":"Fus3"},{"id":"42263309","text":"Edward Samuel Briggs (born October 4, 1926) is a retired vice admiral in the United States Navy.

The active complex is formed by interactions with the MAPK Fus3, the MAPK kinase (MAPKK) Ste7, and the MAPKK kinase Ste11. After the induction of mating by an appropriate mating pheromone (either a-factor or Œ± ‚Äìfactor) Ste5 and its associated proteins are recruited to the membrane. Ste4 helps to recruit Ste5, Ste4 is not required for the attachment of Ste5 to the membrane. Membrane association depends on a pleckstrin homology domain, as well as an amphipathic alpha-helical domain in the amino terminus. During mating, Fus3 MAPK and Ptc1 phosphatase compete to control 4 phosphorylation sites on the Ste5 scaffold. When all of 4 sites have been dephosphorylated by Ptc1, Fus3 is released and becomes active. Ste5 plays 2 main roles in the mating signal pathway: #Binds the components of the MAPK cascade and holds them in an active complex #Associates with the membrane, bringing the kinases to the membrane and promoting amplification of the signal (concentrating the bound kinases). Ste5 remains stably bound at the plasma membrane. Ste5 oligomerization is very important for stable membrane recruitment. In one model, the activation of the pathway occurs at the same time that Ste5 is converted from a less active, closed form of Ste5 to an active Ste5 dimer that can bind to the beta-gamma subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein and form a lattice for the MAPK cascade to assemble on. Not only does Ste5 contribute to propagation of the pheromone signal, but it is also involved in down regulating of signalling. It stimulates autophosphorylation of Fus3, which results in phosphorylation of Ste5, causing a downregulation in signalling. Ste5 also catalytically unlocks Fus3 (but not it‚Äôs homologue Kss1) for phosphorylation by Ste7. Both this catalytically active Ste5 domain as well as Ste7 are required for full Fus3 activation, which explains why Fus3 is activated by only the mating pathway, and remains inactive during other pathways which also utilize Ste7. Ste5 can be localized to the cytoplasm, mating projection tip, nucleus, and plasma membrane.

The episode was written by Caroline Dries and directed by Pascal Verschooris. Plot Elena (Nina Dobrev) wakes up in her body after three weeks since the day Katherine has taken over it and she is trapped at the college dorms. Stefan (Paul Wesley), Bonnie (Kat Graham) and Caroline (Candice Accola) asked Liv (Penelope Mitchell) to cast a spell and seal her there since they can find out the antidote of the ripper/werewolf virus that Katherine injected her body with before she died. Stefan is there with her while Bonnie is with Liv trying to teach her how to practice magic and Caroline is at Wes' laboratory trying to find the antidote. Meanwhile, Damon (Ian Somerhalder) is also locked up and chained at the Salvatore house's basement waiting for the antidote. Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) and Matt (Zach Roerig) guard him and bring him some vampire blood every few hours. Caroline runs into Enzo (Michael Malarkey) who tells her that he was working with the travelers and they have the antidote but to give it to them, Stefan has to meet with the travelers. Caroline calls Stefan and agrees to meet them, leaving Elena alone. Elena and Damon are on the phone talking about those three weeks and Damon tries to fill Elena in. He tells her that he killed Wes but he does not tell her that he also killed Aaron (Shaun Sipos). Elena starts having the symptoms of the virus and she hallucinates, nose bleeding and coughing blood. In her hallucinations she sees Katherine hitting on Stefan while she tries to tell him that Katherine has taken over her body. Stefan finds Caroline and Enzo where they agreed to meet. The travelers are also there and inform Caroline and Stefan that they managed, with the help of Enzo, to find an antidote for the ripper virus but they need something in exchange to hand it over to them. The travelers need Stefan to help them find his doppelganger by linking him to Stefan. Stefan hesitates at first since when Tessa did that to him in the past and linked him to Silas, he had lost his memories. Sloan (Caitlin McHugh) tells him that they will be careful and that will not happen again and he agrees to do it, even though Caroline disagrees. Elena's hallucinations continue and this time she sees Aaron where she realizes that he is dead. She believes that she is the one who killed him and starts getting crazy. She calls Damon to ask him if it is true that Aaron is dead and if she killed him and Damon does not know what to tell her. Elena believes that everyone is lying to her and she hangs up on him. Damon knows that Elena is not fine and she will hurt herself and he wants to go to her. He calls Matt and manages to capture him, throwing his ring away. He threatens Jeremy that if he will not let him go to Elena he will kill Matt and Jeremy releases him. Luke (Chris Brochu), a college student, finds Elena and tries to help her. Elena does not remember him and she realizes that she met her when Katherine was in her body. She compels him and feeds him her blood to turn him so she can feed but she sees marks on his neck and realizes that Katherine was feeding on him. She stops and asks him to find Bonnie and Liv so they can break the seal and she can get out. Luke does exactly what she tells him and when Bonnie and Liv arrive, Elena asks them to undo the seal. Bonnie tries to explain her that it is better for her to stay there but Elena throws a stake at Liv and she tells her that if she will not break the seal so she can heal her, she will die. In the meantime, Stefan does what the travelers ask him to do and they locate his doppelganger in Atlanta while Enzo leaves with the antidote to take it to Damon and Elena. Caroline tries to make Sloan stop the ritual after they found out what they wanted but she wants to continue until they kill the doppelganger. Caroline puts a knife on her throat making her stop and release Stefan. Damon and Elena meet with Elena going crazy since she believes that she killed Aaron. Damon tells her that he was the one who killed him because he thought that she had broken up with him when Enzo appears with the antidote. They take it and they return home. Enzo returns to Stefan, Caroline and the travelers. Stefan wakes up after the ritual and Caroline informs him that they found the doppelganger but to make the travelers stop, she agreed to find him with Enzo and kill him. In the meantime, Bonnie escorts Liv to her dorm and tells her that if she does not want to do magic, they can stop. Liv though says that she wants to continue and they agree to meet the next day to continue the lessons. Liv enters her room and she finds Luke waiting for her. It is revealed that Luke is her brother and that the two of them know more things that they let others believe, plus that Liv already knows how to practice magic. The episode ends with Elena and Damon fighting over their relationship and how much one depends on another. They decide to break up because their love makes them something else of what they really are but they end up in bed together because they cannot fight what they feel for each other.

Hyperthermophiles are organisms that can live at temperatures ranging between 70 and 125 ¬∞C.Vieille, C. & Zeikus, G. J. \\"Hyperthermophilic Enzymes: Sources, Uses, and Molecular Mechanisms for Thermostability\\". Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 65, 1‚Äì43 (2001). They have been the subject of intense study since their discovery in 1977 in the Galapagos Rift. It was thought impossible for life to exist at temperatures as great as 100 ¬∞C until Pyrolobus fumarii was discovered in 1997. P. fumarii is a unicellular organism from the domain Archaea living in the hydrothermal vents in black smokers along the Mid- Atlantic Ridge. These organisms can live at 106 ¬∞C at a pH of 5.5. To get energy from their environment these organisms are facultatively aerobic obligate chemolithoautotrophs, meaning these organisms build biomolecules by harvesting carbon dioxide (CO2) from their environment by using hydrogen (H2) as the primary electron donor and nitrate (NO3‚àí) as the primary electron acceptor. These organisms can even survive the autoclave, which is a machine designed to kill organisms through high temperature and pressure. Because hyperthermophiles live in such hot environments, they must have DNA, membrane, and enzyme modifications that help them withstand intense thermal energy. Such modifications are currently being studied to better understand what allows an organism or protein to survive such harsh conditions. By learning what lets these organisms survive such harsh conditions, researchers can better synthesize molecules for industry that are harder to denature. DNA structures of P. fumarii Two DNA strands are held together by base pairing that allows the nucleotide bases adenosine (A) to bind with thymine (T), and guanine (G) to bind with cytosine (C). It has been proposed that thermophilic archaea would be expected to have higher GC content within their DNA, because GC pairings have three hydrogen bonds, while AT pairings have only two. Increasing the number of hydrogen bonds would increase the stability of the DNA, thereby increasing the energy required to separate the two strands of DNA. This would help the DNA to remain double stranded while at such high temperatures that would normally provide enough thermal energy to separate the DNA strands. P. fumarii was first sequenced in 2001 by the Diversa Corporation and the sequence was released to the public in 2014. The data from this analysis showed a GC content of 54.90%. This supports the hypothesis that thermophiles experience selective pressure to increase their GC content in order to stabilize their DNA. However, research has not conclusively supported this hypothesis. A study done by Hurst and Merchant (2001) showed no correlation between higher GC content in prokaryotes and increased optimal growing temperatures. However, their analysis did show that there was higher GC content for the third nucleic acid within the codon. This demonstrates that within the wobble position there is likely a selective pressure for more hydrogen bonds to increase stability within the DNA, but less selective pressure for GC pairings within the DNA as a whole. This supports what is seen in P. fumarii. The majority of the DNA is composed of G and C nucleotides, but the DNA still contains many A and T nucleotides. These results likely indicate that along with increasing GC pairing in the wobble position, thermophilic archaea have other mechanisms for stabilizing their DNA at such high temperatures. One possible mechanism for stabilizing DNA at such high temperatures are proteins such as a type I topoisomerase that supertwists the DNA making spontaneously untwisting of the DNA more difficult. The presence of this protein in multiple evolutionarily distant organisms supports the hypothesis that this protein plays a role in DNA stabilization. Membrane adaptations All microbes ranging from the smallest bacteria to the largest multicellular eukaryote contains a membrane with phospholipids. A phospholipid molecule is composed of a long fatty acid, often called the tail of the molecule, and a phosphate group, which serves as the head of the molecule. Phospholipid membranes can range widely in the structure of the fatty acid tail, which is composed of mostly hydrocarbons. These phospholipid molecules form bilayers with the polar phosphate groups facing the aqueous solution inside or outside of the cell with the hydrocarbons facing inward interacting with each other. The membrane, along with proteins, controls which molecules are allowed in or out of the cell. For this reason, the membrane plays a crucial role in the survival of the cell. A faulty membrane can allow too many solutes into the cell, resulting in cell death. Different organisms have devised different strategies to control what goes in and out of the cell. Bacteria and eukaryotic cells contain phospholipid bilayers containing ester linkages, while archaea contain ether linkages. While these mechanisms work very well for organisms that live in mesophilic environments, they do not work for extremophiles. Mesophiles are organisms that live within relatively moderate temperatures (20‚Äì45 ¬∞C). They are organisms that live around sea level and can survive around the same temperatures as humans. Extremophiles are organisms that grow best in extremely cold, acidic, basic or hot environments. P. fumarii is a hyperthermophile, indicating that this organism grows best at extremely high temperatures (70‚Äì125 ¬∞C). P. fumarii grows best at 106 ¬∞C. Due to the extremely high temperatures this archaea is subjected to, this organism must have extremely stable biomolecules to survive. Without increased stability in the membrane, the cell would fall apart, and too many molecules would flow in and out of the membrane, destroying the chemical gradients the cell uses as energy and letting all the proteins the cell has synthesized diffuse away, stopping its metabolic processes. To deal with this problem archaea have changed their membrane lipid compositions. They still contain phosphate groups and long fatty acid tails, but they also contain ether linkages instead of ester linkages. The ether linkages make the bonds between phosphate groups and hydrocarbons more stable because the carbon connecting the phosphate group and glycerol molecule is more electron-rich than it would be in an ester, making that carbon less electrophilic and therefore less chemically reactive. This lets the ether-linked phospholipid be more stable and less susceptible to breakdown from large amounts of increased thermal energy. This contributes to the archaea's ability to live in such extreme environments. Another membrane adaptation seen in some archaea is tetraether phospholipids. This specific adaptation has been found in P. fumarii along with other hyperthermophiles. A tetraether phospholipid is a molecule containing two hydrocarbon tails, each coming from one ester bond and one phosphate molecule. These phospholipids form monolayers instead of the typical bilayers seen in most bacteria and all eukaryotes. Therefore, instead two different molecules interacting with each other, only one molecule spans the entire width of the membrane. The monolayer then allows for tighter packing of molecules within the membrane because fewer molecules must fit into membrane, however these large molecules are less able to move within the membrane. This then decreases membrane fluidity, allowing the cell to keep more molecules from crossing the membrane. This is an extremely important adaptation because at such high temperatures, molecules move more quickly than at mesophilic temperatures. By decreasing the membrane fluidity, the cell can decrease movement of the phospholipid molecules, which stops unwanted movement of molecules across the membrane. Another extremely important membrane regulation modification that archaea use to control influx and efflux of solutes is the addition of cyclopentane rings within the hydrocarbon tails of the ester-linked phospholipids. The addition of these rings into the membrane allows for even tighter packing of the membrane molecules. These cyclopentane rings can exist in tetraether lipids or diether lipids. By increasing the number of atoms in the middle of the membrane, there is less space for solutes to move in or out of the cell. This helps again to control the amount of solutes moving in and out of the cell. Cyclopentane rings help to crowd the membrane's inner structure making it more difficult for the solutes to get through the membrane to the other side of cell. This is so important for the cell because at hyperthermophilic conditions, the solutes travel very fast, carrying a lot of thermal energy from the environment. If the cell did not have these rings, too many unwanted molecules would likely pass through the membrane either into or out of the cell. This would result in the slowing or complete stop of metabolic processes resulting in cell death. While these cyclopentane rings are extremely useful for keeping unwanted solutes from entering or leaving the cell, not all archaea use them. They are even seen in psychrophiles, which are archaea that require very cold conditions to survive (‚àí15 ¬∞C or below). This is counterintuitive because cyclopentane molecules help to make the membrane more rigid, which is something that happens naturally. It is unclear why these rings are seen at both ends of the temperature spectrum, but it is clear that they serve functions other than simply slowing molecules from entering or leaving a cell. Metabolism Because organisms like P. fumarii live in such harsh environments, these archaea have needed to devise unusual ways to gather energy from the environment and protect themselves against heat stress. P. fumarii, like plants, are able to harvest CO2 from the environment to build their biomolecules, but unlike plants, they take electrons from H2 instead of H2O and transfer those electrons to NO3‚àí, SO42‚àí or O2. This type of metabolic process is classified as chemolithoautrophism, meaning their carbon comes from an inorganic source, their final electron acceptor is not O2 and they produce and consume their own food. Another way that hyperthermophiles ensure their proteins' proper function is by using heat shock proteins (HSPs). While these HSPs are not unique to extremophiles, they are extremely important to study because HSPs found in hyperthermophiles are the most stable of their kind. HSPs are also able to prolong the life of a hyperthermophile even beyond its optimal growing temperature. By studying these proteins it may be possible to learn the mechanisms proteins use to stabilize other proteins, which may help in biosynthesis of new molecules. HSPs act as chaperone proteins that help enzymatic proteins maintain their proper conformation for longer than they would by themselves at such high temperatures. This is part of what allows P. fumarii to exist at temperatures that were long believed much too hot for life to exist. The most common organisms that harvest CO2 to build biomolecules are plants and photosynthetic bacteria. Those particular organisms use the Calvin cycle for their carbon fixation. However, P. fumarii and other similar organisms contain particular enzymes that allow them to harvest CO2 at temperatures well above those tolerated by plants and photosynthetic bacteria with slightly different mechanisms. The alternate pathways used by these extremophiles are either the rTCA cycle, 3-HP cycle, 3-HP/4-HP cycle, or DC/4-HP cycle. These are likely some of the first pathways to evolve because the bacteria and archaea who use them live in environments that mirror the early Earth environments. Therefore, it is likely that these are some of the first carbon fixation pathways to evolve. The rTCA cycle is usually seen in organisms living at temperatures between 20 and 90 ¬∞C, while organisms living at temperatures above 90 ¬∞C most often use the DC/4-HP cycle. The 3-HP/4-HP cycle is most often used by thermoacidophiles in the Sulfolobales order. The rTCA, 3-HP and 3-HP/4-HP cycles are all very important to particular extremophiles, but the DC/4-HP cycle is the one used by P. fumarii. For this reason, this article discusses the DC/4-HP cycle in further depth, and includes more information on two alternate carbon fixation cycles, with associated links. The DC/4-HP cycle is a combination of the rTCA cycle and the 4-HP half of the 3-HP/4-HP cycle. Both the DC/4-HP and the 3-HP/4-HP cycles begin with acetoacetyl-CoA, which is a molecule containing two acetyl-CoA groups allowing this pathway to run twice with only one starting molecule. The acetyl-CoA is then converted to pyruvate, then PEP. The DC/4-HP cycle then follows the rTCA cycle, converting PEP to oxaloacetate, then to malate, then fumarate, and then to succinate. Once the succinate is formed, the pathway follows the same steps as those seen in the 3-HP/4-HP pathway. The final result is the regeneration of acetoacetyl-CoA allowing the process to start over. The only unique enzymes to this pathway are pyruvate synthase, pyruvate:water dikinase, and PEP carboxylase. Because so many of the steps in the DC/4-HP pathway are seen in other pathways, there were only a few unique enzymes to the DC/4-HP pathway, making it difficult to determine the existence of this pathway for a long time. This pathway was only discovered in P. fumarii a few years ago. The DC/4-HP cycle uses the same enzymes to convert oxaloacetate to succinyl-CoA and all the same enzymes as the 3-HP/4-HP pathway once the succinate is formed. One molecule that has been identified as being related to hyperthermophilic organisms is di-myo-inositol phosphate (DIP). Inositol and other phosphate derivatives of this molecule are sugars often used as secondary messenger in eukaryotic cells. However, DIP has only ever been found in thermophilic cells and their use within the cells is largely unknown. A derivative of this sugar called UDP-Œ±- GlcNAc3NAc-(4‚Üê1)-Œ≤-GlcpNAc3NAc has been found only in P. fumarii. The function of this sugar is unknown, but phosphorylated forms of this sugar have been found in conjunction with UDP-Œ±-Glc- NAc3NAc, which is a sugar known to participate in the formation of the S-layer. These UDP sugars are only found when the cells are in supra optimal growing conditions. This suggests that these sugars are building blocks within the cell that allow for the creation of the S-layer protecting Gram-positive bacteria. This connection to the S-layer is extremely important, because it is hypothesized that the S-layer is used to help protect the cell from the heat stress associated with hyperthermophilic environments. The S-layer is also thought to help slow molecules from exiting or entering the cell. While these results are not conclusive, they do help to elucidate how the S-layer is created, which has remained a mystery for years.

He was educated at the University of Toronto, Heidelberg University, the University of Chicago, and the University of Wisconsin- Madison. His 31-year career with the Geological Survey of Canada included 16 years as Director of the Survey. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and served as President of the Society's geological and biological sciences section. He was also President of the Geological Society of America. Early life and education Collins was born October 26, 1878, to Ann Deavitt and Henry Meredith Collins, on their farm near Chatsworth, Ontario. His mother was descended from French Huguenots who had settled and developed Chatsworth, and his father was of English descent. He was the oldest of four boys. His mother died when he was 10 years old. From an early age Collins loved the outdoors, spending much of his free time there. After graduating from the Owen Sound Collegiate Institute he spent a year as principal of the school in Chatsworth. He began a relationship with the teacher of the primary school, Agnes McGill, whom he would later marry. In 1900 Collins entered the University of Toronto. There he studied geology under Arthur Philemon Coleman and earned a Bachelor of Arts with First Class Honours in 1904. After a year as a research assistant in the Department of Mineralogy, he did graduate studies at Heidelberg University under Harry Rosenbusch, at the University of Chicago, and at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1911. The University of Toronto awarded him an honorary Doctor of Science degree in 1936. Career In 1906, as he began his graduate studies, Collins joined the Geological Survey of Canada, and remained there until his death in 1937. He spent his first 15 years engaged in field work producing geologic maps, mostly of the Canadian Shield, with a particular focus on the Huronian Supergroup. He was known for strong outdoor skills, which aided his expeditions greatly. In 1919 was named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 1920 Collins was named Director of the Geological Survey. In this position he led a project to map all of Canada on a scale of 8 miles to 1 inch. He also incorporated aviation, then a relatively new tool for geologists, into the work of the Survey. He remained Director until 1936, when the Survey was incorporated into the new Department of Mines and Resources. Collins became Chief Geological Consultant to the department. Collins's tenure was a difficult period for the Survey. In his 1975 book Reading the Rocks, historian Morris Zaslow blamed this on poor leadership by Collins, alleging specifically micromanagement, political ineptitude, and narrow vision. W. C. Gussow, a subordinate of Collins at the Survey, countered that when Collins took office the Survey had been weakened in the years prior by World War I, a fire in its headquarters, and a mass resignation by 10 senior geologists. Gussow attributed the Survey's later troubles to budget cuts in 1930 under Prime Minister R. B. Bennett prompted by the Great Depression. While Director, Collins served as President of two important scholarly organisations. In 1929 he was President of Section IV, the Geological and Biological Sciences section, of the Royal Society of Canada. In 1934 he was President of the Geological Society of America. Death Collins suffered health problems long before his death, undergoing a major operation as early as 1926. Nonetheless he carried on with field work for some time before succumbing to kidney failure on January 14, 1937.

History =Origins= The first issue of Fuji Flyer was Vol. 1 No. 1, published on 26 June 1970 when it replaced Yokota's former paper the Afterburner. Staff Sergeant Sam Jones was the paper's first editor. The name change reflected the merger of the former Tachikawa Air Base paper Kanto Plainsman with The Afterburner. Through Dec 1997 Fuji Flyer was a black and white command-sponsored Air Force publication that contained no advertisements and ranged from 8 to 12 pages per issue. In January 1998 the paper, while still an official publication, was turned over to a private company that began printing the cover in color and supported its effort through advertising. =Content= A typical issue of Fuji Flyer consisted of articles on significant and minor local events, individual and unit awards, ceremonies, sports, birth announcements, event and movie schedules, locally produced and wire cartoons and comic strips, as well as general Air Force information and stories. Most articles were accompanied by photographs.

The team currently fields the No. 51 Chevrolet Camaro SS full-time for Jeremy Clements in the NASCAR Xfinity Series with crew chief Tony Clements. Based in Spartanburg, South Carolina, the team was founded in 2010, and is owned by driver Jeremy Clements and his father Tony. The team has fielded cars in the Nationwide Series for Clements, Ty Dillon (loaning the No. 51 entry to Richard Childress Racing), and Ryan Sieg. History =Car No. 51 history= In 2008, Jeremy Clements attempted the Dollar General 300, but failed to qualify. He did, however, qualify for the next race, the Missouri-Illinois Dodge Dealers 250, and debuted for Jeremy Clements Motorsports in the No. 50 car. He finished 22nd. In 2012, for both the Virginia 529 College Savings 250, and the Lilly Diabetes 250, Jeremy Clements fielded the No. 4 entry for Jeremy Clements Racing, the successor to Jeremy Clements Motorsports, in place of the regular 51, as Richard Childress Racing used it for Ty Dillon. Ty finished 3rd and 7th, respectively. In 2013, Jeremy Clements missed both the Dollar General 200 and the Sam's Town 300. Ryan Sieg filled in the No. 51 for both races, with the events being his first two Xfinity Series starts. He finished 21st and 18th, respectively. In the inaugural season of the Xfinity Series Chase (2016), Clements finished 15th in points, just 3 positions outside of the lowest spot in the Chase, 12th. On August 27, 2017, Clements won the Johnsonville 180 at Road America, after a collision with Matt Tifft while coming to the white flag. This victory was the first victory for Clements, JCR, and the 51 team, and locked the 51 into the first round of the 2017 Xfinity Series Chase, the Round of 12. However, Clements would miss the round of 8. Before the 2019 NASCAR Xfinity Series season, JCR purchased chassis from the shuttered Chip Ganassi Racing Xfinity Series program, with a goal of running top-fifteen to top-ten on a consistent basis with the new cars. During the 2020 season, the team was fined $10,000 for an undisclosed violation of NASCAR's COVID-19 protocols; the penalty was upheld after an appeal by the team. On September 23, 2020, JCR announced it has parted ways with longtime sponsor RepairableVehicles.com, ending a partnership that lasted for 10 years. The team will look for new sponsors for the remainder of the season and 2021.

Plot  As Sean Kalos attempts to mend his relationship with Katie, his estranged wife, his cell phone goes dead. Kalos enters a gas station and requests assistance, only to find that the phones there have also died. The attendant, who is raptly watch a television broadcast, reveals that a nuclear war has broken out, and, outside the station, they watch the sky fill with incoming missiles. Five years later, the world has more-or-less acclimated to the changes, and a brutal post- apocalyptic society has sprung up. Although he had previous given up his wife for dead, Kalos attempts to avoid survivalists as he searches for her, following his discovery of an encrypted message that seemingly references her. With the help of Shiv, a quirky codebreaker, Katos learns that his wife may be the victim of experimental research in mutated super-soldiers. Kalos, skeptical of the existence of mutants, recruits Jax to help him rescue his wife from Commander Rufler, the brutal warlord of a local militia. He is aided by the Underground and their leader, Red.

Writer Gary Weeks was inspired after he left his cell phone at home. After going through technology withdrawal, he began thinking of the times when he lost access to other technological advances. He set the film five years in the future because he wanted to show a society that had adjusted to the most pressing dangers. He wanted the protagonist to find a reason to live, and, as a romantic, Weeks decided to make the plot a love story.  Release  Deadland premiered at the Atlanta Film Festival on April 18, 2009. Phase 4 Films released it on DVD on November 23, 2010.  Reception  Jeff Marker of The Gainesville Sun wrote \\"Deadland demonstrates what great things can be done by talented people on a shoestring budget.\\" Curt Holman of Creative Loafing wrote that the plot is vague and has too many quirky characters, but the film is compelling and plausible. Ken Hanke of the Mountain Xpress called it \\"a solid movie with effective direction and some very good performances.\\" Stina Chyn of Film Threat rated it 4/5 stars and wrote that it avoids the bleak themes of traditional post-apocalyptic films by focusing more on a love story than brutality and violence. Justin Felix of DVD Talk rated it 2.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"Deadland has flaws in its pacing and acting, but it's creative enough to stand out from its low budget brethren.\\"  References   External links  * Category:2009 films Category:2009 independent films Category:2000s science fiction films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American science fiction films Category:Post-apocalyptic films Category:Films shot in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Films shot in California ","title":"Deadland"},{"id":"42264016","text":"Ultralife Corporation () designs and manufactures batteries and communications systems worldwide.

History  In 2013, Ministry of Civil Aviation had identified 50 locations across the country for low-cost airports to be built by the AAI. Nellore was selected as a location for development of a new low-cost airport with a purpose to create bare minimum facilities for aircraft to operate, without compromising on safety and security. In September 2017, the government of Andhra Pradesh solicited proposals for development of a no-frills greenfield airport at Dagadarthi under a public-private partnership. The development proposal by SCL-Turbo Consortium Pvt. Ltd. was accepted, along with the associated draft concession agreement and financial stipulations. The Arafath Group and ADP Ing√©nierie was to construct and operate the airport. The airport was to be developed on 1,352 acres of land. The project had received all clearances/ approvals from various agencies. As per the agreement, the financial closure for the project was to be achieved by December 2018. On January 26, 2018, during his Republic Day speech, District Collector R. Mutyala Raju announced that the acquisition of land for the airport was nearly completed. The foundation stone was laid by then Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on January 10, 2019.

In August 2019, the new Government terminated its contract with Nellore International Airport Private Limited to develop Nellore Dagadarthi Airport. The government said it would complete the project by handing the airport over to the AAI. In July 2020, the Government formally scrapped the concession agreement signed with the Nellore International Airport Private Ltd for building the airport.

The talks were held on 1 November 1947, five days after India dispatched its troops to defend Kashmir against a Pakistan-backed tribal invasion. In the talks, Mountbatten presented India's offer to hold an impartial plebiscite under the United Nations auspices to decide the accession of Kashmir. Jinnah effectively rejected the offer.  Background  Officially, the talks were to be held between the Governors- General and Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan at the state level, focused on the Kashmir dispute on November 1947. The British government originally facilitated the negotiations in New Delhi, but the venue of the meeting was changed to Lahore. Before the negotiations started, Prime Minister Nehru fell ill and his Deputy PM, Vallabhbhai Patel, refused to come to Lahore, stating \\"there was nothing to discuss with Pakistan's leadership.\\"  Talks  On 1 November 1947, Louis Mountbatten left for Pakistan to begin talks between the Governors-General of India and Pakistan over the issue of Kashmir. The talks lasted for three-and-a-half hours, where Mountbatten offered to Jinnah that India would hold a plebiscite in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, provided that Pakistan withdrew its military support for the Azad Kashmir forces and their allies. Mountbatten also stipulated that the Indian Army would remain in the Kashmir Valley. Jinnah opposed the plan and claimed that the Kashmir, with its massive Muslim majority, belonged to Pakistan as an essential element in an incomplete partition process.  Analysis  From the perspective of many authors, Jinnah was also convinced that a plebiscite under the supervision of the Indian Army would be sabotaged. Instead, he proposed an immediate and simultaneous withdrawal on both sides, including the Pakistani military and their allies, Pathan tribesmen, and the Indian troops. Hearing the proposal, Mountbatten told Jinnah that he needed the consent of Nehru and Patel. The talks failed to reach agreement and the Kashmir issue was referred to the United Nations.

The 23rd Congress, the first such event since Nikita Khrushchev's ousting, the Presidium reverted to its previous name; Politburo. Mikoyan and Nikolai Shvernik, the two oldest members, were not reelected to the Presidium, while Arvƒ´ds Pel≈°e became the only Presidium d√©butant. While Brezhnev may have been General Secretary, he did not have a majority in the Presidium; when Kosygin and Podgorny agreed on policy, which was not often the case, Brezhnev found himself in the minority. Brezhnev could only count on three to four votes in the Presidium: Suslov, who often switched sides, Kirilenko, Pel≈°e and Dmitry Polyansky. Brezhnev and Kosygin often disagreed on policy; Brezhnev was a conservative while Kosygin was a modest reformer. Kosygin, who had begun his premiership as Brezhnev's equal, lost much power and influence within the Presidium when he introduced the 1965‚Äì1971 Soviet economic reform. After the reshuffling process of the Presidium ended in mid-to-late 1970, the Soviet leadership evolved into a gerontocracy, a form of rule in which the rulers are significantly older than most of the adult population; this meant that fewer up-and-comers were promoted to top party positions. 23rd Politburo (1966‚Äì1971) {class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" +Candidate members !

After having been deported from Hungary in 1944, and finding refuge in Switzerland in 1945, he undertook high-school studies in Geneva and then in Paris, continuing on in the Physics Laboratory of Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure to obtain his doctorate in nuclear physics in 1963.How it happened: 1959 to 2010 Georges Amsel, Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure Paris, Groupe de Physique des Solides, Weizmann Institute, Isra√´l, GPS Jussieu INSP Paris During his doctoral study, and under the guidance of Pierre Aigrain he researched the possibilities for charged particle detection offered by semiconductor diodes and developed some of the first such detectors in 1959. He was invited to the first conference on semiconductor detectors, held at Ashville, NC, in 1960, where he presented the first Rutherford backscattering spectrometry to be obtained with a semiconductor detector. During this period, he studied low-energy nuclear reactions on stable isotopes, developing anodizing methods for manufacturing thin, self-supporting oxide films enriched in specific stable oxygen isotopes in collaboration with David Samuel at the Weizmann Institute in Israel. With these targets, he discovered the narrow resonances in the 18O(p,a)15N nuclear reaction. These discoveries were immediately put to use in the field of stable isotopic tracing of atomic transport processes during thin-film growth and transformation. In 1968, he headed the installation of the HVEC AN2500 accelerator in the Solid State Physics group of the Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure. it was one of the first nuclear particle accelerators to be installed in a condensed matter physics laboratory rather than in a nuclear physics laboratory. During this time, he also laid down the foundations of the stochastic treatment of charged particle energy loss processes, opening the way to rapid and accurate calculations of excitation curves obtained around narrow nuclear resonances, and providing an approach to calculating the overshoot on the leading edge, due to the Lewis effect. He has helped in setting up several IBA laboratories around the world and was the director of AGLAE, the accelerator at the Louvre museum dedicated to analysis of cultural heritage materials.

It influences cell size and the cell cycle by binding CLN3 mRNA and inhibiting its transcription. This, in turn, inhibits the G1/S transition.Gar√≠, E., Volpe, T., Wang, H., Gallego, C., Futcher, B., & Aldea, M. (2001). WHI3 binds the mRNA of the G1 cyclin CLN3 to modulate cell fate in budding yeast. Genes & development, 15(21), 2803-2808. Function WHI3 mediates many, often vital, processes such as the cell cycle, meiosis, filamentous growth and mating. Regulation of the cell cycle is done by acting on the cyclin CLN3, a protein crucial to the G1/S transition in budding yeast. WHI3 acts by binding CLN3 mRNA, and then co- localizes, to form cytoplasmic foci. This locally restricts synthesis of the short-lived CLN3 protein, thus limiting its range.Schneider B.L., Patton E.E., Lanker S., Mendenhall M.D., Wittenberg C., Futcher B., Tyers M.(1998) Yeast G1 cyclins are unstable in G1 phase. Nature 395:86‚Äì89. During G1, yeast has the ability to choose from a multitude of developmental options: meiosis, filamentation and mating. This is possible only when the cell arrests in G1, allowing it to continue down a different pathway.Colomina, N., Gar√≠, E., Gallego, C., Herrero, E., & Aldea, M. (1999). G1 cyclins block the Ime1 pathway to make mitosis and meiosis incompatible in budding yeast. The EMBO Journal, 18(2), 320-329. It is also known that WHI3 directly interacts with Cdc28, and is needed to localize it to the cytoplasm during early G1. WHI3 forms a complex with the CLN3 protein, which is needed for the accumulation of Cdc28. In late G1, however, Cdc28 has been observed to localize to the nucleus.Wang, H., Gar√≠, E., Verges, E., Gallego, C., & Aldea, M. (2004). Recruitment of Cdc28 by WHI3 restricts nuclear accumulation of the G1 cyclin‚ÄìCdk complex to late G1. The EMBO Journal, 23(1), 180-190. Another, more recently discovered function of WHI3 is encoding for memory in budding yeast cells. Budding yeast is capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction. During sexual reproduction, two yeast cells signal their presence by diffusing pheromones, and it has been shown that when a cell is exposed to mating pheromones but does not perform mating, it \\"remembers\\" the event and is less likely to undergo mating afterwards. When exposed to pheromones, yeast will undergo cell-cycle arrest and attempt to mate, however, within the first three hours it will escape the arrest, and the previously inhibited CLN3 will resume activity. The WHI3 protein then aggregate and form a super-assembly, which is inactive and partially insoluble. This then forces the cell to continue with budding, since it is now conditioned against cell-cycle arrest. The daughter cells obtained from this budding, however, are not conditioned against mating, unlike the mother: the WHI3 aggregates have been shown to localize within the mother cell. This results in a mother cell retaining the memory of the previous encounter over multiple generations, while the new daughter cells are still responsive to mating cues.Caudron, F., & Barral, Y. (2013). A Super- Assembly of WHI3 Encodes Memory of Deceptive Encounters by Single Cells during Yeast Courtship. Cell, 155(6), 1244-1257. Structure Using the WHI3 sequence, the protein is predicted to have a mass of 71,257 kD, an isoelectric point of 8.65, and a codon bias of 0.13. It also has been shown to have an RNA binding motif, similar to RNP-1 and RNP-2.Nash, R. S., Volpe, T., & Futcher, B. (2001). Isolation and characterization of WHI3, a size-control gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Genetics, 157(4), 1469-1480.

The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), the primary funder of the institute, is also a member of the joint venture. The primary responsibility for establishing the Alan Turing Institute has been assigned to the EPSRC, with continuing engagement in the shaping of the Institute from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and the Government Office for Science. The Chair of the Alan Turing Institute, appointed in June 2015, is Howard Covington; the Institute Director and Chief Executive, appointed in 2018, is Sir Adrian Smith. Location alt= Concurrently with the selection of founder universities, the EPSRC initiated a process to find a 'location partner'. The selected location is the British Library in London. This was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 4 December 2014 as a key part of the Knowledge Quarter. The Alan Turing Institute is housed within the current British Library building and it is anticipated it will occupy new premises in a development planned on land between the Francis Crick Institute and the British Library. Background, history and origin The Alan Turing Institute is the indirect product of a letter from the Council for Science and Technology (CST) to the UK Prime Minister (7 June 2013), describing the \\"Age of Algorithms\\". The letter presents a case that \\"The Government, working with the universities and industry, should create a National Centre to promote advanced research and translational work in algorithms and the application of data science\\". Funding for the creation of the Institute came from a ¬£600m investment for the '8 Great Technologies', and specifically so-called 'big data', signalled by the UK Government in 2013 and announced by George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the 2014 Budget. The bulk of the investment in 'big data' has been directed to computational infrastructure. Of the remainder, ¬£42m has been allocated to the Institute to cover the initial five-year period of its operation. The five founder universities have each contributed ¬£5m to the Institute. Additional funding from industry, foundations and government bodies has already been indicated. The Alan Turing Institute fits into a complex organisational landscape that includes the Open Data Institute, the Digital Catapult and infrastructure investments. The specific role of the Institute will be to provide the expertise and fundamental research into mathematics and algorithms needed to solve real-world problems.

Biography Anna and Ellen Pigeon were born in Clapham, London, to Henry Pigeon, a wine importer and distiller. Anna was her parents' sixth daughter; Ellen was born four years later. Their parents' financial support allowed them to maintain a household of their own in Clapham and pursue mountain climbing in the Alps. The Pigeons began by hiking and, as described by Clare Roche, \\"metamorphosed into experienced and dedicated mountaineers\\". Over ten years, they travelled to the Alps every summer to climb mountains. They embarked on their first alpine expedition in 1864, focusing on modest peaks of around , and over a five-year period they gradually gained experience on higher peaks. Their most famous expedition took place in 1869, when they traversed the Seserjoch (Sesia Joch), a pass between Zermatt in Switzerland and Alagna in Italy that had only been ascended once before and never descended. Their traverse turned out to have been a mistake: they had intended to cross a more straightforward pass, the Lysjoch, but their guide, Jean Martin de Vissoie, had become lost and they descended to Alagna instead of Gressoney-La-Trinit√© as they had planned. Given the circumstances surrounding their traverse, their claim of success was met with scepticism, and the matter was not resolved until Giuseppe Farinetti of the Italian Alpine Club verified the Pigeons' account of the traverse and the British Alpine Club agreed that they had been successful. In 1872, they made the first traverse from Macugnaga to Alagna, and in 1873 the first female traverse of the Matterhorn from Breuil-Cervinia to Zermatt. They remained active climbers through the 1880s, publishing a short account of their mountaineering experience titled Peaks and Passes in 1885. In 1876, Ellen married Bradley Abbot, a vicar and widower. By that point the Pigeons had climbed 66 mountains over and 60 passes over . After Ellen's death in 1902, Anna remained active in the mountaineering community. She became a vice president of the Ladies' Alpine Club in 1910 and was an honorary member from 1911 until her death in 1917. Both sisters are buried at West Norwood Cemetery in London.

The purpose was to obtain control of local air strips, which could be used as forward bases by fighter aircraft for operations further south in the Philippines. The attack on Batan Island was the first of several other advance landings; the other landings took place at Aparri, Vigan, Legaspi, Davao, and Jolo Island. Background The Japanese had been officially planning a strike on the American fleet at their main base at Pearl Harbor in the Territory of Hawaii since early 1941, but the idea had been informally speculated for many years. Following the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria, beginning the Second Sino-Japanese War, Japan spent considerable effort trying to isolate China and to obtain sufficient natural resources to attain victory in China. The 1940 Japanese invasion of French Indochina was such an effort to control supplies. In response, the United States halted shipments of airplanes, parts, machine tools, and aviation gasoline to Japan. In July 1941, the U.S. ceased oil exports to Japan, leaving the Japanese with the option of either withdrawing from China or securing new sources of raw materials in the resource-rich, European-controlled colonies of Southeast Asia, such as present-day Malaysia (United Kingdom) and Indonesia (Netherlands), both oil producers. Early in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered a military buildup in the Philippines in the hope of discouraging further Japanese aggression in the Far East. Because the Japanese high command was certain that any attack on the United Kingdom‚Äôs Southeast Asian colonies would bring the United States into war, they planned a devastating first strike against Pearl Harbor and the Philippines. Batan Island was the first part of the Japanese invasion of the Philippines, and occurred simultaneously with the attack on Pearl Harbor. Its main purpose was set up an air base for future operations against American forces on Luzon. Landing and aftermath The invasion was mainly launched from the Japanese port of Takao on Taiwan on 8 December 1941. The Batan Island invasion force, under the overall command of Vice Admiral Sueto Hirose, consisted of a 490-man naval combat unit and an indeterminate number of air corps troops, on two transports (Teiun Maru, Kumagawa Maru) escorted by the destroyer , four Chidori-class torpedo boats (Chidori, Manazuru, Tomozuru, Hatsukari), two W-13-class minesweepers (W-13, W-14), two patrol boats (Patrol Boat No. 1, Patrol Boat No. 2), nine converted sub-chasers (Shonan Maru No. 17, Takunan Maru No. 5, Fukuei Maru No. 15, Kyo Maru No. 2, Kyo Maru No. 11, Koeri Maru, Shonan Maru No. 1, Shonan Maru No. 2, Nagara Maru), two Tsubame-class minelayers (Kamome, Tsubame), and three converted gunboats (Aso Maru, Koso Maru, Nampo Maru). The combat troops quickly secured the existing small airfield outside Basco without resistance, and the air corps troops began expansion work the following day to make it suitable for fighters and reconnaissance aircraft. The same day, the first planes of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service 24th and IJA 50th Fighter Regiments landed at Basco. However, over the next few days, the success of the Japanese bombing of Clark Field rendered the base at Basco redundant, and work was discontinued. On 10 December, the Batan Island invasion force was withdrawn from Batan Island, and invaded Camiguin Island in the Babuyan Islands to the south. The landing again proceeded without incident, and possession of the small airstrip on Camiguin gave the Japanese a forward airbase only 35 miles from Aparri. They also occupied nearby Calayan Island.  Consequences In retrospect, the advance landings in northern Luzon, including at Batan Island and Camiguin, accomplished little of strategic or tactical value. The air fields seized were small, and with the rapid advance of the Japanese into central Luzon, were soon unnecessary for further operations.

Ride On in Majesty\\", is a Christian hymn written by Henry Hart Milman in 1820. It is a Palm Sunday hymn and refers to Matthew 21:1‚Äì17 and Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem.  History  While Milman wrote \\"Ride On, Ride On in Majesty!\\" in 1820, it was not published in a hymn book until 1827 when it was published in Bishop Reginald Heber's Hymns Written and Adapted to the Weekly Church Service of the Year. This is reported to only have happened after Milman met Heber in 1823 before Heber became Bishop of Calcutta. It was described by composer Stanley L. Osbourne as \\"Objective, robust, confident, and stirring, it possesses that peculiar combination of tragedy and victory which draws the singer into the very centre of the drama. It is this which gives the hymn its power and its challenge\\". The hymn proved popular: in 1907, John Julian, in his Dictionary of Hymnology, stated it was the most popular Palm Sunday hymn in the English language at that time. The hymn is viewed to be full of dramatic irony. The third line of the first verse \\"Thine humble beast pursues his road\\" has been disliked by some hymn book editors. In 1852 it was attempted to be changed to \\"O Saviour meek, pursue Thy road\\" and in 1855 to \\"With joyous throngs pursue Thy road\\" however both attempts received little popular attention. This led to some hymn books omitting the first verse. The unaltered original text, however appears in later collections such as the 1906 English Hymnal, and in some modern hymnals. The hymn is used as a processional hymn during Palm Sunday.  Tune  The hymn is sung to a variety of tunes, including St Drostane by John Bacchus Dykes, and Winchester New. The last of these is frequently employed in the United Kingdom. It first appears in Musikalisches Handbuch der geistlichen Melodien (Hamburg, 1690), and was reworked into a long-meter setting by William J. Havergal in an 1864 publication, Old Church Psalmody. Named after the county seat of Hampshire, it is appended with \\"new\\" to distinguish it from Winchester Old, which is most commonly sung to the Christmas hymn \\"While shepherds watched their flocks by night\\". << << ew Staff { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 4/2 \\\\partial 2 \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"church organ\\" \\\\omit Staff.TimeSignature \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\\\override Score.BarNumber #'transparent = ##t \\\\relative c' << { f2  bes f g g  f es d \\\\bar\\"\\" d  es d c f  f e f \\\\bar\\"\\" \\\\break f  bes c d bes  es d c \\\\bar\\"\\" d  bes g f bes  bes a bes \\\\bar\\".\\" }  { d,2  f d es es4( d)  c2 a bes bes  bes bes c d  d c c f  f es d g4( f)  es2 f f f  f es f d  g f f } >> } %% ew Lyrics \\\\lyricsmode { put lyrics here if you insist } ew Staff { \\\\clef bass \\\\key f \\\\major \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = \\"church organ\\" \\\\omit Staff.TimeSignature \\\\relative c' << { bes2  bes bes bes es,  f f f f  g f4( g) a2 a  bes4( a) g2 a a  bes g4( a) bes2 bes  bes4( a) bes2 a bes  bes bes bes bes  c c d }  { bes,2  d bes es c4( bes)  a2 f bes bes  g bes f d'  bes c f, f'4( es)  d2 c bes es4( d)  c2 d4( es) f2 bes,  d es d g  es f bes, } >> } >> >> \\\\layout { indent = #0 } \\\\midi { \\\\tempo 2 = 90 }  References   External links  * \\"Ride on, Ride on in Majesty\\" sung by the Choir of All Saints, Margaret Street Category:English Christian hymns Category:Palm Sunday hymns Category:1820 songs Category:19th-century hymns Category:Hymns in The English Hymnal ","title":"Ride On, Ride On in Majesty!"},{"id":"42264834","text":"Ernesto Diaz Gonzalez (born 1939) (in Spanish) is a Puerto Rican sportscaster who has worked since 1962 on Puerto Rican television.

Ernesto Diaz Gonzalez is also known by the Puerto Rican public as \\"Ernestito\\". Biography Ernesto Diaz Gonzalez grew up as a fan of cockfighting. His father took him to watch cockfights at a local cockfighting arena when he was about 11 or 12 years old. Later, Diaz Gonzalez attended university, where he began learning some phrases that he would later use during basketball game transmissions. By 1980, Diaz Gonzalez had been hired as a special-events sportscaster by Telemundo Puerto Rico, which had Junior Abrams as their main sportscaster and sports news reporter. In 1985, Diaz Gonzalez moved to Telemundo Puerto Rico's rival station canal 4. 2014 Puerto Rican Sports Hall of Fame Controversy During its 2014 induction ceremony, the Puerto Rican Sports Hall of Fame was to induct Diaz Gonzalez as a sportscaster, along with former baseball players Bernie Williams and Carlos Baerga, and former basketball player Jerome Mincy. Diaz Gonzalez, however, did not accept the induction, alleging that he had felt shunned by the Hall of Fame for 15 prior years. (in Spanish) Personal Diaz Gonzalez is married to Norma Hernandez, who inspired him to use some phrases during basketball game transmissions. Phrases Diaz Gonzalez has coined some phrases during televised basketball games that have become popular in Puerto Rican Spanish jargon. Some are: *\\"Gulu gulu y pa' fuera\\" (loosely translated to \\"round and round and it goes out\\")-when someone's shot goes around the rim and then drops out. *\\"Y va seguir!\\" (\\"He-or she-keeps it going!\\")-when someone has scored many points and makes another basket *\\"Agua pa' los gallos!\\" (\\"throw water at the cocks\\")-when a team has scored the basket likely to secure the game for them.

After the suppression of the uprising, he became one of the commanders of the Chetnik units in Montenegro and openly collaborated with Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany until his death in 1943.  Uprising in Montenegro  Stani≈°iƒá was a member of the Supreme Command of the insurgent forces during the Uprising in Montenegro.  Anti-communist struggle and collaboration with the Italians  On 11 February 1942, after the uprising had been suppressed, Stani≈°iƒá conducted a coup near Danilovgrad. On that occasion, two companies from the \\"Bijeli Pavle\\" detachment joined him. Later that month, he established the National Army of Montenegro and Herzegovina () comprising six battalions, most of which were Chetniks, and appointed himself as their commander. On 17 February and 6 March 1942, Stani≈°iƒá concluded collaboration agreements with the Italian military governor, Alessandro Pirzio Biroli.

Death  In mid October 1943, General ƒêukanoviƒá and Stani≈°iƒá with 25 of their soldiers were located at their headquarters in the Ostrog Monastery. They were besieged by stronger Partisan units who demanded that they surrender, otherwise the Partisans threatened to destroy the monastery and kill them all. To protect the monastery and their lives, General ƒêukanoviƒá and 22 soldiers surrendered, but Stani≈°iƒá and three of his relatives decided not to surrender. Stani≈°iƒá was shot dead by the Partisans, while Stani≈°iƒá's relatives committed suicide. General ƒêukanoviƒá and his soldiers who surrendered to the Partisans were executed on the same day. They were buried in two mass graves. In 1948, the communists built pit toilets above the graves of ƒêukanoviƒá and his Chetniks for the use of workers who built a railway from Nik≈°iƒá to Podgorica. Stani≈°iƒá was buried in Ostrog, below the Upper Monastery. On 20 October 1945, the Yugoslav authorities excavated his bones and threw them into sinkholes around the monastery.

It is usually performed to a Regional Mexican song, specifically a lyrical charanga or instrumental mambo. The dance style was made especially famous by the Regional Mexican subgenre of Technobanda.Hutchinson, \\"Quebradita,\\" p. 651. In the quebradita there is a male dancer and a female dancer. The male dancer lowers the female dancer backwards almost to the point where she touches the floor. Then the male dancer quickly pulls her up.

A California State University, Northridge professor of Chicano studies, Everto Ruiz, stated that the music has its origin from Sinaloan music.Easley, Joan. \\"Strike Up the Banda : The popular Mexican dance music is gaining momentum with young and old, who turn out in cowboy gear at local clubs and private parties to do la quebradita.\\" Los Angeles Times.

In the 2002 encyclopedia article, Hutchinson stated that the music continues to be performed along the U.S.-Mexico border at concerts, nightclubs, and parties, but that the quebradita had \\"significantly declined\\" in popularity as a performance and competition dance.
