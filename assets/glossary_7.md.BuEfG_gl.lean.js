V. S. N. Prasad. The film stars Ravi Teja and Ileana D'Cruz in the lead roles, and marked the third time they were paired together, having earlier being paired in Khatarnak and Kick. The film was co-produced by Reliance Entertainment and Bhogavalli Bapineedu. The soundtrack of the film was composed by Raghu Kunche, while the cinematography was handled by Shyam K. Naidu. S. R. Shekhar who previously worked with Puri Jagannadh for Business Man handled the editing of the film. The film was released on 15 August 2012 and met with predominantly negative reviews from critics. Plot The movie opens with Lord Vishnu (Bramhanandam) trying to pacify Lakshmi Devi (Kovai Sarala), who is quite disappointed after listening to words of Narada that Lord Vishnu didn't give any present to Lakshmi Devi on the eve of her Birthday (Akshaya Tritiya). Lord Vishnu shows a love story between two orphans Ravi Teja (Ravi Teja), a settlement broker in Hyderabad and Ileana (Ileana D'Cruz), a taxi driver living in Bangkok. Panileni Papayya (M. S. Narayana) sits at a shop, eats a banana & throws the peel on the road. Using the peel, Lakshmi Devi creates a small problem which leads C.I. Subbaraju (Subbaraju) killing Sandy, a trusted goon of the absent-minded Don Prakash Raj (Prakash Raj) of Bangkok. Thus to settle the problem between the two, Ravi Teja goes to Bangkok. At the airport, a taxi driver Goli (Ali) steals the bag of Ravi Teja which has his belongings including passport. He chases him in Ileana's car but his efforts are in vain. Feeling bad upon learning he is an orphan like her, Ileana invites Ravi Teja to her home. Next day he finds Goli, who is a die- hard devotee of Lakshmi Devi and meets Prakash Raj through him and settles the problem. Prakash Raj, who lusts after Ileana, asks Ravi Teja to send Ileana for a night for having sex. He bashes his entire team and runs to Ileana who is already in love with him. Both quarrel and get separated. Unhappy with the turn of events, Lakshmi Devi goes into the past and makes Papayya throw the Banana peel into a dust bin instead on the road. Due to this the story turns like this: Sandy is caught red-handed by Subbaraju and Sandy is sent to jail. As Sandy is a trusted goon and has all the information regarding his activities, Prakash Raj is furious and wants Sandy released. Ravi Teja is appointed by Prakash Raj's henchmen to strike a deal between Subbaraju and Prakash Raj. Both Ravi Teja and Subbaraju go to Bangkok. At the airport he sees Ileana for the first time and falls in love with her, due to which he refuses to sit in the taxi of Goli and sits in her taxi. Meanwhile, Prakash Raj's men chase them in Goli's Taxi. During the chase, Subbaraju, Ravi Teja and Ileana are safe but their taxi is destroyed. After a long argument, Ravi Teja promises to buy a taxi when the deal is over and stay at Ileana's house as Subbaraju is injured. Meanwhile, Ravi Teja flirts with Ileana which infuriates her. Both go to Prakash Raj and settle the problem for 2 crore. Prakash Raj sees his sister in Ileana and is ready to do anything for her. Ileana accepts him as her brother. Meanwhile, Ravi Teja proposes to Ileana to which she accepts happily. At the time of closing of deal, Prakash Raj brings the 20 million but Subbaraju comes with the police forces. Meanwhile, Ravi Teja & Ileana quarrel but both hug each other, expressing their love. Finally after a fight sequence, Ravi Teja & Ileana are shown to live a happy life & Prakash Raj is a member of their family who would return to their home after six months of imprisonment. The whole story is seen by Lakshmi Devi and Lord Vishnu is successful in making her happy.

Mahesh Koneru of 123telugu.com gave a review of 2.25/5 and commented that \\"'Devudu Chesina Manushulu' is a surprisingly poor offering from Ravi Teja and Puri Jagan. The movie fails to entertain on any level. Strong and hard hitting dialogues are expected in a Puri Jagan movie and he disappoints this time. Except for a few moments of humour and one or two nice lines, there is nothing to rave about in this movie. Perhaps, some respect for the intelligence of the viewers should have been shown.\\"http://www.123telugu.com/reviews/review-devudu-chesina- manushulu-an-arati-thokka-story.html Shekhar of OneIndia Entertainment gave a review stating \\"Watch the film only if you are a hardcore fan of Ravi Teja. The film can be watched for Puri Jagannath's punch dialogues and Ileana's glamour. After a long time, you feel that you spent your valuable time and money unnecessarily on a Ravi Teja's film.\\"http://entertainment.oneindia.in/telugu/reviews/2012/devudu-chesina- manushulu-movie-review-098427.html Supergood Movies gave a rating of 2.5/5 stating \\"Devudu Chesina Manushulu has some good comedy scenes and was targeted to be a mass entertainer.

He was a co-founder and chairman of the Thai Nation Party, deputy prime minister and minister in several cabinets. Early life, military career, and family Pramarn Adireksarn was born on 31 December 1913 in Saraburi to a Chinese immigrant father and Thai mother. He attended the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy and became an officer in the artillery of the Royal Thai Army in Lopburi. The highest rank he achieved was Major General. Pramarn married Charoen Choonhavan, the daughter of Field Marshal Phin Choonhavan and sister of Chatichai Choonhavan. By this marriage, he became a member of the influential \\"Rajakru clan\\". Pramarn and Charoen Adireksarn had three sons, including the author and politician Pongpol Adireksarn (pen-name Paul Adirex). Political career under Plaek Phibunsongkhram Later he served as director of the state-run Express Transportation Organization of Thailand (ETO). In 1951 he became deputy minister in the cabinet of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, initially assigned to the ministry of transport, he changed to the interior ministry in 1952, and to the ministry of industry in 1953. In 1955 he left the government. In 1957, Pramarn was elected Member of Parliament for the ruling Seri Manangkasila Party, the winner of the election in February of that year. Subsequently, Prime Minister Plaek appointed him Minister of Industry. The 1957 military coup d'√©tat by Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat deposed Pramarn's patron Plaek and brought his political career to a temporary halt. He got involved in the private sector and established a textile concern. Thai Nation Party leader In 1974, after the successful democratic uprising, Pramarn, together with his in-laws Chatichai Choonhavan and Siri Siriyothin, founded the Thai Nation Party. The right-wing conservative and staunchly anti- communist party was the adversary of the leftist student movement. In March 1975, Pramarn led the Thai Nation Party into a United Parties coalition with the progressive Social Action Party and the right-wing Social Justice Party with M.R. Kukrit Pramoj becoming Prime Minister and Pramarn taking the office of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. The coalition broke in January 1976. It had not been able to cope with the social unrest in the country, including the protests of the students movement, strikes, and fear at the sight of the events in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, and inter-party conflicts, namely between Pramarn and Thawit Klinprathum, the leader of the Social Justice Party. In advance of the snap elections, Pramarn's Thai Nation Party campaigned on the slogan \\"Right kill Left\\". The party could significantly increase its share of votes and seats in parliament. This time, the Thai Nation Party joined a Democrat Party-led government under Kukrit's brother M.R. Seni Pramoj. Pramarn Adireksarn stayed Deputy Prime Minister, but was denied the defence portfolio. Instead, he was given the ministry of agriculture. In the morning of 6 October 1976, it was Pramarn who declared in a cabinet meeting that it was the right moment to destroy the student movement. This was eventually executed by the police and ultra-right paramilitary units who shot and struck at least 46 protesters at the Thammasat University dead. On the evening of the same day, the military launched a coup d'√©tat and deposed the Seni government. =After 1976= In 1978, Pramarn became official leader of the opposition, before Thai Nation joined the coalition government of General Prem Tinsulanonda in 1980, with Pramarn again becoming Deputy Prime Minister. In 1986, Pramarn passed the leadership of the Thai Nation Party to his brother-in-law Chatichai Choonhavan. Chatichai won the election of 1988, became Prime Minister and made Pramarn Minister of Interior. In this position, he was royally promoted to the honorary rank of police general. In January 1990 he switched posts with fellow party member Banharn Silpa-archa and took over the industry portfolio, just to change back to the interior ministry in December of the same year. Chatichai however took on leading circles in the military and was deposed by a coup in 1991. The so- called National Peace Keeping Council seized 139 million baht of Pramarn's assets, accusing him of being \\"unusually rich\\" for a cabinet member. From 1992 to 1994 Pramarn once again assumed the leadership of the Thai Nation Party and acted as leader of the opposition. Afterwards, Pramarn retired from the political scene and passed the mantle to his son Pongpol Adireksarn. Pramarn Adireksarn died of a blood infection at the age of 96 on 20 August 2010.

They would compete every round of the Le Mans Series, selected round in the FIA GT Championship and compete at the Le Mans 24 Hours. The team raced two cars in the LMS rather than three in 2007 with Marc Lieb joined by Alex Davison in car No. 77 while car No. 88 was piloted by the two Horst Felbermayrs and Christian Ried. Despite not winning any races, car 77 finished second in the Teams Championship finishing once again behind Virgo Motorsport with a gap of 5 points this time round. Car 88 finished eighth place with ten points, level with Farnbacher Racing. The team only competed one round in FIA GT which was the FIA GT Bucharest 2 Hours. The team scored no points in either of the two races that weekend. The team made its full d√©but at Le Mans with no partnership from Seikel Motorsport this time round. The teams' line up for Le Mans was Horst Felbermayr, Sr., Alex Davison and Wolf Henzler. Qualifying went well with car 77 qualifying in second place in the GT2 class behind 2007 class winners IMSA Performance Matmut. They were not able to retain their second place qualifying position during the race but finished a respectable fifth place in class and 27th overall. = 2009 = Team Felbermayr-Proton Porsche 997 GT3-RSR at the 2009 1000 km of Spa The 2009 season was Felbermayr-Proton's most successful season to date. Marc Lieb remained in car 77 for the 2009 season with Richard Lietz becoming his teammate replacing Alex Davison. Horst Felbermayr, Jr. and Christian Ried remained in car 88 with Felbermayr, Sr. replaced by Francisco Cruz Martins. It was car 77 that earned all of the success for the team winning three of the five races and winning the Teams Championship by just one point ahead of JMW Motorsport, with car 88 finishing tenth in the standings earning five points. The pair drivers of Lieb and Lietz also won the Drivers Championship beating JMW drivers Rob Bell and Gianmaria Bruni by a point. The team entered the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans with essentially two cars with No. 77 driven by LMS regulars Lieb and Lietz, who were joined by Wolf Henzler. They also partnered IMSA Performance Matmut who are long time Porsche competitors with car No. 70 with the two Felbermayrs racing alongside Matmut driver Michel Lecourt. The team were pretty confident going into the race after qualifying where they repeated their 2008 qualifying position of second in the GT2 class. The team narrowly missed out on pole position by only 0.030 seconds behind American Porsche competitors Flying Lizard Motorsports. Unfortunately their race came to a very early end after just 24 laps when car 77 ran out of fuel. The IMSA/Felbermayr car 70 soon followed by retiring on the 102nd lap. Felbermayr-Proton wrapped up their season when they contested the inaugural round of the Asian Le Mans Series and indeed the only round of the season in Asia. The race was at Okayama in Japan and the team brought over the two cars but mixed the driver pairings up a bit. All four drivers were German. Marc Lieb was joined by Le Mans teammate Wolf Henzler in No. 77 and Christian Ried was joined in No. 88 by Marco Holzer. Both cars finished second and fourth in class respectively. = 2010 = Car No. 88 Porsche 997 GT3-RSR at the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans The team hoped to continue their 2009 success in 2010. The team retained their No. 77 championship winning line up of Lieb and Lietz for the 2010 season with Christian Ried retaining his No. 88 seat alongside Martin Ragginger for the season. Porsche factory drivers Patrick Long and Romain Dumas also joined car 88 for a few of the LMS events. Car 77 once again was the force to be reckoned with winning three of the five races and once again winning the Teams Championship. They finished a comfortable 21 points ahead of second place team AF Corse. Car 88 was a lot more competitive than in previous years finishing fourth in the standings. Lieb and Lietz also retained their Drivers Championship titles beating the AF Corse trio of Jean Alesi, Giancarlo Fisichella and Toni Vilander by 21 points. 2010 was the inaugural season of the Intercontinental Le Mans Cup, a global endurance racing series that mixes in with events like the Le Mans Series and the American Le Mans Series. It is the first of its kind since the World Sportscar Championship last run in 1992. The 2010 edition was a sort of prologue to a proper season with three events with one event in Europe, America and Asia. Felbermayr-Proton took part in the European and Asian rounds at Silverstone and Zhuhai. The team won the championship with 72 points, 15 points ahead of LMS rivals AF Corse. As it was a series for teams and manufacturers, a drivers championship was not awarded. For the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans, the team hoped that their championship winning car could prove its status this time round after a disappointing early exit in last years edition. The previous year's car 77 trio of Lieb, Lietz and Henzler remained while car 88 saw the father/son duo of the Felbermayrs return being joined by Slovakian racer Miro Konopka. Qualifying went reasonably well for No. 77 qualifying fourth in class while No. 88 started second last. The race however was a completely different story with car 77 taking the GT2 class victory at Le Mans in 2010 beating Ferrari, Corvette and fellow Porsche factory teams. It was Marc Lieb's second class victory, winning the 2005 24 Hours of Le Mans in the GT2 category with Alex Job Racing. Richard Lietz also won his second class victory in 2010 after winning the GT2 class in his first Le Mans race in 2007 with IMSA Performance Matmut. It was Wolf Henzler's first class victory at Le Mans. Car 88 did reasonably well finishing eighth in a highly competitive GT2 class. = 2011 = The 2011 Le Mans Series season saw the GT2 class split to two classes LM GTE Pro and LM GTE Am. GTE Pro was for teams using 2011 spec cars or older and were allowed have a fully professional (gold and platinum) driver line up. GTE Am was for teams with 2010 spec cars or older and could only have one professional or gold category driver in the line up. The team raced with two cars with once in each class. Car 77 was a 2011 spec Porsche 997 GT3-RSR in LM GTE Pro driven by champions Lieb and Lietz. Car 88 was an older spec GT3-RSR competing in the LM GTE Am class and was driven by Horst Felbermayr, Jr. and Christian Ried with appearances from Felbermayr, Sr. and Bryce Miller in some of the rounds. In GTE Pro, the team finished third in the Teams Championship, sadly not earning three championships in a row. The GTE Am Porsche also finished third in the championship out of four competitors and picked up a win in the opening round at Paul Ricard. The team competed in that year's ILMC but only in the GTE Am class and restoring the old Proton Competition name of yesteryear. The car used was No. 63 and had many different driver combinations throughout the seven-round season with Christian Ried racing in all but one of the events. Proton finished third in the championship with 52 points. The team went into the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans in two classes as well as being the reigning GT2 Le Mans winners. They kept the Lieb/Lietz/Henzler alliance that won Le Mans in 2010 for their No. 77 GTE Pro car while the GTE Am car No. 63 was driven by team boss Christian Ried and the two Felbermayrs. Proton also operated an extra 911 GT3-RSR No. 88 in the Pro class, driven by Nick Tandy, Abdulaziz al- Faisal and Bryce Miller. The two Pro cars qualified in the middle of the pack while the Am car qualified second fastest in class. Out of the three cars, No. 77 was the only one that finished which was fourth in class. Car No. 63's race came to an end near dawn on the 199th lap when the No. 74 Corvette Racing car in GTE Pro went to lap the Proton Competition car driven by Felbermayr, Sr. at the time. Corvette driver Jan Magnussen who was leading in the Pro class at the time, tried to lap the Porsche on the inside of the final part of the Porsche Curves rather than around the outside. The Corvette C6.R went onto the grass and spun hitting the driver's side of the Porsche head on injuring Felbermayr, Sr. who was the oldest driver competing at Le Mans in 2011. Car No. 88 retired thirty laps previously. = 2012 = Proton Competition announced plans to campaign in the inaugural season of the FIA World Endurance Championship in 2012 with two cars in GTE Pro and GTE Am. Marc Lieb and Richard Lietz would be the regular season pair in the GTE Pro car while Christian Ried and Gianluca Roda were scheduled to compete in the GTE Am Porsche. = 2015 = Proton Competition teamed with Dempsey racing in the 2015 24 Hours of LeMans. The team qualified 5th and finished 2nd in the LM GTE-AM class with drivers Marco Seefried, Patrick Long, and Patrick Dempsey driving the number 77 Dempsey/Proton Racing Porsche 911 RSR.

Var.) is a dermal bone situated between the parietal and supraoccipital. It is homologous to the postparietal bones of other animals. In humans, it corresponds to the upper portion of the squama of the occipital bone that lies superior to the highest nuchal line and is completely fused to the supraoccipital. However, in some individuals this portion remains separate from the rest of the occipital bone throughout life. In such cases, this separate bone is particularly referred as Inca bone. Inca bones in humans were first found in the skulls of contemporary indigenous peoples of the southern Andes as well as in those of mummies of the Inca civilization. Although the Inca bone was originally encountered as a variation in South American and Latin American cranial remains, the variation occurs in people from all geographic regions of the world and is by no means indicative of South/Latin American origin. The existence of this Inca bone has helped to identify the mummified remains which spent 110 years in two German museums as belonging to a young South American woman who was probably a victim of ritual murder practiced around the 17th century.ScienceShot: Mystery Mummy Was Ritually MurderedReconstructing the Life of an Unknown (ca. 500 Years- Old South American Inca) Mummy In many other mammals, this bone is completely fused to the supraoccipital as in humans. However in some mammals (for example, rodents, rabbits, and artiodactyls), this bone remains separate from the supraoccipital bone. Classic comparative anatomy have regarded the interparietal as being lost in various mammalian lineages since the interparietal and supraoccipital fuse with each other in the early ontogenetic period in many mammals, but recent study has shown that its presence is confirmed in all extant mammalian orders, particularly in the embryonic period (Koyabu and others, 2012).

It developed as a suburb of the town in the Middle Ages, when it was protected by a defensive ditch, the Clawdd-du or \\"Black Dyke\\", the remains of which are now protected as an ancient monument. In later centuries the area became known as \\"Little Monmouth\\" or \\"Cappers' Town\\". Development of the area has continued, particularly since the mid-twentieth century, and the area is now a ward of Monmouthshire County Council. History At the time of the Norman conquest, the area to the east of the River Monnow, and north of the River Wye, was in the area known as Archenfield, which lay within the Earldom of Hereford and was considered to be part of England; areas to the west of the Monnow, including the Overmonnow area, were regarded as Welsh. After the Normans built Monmouth Castle, the town of Monmouth gradually developed as a market town, a river port, and as a centre for the manufacture of iron goods and woollen fabric. By the twelfth century, development had taken place beyond the Monnow Bridge at Overmonnow, forming a suburb or faubourg. The mediaeval iron industry at Overmonnow resulted in the wastage of large piles of cinders; these \\"cinder hills\\", which gave their name to Cinderhill Street, were removed in the eighteenth century. The area was also known for the manufacture of woollen fabric, particularly Monmouth caps which were popular between the fifteenth and eighteenth centuries, and as a result the Overmonnow area supposedly became known as \\"Cappers' Town\\", Kelly's Directory 1901: Monmouth . Accessed 28 January 2012 although this has been questioned. The area was also known as \\"Little Monmouth\\".Kissack, Mediaeval Monmouth, p.33 In the nineteenth century, there was a belief that \\"Little Monmouth\\" had at one time been a separate borough from the rest of the town, or \\"Great Monmouth\\". This seems to be a legend deriving from a pageant arranged to celebrate the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1838, in which the so-called \\"mayor of Overmonnow\\" demanded admittance to the town across Monnow Bridge, and then rode around the town with the (real) mayor of Monmouth.Kissack, Mediaeval Monmouth, p.57 However, the bridge was the scene of annual battles, or \\"muntlings\\", between rival gangs from \\"Up-Town\\" and \\"Cappers' Town\\". These took place on 1 May and 29 May, the youths arming themselves with besoms or \\"muntles\\" reinforced with stones. The altercations were banned in 1858.Roy Palmer, The Folklore of (Old) Monmouthshire, Logaston Press, 1998, , p.262 Substantial development, for both housing and light industry, has taken place in the Overmonnow area since the mid twentieth century. In the 2001 census, the Overmonnow ward had a total resident population of 2,300, within 1,104 separate households. ONS Neighbourhood Statistics: Overmonnow Ward. Accessed 28 January 2012 The ward is currently represented on Monmouthshire County Council by Cllr. Susan White, of the Conservative Party. Monmouthshire County Council: Cllr. S White. Accessed 28 January 2012 The area is also the site of the Monnow Vale Integrated Health and Social Care Facility at Drybridge Park. Clawdd-du Mediaeval bridge over Clawdd-du The Clawdd-du, or \\"Black Dyke\\", was a linear defensive earthwork or moat constructed as protection for the mediaeval suburb of Overmonnow. It originally extended, roughly in a semi-circle, for some from the River Monnow opposite Chippenham Fields, westwards and then northwards to the vicinity of the later Drybridge House. The defence comprised a water- filled ditch some 35 to 40 feet (10-12m) wide.M.L.J. Richards, Monnow Bridge and Gate, Alan Sutton Publishing, 1994, , p.3 It is now partly infilled, but still exists for most of its length as a broad ditch used for drainage. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and the remains of the mediaeval bridge across it are a Grade II* listed building. British Listed Buildings: Clawdd-du Bridge. Accessed 28 January 2012 Church of St Thomas the Martyr Notable buildings The Church of St Thomas the Martyr, on the Overmonnow side of the Monnow Bridge, dates at least from the twelfth century. In 1830, it was given its own parish, separate from that of the Priory Church of St Mary in Monmouth town centre. The cross, in the middle of the roundabout beside the church, is of mediaeval origin but was heavily restored in 1888. Overmonnow House, opposite the church, is a former vicarage with a five-bayed Georgian frontage.John Newman, The Buildings of Wales: Gwent/Monmouthshire, Penguin Books, 2000, , p.410 Drybridge House was built in 1671 by William Roberts, on the site of an earlier farmhouse. The house was owned for 400 years by the Crompton-Roberts family. It now houses a community and day care centre. Buildings along the road between Drybridge House and the bridge incorporate in their walls large wooden wallpaper blocks formerly used for hand printing, which were provided in the nineteenth century by the Crompton-Roberts family, who owned a printing business.Kissack, Monmouth and its Buildings, p.60 Governance Overmonnow is a community electoral ward for Monmouth Town Council, electing four town councillors. At the May 2017 elections one of the long standing Conservative councillors lost her seat to Labour candidate Su McConnel. However, the Conservatives regained the seat at a by-election in April 2018.

He is Professor Emeritus of English at The Ohio State University and the author of eight books. Davis has also taught at the University of California, Santa Barbara. His theoretical work engages critically with psychoanalysis, Marxism, existentialism, Hegelian dialectics and postmodernism. For a more general audience, he has written plays and two volumes of essays in cultural criticism. Education and academic career Born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, Davis earned a B.A. from Marquette University in 1964, an M.A. from the same institution in 1966, and a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1969. He taught in the English departments at the University of California at Santa Barbara from 1969 to 1977 and at The Ohio State University from 1977 to 2002, when he retired to focus on writing. Literary theory and criticism As a theorist and critic of literature, Davis has been associated with the 'Chicago School' of R. S. Crane and Wayne C. Booth,Richter, David H., The Critical Tradition, New York: St. Martin's, 1989. 735. but Davis's work shows him to be an engaged critic of these critics.Davis, Walter A. \\"The Humanist Tradition: The Philosophical and Rhetorical Roots of Ideological Paralysis,\\" Art and Politics, London and Ann Arbor: Pluto Press, 2007. His first book, The Act of Interpretation: A Critique of Literary Reason, published by The University of Chicago Press in 1978, stages a series of interpretations of William Faulkner's The Bear as a simultaneous demonstration and critique of critical pluralism. In his later book, Get The Guests: Psychoanalysis, Modern American Drama, and the Audience, Davis takes a more psychoanalytic approach, analyzing in depth five American plays--The Iceman Cometh, A Streetcar Named Desire, Death of a Salesman, Long Day's Journey into Night, and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf‚Äîin terms of their psychological impact upon the audience. Critic Frank Lentricchia called Davis's Get The Guests \\"unparalleled\\" and wrote of the author, \\"Davis is a man of the theatre, he reads plays as theatrical events, and he can get at plays in ways that most people of the theatre cannot because he is a superb theorist and scholar as well.\\"Davis, Walter A. Get The Guests: Psychoanalysis Modern American Drama, and the Audience. Madison: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1994. back cover. Philosophical works Davis's most wide-ranging philosophical work is Inwardness and Existence: Subjectivity in/and Hegel, Heidegger, Marx, and Freud. In this book, Davis adumbrates a theory of the human subject (less technically, \\"the self\\") that dialectically integrates four theories of subjectivity usually considered incompatible: G. W. F. Hegel's self-consciousness, Martin Heidegger's existentialism, Karl Marx's dialectical materialism and related Marxist theories of ideology, and Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis. In his consideration of Hegel, Davis argues that the Structuralism of Claude L√©vi-Strauss and the Deconstruction of Jacques Derrida, Paul de Man, et al. represent prematurely arrested moments in a dialectical movement issuing in Hegelian \\"unhappy consciousness.\\" At other points in the text Davis writes at length upon such topics as sexuality, love, neurosis, psychosis, death, capitalism, freedom and authenticity, seeking always to challenge the consensus of intellectual and/or popular discourse on these topics. In the section on existentialism, for example, Davis attempts to revitalize this philosophy by taking it beyond pop-Sartrean notions of freedom. He emphasizes the extent to which human freedom is not a given but merely a possibility. The struggle to achieve freedom and authenticity proceeds through the hard intellectual work that Davis calls \\"anti-bildung\\", the rooting out of all the ideological obfuscations that have been implanted in us by our families and cultures. Inwardness and Existence has influenced the writings of scholars as diverse as leading Anglican theologian Rowan Williams, former Archbishop of Canterbury,Williams, Rowan. On Christian Theology. Oxford: Blackwell, 2000. 239-40 and film theorist Todd McGowan, who has said of it, \\"No one who reads [Inwardness and Existence] will ever think about existence itself in the same way again. Davis‚Äôs landmark work will profoundly transform anyone who reads it.\\" Building on the idea of anti- bildung, Davis's 2001 book Deracination: Historicity, Hiroshima, and the Tragic Imperative takes the historical trauma of the first atomic bombing as the basis for a radically interdisciplinary investigation of trauma generally and of historical discourse in particular, culminating in a chapter that combines psychoanalysis, history and aesthetics to argue for \\"artistic cognition as a distinct and primary way of knowing.\\"Davis, Walter A. Deracination. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2001. 193. The \\"deracination\\" of the title refers to the necessity of \\"deracinating,\\" or \\"rooting out,\\" the ideological \\"guarantees\\" that structure our responses to events both personal and political. Cultural criticism Davis has written two volumes of essays in cultural criticism. Death's Dream Kingdom: The American Psyche Since 9-11 (2006) contains Davis's clearest and most direct statement of his concept of \\"deracinating\\" the \\"guaranteees\\"Davis, Walter A. Death's Dream Kingdom. London and Ann Arbor: Pluto Press, 2006. as well as essays on the Iraq War, Abu Ghraib, Christian fundamentalism, capitalism, ethics and evil. The essay \\"A Postmodernist Response to 9-11: Slavoj Zizek, or the Jouissance of an Abstract Hegelian\\" contains Davis's critique of critical theorist Slavoj Zizek and an extended critical discussion of Lacanian psychoanalysis. Davis's 2007 book Art and Politics: Psychoanalysis, Ideology, Theatre takes the controversy surrounding the play My Name is Rachel Corrie as a jumping-off point for a discussion of the role of the arts (specifically the theatre) in post 9-11 America. The book includes Davis's \\"Manifesto for a Progressive Theatre\\" and an argument for monologue as the form that can best accomplish the necessary task of dramatically examining what Davis calls \\"the tragic structure of experience.\\".Davis, Walter A. Art and Politics. London and Ann Arbor: Pluto Press, 2007. 119 Plays Davis is both a playwright and an actor in regional theatre. His plays include: The Holocaust Memorial: A Play About Hiroshima; An Evening with JonBenet Ramsey, an exploration of the effects of childhood trauma; Between Two Deaths: Life on the Row, a monologue spoken by a murderer on death row; and Trim: The Tyger Woods Story, a satire of celebrity, media and race in America. As an actor his roles have ranged from Oscar Madison in Neil Simon's The Odd Couple to the title role in King Lear. Fiction Davis is currently at work on an epic-length novel, a vast bildungsroman titled The Last Catholic.

Plot One evening, Felix serves as a conductor to four singing cats. Meanwhile at a house only a few yards away, a hefty man is napping on a chair but gets awakened by their act. To silence them, the man grabs and rolls out a bowling ball, knocking Felix and the other cats off their feet. Felix, however, still insists to go on performing as he plays a flute and his friends dance. Awakened once more, the man takes out an ether sprayer and showers its contents onto the cats. While his friends fall into a snooze, Felix decides to have his sleep at home. Felix enters his apartment, and lies on the sofa. But before he can rest long enough, his dwarf master calls him over. Felix comes in and hears about the dwarf's complaint about an insomnia problem. To assist his master, the cat offers a glass of warm milk but to no effect. The dwarf is still unable to sleep, and therefore craves for some entertainment instead. Felix then plays a clarinet, and the toy soldiers start dancing to his music. After moving around for a few moments, one of the little soldiers fires a small cannon, piercing a picture on a wall with its projectile. The dwarf was amazed by the presentation, and asks Felix to handover the cannon. When Felix gives it and suddenly turns around, the hostile dwarf aims the small weapon at him and fires. Felix was struck at the back and frightenedly flees the apartment. Out in the streets, Felix looks for suitable resting places. He then climbs up a telephone pole, and lies down on a set of pants hanging on one of the lines. Because the lines are brittle, the one holding the pants momentarily snaps, and Felix plummets back to the pavement. Felix wanders further in the neighborhood until he sees a small house on the other side of a fence. He enters it, only to be chased out by the dog inside. Still wanting to take room, the cat stood on the house's roof and blows into the stack, pushing the dog outside. Felix re- enters the house through the stack and immediately closes the door, locking the canine out. The heart-broken dog starts weeping so much that the area is soon flooded by its tears. As a result, the little house starts to float away. Riding on the floating house over time, Felix finds himself landing on the Dark Continent. After being chased by a hippo, the cat suddenly runs into a mountain lion. Thus the two felines started pummeling each other with punches. Following a number of exchanges, Felix became the only one throwing and landing blows. The little cat then slams the mountain lion repeatedly until the latter turns into a pillow. Felix lies down on his newfound pillow and finally goes to sleep.

The series, the 43rd in league history, began on Saturday, October 13 in New York and ended on Thursday, October 18 in Detroit. The Tigers swept the Yankees, winning the series 4‚Äì0. TBS televised all games in the United States. In global markets, MLB International broadcast the ALCS in its entirety, with long-time Baltimore Orioles announcer Gary Thorne and ESPN's Rick Sutcliffe calling the games. This was the third postseason meeting between the Yankees and the Tigers, but the first in the ALCS. The Tigers previously beat the Yankees in the 2006 ALDS (3‚Äì1) and the 2011 ALDS (3‚Äì2). The last appearance for each team in the ALCS resulted in a loss to the Texas Rangers; the Yankees in the 2010 ALCS and the Tigers in the 2011 ALCS. The Tigers would go on to lose in a sweep to the San Francisco Giants in the World Series. Summary =New York Yankees vs. Detroit Tigers= ‚Ä†: postponed from October 17 due to rain Game summaries =Game 1= Saturday, October 13, 2012 ‚Äì 8:07 p.m. (EDT) at Yankee Stadium in Bronx, New York The Yankees threatened in the first inning when they loaded the bases on three walks, but Jhonny Peralta robbed Alex Rodriguez of an RBI single with a diving stop to end the inning. Peralta also took away a run in the second when, with the bases loaded via three singles and two outs once again, Robinson Can√≥ hit a ball that glanced off the wrist of Tiger starter Doug Fister and caromed to shortstop. Peralta fielded it and just nipped Can√≥ at first, which was revealed to be the wrong call. The Yankees would leave the bases loaded for the third time in the game in the sixth inning, and were 1-for-10 with runners in scoring position, with the only hit being an infield single by Ichiro Suzuki that did not score a run. Fister threw shutout ball into the seventh inning, scattering six hits. Postseason veteran Andy Pettitte almost matched him, pitching five shutout innings for the Yankees before giving up RBI singles to Prince Fielder and Delmon Young in the sixth after a triple and intentional walk. A home run by Delmon Young and an RBI single by Avisa√≠l Garc√≠a after a Peralta double in the eighth off Derek Lowe and Boone Logan, respectively, gave Detroit a 4‚Äì0 lead. In the bottom of the ninth, Detroit brought in Jos√© Valverde to get the final three outs. Russell Martin led off the Yankees ninth with a single, and Ichiro Suzuki followed two batters later with a home run to cut the lead in half. Can√≥ then struck out for the second out, and Valverde got to 0‚Äì2 on Mark Teixeira before walking him. Ra√∫l Iba√±ez hit a game-tying home run, forcing extra innings. Rafael Soriano and David Robertson each pitched one scoreless inning out of the bullpen, but the Yankees could not capitalize off Tiger relievers Octavio Dotel and Drew Smyly. Detroit finally broke the tie in the top of the 12th on a Delmon Young double off David Phelps, which scored Miguel Cabrera, who walked to lead off. Six pitches later, Derek Jeter broke his left ankle while stopping a groundball from Peralta, forcing him to miss the rest of the postseason. One batter later, Andy Dirks drove in an insurance run on a chopper that glanced off Phelps' pitching hand for an infield single. The Tigers held on to their two-run lead in the bottom of the 12th, to take the series' first game. Despite the loss, Iba√±ez's clutch homers in both the ALDS and ALCS brought him distinction as the only player to ever hit three home runs in the ninth inning or later in one postseason. This was Derek Jeter's 158th and final playoff game.https://www.baseball- reference.com/players/j/jeterde01.shtml Before getting injured, Jeter recorded his 200th career postseason hit earlier in the game which is still the most all-time. =Game 2= Sunday, October 14, 2012 ‚Äì 4:07 p.m. (EDT) at Yankee Stadium in Bronx, New York Hiroki Kuroda retired the first 15 Detroit Tigers he faced and held the Tigers scoreless through six innings, allowing only one hit and no walks while striking out eight‚Äîincluding seven of the first nine batters. The Tigers' An√≠bal S√°nchez was nearly as efficient, allowing three hits, striking out five and walking two. The Tigers finally broke through with a run off Kuroda in the seventh. Quintin Berry doubled to lead off the inning, and advanced to third on a single by Miguel Cabrera. After Kuroda struck out Prince Fielder, Delmon Young hit an RBI force out, on which the potential double play relay throw was mishandled by Robinson Can√≥. In the eighth, Kuroda struck out the first two batters he faced, then allowed a single Omar Infante. Austin Jackson then singled to right. Nick Swisher fielded the ball and threw it to second as Infante ran past the base and attempted to get back. Baseman Robinson Can√≥'s tag on Infante beat him touching the base, but umpire Jeff Nelson ruled him safe even though television replays confirmed he was out. Yankees Manager Joe Girardi argued during a pitching change and was ejected. The play would have resulted in the inning's third out, and the Tigers took advantage by getting two insurance runs on RBI singles by Avisa√≠l Garc√≠a off of Boone Logan and Miguel Cabrera off of Joba Chamberlain. Prior to the game, Tiger manager Jim Leyland stated that struggling closer Jos√© Valverde, who had allowed seven runs in his last two postseason appearances, would not close Game 2 if the situation called for it. He instead used Phil Coke over the final two innings in this game, and Coke earned the save. The Yankees' lineup continued its struggles in Game 2\\\\. Robinson Can√≥, batting second for the first time since September 2010, grounded out in all four times at bat, with this 0-for-4 performance resulting in an 0-for-26 hitless streak‚Äîthe longest such barren streak in any single year of postseason play in MLB history. Alex Rodriguez took a called third strike on a changeup in the second and struck out on a foul tip in the fourth, dropping to 2-for-21 with no RBIs in the postseason, including 0-for-18 with 12 strikeouts against right-handers. Curtis Granderson fanned twice, falling to 3-for-25 with 13 strikeouts. =Game 3= Tuesday, October 16, 2012 ‚Äì 8:07 p.m. (EDT) at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan Game 3 saw Justin Verlander pitch for the third time against the Yankees in postseason play. In the previous season's Division Series, Verlander struck out 11 batters, but in the process, he expended 120 pitches and gave up four runs. This time around was different, as the Yankees waited out pitches and struck out only three times against him. Nonetheless, Verlander took a shutout into the ninth inning. He allowed only a pair of singles by Ichiro Suzuki and a leadoff homer by Eduardo N√∫√±ez in the ninth. After Brett Gardner grounded out on Verlander's 132nd pitch of the night, the Tigers starter was lifted for Phil Coke. Coke induced a grounder from Suzuki for the second out of the inning, but then gave up consecutive singles to Mark Teixeira and Robinson Can√≥ (Can√≥'s single ended a personal 0-for-29 slump). Postseason star Ra√∫l Iba√±ez worked Coke to a 3‚Äì2 count before striking out on a slider, giving Coke his second save in two games. Delmon Young hit a home run (his seventh post-season home run with the Tigers) in the fourth off of Yankees starter Phil Hughes, who was then lifted because of a stiff back, and manager Joe Girardi's lineup shuffle had Alex Rodriguez benched again. Next inning, Quintin Berry reached first on Yankees third baseman Eric Chavez's error, stole second and scored on Miguel Cabrera's double off of David Phelps. The home run by N√∫√±ez ended a streak of scoreless innings by Tigers starters in the postseason, breaking the 1974 record of 29 innings set by the Oakland Athletics. The Tiger starters had also gone 37 straight innings without surrendering an earned run. =Game 4= Thursday, October 18, 2012 ‚Äì 4:07 p.m. (EDT) at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan, originally scheduled for Wednesday, October 17, 2012 - 8:07 p.m. (EDT) and was postponed due to rain. Game 4 saw Detroit come out swinging early, going up 2‚Äì0 on RBI singles by Delmon Young in the first and Avisa√≠l Garc√≠a in the third. The Tigers broke this game open with a pair of two-run home runs by Miguel Cabrera and Jhonny Peralta. Yankee starter CC Sabathia exited after just innings. The Tigers' Max Scherzer, meanwhile, maintained a no-hitter until the sixth inning, and struck out 10 batters in his innings of work. The Yankees drove in one run in the sixth, when a triple by Eduardo N√∫√±ez was followed by a Nick Swisher double. Austin Jackson homered off of Derek Lowe in the seventh inning, and Peralta closed the scoring with his second homer in the eighth off of David Robertson, to give the Tigers an 8‚Äì1 lead. Former Yankee Phil Coke, who was on the 2009 World Series championship team, closed the game by pitching the final two innings, finishing the series and handing the Yankees their first postseason series sweep since the 1980 American League Championship Series, when they were swept by the Kansas City Royals. It was also the first time the Yankees were swept in a best-of-seven series since the 1976 World Series against the Cincinnati Reds and the 4th time overall. Delmon Young, who hit .353 in the series with two home runs and six RBI, was named ALCS MVP for 2012. The Yankees finished the 2012 postseason hitting a dismal .188, including batting only .157 against Tiger pitching in the ALCS. Tiger starters allowed only two earned runs in the ALCS, posting a 0.66 ERA. Miguel Cabrera set a major league record by having at least one hit in all 17 of his League Championship Series games, besting the previous mark of 15 shared by Manny Ramirez and Pete Rose. Cabrera has also reached base safely in all 20 of his postseason games with the Tigers, a team record. It would be the last time where the #1 seeded teams from every major professional sports league in North America were defeated until 2019.

History The archdeaconry was originally created, on 10 January 1910, from the Archdeaconry of Worcester, and in the Diocese of Worcester. Since 2009 the post has been redefined and renamed as Archdeacon Missioner. From the retirement of Michael Paget-Wilkes in 2009, the Archdeacon of Coventry also had statutory oversight over the Archdeaconry of Warwick, delegated from the Archdeacon Missioner, in preparation for the merging of the two archdeaconries, until that post was replaced by that of Archdeacon Pastor.

The AAGPBL grew to an all-time peak of ten teams in that season, representing Eastern and Western zones, just in the first year the circuit shifted to strictly overhand pitching. Other modifications occurred during 1948. The ball was decreased in size from 11¬Ω inches to 10‚Öú inches, while the base paths were lengthened to 72 feet and the pitching distance increased to 50 feet.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Rules of Play The Chicago Colleens and the Springfield Sallies were added to the previous roster that included the Kenosha Comets, Fort Wayne Daisies, Grand Rapids Chicks, Muskegon Lassies, Peoria Redwings, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox. The Chicago, Fort Wayne, Grand Rapids, Muskegon and South Bend teams were aligned in the East Division, while Kenosha, Peoria, Racine, Rockford and Springfield played in the Western Division. The number of games in the schedule increased from 112 to 126. For the second consecutive year the AAGPBL spring training camp was held in Havana, Cuba. as part of a plan to create an International League of Girls Baseball. Around two hundred girls made the trip. Among them, players represented 27 different states in the United States and many provinces of Canada, while several Cuban players entered the league as a result of holding spring training there the year before. A total of 21 players had been in the league since its foundation in 1943.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2000. Format: Softcover, 294pp. Language: English. The fact of two divisions resulted in the Shaughnessy system adding another round of playoffs to decide the championship between eight teams. The first round faced the top teams of each division in a best-of-three series, with the first place team playing against the third place team and the second place team against the fourth place team. The winners competed in a best-of-five divisional first round, with the first place team facing the third place team and the second place team against the fourth place team. The sectional champions then advanced to the third round and faced in the best-of-seven Championship Series.All- American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book Pitchers continued to dominate the league in that season, even though many of them could not adapt to the new pitching style. Grand Rapids' Alice Haylett led all pitchers with a 0.77 earned run average, while 20 averaged at least a 1.99 mark. In addition, Haylett and Racine's Eleanor Dapkus hurled 10 shutouts a piece. The only .300 hitter was Kenosha's Audrey Wagner (.312), who also led the circuit in hits (130) and total bases (186). At the end of the season Wagner was honored with the AAGPBL Player of the Year Award. The Grand Rapids and Racine teams won their respective division. In the first round, Grand Rapids, Fort Wayne, Racine and Rockford swept South Bend, Muskegon, Peoria and Kenosha, respectively. In the divisional playoffs, Fort Wayne swept Grand Rapids and Rockford did the same with Racine. Then, Rockford jumped out to a three-game lead in the final series and defeated Fort Wayne four games to one. Helen Nicol was credited with four of the 10 playoff wins of Rockford, including two in the finals, while Lois Florreich and Margaret Holgerson took three a piece. In Game 1 of the first round, Florreich pitched the first no-hitter in series history, and Holgerson threw a second no-hitter in Game 3 to set an all-time record for the most playoff no-hitters. Another highlight came in the first round, when South Bend's Jean Faut outdueled Haylett of Grand Rapids, 3‚Äì2, in 20 innings, in what would be the longest game in AAGPBL playoff history. The league drew almost a million fans for the second consecutive season, although the Chicago and Springfield franchises failed to reach the attendance required. Then, the Colleens and the Sallies were turned into player development teams that toured and played exhibition games to recruit and train new players. The tour started in Chicago and ended up in Canada, including stops in Yankee Stadium and Griffith Stadium.Fox 17 Video ‚Äì Doris Cook's Story of the AAGPBL Standings =Eastern Division= { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0;

The 1914 Jubilee Exhibition took place in Kristiania, Norway, from May 5 to October 11, 1914. It marked the centennial anniversary of the 1814 constitution and focused on industry and agriculture. The main location was the grounds of Frogner Manor (the site of the current Frogner Park), in addition to a subsection on shipping at Skarpsno at Frognerkilen. The exhibition opened on 15 May, and was closed on 11 October 1914. The total number of visitors was more than 1.5 million. On 11 October, the final day, more than 100,000 visitors visited the exhibition. Planning The idea for the exhibition is credited to architect Torolf Prytz, in a proposal to the board of Kristiania haandverks- og industriforening in 1907. Prytz became chairman of the planning committee, and later also chairman of the exhibition. Various location alternatives were discussed, including Hoved√∏ya, but it was finally decided on Frogner. In August 1911 the Kristiania city council granted a funding of to the exhibition, in addition to extra funding for street modifications. Exhibition pavilions The cabin designed by Berner & Berner won a prize for best tourist cabin. It was moved to Kols√•s after the exhibition, later known as KIF-hytta. Kongo village at the exhibition Hjalmar Welhaven's ski collection. Poster for the agriculture department. The park area was designed by architect Josef Nickelsen, and leading architects were Henrik Bull, August Nielsen, Rudolf Emanuel Jacobsen and Adolf Jensen. The exhibition showcased developments in Norway over the last 100 years. Among the pavilions were the Industry Hall, the Machinery Hall, restaurants, and more than hundred other buildings. Two locomotives were on display, one constructed at Hamar Jernst√∏peri og Mekaniske Verksted, the other at Thunes Mekaniske Verksted. Kv√¶rner Bruk won a gold medal for their contributions, which included construction elements of the Machinery hall. Lilleborg's soap bubble fountain, which was placed in the Industry Hall, attracted some attention. A department of agriculture included a farm with barn and living house, in addition to separate exhibition buildings for forestry and agriculture. Among the exhibitions was a village with 80 inhabitants brought in from Kongo; it was called the Congo Village. Other amusements were a 700 meter long roller coaster, the Tanagra theatre, and Lilleputbanen. Another display was Hjalmar Welhaven's large collection of skis. A maritime department was located in Frognerkilen, at Skarpsno. Most of the pavilions were demolished after the exhibition, with a few exceptions. Events The exhibition opened on 5 May 1914, and was met with great interest from the public. Among the performances in \\"Sangerhallen\\" was Edvard Grieg's Kongekvadet, and a new cantata written by Nils Collett Vogt with music by Christian Sinding. Actor Johan Fahlstr√∏m recited the national hymn \\"Ja, vi elsker dette landet\\". The exhibition was declared open by King Haakon. In the evening a dinner was given for 1,400 invited guests, which included 300 mayors from various municipalities. Several large gatherings took place during the exhibition period. At one assembly the restaurant served dinner for 4,000 guests. On 4 July a dinner was served for 2,600 guests. In July the exhibition faced some unexpected problems. A tram strike reduced the accessibility drastically. At the outbreak of World War I the Tyrolean orchestra and a German brass band had to leave, heading for the front. On 8 August the number of visitors was below 2,000 for the first time, but from then on the daily number of visitors increased again. On 4 October there were 30,000 visitors. On the closing day, Sunday, 11 October, there were more than 100,000 visitors, and a fireworks ceremony ended the exhibition. During the whole period, the exhibition had total of about 1.5 million visits. The Congo Village- exhibition From the Kongo village. The Kongo village was regarded as popular and exotic; \\"the public appeared as they were mesmerized. All day they could stand and stare at the activities of the around 80 aborigins\\"; spectators \\"let themselves mesmerize by the fantastic African village\\", according to Sverre Bj√∏rstad Graff. (At the time there probably were not any Africans who lived in Oslo, but at traveling fairs (Tivoli) Africans were occasionally encountered.) The exhibition also led to a heated newspaper debate. During the planning stage of the exhibition, a Dagbladet article said that it would be preferable with a large open-air theatre in the entertainment area rather than a \\"gang of filthy, begging rascals from the fever swamps of Zulu\\". Benno Singer was the man behind this exhibition, and he \\"clearly knew what was required to catch the public's attention\\", according to Graff. The village's inhabitants were from Senegal. Reactions to the Congo Village include the 2014 \\"construction of a copy of the Congo Village that stood in Frogner Park in 1914\\", according to Dagbladet. The constructors of the 2014 \\"village\\", will be artists Mohammed Ali Fadlabi and Lars Cuzner.Eg er rasist, men ...

LAGR was funded by DARPA, a research agency of the United States Department of Defense. History and background While mobile robots had been in existence since the 1960s, (e.g. Shakey), progress in creating robots that could navigate on their own, outdoors, off-road, on irregular, obstacle-rich terrain had been slow. In fact no clear metrics were in place to measure progress.See especially appendix C, National Research Council of the National Academies, ‚ÄúTechnology Development for Army Unmanned Ground Vehicles,‚Äù National Academies Press, Washington, D.C., 2002. A baseline understanding of off-road capabilities began to emerge with the DARPA PerceptOR program E. Krotkov, S. Fish, L. Jackel, M. Perschbacher, and J. Pippine, ‚ÄúThe DARPA PerceptOR evaluation experiments.\\" Autonomous Robots, 22(1):pages 19-35, 2007. in which independent research teams fielded robotic vehicles in unrehearsed Government tests that measured average speed and number of required operator interventions over a fixed course over widely spaced waypoints. These tests exposed the extreme challenges of off-road navigation. While the PerceptOR vehicles were equipped with sensors and algorithms that were state-of-the-art for the beginning of the 21st century, the limited range of their perception technology caused them to become trapped in natural cul-de-sacs. Furthermore, their reliance on pre-scripted behaviors did not allow them to adapt to unexpected circumstances. The overall result was that except for essentially open terrain with minimal obstacles, or along dirt roads, the PerceptOR vehicles were unable navigate without numerous, repeated operator intervention. The LAGR program was designed to build on the methodology started in PerceptOR while seeking to overcome the technical challenges exposed by the PerceptOR tests. LAGR goals The principal goal of LAGR was to accelerate progress in off navigation of UGVs. Additional, synergistic goals included (1) establishing benchmarking methodology for measuring progress for autonomous robots operating in unstructured environments, (2) advancing machine vision and thus enabling long-range perception, and (3) increasing the number of institutions and individuals who were able to contribute to forefront UGV research. Structure and rationale of the LAGR program The LAGR program was designed L.D. Jackel, Douglass Hackett, Eric Krotkov, Michael Perschbacher, James Pippine, and Charles Sullivan. ‚ÄúHow DARPA structures its robotics programs to improve locomotion and navigation.\\" Communications of the ACM, 50(11):pages 55-59, 2007. to focus on developing new science for robot perception and control rather than on new hardware. Thus, it was decided to create a fleet of identical, relatively simple robots that would be supplied to the LAGR researchers, who were members of competitive teams, freeing them to concentrate on algorithm development. The teams were each given two robots of the standard design. They developed new software on these robots, and then sent the code to a Government test team that then tested that code on Government robots at various test courses. These courses were located throughout the US and were not previously known to the teams. In this way, the code from all teams could be tested in essentially identical circumstances. After an initial startup period, the code development/test cycle was repeated about once every month. The standard robot was designed and built by the Carnegie Mellon University National Robotics Engineering Center (CMU NREC) Official Website. The vehicles‚Äô computers were preloaded with a modular ‚ÄúBaseline‚Äù perception and navigation system that was essentially the same system that CMU NREC had created for the PerceptOR program and was considered to represent the state-of-the-art at the inception of LAGR. The modular nature of the Baseline system allowed the researchers to replace parts of the Baseline code with their own modules and still have a complete working system without having to create an entire navigation system from scratch. Thus, for example, they were able to compare the performance of their own obstacle detection module with that of the Baseline code, while holding everything else fixed. The Baseline code also served as a fixed reference ‚Äì in any environment and at any time in the program, teams‚Äô code could be compared to the Baseline code. This rapid cycle gave the Government team and the performer teams quick feedback and allowed the Government team to design test courses that challenged the performers in specific perception tasks and whose difficulty was likely to challenge, but not overwhelm, the performers‚Äô current capabilities. Teams were not required to submit new code for every test, but usually did. Despite this leeway, some teams found the rapid test cycle distracting to their long term progress and would have preferred a longer interval between tests. To advance to Phase II, each team had to modify the Baseline code so that on the final 3 tests of Phase I of the Government tests, robots running the team's code averaged at least 10% faster than a vehicle running the original Baseline code. This rather modest ‚ÄúGo/ No Go‚Äù metric was chosen to allow teams to choose risky, but promising approaches that might not be fully developed in the first 18 months of the program. All 8 teams achieved this metric, with some scoring more twice the speed of the Baseline on the later tests which was the objective for Phase II. Note that the Phase I Go / No Go metric was such that teams were not in completion with each other for a limited number of slots on Phase II: any number of teams, from eight to zero could make the grade. This strategy by DARPA was to designed to encourage cooperation and even code sharing among the teams. The LAGR teams Eight teams were selected as performers in Phase I, the first 18 months, of LAGR. The teams were from Applied Perception (Principal Investigator [PI] Mark Ollis), Georgia Tech (PI Tucker Balch), Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PI Larry Matthies), Net-Scale Technologies (PI Urs Muller), NIST (PI James Albus), Stanford University (PI Sebastian Thrun), SRI International (PI Robert Bolles), and University of Pennsylvania (PI Daniel Lee). The Stanford team resigned at the end of Phase I to focus its efforts on the DARPA Grand Challenge; it was replaced by a team from the University of Colorado, Boulder (PI Greg Grudic). Also in Phase II, the NIST team suspended its participation in the competition and instead concentrated on assembling the best software elements from each team into a single system. Roger Bostelman became PI of that effort. The LAGR vehicle The LAGR Vehicle. About 30 were produced. They were about 1 meter high and weighed about 100 kg. The LAGR vehicle, which was about the size of a supermarket shopping cart, was designed to be simple to control. (A companion DARPA program, Learning Locomotion,James Pippine, Douglas Hackett, Adam Watson, ‚Äú An overview of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency‚Äôs Learning Locomotion program,‚Äù International Journal of Robotic Research, Vol 30, Num 2, pages 141-144, 2011 addressed complex motor control.) It was battery powered and had two independently driven wheelchair motors in the front, and two caster wheels in the rear. When the front wheels were rotated in the same direction the robot was driven either forward or reverse. When these wheels were driven in opposite directions, the robot turned. The ~ $30,000 cost of the LAGR vehicle meant that a fleet could be built and distributed to a number of teams expanding on the field of researchers who had traditionally participated in DARPA robotics programs. The vehicle's top speed of about 3 miles/ hour and relatively modest weight of ~100 kg meant that it posed a much reduced safety hazard compared to vehicles used in previous programs in unmanned ground vehicles and thus further reduced the budget required for each team to manage its robot. Nevertheless, the LAGR vehicles were sophisticated machines. Their sensor suite included 2 pairs of stereo cameras, an accelerometer, a bumper sensor, wheel encoders, and a GPS. The vehicle also had three computers that were user-programmable. Scientific results A cornerstone of the program was incorporation of learned behaviors in the robots. In addition, the program used passive optical systems to accomplish long-range scene analysis. The difficulty of testing UGV navigation in unstructured, off-road environments made accurate, objective measurement of progress a challenging task. While no absolute measure of performance had been defined in LAGR, the relative comparison of a team's code to that of the Baseline code on a given course demonstrated whether progress was being made in that environment. By the conclusion of the program, testing showed that many of the performers had attained leaps in performance. In particular, average autonomous speeds where increased by factor of 3 and useful visual perception was extended to ranges as far as 100 meters.For detailed discussion of LAGR results see the Special Issues of Journal of Field Robotics, Vol 23 issues 11/12 2006 and Vol 26 issue 1/2 2009. While LAGR did succeed in extending the useful range of visual perception, this was primarily done by either pixel or patch-based color or texture analysis. Object recognition was not directly addressed. Even though the LAGR vehicle had a WAAS GPS, its position was never determined down to the width of the vehicle, so it was hard for the systems to re-use obstacle maps of areas the robots had previously traversed since the GPS continually drifted. The drift was especially severe if there was a forest canopy. A few teams developed visual odometry algorithms that essentially eliminated this drift. LAGR also had the goal of expanding the number of performers and removing the need for large system integration so that valuable technology nuggets created by small teams could be recognized and then adopted by the larger community. Some teams developed rapid methods for learning with a human teacher: a human could Radio Control (RC) operate the robot and give signals specifying ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-safe‚Äù areas and the robot could quickly adapt and navigate with the same policy. This was demonstrated when the robot was taught to be aggressive in driving over dead weeds while avoiding bushes or alternatively taught to be timid and only drive on mowed paths. LAGR was managed in tandem with the DARPA Unmanned Ground Combat Vehicle ‚Äì PerceptOR Integration Program (UPI) CMU NREC UPI Website. UPI combined advanced perception with a vehicle of extreme mobility. The best stereo algorithms and the visual odometry from LAGR were ported to UPI. In addition interactions between the LAGR PIs and the UPI team resulted in the incorporation of adaptive technology into the UPI codebase with a resultant improvement in performance of the UPI \\"Crusher\\" robots. Program management LAGR was administered under the DARPA Information Processing Technology Office. Larry Jackel conceived the program and was the program manager from 2004 to 2007. Eric Krotkov, Michael Perschbacher, and James Pippine contributed to LAGR conception and management. Charles Sullivan played a major role in LAGR testing. Tom Wagner was the program manager from mid-2007 to the program conclusion in early 2008.

A recent study conducted by Nate Silver of fivethirtyeight.com, found that Atlanta was the second most segregated city in the U.S. and the most segregated in the South.Silver, Nate; ‚ÄòThe Most Diverse Cities Are Often The Most Segregated‚Äô; FiveThirtyEight; May 1, 2015 at 8:28 AM this was one of the main challenges faced by the residents of Atlanta in the 80s. Post-Civil War =De facto residential segregation= After the war ended, Atlanta received migrants from surrounding counties, as well as new settlers to the region. Many freedmen moved from plantations to towns or cities for work, including Atlanta; Fulton County went from 20.5 percent black in 1860 to 45.7 percent black in 1870. Many refugees were destitute without even proper clothing or shoes; the American Missionary Association (AMA) helped fill the gap, and the Freedmen's Bureau also offered much help, though erratically.Allison Dorsey, To Build Our Lives Together, p. 34ff. The destruction of the housing stock by the Union army in the Battle of Atlanta, together with the massive influx of refugees, resulted in a severe housing shortage. to lots with a small house rented for $5 per month, while those with a glass pane rented for $20. High rents rather than laws led to de facto segregation due to simple economics, with most blacks settling into areas at the edge of the city like Jenningstown (pop. 2,490), Shermantown (2,486) and Summerhill (pop. 1,512), where housing was substandard but rented at rates that were regarded as inflated. Shermantown and Summerhill sat in low-lying areas, prone to flooding and sewage overflows, which resulted in outbreaks of disease in the late 19th century. Housing was substandard; an AMA missionary remarked that many houses were \\"rickety shacks\\" rented at inflated rates. The Fifth Ward, now the Fairlie-Poplar district and areas north of it, was home to the greatest number of blacks before the war, but dropped to third place (pop. 2,436) among black neighborhoods by 1870. Mechanicsville would develop as an additional black neighborhood in the 1870s. Race Riot and aftermath =Jim Crow laws= Sign at entrance to Ponce de Leon amusement park in 1908 indicating \\"colored persons admitted as servants only\\" Jim Crow laws were passed in swift succession in the years following the Atlanta Race Riot in 1906. The result was in some cases segregated facilities, with nearly always inferior conditions for black customers, but in many cases it resulted in no facilities at all available to blacks, e.g. all parks were designated whites- only (although a private park, Joyland, did open in 1921). In 1910, the city council passed an ordinance requiring that restaurants be designated for one race only, hobbling black restaurant owners who had been attracting both black and white customers. In the same year, Atlanta's streetcars were segregated, with black patrons required to sit in the rear. If not enough seats were available for all white riders, the blacks sitting furthest forward in the trolley were required to stand and give their seats to whites. In 1913, the city created official boundaries for white and black residential areas. And in 1920, the city prohibited black-owned salons from serving white women and children.Lawrence Otis Graham, Our Kind of People: inside America's Black upper class, p. 335 Beyond this, blacks were subject to the South's racial protocol, whereby, according to the New Georgia Encyclopedia:‚ÄòSegregation‚Äô, New Georgia Encyclopedia > all blacks were required to pay obeisance to all whites, even those whites > of low social standing. And although they were required to address whites by > the title \\"sir,\\" blacks rarely received the same courtesy themselves. > Because even minor breaches of racial etiquette often resulted in violent > reprisals, the region's codes of deference transformed daily life into a > theater of ritual, where every encounter, exchange, and gesture reinforced > black inferiority. =Gone with the Wind premiere= On December 15, 1939, Atlanta hosted the premiere of Gone with the Wind, the movie based on Atlanta resident Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel. Stars Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, and Olivia de Havilland were in attendance. The premiere was held at Loew's Grand Theatre, at Peachtree and Forsyth Streets, current site of the Georgia-Pacific building. An enormous crowd, numbering 300,000 people according to the Atlanta Constitution, filled the streets on this ice-cold night in Atlanta. Absence of film's black stars at event Noticeably absent was Hattie McDaniel, who would win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Mammy, as well as Butterfly McQueen (Prissy). The black actors were barred from attending the premiere, from appearing in the souvenir program, and from all the film's advertising in the South. Director David Selznick had attempted to bring McDaniel to the premiere, but MGM advised him not to. Clark Gable angrily threatened to boycott the premiere, but McDaniel convinced him to attend anyway.Harris, Warren G. Clark Gable: A Biography, Harmony, (2002), p. 203; McDaniel did attend the Hollywood debut thirteen days later, and was featured prominently in the program.Watts, Jill. Hattie McDaniel: Black Ambition, White Hollywood, 2005, page 172 - Controversial participation of Martin Luther King Martin Luther King Jr. sang at the gala as part of a children's choir of his father's church, Ebenezer Baptist.Atlanta Premiere of Gone With The Wind The boys dressed as pickaninnies and the girls wore \\"Aunt Jemima\\"-style bandanas, dress seen by many blacks as humiliating.John Egerton, Speak now against the day, p.240\\"The little known story of MLK's 'drum major for justice'\\", Atlanta Journal-Constitution, October 16, 2011 John Wesley Dobbs tried to dissuade Rev. King Sr. from participating at the whites-only event, and Rev. King Sr. was harshly criticized in the black community. =Blockbusting and racial transition in neighborhoods= In the late 1950s, after forced-housing patterns were outlawed, violence, intimidation and organized political pressure was used in some white neighborhoods to discourage blacks from buying homes there. However, by the late 1950s, such efforts proved futile as blockbusting drove whites to sell their homes in neighborhoods such as Adamsville, Center Hill, Grove Park in northwest Atlanta, and white sections of Edgewood and on the east side. In 1962, the city attempted to thwart blockbusting by erecting road barriers in Cascade Heights, countering the efforts of civic and business leaders to foster Atlanta as the \\"city too busy to hate.\\" This incident would come to be known as \\"Atlanta's Berlin Wall\\" or the \\"Peyton Road Affair.\\" But efforts to stop transition in Cascade failed too. Neighborhoods of new black homeowners took root, helping alleviate the enormous strain of the lack of housing available to African Americans. Atlanta's western and southern neighborhoods transitioned to majority black ‚Äî between 1950 and 1970 the number of census tracts that were at least ninety percent black tripled. East Lake, Kirkwood, Watts West Road, Reynoldstown, Almond Park, Mozley Park, Center Hill and Cascade Heights underwent an almost total transition from white to black. From 1960 to 1970, the black proportion of the city's population rose from 38 to 51 percent. Meanwhile, during the same decade, the city lost sixty thousand white residents, a 20 percent decline.David Andrew Harmon, Beneath the image of the Civil Rights Movement and race relations, p. 177ff. White flight and the building of malls in the suburbs triggered a slow decline of downtown as a central shopping district; however, it would continue its role as a government center and add the role of lodging and entertainment center for convention traffic. =Civil Rights Movement= Martin Luther King Jr. In the wake of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education, which helped usher in the Civil Rights Movement, racial tensions in Atlanta erupted in acts of violence. For example, on October 12, 1958, a Reform Jewish temple on Peachtree Street was bombed. The \\"Confederate Underground\\" claimed responsibility. Many believed that Jews, especially those from the northeast, were advocates of the Civil Rights Movement. In the 1960s, Atlanta was a major organizing center of the Civil Rights Movement, with Martin Luther King Jr. and students from Atlanta's historically black colleges and universities playing major roles in the movement's leadership. On October 19, 1960, a sit- in at the lunch counters of several Atlanta department stores led to the arrest of Dr. King and several students. This drew attention from the national media and from presidential candidate John F. Kennedy. Despite this incident, Atlanta's political and business leaders fostered Atlanta's image as \\"the city too busy to hate.\\" While the city mostly avoided confrontation, minor race riots did occur in 1965 and in 1968. =Desegregation= Desegregation of the public sphere came in stages, with buses and trolleybuses desegregated in 1959,\\"Bus desegregation in Atlanta\\", Digital Library of Georgia restaurants at Rich's department store in 1961\\"Rich's Department Store\\" New Georgia Encyclopedia (though Lester Maddox's Pickrick restaurant famously remained segregated through 1964),\\"Lester Maddox\\", New Georgia Encyclopedia and movie theaters in 1962-3.‚ÄúNegroes Attend Atlanta Theaters,‚Äù Atlanta Journal, 15 May 1962Daily Report In 1961, Mayor Ivan Allen Jr. became one of the few Southern white mayors to support desegregation of his city's public schools, although initial compliance was token, and in reality desegregation occurred in stages from 1961 to 1973. Current state of residential segregation 2000 map of race and ethnicity in Atlanta; whites still live largely in the north side of the metro area; blacks in the south There is no one definitive method for measuring residential segregation, and differing methods reveal different results. In general, the metro area is more integrated than the city of Atlanta. According to the 2000 Census Bureau study, among the fifty largest U.S. cities, Atlanta ranks just below average, with 8.8 percent of residents living on integrated blocks vs. 9.4 percent on average. However, among the twenty cities with the highest proportion of blacks in their populations (Atlanta having the fifth highest percentage), Atlanta ranks second to last, with only Chicago having fewer residents (5.7 percent) living on integrated blocks.Lois M. Quinn et al., \\"Racial Integration in Urban America: A Block Level Analysis of African American and White Housing Patterns\\", University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee Metro Atlanta ranked high in a 2000 measure of residents living on integrated blocks, at 18.4 percent ranking 14th among the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas. However measured by a longstanding \\"dissimilarity index\\", Metro Atlanta ranked 63rd out of 100. In a study that measured how many Metro Atlanta blacks lived on blocks that were at least 20 percent black and 20 percent white, Metro Atlanta ranked at the lower end of the group of more heavily black metro areas, at 25.8 percent. Nevertheless, Metro Atlanta had one of the highest proportions of whites living on blocks that were at least 20 percent black and 20 percent white, with its tally of 14.1 percent ranking eleventh out of 100. Within metropolitan Atlanta, racial residential segregation tends to be more prominent in highly urbanized counties in comparison to more suburban counties. DeKalb county and Fulton county, which are the most urban counties in metro Atlanta are the most segregated of the ten counties that constitute the metro area according to the Atlanta Regional Commission. Atlanta's Black population continues to be centralized in older urban neighborhoods and isolated from the growing number of employment opportunities that are becoming increasingly available in the suburban regions of the city as urban sprawl in the metro area increases. The continued racial residential segregation in Atlanta is also affected by racial stereotyping and race based perceptions. In regards to prejudice and racial segregation, negative racial stereotypes and the fear of group threat from Black residents contribute to white resistance to integration while negative racial stereotypes and the perception of whites as being discriminatory contribute to black resistance to integrate. Racial residential segregation in metro Atlanta is also highly correlated to economic residential segregation. For census tract groups within Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton, and Gwinnett counties, 22.14% of the population is below the poverty level for the block groups that are 81-90% black whereas, for block groups that are 81-90% white, only 1.40% of the population is below the poverty level. For the Hispanic and Asian populations, block groups that are around 31-40% Asian or 41-50% Hispanic tend to have higher poverty rates than blocks with a higher or lower percentage of Hispanic or Asian residents. Nevertheless, in some ways metro Atlanta has become increasingly more integrated as the dissimilarity index for blacks or African Americans has decreased by 12.5% from 1980 to 2000 and the isolation index has decreased by 4.5%. On the other hand, the dissimilarity index and isolation index increased for Hispanics or Latinos as Atlanta had the second largest increase in residential segregation for Hispanics and Latinos out of the metropolitan statistical areas studied by the US Census Bureau. While Atlanta still maintains a dissimilarity and isolation index for African Americans and a dissimilarity index for Latinos that is higher than average for metropolitan areas in the US, the city's dissimilarity index for black residents is also decreasing at a higher than average rate which reflects the city's growing rate of integration. Certain areas of the city are predominantly black or white (See also Demographics of Atlanta:Neighborhoods):U. S. Census Bureau data as tabulated on Demographics of Atlanta:Neighborhoods * sixty percent of the city's area consists of largely black neighborhoods: together, Northwest, Southwest, and Southeast Atlanta are 92 percent black * there are some areas that are predominantly white, notably Buckhead and Northeast Atlanta (NPUs F and N: Virginia- Highland, Morningside/Lenox Park, Inman Park, Candler Park, Poncey-Highland, Reynoldstown, Cabbagetown, Lake Claire) which are on average 80% white References Category:African-American history in Atlanta Atlanta ","title":"Racial segregation in Atlanta"},{"id":"34529374","text":"David Wise (born June 30, 1990) is an American freestyle skier.

Composed in 1806, after the death of Lord Nelson, hero of the Napoleonic Wars, and first published in 1807,http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poems/character-happy-warrior the poem purports to describe the ideal \\"man in arms\\" and has, through ages since, been the source of much metaphor in political and military life. Summary Wordsworth begins by asking us \\"Who is the happy Warrior? Who is he / What every man in arms should wish to be?\\".Harvard Classics, vol. 41. English Poetry, in three volumes, vol. ii. From Collins to Fitzgerald. pp. 656‚Äì658. He then proceeds to answer his own query: The Happy Warrior is a generous spirit, who, amidst, or, in spite of, the tasks of real life, hath done what pleased his innocent, \\"childish thought\\". His noble ideas and deeds are \\"an inward light\\" (not unlike the Quaker belief in an inner light) that, despite their inwardness, make the path before the warrior \\"always bright.\\" The Happy Warrior is a diligent student, eager to amass whatever knowledge comes his way; furthermore, and as a result, his principal concern must be his own moral being. All fearsome challenges he transmutes, subduing what negative qualities they may have, and learning from what good they have to offer. The warrior is \\"skilful in self-knowledge\\" (like the philosophers of ancient Greece, living by the famous injunction to \\"know one's self\\") and understands that the true purpose of \\"suffering and distress\\" is to grow in compassion and \\"tenderness\\". His law and dearest friend is Reason; he owes all of his triumphs to Virtue. If he achieves high station, he does so honestly; if he can not act honestly whilst in office, he would sooner quit. Because he is single-mindedly faithful, he does not seek his own advancement. He has a \\"peculiar grace\\" that shows itself in any action that he takes, no matter how great or humble. Our Warrior is \\"happy as a Lover\\" in the face of the greatest strife; he keeps the law, no matter how severe any conflict may be; when called upon for any task, the Happy Warrior is always equal to it. Though he deals well with all things perilous and turbulent, he aspires to \\"homefelt pleasures and to gentle scenes\\" (like Cincinnatus or George Washington). He is not content with any one good or great deed, but always seeks to top himself; and furthermore, for all the worldly esteem he may attain, he, in all his greatness, knows that not even the esteem of history is the most important a man can attain, but that of God: indeed, so long as the Happy Warrior \\"finds comfort in himself and in his cause\\", he will have the approval of Heaven, and that, he finally knows, is the only mark of greatness. The poet concludes with a statement echoing his initial question: \\"This is the happy Warrior; this is he / Whom every Man in arms should wish to be\\". Meter and rhyme The poem is in iambic pentameter, and is composed mostly in rhyming couplets: thus is the poem written in heroic couplets, fitting for a composition extolling those virtues most apparent in \\"men in arms,\\" and found often in epic works such as Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. As in much other heroic verse, the poet here seems to object nothing to the occasional poetic triplet.Baer 2006 Historical basis Wordsworth modelled his Happy Warrior on Lord Nelson, who, though his fleet was victorious, had been killed at the Battle of Trafalgar by a French sniper. Nelson had been famous for his loving, inspirational leadership,Lambert 2004, pp.107‚Äì109 and had, in previous battles, lost an arm and the sight in one eye, yet persisted in his pursuit of greatness. Other uses in history In nominating Alfred E. Smith for the presidency at the 1924 Democratic National Convention, Franklin D. Roosevelt notably referred to Smith as \\"the happy warrior\\", apparently at the behest of Joseph M. Proskauer,https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/22/opinion/l-don-t-credit-fdr-with- happy-warrior-179922.html Smith's close friend, campaign advisor and speech writer.http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courts/ad1/centennial/Bios/jmproskauer2.shtml Hubert Humphrey was also frequently referred to as \\"the Happy Warrior\\". Barack Obama, after winning a second term as President, referred to Vice-President Joe Biden as \\"America's Happy Warrior\\" in his acceptance speech. The words \\"happy warrior\\", an apparent reference to Wordsworth's poem, were famously found written in the personal notes which then-Labour Party leader Ed Miliband accidentally left behind after one of the leaders' debates prior to the 2015 general election.https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32188119 References External links * Character of the Happy Warrior on Bartleby Category:Poetry by William Wordsworth Category:British poetry Category:1807 poems ","title":"Character of the Happy Warrior"},{"id":"34529434","text":"Noah Bowman (born May 8, 1992) is a Canadian freestyle skier.

As a graduate student, Levine's important mentors included Robert Redfield and Richard McKeon. He also spent a formative year in Germany in 1952‚Äì1953 as the University's first exchange student at the Goethe University of Frankfurt. Except for five years abroad, Levine lived in Chicago ever since receiving his doctorate in Sociology. His dissertation focused on a comparison of the works of Georg Simmel and Talcott Parsons. During his postdoctoral fellowship, he spent three years in Ethiopia, which included teaching courses at University College of Addis Ababa. He joined the faculty at the University of Chicago in 1962 and started a program on African civilization. Over time, he served as a professor of Sociology there, and its dean of undergraduate college.Bob Goldsborough (2015), Donald Levine, believer in liberal arts education, dies at 83, Chicago Tribune He later held the Peter B. Ritzma chair in Sociology (Professor Emeritus) at the University. Levine died on April 4, 2015. Career Throughout his career, Levine remained engaged with four primary areas of work: undergraduate education, sociological theory, Ethiopian Studies, and the Japanese martial art of aikido. Levine made distinctive contributions to the teaching of undergraduates throughout five decades of service at the University of Chicago. As chair of the staff of the Social Sciences 121-2-3 sequence in the 1960s, he reorganized the yearlong course into its current form as Self, Culture & Society. As founding Master of the Social Sciences Collegiate Division from 1965 to 1968, Levine also introduced programs, including the African Civilization sequence and the Public Policy concentration program, that remain vital to this day.http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/960523/levine.shtml Subsequently, Levine initiated the concentration program in Environmental Studies. As Dean of the College in the 1980s, he led a searching reexamination of the College curriculum, which resulted in enriched research opportunities for students, strengthened programs in the teaching of writing and foreign languages, and an expansion of the Common Core from one to two years. Levine also created novel courses of his own, some described in his 2005 book, Powers of the Mind: The Reinvention of Liberal Learning in America, which focuses on Chicago‚Äôs distinctive traditions of higher education. He received the Quantrell Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1971, and won the Amoco Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1996.http://www.uchicago.edu/about/accolades/quantrell.shtml In 1985 he was awarded a chair, the Peter B. Ritzma Professorship. In the area of social theory, Levine published a hundred papers and five books. He was especially well known for his critical interpretations of Auguste Comte, Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, Talcott Parsons, Robert Merton, S.N. Eisenstadt, and above all Georg Simmel, in whose writings he is often credited for helping to inspire a renaissance of interest. His book, Georg Simmel on Individuality and Social Forms is one of the definitive collections of Simmel's sociological contributions. He taught classical sociological theory to first-year students in Chicago's Department of Sociology for decades. He was elected Chair of the Theory Section of the American Sociological Association in 1997, and for two decades served as editor of the University of Chicago Press's Heritage of Sociology series. Levine served on the editorial boards of the American Journal of Sociology, Journal of Classical Sociology, Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, and Theory, Culture & Society. For five decades, Levine was also active in the area of Ethiopian Studies. In this, field he published two seminal books and dozens of papers. He organized the Fifth International Conference of Ethiopian Studies at the University of Chicago in 1978. For his expertise as an Ethiopianist he served as consultant to public and governmental organizations, include the U.S. Department of State, the United States Senate, and the Peace Corps. Before joining the Chicago faculty in 1962, he taught at Ethiopia's University College of Addis Ababa. Levine eventually received a Doctor of Letters honoris causa in 2004 from Addis Ababa University, where his citation read: \\"Ethiopianist, sociological theorist, educator: you have succeeded in all three vocations. Your pioneering work, Wax and Gold, has become an Ethiopian classic. As manifested in its title, yours is an exceptionally imaginative quest to reach an understanding of Amhara society from the internal point of view. The very concept of \\"Wax and Gold\\" has taken a life of its own: it figures at once in our understanding of Ethiopia's pre-modern culture and in our coming to grips with Ethiopia's reception of modernity. Greater Ethiopia draws attention to the deep fact that Ethiopian life is rooted in multicultural identities, and it also demonstrates the salient bonds that hold them together.\\" In 1979, Levine began the practice of aikido, to which he remained devoted ever since. In 2003, he was promoted to the rank of yondan (4th-degree black belt) through the Aikido Schools of Ueshiba. He served as head instructor of the University of Chicago Aikido Club since the late 1980s. In 1986 he began teaching a credit course, Conflict Theory and Aikido, described in Powers of the Mind. The course helps students to understand and manage social conflict by combining texts from a number of disciplines with regular training in aikido‚Äôs aggression-neutralizing techniques. He was founding president of Aiki Extensions Inc., a non-profit organization that networks and supports individuals involved with ‚Äúoff-the- mat‚Äù aikido applications. In 2011 he compiled a selection of his articles related to aikido under the title, Aiki Waza Michi Shirube, Aikido Practice is a Signpost to the Way.

Specialised triggers are produced for specific instruments. A snare drum trigger, for example, will often have two channels, one each for the rim and head, while a tom-tom drum trigger usually needs to only register strokes to the drum head. Drum triggers gained great attention in the beginning of the 1990s, being extensively used on bass drums in heavy metal music. The advantage of using drum triggers is that potential problems associated with using microphones can be overcome by triggering pre-recorded samples. It is commonly quoted that less effort is required from the drummer when using drum triggers. The drum module to which the trigger is connected can be adjusted to accommodate a range of volumes, thus preserving the dynamic range of the drummer's playing. Triggers have a greater use in live performances than in studio recordings, since some drummers dislike the processed triggered sound, labelled by some as artificial.

Handling about a fifth of the world's total, it is the world's largest ship breaking yard, employs over 200,000 Bangladeshis, and accounts for around one-half of all the steel in Bangladesh. History Workers at Chittagong ship breaking yard. Note the lack of safety boots and hard hats Sunset at a ship breaking yard in Chittagong In 1960, after a severe cyclone, the Greek ship M D Alpine was stranded on the shores of Sitakunda, Chittagong. It could not be re-floated and so remained there for several years. In 1965, Chittagong Steel House bought the ship and had it scrapped. It took years to scrap the vessel, but the work gave birth to the industry in Bangladesh. During the Bangladesh Liberation War, a Pakistani ship Al Abbas was damaged by bombing. Later on, the ship was salvaged by a Soviet team who were working at Chittagong port at the time and the ship was brought to the Faujdarhat seashore. A local company, Karnafully Metal Works Ltd bought it as scrap in 1974 and introduced commercial ship breaking in the country. The industry grew steadily through the 1980s and, by the middle of the 1990s, the country ranked number two in the world by tonnage scrapped. In 2008, there were 26 ship breaking yards in the area, and in 2009 there were 40. From 2004 to 2008, the area was the largest ship-breaking yard in the world. However, by 2012 it had dropped from half to a fifth of worldwide ship-breaking. At one stage the industry was a tourist attraction, but outsiders are no longer welcome due to its poor safety record; a local watchdog group claims that one worker dies a week on average. Workers have neither protective equipment nor financial security. In 2014, shipping company Hapag-Lloyd followed an earlier decision by Maersk to stop using the yard for breaking its old ships, despite the higher costs elsewhere. A scene of the movie Avengers: Age of Ultron was shot at the ship breaking yards of Chittagong.

Bloch states the principle in Latin as: Nihil est in infinito quod non prius fuerit in finito, and explains this as follows: Every proposition in whose statement the actual infinity occurs can be always considered a consequence, almost immediate, of a proposition where it does not occur, a proposition in finite terms. Bloch mainly applied this principle to the theory of functions of a complex variable. Thus, for example, according to this principle, Picard's theorem corresponds to Schottky's theorem, and Valiron's theorem corresponds to Bloch's theorem. Based on his Principle, Bloch was able to predict or conjecture several important results such as the Ahlfors's Five Islands theorem, Cartan's theorem on holomorphic curves omitting hyperplanes, Hayman's result that an exceptional set of radii is unavoidable in Nevanlinna theory. In the more recent times several general theorems were proved which can be regarded as rigorous statements in the spirit of the Bloch Principle: Zalcman's lemma Let \\\\\\\\{f_n\\\\\\\\} be a sequence of meromorphic functions in a region D, which is not a normal family. Then there exist a sequence of points z_n in D and positive numbers \\\\rho_n with \\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}\\\\rho_{n}=0 such that : f_n(z_n+\\\\rho_nz)\\\\to f, where f is a non-constant meromorphic function in the complex plane.

Then there exists a metric on X such that every holomorphic map from the unit disc with the Poincar√© metric to X does not increase distances.Lang (1987).

This plant is a monocotyledonous woody vine that forms dense colonial thickets and climbs over other vegetation. The stems reach five meters or more in length. They are \\"viciously armed\\" with prickles that may be over a centimeter long. The plant grows from a huge woody, tuberous rhizome. The sprouts may grow up to 7 centimeters per day. The leathery evergreen leaves are linear, lance-shaped, or oval and reach 13 centimeters long by 6 wide. The petioles twist to bear the leaves in an erect position. The inflorescence is an umbel of up to 25 flowers borne in the leaf axils. Each flower has whitish or yellowish tepals each about half a centimeter long. The fruit is a shiny, waxy black berry 5 to 8 millimeters long. The berries mature in the second growing season after they first appear. This plant grows in bogs, swamps, and marshy areas. It is a dominant plant in pocosins. The soils are wet to saturated and the sites are often flooded. It is common in the Everglades and it is \\"characteristic\\" of the Okefenokee Swamp understory flora. It grows beneath cypress, swamp blackgum (N. sylvatica), white bay (Magnolia virginiana), loblolly bay (Gordonia lasianthus), sweet bay (Persea borbonia), red maple (Acer rubrum), cassena (Ilex cassine), titi (Cyrilla racemiflora), and southern white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides). In the understory it is associated with hurrahbush (Lyonia lucida), leucothoe (Leucothoe racemosa), sweetspire (Itea virginica), poor-man's soap (Clethra alnifolia), coral greenbrier (S. walteri), and honeycup (Zenobia pulverulenta). This plant competes with and inhibits tree seedlings such as those of southern white cedar. In sunny sites it grows better and can form dense thickets. When burned or damaged it resprouts vigorously from its large rhizome. This rapidly climbing vine is a silvicultural pest. This plant provides habitat for many types of animals, such as white-tailed deer, bobcat, gray squirrel, Eastern diamondback rattlesnake, American alligator, pine barrens tree frog, and the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker. It grows alongside a variety of rare such as white wickey (Kalmia cuneata), arrowleaf shieldwort (Peltandra sagittaefolia), spring-flowering goldenrod (Solidago verna), and rough-leaf loostrife (Lysimachia asperulaefolia). Native American groups used this plant medicinally. For example, the Cherokee used it for sores and burns. The tuberous rhizome was also a food source; the Choctaw made it into fried cakes and bread.

He currently lives in Asheville, North Carolina. Biography =Early life= Herr grew up in Phoenix, Arizona and attended Northern Arizona University. He spent his early twenties traveling and seeking adventure throughout the US west coast, Mexico, Australia, and Asia. At 26, he moved to South West Virginia where he met his wife, Kara. He lives and works in Asheville with his wife and two daughters. =Career= In 2006, Herr began to show his art publicly. He approached Betsey-Rose Weiss the next year with a CD of his works. Upon viewing Herr's paintings, Weiss decided that he would be the first artist she would choose to represent as the new owner of an Asheville gallery. Herr was exhibited at the 20th annual Outsider Art Fair in New York in January 2012. His work was represented at the Outsider Art Fair by Marcia Weber Art Objects, a gallery that sells a large number of his works to collectors worldwide. Themes and materials Much of Herr's work is laden with spiritual allusions. His interest in religion can be seen in two of his older series based on Abraham's Covenant and the poetry of 13th century Persian mystic Rumi. His series working man's mystic addresses the relationship between ego death and the desire to connect with God. His use of layering expresses an interest in the perception of memory. Herr often sacrifices realism for essence. Paintings of his daughters are not portraits of their physical characteristics, but rather they capture the girls' wonderment and innocence. Having grown up in the southwest, Herr is fascinated with rough environments. His work represents this through journalistic portrayals of states of mind, as opposed to landscapes.

They were founded in Pirmasens, Germany, in 1855 by the Blessed Paul Joseph Nardini. They are therefore commonly known as the Nardini Sisters, or the Mallersdorfer Sisters from the German town where they are headquartered. Origins The Blessed Paul Nardini had been born out of wedlock in 1821 in the Palatinate, then within the Kingdom of Bavaria. He had suffered a deprived childhood until he was adopted by a great-aunt and her Italian husband. He later developed a strong calling to the priesthood, and began the studies needed to prepare for this. He was sent by Johannes von Geissel, the Bishop of Speyer, to do his study of theology at the University of Munich, where he graduated summa cum laude. Despite the encouragement of his professors to remain at the University and teach, Nardini was determined to be a parish priest.\\"Paul Joseph Nardini (1821-1862)\\", Vatican News Services After his ordination in 1846, Nardini served in various positions in the vicinity of Speyer, until on 17 February 1851 he was entrusted by the bishop with the pastoral care of the poor parish of Pirmasens. It would be a post he held until his death. The pastorate of Pirmasens was a difficult post as it was in a town divided between a Catholic population and the dominant Protestant populace. The Catholics suffered economic discrimination, forced into menial jobs, with their children reduced to begging on the streets. Their new pastor was determined to improve the conditions of his congregation. He began to develop programs of charity to meet their needs. His first thought in providing social care was to invite a community of Religious Sisters to come and care for the Catholics of the city. He was fiercely resisted in this plan by the local Town Council, composed entirely of Protestants. Nardini, however, held fast and three members of the Sisters of the Holy Redeemer came from their Motherhouse in Niederbronn. They nursed the sick and cared for and educated the children. Foundation The modest, rented home occupied by the Sisters was soon filled with sick, neglected elderly people and poverty-stricken street children. To make things worse, the following winter was extremely severe and accompanied by an outbreak of typhoid fever. The Sisters were at the bedside of the sick continuously until they themselves contracted the disease. The superiors at Niederbronn hinted that they were considering withdrawal of the small community of four Sisters. At that same time the government issued a decree forbidding foundations of Sisters based outside Germany. As the Sisters' Motherhouse was located in Alsace, a part of France, they were considered foreigners. Nardini determined that the only answer to guarantee the continuity of his work was to establish a new congregation committed to it. As a result, when the Superior General of the Sisters recalled one of the Sisters upon a fresh outbreak of typhus, to this end he invited two young local women, Barbara Schwarz and Juliana Michel, members of the Third Order of St. Francis, to move into the little convent. On 2 March 1855 he gave them a religious habit and the religious names of Sister Agatha and Sister Aloysia. Nardini was a member of the Franciscan Third Order himself, and gave them the Rule of the Franciscan Third Order Regular for their way of life. The Sisters of the Holy Redeemer withdrew from the town at that point, entrusting their work to the new community.\\"Father Paul Joseph Nardini\\", Franciscan Nardini Sisters of the Holy Family Expansion The early days of the new community were difficult, as Nardini, in his conviction, had acted without the authorization of the bishop. In response to this behavior, his letters to the bishop were left unanswered for months. While the townspeople were supportive, public response outside the city was scathing, with newspaper articles denouncing the action for months.\\"Dr. Paul Joseph Nardini\\" Nevertheless he continued with the project, personally supervising the care and formation of the Sisters, securing their food and lodging, even to the point of depriving himself of a regular evening meal. On the 10 March 1857, Bishop Nicolaus von Weis finally broke his silence and gave the Poor Franciscan Sisters of the Holy Family the official approval of the Catholic Church. Nardini's oversight and care was not to last long, however. On a frigid, winter night in January 1862, he was called to the bedside of a dying parishioner. As a result of the visit, he contracted pulmonary typhus, from which he died on the 27 January at the age of 40. By then, the congregation already numbered 220 Sisters, working in 35 different locations. Today =Germany= After Nardini's death, the Sisters continued to expand and take on new missions throughout southern Germany. Today they operate school and hospitals, and provide the domestic services for two seminaries. The growth of the congregation soon caused the Sisters to outgrow their home in Pirmasens. They began to look for a new home, and found the Benedictine Mallersdorf Abbeyabbey in the town of Mallersdorf which had been secularized in 1805. They purchased the former monastery from the town in 1869, and made it the new General Motherhouse of the congregation. Mallersdorf Sisters \\"Gr√ºnder\\" =Romania= They began to work in what is now modern Romania in 1864, shortly after the founder's death. They developed to the point that the Sisters there were established as a Province of the congregation. After World War II, while that nation was under the rule of the Communist Party, they lost control of their institutions, but continued to work in them, in the spirit of their founder. After the fall of Communism, they quickly re-established their common life, opening a convent in Oderhei in 1991, which is now the local motherhouse and a center of various services.Mallersdorfer Sisters \\"Unsere Einsatzorte: Rum√§nien\\" =South Africa= In 1955, the Sisters began a mission to the Republic of South Africa. As their nursing qualifications were not recognized by the local authorities, the Sisters had to start training at a local hospital run by the Missionary Benedictine Sisters of Tutzing. On 15 November 1958, the Franciscan Sisters took responsibility for St. Benedict Hospital in a mission station at Nkandla from the Benedictine Sisters, who had founded it in 1939. The mission served 30,000 Zulus in the region. Since then, the Sisters have established orphanages and other hospitals. Administration of all the hospitals in the nation was taken over by the government in 1976. The Sisters chose to remain working in the institutions they had run as part of the staff. They have since developed ministry to AIDS patients. \\"Called to serve in South Africa\\", Franciscan Nardini Sisters of the Holy Family References Category:1855 establishments in Bavaria Category:1855 establishments in Germany Category:Religious organizations established in 1855 Category:Congregations of Franciscan sisters Category:Catholic female orders and societies Category:Catholic religious institutes established in the 19th century ","title":"Poor Franciscan Sisters of the Holy Family"},{"id":"34529943","text":"The Subaru Telescope at the Mauna Kea Observatory on Hawaii. Strategic Explorations of Exoplanets and Disks with Subaru (SEEDS) is a multi-year survey that used the Subaru Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii in an effort to directly image extrasolar planets and protoplanetary/debris disks around several hundred nearby stars. Near-infrared imaging was carried out using the AO188 Adaptive Optics System and HiCIAO high-contrast imaging instrument. The survey is headquartered at National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) and led by Principal Investigator Motohide Tamura. The survey team includes over a hundred members from dozens of institutes around the world. Observations began in late October 2009, and finished in early January 2015. The goals of the survey are to address the following key issues in exoplanet‚àïdisk science: (1) the detection and census of exoplanets in the outer circumstellar regions around stars, (2) the evolution of protoplanetary and debris disks including their morphological diversity, and (3) the link between exoplanets and circumstellar disks.

GJ 504b is a cold Jovian planet orbiting a relatively old Sun-like star and has unique atmospheric features. One young planet is also confirmed (HD 100546 b). Wide-orbit planets population can be explained as a single distribution and its frequency is ~2% from SEEDS preliminary results. Many circumstellar disks are detected down to radius r=0.1‚Äù. Fine structures such as gaps and spirals of <100 au scale are discovered for the first time, which are possible signs of planet formations.

Eds. Martijn Theodoor Houtsma, R. Bassett and Thomas Walker Arnold.Leiden: Brill Publishers: 1993. Al-Mufaddal was a contemporary of Hammad Ar-Rawiya and Khalaf al-Ahmar, the famous collectors of ancient Arab poetry and tradition, and was somewhat the junior of Abu 'Amr ibn al-'Ala', the first scholar who systematically set himself to preserve the poetic literature of the Arabs. He died about fifty years before Abu  øUbaidah and al-Asma'i, to whose labours posterity is largely indebted for the arrangement, elucidation and criticism of ancient Arabian verse; and his anthology was put together between fifty and sixty years before the compilation by Abu Tammam of the Hamasah. Life The exact year of Al-Mufaddal's birth is not known, though his father was an authority on the Muslim conquest of Persia and it is thought that al-Mufaddal was born in that region. Al-Mufaddal lived for many years under the caliphs of the Umayyad line until their overthrow by the Abbasid Revolution in 750. In 762 he took part in the rising led by Ibrahim Ibn Abdallah, the Alid, called \\"The Pure Soul\\", against the caliph al-Mansur, and after the defeat and death of Ibrahim was cast into prison. Al-Mansur, however, pardoned him on the intercession of his fellow tribesman Musayyab ibn Zuhair of Dabba, and appointed him the instructor in literature of his son, afterwards the caliph al-Mahdi. It was for this prince that, at al-Mansur's instigation, al-Mufaddal compiled the Mufaddaliyat. Al-Mufaddal's exact date of death has proved difficult to determine. The Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature states that he died some time around the year 780,Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature, vol. 2, pg. 537. Eds. Julie Scott Meisami and Paul Starkey. London: Taylor & Francis, 1998. though the longer window between 781 and 787 has been claimed as well.Shady Nasser, The Transmission of the Variant Readings of the Qur æƒÅn: The Problem of TawƒÅtur and the Emergence of ShawƒÅdhdh, pg. 210. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 2012. Work Al-Mufaddal was a careful and trustworthy collector both of texts and traditions, and is praised by all authorities on Arabian history and literature as in this respect greatly the superior of Hammad and Khalaf, who are accused (especially the latter) of unscrupulous fabrication of poems in the style of the ancients. He was a native of Kufa, the northernmost of the two great military colonies founded in 638 by the caliph Umar for the control of the wide Mesopotamian plain. In Kufa and Basra were gathered representatives of all the Arabian tribes who formed the fighting force of the Islamic Empire, and from these al-Mufaddal was able to collect and record the compositions of the poets who had celebrated the fortunes and exploits of their forefathers. He, no doubt, like al-Asma'i and Abu Ubaida, also himself visited the areas occupied by the tribes for their camping grounds in the neighbouring desert; and adjacent to Kufah was al-Hira (modern al-Kufah), the ancient capital of the Lakhmids kings, whose court was the most celebrated centre in pre-Islamic Arabia, where, in the century before the preaching of the Prophet, poets from the whole of the northern half of the peninsula were wont to assemble. There is indeed a tradition that a written collection (diwan) existed in the family of Nu'man III ibn al-Mundhir, the last Lakhmid king, containing a number of poems by the fuhul, or most eminent poets of the pagan time, and especially by those who had praised the princes of the house, and that this collection passed into the possession of the Umayyad caliphs of the house of Marwan; to this, if the tradition is to be believed, al-Mufaddal probably had access. After his death, al-Mufaddal's students were responsible for compiling and publishing his famous anthology on his behalf.

First, the teacher prepares a text that contains examples of the grammatical form to be studied. The teacher reads the text to the students at normal speed while they take notes. Students then work in small groups to prepare a summary of their work using the correct grammatical structures, and finally each group presents their work to the rest of the class. Dictogloss activities encourage learners to focus on the form of their language while also being based in communication, and are used in task-based language teaching. An alternative way of conducting a dictogloss activity is to have the teacher read a short, relevant text three times. The first time, the students listen only, and do not take notes. The second time, they are allowed to note down several key words. The third time, the learners are allowed to write as much as they desire. Following this, the students are instructed to create a summary of what they have heard on their own. When this task has been completed, they take their own summaries and work with a partner to co- construct a summary based on their individual work. Following this, they join with another pair to create a group of four to collaboratively reconstruct the text. Then, students compare their reconstruction of the work with the original to discuss similarities and differences from the source text. This activity can be used, for example, to draw attention to a particular language feature or to help develop students' abilities to synthesize information. Dictogloss activities have several advantages. They integrate the four language skills of listening, reading, speaking, and writing. They also give students opportunities to talk about both content and the language itself. Furthermore, dictogloss activities are a useful way of presenting new factual information to students and encourage them to listen for key points. Finally, they give support to less confident students, as they are encouraged to participate in their groups as part of the structure of the activity.

The name translated from Spanish to English means \\"lake\\" and \\"ocean\\". It is derived from its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and Brinson's Inlet Lake (originally known as \\"Salt Pond\\" and later \\"Lake Tecumseh\\"), as well as from the neighboring community of Ocean Lakes. The street names within Lago Mar are also of Spanish origin with the notable exception of Atwoodtown, which is what the area was called prior to being renamed in the 1960s. Today, neighboring communities Ashby's Bridge, Lotus Creek, Mirasol, Parkway Estates, and parts of Sigma are sometimes included in greater Lago Mar, especially for real estate marketing or demographic purposes. Geography Lakefront in Lago MarLago Mar lies between Nimmo Road and Sandbridge Road near Sandbridge in southern Virginia Beach. Sandbridge Road, which forms Lago Mar's southern border, is currently the only public road to access the north end of the Currituck Banks Peninsula. Heading east on Sandbridge Road, Lago Mar is the last neighborhood before entering Sandbridge itself, making Lago Mar \\"The Gateway to Virginia's Outer Banks\\". This road is also part of Virginia Beach's \\"Green Line\\", which is its boundary for urban growth. Thus Lago Mar lies just where urban conveniences transition into the rural forests and farms of the south. To the west is the Red Mill Farms area of Princess Anne, which includes the Red Mill Commons shopping complex. To the north is Scopus Marsh and Lake Tecumseh, and beyond that the neighborhood of Ocean Lakes and the Navy's Training Support Center at Dam Neck. To the south lies the Back Bay, the area known as Sigma and the historic village of Pungo. The Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge borders to the east, and there are plans to extend Nimmo Trail through the refuge giving bicyclists and pedestrians access between Lago Mar and Sandbridge Beach. History The land currently comprising Lago Mar was inhabited at least as early as the late 1600s. A grave site off Nimmo Trail marks the resting place of three \\"Stone Brothers\\" who lived around the turn of the 19th century. Settlers were in the immediate vicinity much earlier than that however, since Lago Mar lies on the banks of \\"Muddy Creek\\" (now known as Ashville Bridge Creek), upon which the famous \\"Witch of Pungo\\" lived in the late 1600s until her death around 1740. A view of Ashville Bridge Creek The community of Lago Mar was founded by John Aragona, a successful developer in Princess Anne County and Virginia Beach during the 1950s-70s. He was responsible for developing a great portion of the city, including Diamond Springs, Aragona Village, and Princess Anne Plaza just to name a few. But for his own home, he purchased an 800-acre subdivision between the Beach borough and Sandbridge. He named it Lago Mar, with the purpose of building \\"luxury homes to repose in a country setting\\". He constructed a canal upon which he built his own Spanish-style home in 1968. The canal was initially intended to extend to the Atlantic Ocean, making Lago Mar much like the neighborhoods of his youth in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. However, the Army Corps of Engineers would not allow it to extend beyond Ashville Bridge Creek, thus extending the trip to the Atlantic by boat from a short 2 miles to a much longer trip via Oregon Inlet 75 miles to the south. The Corps represented the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge, which had spent many years and much funding to create a largely freshwater ecosystem in the years since the closing of several northern inlets between the Ocean and Sound. Lago Mar's founder died in 1977, but his descendants also became successful entrepreneurs in the area. They carried on his legacy as a developer and also enjoyed success as sponsors and promoters in the Beach music scene. The development of Lago Mar was sold to Aragona's business partner, Edward Garcia Jr, to be operated by False Cape Enterprises. Aragona's original home on the canal still stands on 5 and a half acres of land on Entrada Drive. To this day, Lago Mar maintains a personality \\"as much connected with water as its canals are to Back Bay\\". In the Summer of 1984 the Lago Mar subdivision was featured in the Tidewater Builders Association Homearama. In a nod to the Spanish theme of the neighborhood the event was called Fiesta de las Casas. The homes of Baja Court were featured as that was the only part of the neighborhood completed at that time. Education and demographics When Princess Anne County officially became the City of Virginia Beach in 1963, it was divided into seven boroughs. Lago Mar is in the area formerly known as Princess Anne Borough. In the late 1990s, the city replaced the boroughs with seven Council Districts. Lago Mar is in District 7, known as Princess Anne District. The district comprises the entire southern portion of the city, and is currently represented in city council by Barbara Henley. One of three city parks in Lago MarNimmo Trail serves as a dividing line for school districts and voting precincts. The portion of Lago Mar north of Nimmo Trail is also known as Lago Mar Back Bay. Lago Mar is represented by two voting districts. Sigma Precinct 31 includes Lago Mar south of Nimmo Trail as well as Sigma and Sandbridge. Lago Mar north of Nimmo Trail is included along with portions of Ocean Lakes and Dam Neck in Culver Precinct 63. The area's public school students attend Red Mill Elementary School and Princess Anne Middle School before moving on to Kellam (Lago Mar south of Nimmo Trail) or Ocean Lakes (Lago Mar Back Bay) High School. With over 43% of its residents reporting their highest level of education to include a bachelor's degree, and 23.2 percent having earned a graduate's degree, Lago Mar is a highly educated community. No surprise then that almost 34 percent of its residents earn over $150,000 a year, making Lago Mar an \\"upper middle class neighborhood\\". Unemployment is 4.6%, which is slightly higher than national averages. As of 2018, there were over 5541 residents, among whom 88% were Caucasian, 3 percent Asian and another 3 percent being of African-American descent. Approximately 97% of Lago Mar residents are homeowners. Recreation Lago Mar is a Golf Cart Community.Much of Lago Mar is built around Ashville Bridge Creek, which is an inlet of the Back Bay and is affected by the same wind-driven tides. The entire area is in the Back Bay watershed (which is just a small portion of the larger Albemarle watershed according to the US Environmental Protection Agency). In addition to bordering the Wildlife Refuge, Lago Mar has three family parks within its borders where residents may enjoy playgrounds, picnics, or tennis courts. Bicycling, jogging and walking are other common activities on both Nimmo Trail and the \\"Lago Mar Loop.\\" Many residents frequent the local Hell's Point Golf Club, which is at the southeast end of the neighborhood. Golf carts are permitted to be driven on all streets in Lago Mar south of Nimmo Trail. The community Civic League sponsors several annual events, including a 4th of July parade and picnic as well as an Oktoberfest picnic. Many residents are involved in or enjoy attending area festivals, including Pungo's famous Strawberry Festival, the annual Peach Festival on nearby Knotts Island and the Neptune Festival at the Oceanfront. Climate and vegetation Like much of the Southeastern United States, the Lago Mar community of Virginia Beach has a humid subtropical climate, characterised by short, relatively mild winters and long, hot and humid summers. Primarily because of its close proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and location south of the Chesapeake Bay, temperatures are more moderate than those inland, with winters being warmer and with little to no snow. Annually, Lago Mar residents can expect about 3 and a half inches of snow (although many years can pass without measurable snow) and around 55 inches of rain. Rainfall is abundant throughout the year, but the wettest season is summer, and the driest season is winter. The annual average high temperature is 71 ¬∞F (22 ¬∞C) and the average low temperature is 55 ¬∞F (13 ¬∞C). During an average year, the extremes are 100 ¬∞F (38 ¬∞C) being the hottest, and 18 ¬∞F (-8 ¬∞C) being the coldest.A street scene in Lago Mar High temperatures top 86 ¬∞F (30 ¬∞C) a total of 84 times during an average year, and top 90 ¬∞F an average 47 times. Residents can also expect freezing temperatures approximately 27 times a year, with December 5 and March 6 being the average first and last freeze dates. Average dates with possibility of a hard freeze (28 ¬∞F or below) are December 23 through February 19. Average dates with a possibility of frost (36 ¬∞F or below) are November 23 through March 26, giving Lago Mar an average growing season of 240 days or more. Lago Mar is in USDA hardiness zone 8, Sunset climate zone 31 (Interior Plains of Gulf Coast and Coastal Southeast), and AHS Heat Zone 7. Most of Lago Mar is in Ecoregion 63d (Virginian Barrier Islands and Coastal Marshes) except a small corner in the southwest which is in 63b (Chesapeake-Pamlico Lowlands and Tidal Marshes). The National Gardening Association lists Lago Mar in the Lower South region. A wide variety of plants flourish here and can be seen growing throughout the neighborhood, including Camellias, Oleanders, Azaleas and Gardenias. Trees in propagation include Sabal, Pindo, and Windmill palms, hardy banana and cold hardy citrus, persimmons, crepe myrtles, cherry blossoms, and various fig trees. Natives include several varieties of magnolia and other Bays, Loblolly pine, live oak, wax myrtle, bald cypress, sweetgum, Water Tupelo and many other indigenous plants. Much of Lago Mar is well established and there are plants in bloom throughout the year. Many animal species make their homes in the coastal marshes and forests in and around Lago Mar. It is the northernmost known location for both the Ruby-throated hummingbird and the Monarch butterfly to have overwintered on the East Coast of the United States.

Because of Oklahoma's unique history (much of the state was a place where aboriginal natives have always lived and after forced removal many other tribes were relocated here) an explanation of the Oklahoma Organic Act needs a historic perspective. In general, the Oklahoma Organic Act may be viewed as one of a series of legislative acts, from the time of Reconstruction, enacted by Congress in preparation for the creation of a unified State of Oklahoma. The Organic Act created Oklahoma Territory, and Indian Territory that were Organized incorporated territories of the United States out of the old \\"unorganized\\" Indian Territory. The Oklahoma Organic Act was one of several acts whose intent was the assimilation of the tribes in Oklahoma and Indian Territories through the elimination of tribes' communal ownership of property. History =Indian Relocation= Routes of southern removals to the first Indian Territory of the Five Civilized Tribes. \\"Indian removal\\" was a nineteenth-century policy of the US Government to relocate aboriginal natives living east of the Mississippi River to lands west of the river. The Indian Removal Act, a specific implementation of the Removal Policy, was signed by President Andrew Jackson on May 28, 1830. The Act transformed most of the current state of Oklahoma into an Indian Territory, where southern aboriginal natives (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek and Seminole, also called the Five Civilized Tribes) were relocated. The Trail of Tears is a name given to the forced relocation of the Choctaw Nation in 1831. In 1834, Congress created the first Indian Territory,H.R. Rep. No. 496, pt. 1, at 7 (Jan. 23, 1906) with the Five Civilized Tribes occupying the land that became the State of Oklahoma, excluding its panhandle. =Civil War= See: Indian Territory in the American Civil War Several members of the Five Civilized Tribes owned slaves and had sympathies with the Confederacy. All of the Five Civilized Tribes signed treaties placing themselves \\"under the protection of the Confederate States of America\\"Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with the self-proclaimed Confederate States of America. Treaty of July 12, 1861, Confederate States of America-Choctaw Nation-Chickasaw Nation During the Civil War, Congress passed a statute concerning the Abrogation of treaties with Indian Tribes, (codified at 25 USC Sec. 72) which states: > Whenever the tribal organization of any Indian tribe is in actual hostility > to the United States, the President is authorized, by proclamation, to > declare all treaties with such tribe abrogated by such tribe if in his > opinion the same can be done consistently with good faith and legal and > national obligations. =Reconstruction= As part of the Reconstruction effort following the Civil War, a \\"Southern Treaty Commission\\" was formed to meet with Indian tribes to negotiate new treaties.Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for the Year 1865, Washington, Government Printing Office (1865) A result of these \\"Reconstruction Treaties\\" with various tribes was that the land allocated to the Five Civilized tribes was reduced to the eastern part of the territory, making room for relocation of other Indian tribes. Later, other aboriginal people, such as the Apache, Comanche, Delaware, Kiowa, Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes and the Osage Nation were also forced to relocate to the Territories (there are currently 38 federally recognized tribes in Oklahoma). Treaty of Washington (1866) The Southern Treaty Commission formulated the 1866 Treaty of Washington with the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations which contained the following provisions: * Abolished slavery1866 Treaty of Washington, arts. II, III * agreed to legislation that Congress and the President \\"may deem necessary for the better administration of justice and the protection of the rights of person and property within the Indian territory.\\".1866 Treaty of Washington, art VII * Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes received $300,000, selling tribal lands west of 98 west longitude to the United StatesTreaty of Washington, Art 3 * General amnesty for siding with Confederate States of AmericaTreaty of Washington, Art 5 * Tribes grant right of way for rail roads authorized by Congress; A Land patent, or \\"first-title deed\\" to alternate sections of land adjacent to rail roads would be granted to the rail road upon completion of each 20 mile section of track and water stationsTreaty of Washington, Art 6 * Agree to participate in the Indian Territory Legislature, with proportional representation from all tribes over 500 membersTreaty of Washington, Art 8 ** Laws take effect unless suspended by Secretary of the Interior or President of the United States ** No laws shall be inconsistent with the US Constitution, or laws of Congress, or treaties of the US ** No legislation regarding \\"matters pertaining to the legislative, judicial, or other organization, laws, or customs of the several tribes or nations, except as herein provided for\\" ** Superintendent of Indian Affairs (or appointee) is the presiding officer ** Secretary of Interior appoints secretary ** \\"The Choctaws and Chickasaws also agree that a court or courts may be established in said Territory with such jurisdiction and organization as Congress may prescribe: Provided, That the same shall not interfere with the local judiciary of either of said nations.\\" * Within each county, a quarter section of land shall be held in trust for the establishment of seats of justice therein, and also as many quarter-sections as the said legislative councils may deem proper for the permanent endowment of schoolsTreaty of Washington, Art 14 * Provides for each man, woman, and child to receive 160 acres of land as an allotment.Treaty of Washington, Art 15 * A Land patent, or \\"first-title deed\\" shall be issued as evidence of allotment, \\"issued by the President of the United States, and countersigned by the chief executive officer of the nation in which the land lies\\"Treaty of Washington, Art 25 * All treaties and parts of treaties inconsistent herewith be, and the same are hereby, declared null and void.Treaty of Washington, Art 51 Osage Nation Purchase of Land in Cherokee Outlet Under the Cherokee Reconstruction Treaty of 1866, the Osage Nation began the process of purchasing approximately 1,570,059 acres in the Cherokee Outlet from the Cherokee Nation. The Osage Reservation was part of Oklahoma Territory under the Oklahoma Organic Act of 1890 and was made a semiautonomous district by the Enabling Act of 1906. With the passage of the Osage Allotment Act of June 28, 1906 (34 Stat. 539 c. 3572), each member of the tribe received an average allotment of 659.51 acres, with no surplus land remaining and the tribe retained ownership of mineral under the land (held in trust by the US Government). Committee on Territories The United States House Committee on Territories was initially formed in 1825. Shortly after the Civil War, the Committee began discussing how best to assimilate the Five Civilized Tribes and how to combine Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory. It was decided that one component of assimilation would be the distribution of property held in-common by the tribe to individual members of the tribe.Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek: Hearings on H.R. 19213 Before the H. Subcomm. on Indian Affairs, at 24 (Feb. 14, 1912) (statement of Hon. Byron P. Harrison) (\\"While the {1866 Treaty of Washington} contemplated the immediate allotment in severalty of the lands in the Choctaw-Chickasaw country, yet such allotment in severalty to anyone was never made under such treaty, and has only been consummated since the breaking up of the tribal organization and preparatory to the organization of the State of Oklahoma.\\") A second component of this decision was that in 1871, Congress decided that the United States would no longer deal with Indian tribes through a formal treaty-making process, providing that \\"[n]o Indian nation or tribe within the territory of the United States shall be acknowledged or recognized as an independent nation ...\\".Indian Appropriation Act of March 3, 1871, 16 Stat. 544, 566 (currently codified at 25 U.S.C. ¬ß 71)Congress' plenary authority to \\"override treaty provisions and legislate for the protection of the Indians.\\" United States v.

Blackfeet Tribe of Blackfeet Indian Reservation, 364 F.Supp. 192, 194 (D.Mont. 1973) (\\"[A]n Indian tribe is sovereign to the extent that the United States permits it to be sovereign ‚Äì neither more nor less.\\") From the 1870s through the early 1900s, the Committee on Territories heard arguments from the Five Civilized Tribes that the lands within their territory should not be included within the State of Oklahoma and that a separate State of Sequoyah should be created for the Tribes. Indian Appropriations Act of 1889 The Cherokee Commission, created by Section 14 of the Indian Appropriations Act of March 2, 1889, was empowered to acquire land in the Cherokee Outlet not occupied by tribes, and to acquire excess land of other tribes in the Oklahoma Territory for non- indigenous homesteading. Eleven agreements involving nineteen tribes were signed over the period of May 1890 through November 1892. Investigations for Commission irregularities continued through the end of the 20th Century. The 1889 Act also opened the Unassigned Lands to homesteaders, which included the Land Run of 1889 that settled Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Contents of Organic Act - Oklahoma Territory Established Congress rejected the Five Civilized Tribes' argument for a State of Oklahoma and a separate State of Sequoyah. On May 2, 1890, the Oklahoma Organic Act was passed officially creating Oklahoma Territory, which initially excluded lands occupied by the Five Civilized Tribes, but reorganized the legal system of Indian Territory, providing for a mechanism to consolidate Oklahoma and Indian Territories.Acts of the Fifty- First Congress, First Session: Oklahoma Organic Act of May 2, 1890, ch. 182, 26 Stat. 81. Laws and Treaties Vol 1. (Statutes, Executive Orders, Proclamations, and Statistics of Tribes) Compiled to December 1, 1902 by Charles J. Kappler, LL., M., Clerk to the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Washington: Government Printing Office, 1903 \\"The purpose of the Organic Act was to begin the process of creating a state and forming a government, while still allowing time to divide the property of the Five Civilized Tribes and transfer the property from communal to individual ownership.\\"Case No. CIV-11-927-W, in the Western District of Oklahoma. Chickasaw Nation and Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma v. Mary Fallin in her capacity as Governor of the State of Oklahoma et al. Defendants City of Oklahoma City and the Oklahoma City Water Utilities Trust's Answer to the Plaintiff Nations' First Amended Complaint. Filed 1/25/12, p 91 =Components of Oklahoma and Indian Territories= In the 1890s both Oklahoma and Indian Territories contained Indian Reservations. Indian Territory was primarily a consolidation of the Five Civilized Tribes plus an assortment of tribes in the northeast part of the territory, land administered by the Quapaw Indian Agency. Oklahoma Territory was essentially an amalgamation of what was left over; land unassigned to other territories and states. Oklahoma and Indian Territory, 1890s Major components of what would become the State of Oklahoma include: * Indian Territory ** Cherokee Nation ** Chickasaw Nation ** Choctaw Nation ** Muscogee (Creek) Nation ** Seminole Nation ** Land administered by the Quapaw Indian Agency * Oklahoma Territory ** Cherokee Outlet ** Osage Nation ** \\"Leased lands\\" of the Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations, west of the ninety-eighth degree of west longitude ** Ceded lands of the Seminole and Muscogee (Creek) Nations ** Unassigned Lands ** Cimarron Territory - the Oklahoma Panhandle * Disputed land, Greer County, Texas =Civil and Criminal Law in Oklahoma and Indian Territories= The Oklahoma Organic Act specifically extended civil and criminal Arkansas laws over the Indian Territory.26 Stat. 81, at 94-97 Historically, non-Indians were not allowed in Indian Territory and the Federal Court in Ft. Smith, Arkansas had jurisdiction over Indian Territory. Arkansas recognizes the doctrine of Riparian water rights,Little Rock & Fort Smith Ry. Co. v. Chapman, 39 Ark. 463, 475-76 (1882); Harris v. Brooks, 283 S.W.2d 129, 132 (Ark. 1955). based on English common law, and generally accepted in the eastern part of the United States. For the Oklahoma Territory, the laws of Nebraska were to prevail. Water rights in Oklahoma Territory and the western United States, water rights were generally allocated under the principle of prior appropriation. Today Oklahoma has a unique set of water rights statues based on groundwater and streamwater. The owner of land owns the groundwater underlying such land and surface water standing on the land, however the Oklahoma Water Resources Board regulates non-domestic use. Stream water is considered to be publicly owned and subject to appropriation by the Oklahoma Water Resources Board. The organic act created several Federal District Courts, both in the Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory. The act also preserved Indian court civil authority by stipulating that \\"and any person residing in the Territory of Oklahoma, in whom there is Indian blood, shall have the right to invoke the aid of courts therein for the protection of his person or property, as though he were a citizen of the United States: Provided, That nothing in this act contained shall be so construed as to give jurisdiction to the courts established in said Territory in controversies arising between Indians of the same tribe, while sustaining their tribal relations\\"Organic Act Sec 12 =Homestead / Land Use= The Oklahoma Organic Act provided for a mechanism for Indian tribes to allocate their communally held land to individual tribal members, and to distribute unallocated property to non-Indians. A Land patent, or \\"first-title deed\\" would be granted to both tribal members, who received allotments, and to homesteaders who, after a period of time, claimed and improved (or in some cases purchased for $1.25 per acre) the homestead lands via a Land run. Two sections in each Oklahoma Territory township were to be reserved, in the form of a Land grant, as public school lands, with money from land leases to be used to pay for public education. Later, the Oklahoma Constitution established the Oklahoma Commissioners of the Land Office to manage this resource. Section-line roads to provide access to land parcels, were to be maintained on each side of every one-mile-square section throughout the territory. This requirement does not apply to the former Osage Reservation, now Osage County, Oklahoma. =US Citizenship= Members of an Indian Tribe, who were not already citizens, could apply to become citizens of the United States. In an effort to entice Indians of Indian Territory to accept their land allotments, it was provided that upon acceptance of an allotment, the Indians were declared to be Citizens of the United States. \\"Provided, that the Indians who become Citizens of the United States under the provisions of this act do not forfeit or lose any rights or privileges they enjoy or are entitled to as members of the tribe or nation who which they belong.\\"Organic Act Sec 43 =Railroads= Existing railroad easements were to remain in effect. Railroads were also given the right to \\"cross, intersect, join or unite it railroad with any other railroad now constructed or that may hereafter be constructed at any point upon its routes\\"Organic Act Sec 18, and 51 Congress Chapter 126 =Powers Reserved to US Government and Tribes= \\"Congress may at any time hereafter change the boundaries of said Territory, or attach any portion of the same to any other State or Territory of the United States without the consent of the inhabitants of the Territory hereby created: Provided, That nothing in this act shall be construed to impair any right now pertaining to any Indians or Indian tribe in said Territory under the laws, agreements, and treaties of the United States, or to impair the rights of person or property pertaining to said Indians, or to affect the authority of the Government of the United States to make any regulation or to make any law respecting said Indians, their lands, property, or other rights which it would have been competent to make or enact if this act had not been passed\\"Organic Act Sec 11 Dawes Act and Dawes Commission The Dawes Act, (also called \\"The General Allotment Act\\") was adopted by Congress in 1887, and authorized a survey of Indian tribal land for the purposes of dividing the land into allotments for individual Indians. Dawes Act was amended in 1891 and again in 1906 by the Burke Act. The General Allotment Act's \\"goal was to end tribal ownership of land by assimilating Indians as part of an agrarian society.\\"Hackford v. Babbitt, 14 F.3d 1457, 1467 (10th Cir. 1994) Individual ownership of land was seen as an essential step. The act also provided that the government would purchase Indian land \\"excess\\" to that needed for allotment and open it up for settlement by non- Indians. The Dawes Commission was created by Congress in 1893 as a further attempt to convince the members of tribes to receive their tribal land allotments. Members of the Five Civilized Tribes (Indian Territory) were exempt from the original Dawes Act legislation, and the Dawes Commission was to convince the Five Civilized Tribes to agree to cede tribal title of Indian lands. The commission established procedures for members of Indian tribes in Oklahoma Territory to register with their respective Indian Nations (only one nation if there was mixed ancestry), and procedures to receive land allotments.Act of March 3, 1893, ch. 209, 27 Stat. 612, at 645 The Curtis Act of 1898 amended the Dawes Act, abolishing all tribal courts and gave the United States exclusive jurisdiction over \\"all controversies growing out of the titles, ownership, occupation, possession, or use of real estate, coal, and asphalt.\\"Curtis Act of June 28, 1898, ch. 517, 30 Stat. 495. Proposed State of Sequoyah A Constitutional Convention was convened by residents of Indian Territory and proposed to Congress that a State of Sequoyah be admitted to the Union. Charles N. Haskell was selected to represent the Creek Nation at the convention, and later became the first Governor of the State of Oklahoma. William H. Murray, represented the Chickasaw and later became the first Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives after statehood, and was elected the ninth Governor of Oklahoma. The proposal failed to gain acceptance in Washington. Five Civilized Tribes Act (April 26, 1906) The Five Civilized Tribes Act of April 26, 1906 can be seen as the final act leading to Oklahoma Statehood. One of the act's purposes was to pave the way \\"for Oklahoma's admission to the union on an \\"Equal footing with the original States\\", conditioned on its disclaimer of all right and title to lands \\"owned or held by any Indian, tribe, or nation.\\" In the Act, Congress unilaterally diminished the power of the five sovereign tribal governments, lost powers were reinstated by the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act of 1936. The Department of the Interior took over the Indian schools, school funds, and tribal government buildings and furniture. The law provided that the President may appoint a principal chief for any of the tribes. If a chief failed to sign a document presented to him by U.S. authorities, he was either to be replaced or the document could be simply approved by the Secretary of the Interior.http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/laws/act_april_26_1906.htm The law also provided that: *That the principal chief of the Seminole Nation is hereby authorized to execute the deeds to allottees in the Seminole Nation prior to the time when the Seminole government shall cease to exist.Five Civilized Tribe Act,. Sec 6 * Coal and asphalt lands are reserved for sale when their leases expireFive Civilized Tribe Act,. Sec 13 * When land allotments (Land patent) have been made to all members and freedmen of the tribes, surplus lands may be sold by the Secretary of the Interior with proceeds deposited in the United States Treasury to the credit of the respective tribes.Five Civilized Tribe Act,. Sec 16 * Power companies operating in Indian Territory are empowered to construct, own and operate dams, canals, and reservoirs across any non-navigable stream for the purpose of generating and distributing electrical power, light and heat to other places.Five Civilized Tribe Act,. Sec 25 * Upon dissolution of the Tribes, tribal land shall not become public lands nor property of the United States, but shall be held in trust by the United States for the use and benefit of the Indians respectively comprising each of said tribesFive Civilized Tribe Act,. Sec 27 * \\"That the tribal existence and present tribal governments of the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee, Creek, and Seminole tribes or nations arc hereby continued in full force and effect for all purposes authorized by law, until otherwise provided by law, but the tribal council or legislature in any of said tribes or nations shall not be in session for a longer period than thirty days in any one year: Provided, That no act, ordinance, or resolution (except resolutions of adjournment) of the tribal council or legislature of any of said tribes or nations shall be of any validity until approved by the President of the United States: Provided further, That no contract involving the payment or expenditure of any money or affecting any property belonging to any of said tribes or nations made by them or any of them or by any officer thereof, shall be of any validity until approved by the President of the United States.\\"Five Civilized Tribe Act,. Sec 28 * That all Acts and parts of Acts inconsistent with the provisions of this Act be, and the same are hereby, repealedFive Civilized Tribe Act,. Sec 29 Enabling Act of 1906 The Oklahoma Enabling Act of June 16, 1906HR 12707, ch. 3335, 34 Stat. 267 provided for the people of Oklahoma and Indian Territories to elect delegates to a state constitutional convention, and established the Territorial capital in Guthrie, Oklahoma, until 1913, when a permanent capital would be selected by a statewide election. The act also provided \\"that nothing contained in the said constitution shall be construed to limit or impair the rights of person or property pertaining to the Indians of said Territories (so long as such rights shall remain unextinguished) or to limit or affect the authority of the Government of the United States to make any law or regulation respecting such Indians, their lands, property, or other rights by treaties, agreement, law, or otherwise, which it would have been competent to make if this Act had never been passed.\\"HR 12707, ch. 3335, 34 Stat. 267 The same act also provided for the people of New Mexico and of Arizona to form a constitution and State government and be admitted into the Union. At the time President Roosevelt proclaimed Oklahoma a state on November 16, 1907, there were no Indian Reservations within the state boundaries; former Indian Lands were either held by the U.S. Government in trust for members of the tribes, were allotted to members of the tribe, or distributed through land runs for settlers to homestead, ultimately receiving a Land patent as title to the land. Tribal governments were basically relegated to settling disputes between tribal members based on tribal custom, and being a conduit for federally sponsored community support. Some tribes distributed royalty income to members from oil and gas leases on tribal grounds.

Biography Absalom Boston was born in Nantucket, Massachusetts, to Seneca Boston, an African-American ex-slave father, and Thankful Micah, a Wampanoag Indian mother. His uncle, a slave named Prince Boston, was part of the crew of a 1770 whaling voyage, but refused to turn over his earnings to his white master. Instead, he went to court and won both his earnings and freedom, making him the first black slave to win his freedom in a U.S. jury trial.Bill Delahunt, remarks made during \\"The Role of Civil Rights Organizations in History\\", February 11, 1997, Congressional Record Volume 143, U.S. Government Printing Office. Boston spent his early years working in the whaling industry. By the time he reached 20, he acquired enough money to purchase property in Nantucket. Ten years later, he obtained a license to open and operate a public inn. In 1822, Boston became the captain of The Industry, a whaleship manned entirely with an African-American crew. The six-month journey returned with 70 barrels of whale oil and the entire crew intact. Boston retired from the sea after The Industry returned to Nantucket from its historic voyage. He concentrated on becoming a business and community leader, and also ran for public office. Together with fellow captain, Edward Pompey, he led the Nantucket abolitionist movement. He was also a founding trustee of Nantucket's African Baptist Society, and the African Meeting House in Nantucket. In 1845, after his daughter Phebe Ann Boston was barred from attending a public school, he successfully brought a lawsuit against the Nantucket municipal government to integrate the public education system.

Hannibal raced until he was four-years-old, winning only one race over his two-year racing career. His breeder, Lord Egremont, won the Derby five times and Hannibal's victory was his third time winning the event. Hannibal retired from racing in 1806 and had a limited stud career, covering few mares and standing for only the 1806 breeding season at Lord Egremont's stud in Petworth. Background Hannibal was foaled in 1801 at Lord Egremont's estate Petworth House. Egremont's Driver, Hannibal's sire, was bred by Lord Egremont and was described as a \\"tolerable runner.\\" Hannibal's dam, Fractious (foaled in 1792), was also bred by Lord Egremont. Hannibal was Fractious' fourth foal and one of seven by Driver. Fractious produced fifteen foals between 1798 and 1816. Fractious is present in the female-line of the influential broodmare Pocahontas and was her fifth-dam through Fractious' daughter Amazon. Racing career Hannibal did not race as a two-year-old, and his first race was in the 1804 Epsom Derby. Hannibal was trained by F. Neale at Newmarket. In his career, he started five times, winning only the Derby. =1804: three-year-old season= Sancho (foreground) leading Hannibal in a 26 July 1805 match race held at Brighton. This was the last start of Hannibal's racing career. Hannibal's first start was in The Derby held on 17 May with a field of eight horses. Hannibal started at 3 to 1 odds and won the 1650-guinea race, with Mr. Wilson's colt by Waxy second and Mr. Dawson's colt Hippocampus third. Lord Egremont won the Derby for the second time with Hannibal, having won in 1782 with Assassin. He won the Derby three more times, with Cardinal Beaufort the next year, Election in 1807 and with Lap-dog in 1826. At Ascot in June, Hannibal received a 50-guinea forfeiture from Mr. Warrington after his colt by Guildford withdrew from a match race. Hannibal was third in the Pavilion Stakes held at Brighthelmston on 28 July, losing to the colt Enterprise and a colt by Waxy. Hannibal was beaten by Hippocampus a few days later in a 650-guinea sweepstakes race whilst carrying seven more pounds than Hippocampus as a handicap for his Derby win. =1805: four-year-old season= Hannibal ran twice in 1805. At the First Spring meeting in Newmarket in April, Hannibal finished third in the New Claret Stakes losing to Lord Darlington's colt Pavilion and Mr. Mellish's colt Sancho. In the last start of his career on 26 July at Brighton, Hannibal participated in a match race against Mr. Mellish's colt Sancho. The odds were 11 to 10 against Hannibal for the 1,000-guinea race. Sancho was ridden by Francis Buckle and quickly took the lead in the mile-long race, winning easily and was never challenged by Hannibal in the race. The running was described as \\"a great betting race\\" and an engraving of the match (right) was commissioned from a painting by John Nott Sartorius and published in Volume 28 of the Sporting Magazine. Season at stud Hannibal retired from racing at the end of the 1805 season and was listed in the Racing Calendar as a breeding stallion for the 1806 season (from 1 February to 14 July) at Lord Egremont's Petworth House stud. At Petworth, he stood for a 5-guinea per mare stud fee and 1-guinea groom's fee alongside the stallions Gohanna, Bobtail and Brother to Driver. Hannibal does not appear in the 1807 stallion register for Petworth or any other stud farm, suggesting that he died early in the 1806 breeding season or was sold for other purposes. The General Stud Book reports Hannibal covering only three mares in 1806: Martha, Lord Grosvenor's mare Ariadne and Quiz (full-sister to Wowski, Smolensko's dam) before Ariadne and Quiz were sent to the West Indies. The only foal recorded for Hannibal in the General Stud Book is the chestnut filly, Hannah, produced by Martha (by Woodpecker) in 1807. Hannah raced until she was four-years-old, winning several races. Hannah by Hannibal does not appear in subsequent editions of the General Stud Book and does not appear to have produced any registered offspring. Carthaginian, who was later gelded, was another of Hannibal's offspring that also raced, but his dam was not identified in the racing literature and he does not appear in the General Stud Book.

It originally aired on January 30, 2012. A teenage girl Callie/Jane Doe (Bridgit Mendler) needs a surgery requiring adult consent, but claims she is fleeing an abusive household. House and Adams debate whether to call Social Services, but then her mom shows up and it turns out the relationship is far more complicated than the team could have anticipated. Meanwhile, Taub can't connect with his infant daughters and House threatens to exploit Foreman's relationship with a married woman. The song \\"Be The Song\\" by Foy Vance is featured at the end of the episode. Plot House is examining a young girl (Callie) in the clinic who is having trouble breathing. House accuses her and the man she's with of being unrelated. She goes to leave, but House tells her that she's bleeding from her ear. House continues his physical examination. House meets his team and starts a differential. Adams has figured out the patient isn't really 18 and says they have to call social services. House says that the patient will run if social services is called. House decides to treat for pneumococcus, but the team argues that she may have been vaccinated. Adams finds out that she has been vaccinated for pneumococcus. The patient registered under a fake name, but Adams and Park decide to scan the foreclosed house she listed as her address. When Callie realizes they went to her school she tries to leave the hospital, knowing that social services will come, but she collapses and complains she can't feel her legs. House drags the team to a skeet shooting range for the next differential. Chase comes up with vasculitis and House agrees to steroids. Adams gets back to calling social services and House makes a bet - if she can hit a clay pigeon, she can call. If she misses, she can't raise the issue again. She expertly hits the pigeon. The social worker arrives but Adams is suspicious - the patient isn't making a fuss and the social worker is wearing five inch heels. Adams wonders if House could have known she was an expert marksman. House hired a prostitute to impersonate a social worker. Foreman explains that House called back and cancelled the real social worker and has arranged another one. Foreman says House should have told him about an underage patient. House meets the team to start a new differential, as it appears steroids made it worse. House decides on Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and tells them to get consent from the mother to test for it. Adams is opposed as she believes the mother hit Callie. House says that's not relevant unless social services agrees. Callie says she lied because people understand physical abuse, but not what she went through. Adams asks her to give her mother another chance, but Callie feels her mother will return to drugs when things get bad. Adams and Chase are performing the endoscopy and find an ulcer in the esophagus. Adams thinks it might be alcoholism, but House thinks it is an aneurysm and wants to do surgery. They discuss the brain surgery with the patient. Callie realizes Adams thinks House is wrong. Adams accuses the patient of being an alcoholic. Callie denies it. She says she wants the surgery, but Taub says it's the mother's decision. Callie assures her mother she's not an addict, but her mother reminds her that's what she always said. Callie snaps back that she's not like her mother and says she wants surgery. House goes to see the mother. He tells her that her daughter hates her and should hate her. He tells the mother to leave. He says he's going ahead with the surgery and will deal with the fallout. However, he leaves his Vicodin. The mother gives him back his pills and tells him to treat her daughter for alcoholism. They perform emergency surgery, but can't find anything. The blood vessels are all intact. The patient's blood pressure drops. The team start talking about the patient being in Florida and that it might be a tropical infection. House notes those don't wait for years to appear and goes to dismiss the idea when he thinks of something. House asks the mother if Callie ever went swimming in Florida. The mother says she went swimming in a nearby canal. He asks the mother to follow him into surgery. House reveals she has ascariasis, a parasite. They are generally asymptomatic, but when set off by a small trauma, they attack the body's organs. She is then given mebendazole. Callie improves rapidly, but runs away while unsupervised. She leaves behind a note, saying that she believes her mother will fall back to her old ways and, not wanting to experience that again, prefers to remember her mother the way she is now. Reception The Onion's AV Club gave this episode a B rating. 13th most watched program of the week.

It is also a Grade II listed building, having been designed by Godfrey Pinkerton and constructed in 1903‚Äì4. History The parish was constituted in 1845 and there has been a church in this area for a number of years. In 1894, the old chapel, built in 1836 by William Moseley and extended in 1861 and 1870, was demolished for structural reasons, and was replaced by a temporary iron structure until a new parish church could be completed nearby. This iron structure served as a church hall from c.1925 until 1968, when it was sold by act of parliament (St. Mary, Summerstown Act 1968). The Incorporated Society for Promoting the Enlargement, Building and repairing of Churches and Chapels gave ¬£250 towards the rebuilding. The foundation stone was laid by Princess Helena, daughter of Queen Victoria on 4 April 1903 who was accompanied by an escort of the Surrey Imperial Yeomanry, and greeted at the site by a detachment of the 4th Surrey Volunteers. The Mayor of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth, Mr Henry Kimber MP and the vicar, Revd. John Robinson were in attendance. The church was consecrated by the Suffragan Bishop of Southwark, Huyshe Yeatman-Biggs, on Saturday 30 April 1904. It has been little altered over the years, with an addition of a new church hall around 1968, a (recently restored) lynch gate around 1930, and Summerstown's war memorial after the Great War. Organ The church contains a pipe organ by Henry Bevington. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. Present Day The church is open for public services every Sunday at 10:30am, and has a range of mid-week groups, including for children, students and young adults.

It was established in 1843, and was the second Catholic Church to be built in the city. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The church was built to serve the needs of about 500 families who had emigrated from Germany. It is located in the hub of the pioneer \\"Chouteau's Landing\\" District, one of the early commercial and residential neighborhoods where the German immigrants settled in pre-Civil War era St. Louis. It took its name from a noted feast day proclaimed by Pope Pius V to celebrate the victory of the Christian Navy over Islamic forces in the Battle of Lepanto, off the coast of Italy in the Adriatic Sea in 1571. The church is also a consecrated church (1866) at the direction of Pope Pius IX. It also has an indulgenced High Altar (where hundreds of relics of saints are entombed) bestowed by Pope Leo XIII in the late 19th century. St. Mary's served as the first ethnic parish and spiritual home to the German Roman Catholic population of the city for the next century. It also provided a temporary home to a small community of Lebanese immigrants in the 20th-century, who went on to found a church in their own‚Äîpresent-day St. Raymond Maronite Cathedral in LaSalle Park neighborhood. St. Raymond's is now the Cathedral for the Maronite Eparchy west of the Mississippi River in the USA. Its former Archbishop, Most. Rev. Robert J. Shaheen, built the present St. Raymond's Cathedral under his pastoral administration. The 1950s saw the departure from the city of a large number of the families whose German ancestors had worshiped there. They were replaced by a large community of refugees from Hungary after World War II and the 1956 Hungarian Uprising. They gave new life to the parish, which became unofficially called the \\"Hungarian Church\\" (). The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It is also a consecrated Roman Catholic church; that is, the Vatican has bestowed the consecration privilege on the church itself by Pope Pius IX, performed with a specific ritual by St. Louis Archbishop Peter Richard Kenrick in 1866. Archbishop Kenrick anointed each of the interior walls of the church with chrism oil per the consecration ritual, and today, brass wall cross sconces (candleholders) are displayed on the walls noting the consecration locations. While all Catholic churches are blessed, only a few in a diocese are consecrated, and it assures the church may only be used for Roman Catholic worship and for no other purpose. The main altar of the church also has an Indulgence attached to it by Pope Leo XIII in 1896, granting temporal remission of sins at the time of death for those Catholics saying the specific prayers, and dying in the state of grace. Architecture Interior George I. Barnett and Franz Saler, the distinguished architects of St. Mary's Church, designed it in accordance with that of the early 16th-Century Mannerist style. The nave is rectangular and, with the transept, forms a cross with the sanctuary at its head. The choir loft is located on the second tier of the two-tier balcony at the rear of the church. Its ornate wooden-carved organ case and stenciled display pipes are among the oldest in St. Louis. Eight tall stained-glass windows with rounded frames grace the nave and the transept, complementing the high arch of the sanctuary. The Egyptian-style doorway to the church is framed by two massive pillars that hold up the heavy wooden cross above the entrance. The interior of St. Mary of Victories is also remarkable as the first interior in a St. Louis church whose design was based upon liturgical studies. It was developed and constructed by Max Schneiderhahn, the city's first professional church artist. Himself a German immigrant, Schneiderhahn studied at a German university and two monasteries, bringing the craftsmanship tradition of liturgical art to the St. Louis area. The altars, statuary, steepled baptismal font, communion rail, carvings and frescoes were all conceived and executed by Schneiderhahn, who also painted the Stations of the Cross. Within its hallowed walls are also other liturgical art treasures and fixtures donated at later dates by other Roman Catholic religious orders and communities in the metro St. Louis area, particularly those of German origin, including the School Sisters of Notre Dame, the Franciscan Sisters of Mary, the Mill Hill Fathers, and the group promoting the canonization of Blessed Francis X. Seelos, C.SS.R., a Bavarian Redemptorist immigrant priest who worked with mid-19th century German immigrants in St. Louis, Baltimore, and New Orleans. (His statue, minted by the Vatican Statuary Foundry, stands on a reconstructed side altar made of the communion rail from the old St. Malachy's Church in the Mill Creek Valley (now demolished), once used by the later-dated, now-closed St. Timothy Parish in Affton, MO. A copy of Bl. Seelos' bronze death mask, one of five in the world, is also on permanent display). The Hungarian Roman Catholic faith community also honors the famed Joseph Cardinal Mindszenty of Hungary with a carved white marble plaque in the sanctuary, noting his visit to this church in the 1970s. The late Cardinal-Archbishop of Budapest-Esztergom participated in a special Mass, seminar and dinner at the visit sponsored by the parish and the Cardinal Mindszenty Foundation of the U.S. Mindszenty is regarded as a great hero to the Hungarian people around the world for his resistance to atheistic Communism and totalitarianism in the 1950s, as well as to those of other nations. The Hungarian Ladies Society of the church has also embroidered most of the decorative altar linens used on its many altars and shrines throughout the liturgical year. Benedict XVI's coat of arms at it appears in the church Two noted historically-recent popes are also commemorated, featuring their stenciled coat of arms on the ornate painted ceiling of Old St. Mary's. Pope John Paul II has his blue-and-gold coat of arms over the church crossing (featuring the old papal tiara, or three-tiered crown), while Pope Benedict XVI (formerly Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger), has his papal coat-of-arms displayed over the choir loft featuring the more-updated mitre in place of the tiara. (As the first German-background church in the Archdiocese, it was the only parish with Pope Benedict XVI's coat-of-arms on public display in the fabric of the church building). Historic connections It was in St. Mary of Victories that the Blessed Francis Xavier Seelos, C.Ss.R., made his Missouri preaching debut. Together with his Redemptorist companions, Fathers Schneider, Jacob and Gulielm, Seelos preached a parish mission in German from the first to fifteenth of October 1865. The side altar in the south middle portion of the nave of the church honors his role in the historic parish's development. In 1872, five women came to St. Louis from Germany, under the leadership of Mother Mary Odilia Berger, having been unable to live out their lives of religious dedication and service due to the policies of the German government known as the Kulturkampf. They found lodging in an attic in the church complex, having the same door to their residence as to the church. They organized themselves in 1874 as a religious congregation under the name of the Franciscan Sisters of St. Mary, taking their name from the church.Franciscan Sisters of Mary \\"Heritage\\" The healing and therapeutic ministry of their Order continues in today's SSM HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS, a St. Louis-based hospital/nursing organization which operates hospitals and medical care facilities throughout the Midwest and the Mid-South.

Basselin (1851‚Äì1914) was an American lumber magnate, best remembered for an endowed scholarship he created at the Theological College of the Catholic University of America. The Basselin scholarship has funded the philosophical education of many notable American churchmen. Biography Basselin was born on March 24, 1851 in Grostenchen, now Grostenquin, a village in Lorraine. He emigrated to the United States at the age of three with his parents, Dominique Basselin and his mother, Anna Basselin (n√©e Pierson).See the entry for . His father died when he was ten years old, and his mother raised him in the principles of business as he ran the family's general store. Basselin attended Niagara University, graduating at the age of twenty-two before returning to his home town of Croghan, New York, and becoming involved in the timber trade. He quickly accumulated a fortune in the lumber trade, owning several thousands of acres of timberland and employing hundreds of people at the time of his death. An innovation which contributed to his success was his practice of using felled hemlock logs left to rot after they had been stripped of their bark for use in leather production. This allowed him to turn a waste product into a source of income. He diversified his business interests later in life, becoming involved in furniture production, the Lowville and Beaver River Railroad Company, a paper company, an electric power company, and banking. Basselin was active in the Democratic party and served two terms as Croghan town supervisor. He was a friend of David B. Hill who served as Governor from 1885 to 1891.Watertown Re-Union April 25, 1914 In 1885 the state legislature created a Forest Commission which was one of the first state forestry agencies in the United States.American Forestry by William G. Robbins 1985 Governor Hill appointed Basselin as one of threeThe Evening Gazette, May 25, 1885 Commissioners to run the new agency. The Forest Commission had charge of the state Forest Preserve lands in the Adirondacks and Catskills and the responsibility of promoting forestry and forest fire protection statewide. He served on the Forest Commission for six years. During his tenure important progress was made in forest fire prevention, protection of state lands, and the establishment of the Adirondack Park.New York Forest Commission Annual Reports 1885 - 1892 Basselin died at his home in Croghan on April 21, 1914 from Bright's disease. Those fortunate enough to have lived, and still live in his hometown remember him far more for what he did while he was alive, and far less for the exhorbitant amount of money left to the Catholic University. He was an employer of many and a provider for much in Croghan. His memory lives on here daily. Legacy Basselin died a millionaire, and left a generous will. He gave each of his two cousins, his only living relatives, $100,000 each. He left money to support his nurse, housekeeper, and barn man for the rest of their lives. He was especially generous to the Roman Catholic Church, leaving $100,000 to the Order of Friars Minor in Croghan for the creation of a college in the town. He is primarily remembered today for the endowment he created at Theological College at the Catholic University of America for the construction of a building and a department for the education of young seminarians studying for the Catholic priesthood. One hundred and ten thousand dollars went to erect Basselin Hall, while $500,000 was set aside to fund a scholarship for \\"the very best and brightest\\" seminarians. The Basselin scholarship still exists today; notable recipients include the scripture scholar Father Raymond E. Brown, philosophers Monsignor John F. Wippel and Monsignor Robert Sokolowski, as well as Raymond Cardinal Burke, Daniel Cardinal DiNardo, Donald Cardinal Wuerl, Bishop Michael F. Olson, Bishop Robert Barron and Daniel Sessions. Basselin is also remembered as one of the most influential citizens of Croghan, New York. His mansion and family cemetery still stand as landmarks in the town today.

It spontaneously ignites in air and burns with a cool flame. The discoverers were able to have flames around their hands without discomfort, and called it \\"probably one of the coldest flames known\\". The gas was discovered in 1888. It is useless for chemical warfare as it burns immediately and is not toxic enough. Preparation Thiophosphoryl fluoride was discovered and named by J. W. Rodger and T. E. Thorpe in 1888. They prepared it by heating arsenic trifluoride and thiophosphoryl chloride together in a sealed glass tube to 150 ¬∞C. Also produced in this reaction was silicon tetrafluoride and phosphorus fluorides. By increasing the PSCl3 the proportion of PSF3 was increased. They observed the spontaneous inflammability. They also used this method: :3 PbF2 \\\\+ P2S5 ‚Üí 3 PbS + PSF3 at 170 ¬∞C, and also substituting a mixture of red phosphorus and sulfur, and substituting bismuth trifluoride. Another way to prepare PSF3 is to add fluoride to PSCl3 using sodium fluoride in acetonitrile.

Reactions PSF3 is decomposed by moisture and oxygen or heat. With heat, phosphorus, sulfur and phosphorus fluorides are formed: :PSF3 ‚Üí PF3 \\\\+ S The hot gas reacts with glass producing SF4, sulfur and elemental phosphorus. The pure gas is completely absorbed by alkali solutions. However, it does not react with ether, benzene, carbon disulfide, or pure sulfuric acid. It is stable against CaO, which can be used to remove impurities such as SiF4 and PF3. In air it burns spontaneously with a greyish green flame, producing solid white fumes. With dry oxygen combustion may not be spontaneous and the flame is yellow. On burning SO2 and P2O5 are produced. The gas burns with one of the coldest flames known. Reaction with water is slow: :PSF3 \\\\+ 4 H2O ‚Üí H2S + H3PO4 \\\\+ 3 HF If PSF3 is allowed to react with water in a lead glass container, the hydrofluoric acid and hydrogen sulfide combination produces a black deposit of lead sulfide on the inner surface of the glass.

PSF3 is an initiator for the polymerization of tetrahydrofuran. =Sulfur removal= :2 PSF3 \\\\+ SO2 ‚Üí 2 POF3 \\\\+ 3 S This reaction indicates why PSF3 is not formed from PF3 and SO2. :PSF3 \\\\+ SO3 ‚Üí POF3 \\\\+ S2 and sulfur and sulfur sesquioxide (S42+ polysulfate) as additional products. =Fluorine substitution= :PSF3 \\\\+ 2 ICl ‚Üí PCl2F3. :PSF3 combines with dimethylamine in solution to produce dimethylaminothiophosphoryldifluoride (CH3)2NPSF2 and difluorophosphate and hexafluorophosphate ions. Thiophosphoryl difluoride isocyanate can be formed by reacting PSF3 with silicontetraisocyanate at 200 ¬∞C in an autoclave. =Cations= :PSF3 reacts with alkali solutions producing the fluoride and a thiophosphate (PSO33‚àí). :CsF + 2 PSF3 ‚Üí CsPF6 \\\\+ CsF2PS2 (a thiophosphate).

PSIF2 can be converted to hydrothiophosphoryldifluoride PSHF2 by reducing it with hydrogen iodide. In F2PSSPF2 one sulfur forms a bridge between two phosphorus atoms. Dimethylaminothiophosphoryldifluoride is a foul smelling liquid with a boiling point of 117¬∞C. It has a Trouton constant of 24.4, and a heat of evaporation of 9530 cal/mole. Alternately it can be produced by fluoronating dimethylaminothiophosphoryldichloride. Physical properties The thiophosphoryl trifluoride molecule shape has been determined using electron diffraction.

She was founder of the Niagara Frontier Ballet and the Ballet Center of Buffalo. Life and career Kathleen Crofton was born in Faizabad, India, in 1902, to British parents. Her father had been an Army Officer who was killed in action. Crofton studied ballet under Russian dancers Olga Preobrajenska, Nikolai Legat, and Laurent Novikoff. She would go on to dance with Anna Pavlova's company between 1923 and 1928, earning the nickname \\"Pavlova‚Äôs Baby\\" due to her age. Crofton then danced with the Chicago Lyric Opera Ballet before touring Europe with Bronislava Nijinska's company. She also danced with the Levitov-Dandr√© Russian Ballet and the Markova-Dolin Ballet. Crofton retired from dancing in 1938 and gave up performing during World War II in order to contribute to the war effort. After returning to ballet in 1950, Crofton opened her own studio in London and was often a guest at the Royal Ballet School. In 1966, she relocated to New York City when Alicia Markova, the ballet director of the Metropolitan Opera, invited her to teach. Shortly after, in 1967, Crofton relocated to Buffalo, NY, where she established a ballet company, the Niagara Frontier Ballet, and feeder school, the Ballet Center of Buffalo, upon the recommendation of Markova. Here, she would continue to train dancers in the Imperial Russian style. In 1969, she convinced her friend Nijinska to produce three classical ballets in Buffalo and in 1971, the Niagara Frontier Ballet toured Europe with Rudolf Nureyev. Following the tour, Crofton's company and school was suspended due to financial uncertainty from their original funding body, the Metropolitan Buffalo Association for The Dance. They were bailed out by the Great Lakes Association for the Dance and in 1972 the company was re-organized as the Festival Ballet of New York. Although the new Festival Ballet of New York was met with mounting success, in April 1973, a fire in the company's studio destroyed sets, costumes, and musical scores, and ultimately led to the disbanding of the company. Cofton left Buffalo to teach at the San Francisco Ballet, and then to serve as the artistic director of the Maryland Ballet Company, but returned to Rochester, NY in 1978 to establish a classical company, Ballet Concordia. Before the company could get off the ground, however, Cofton suffered a heart attack at her desk in Rochester, and died on 30 November 1979. =Notable students= *Roger Tully *Belinda Wright Further reading References Category:1902 births Category:1979 deaths Category:English ballerinas Category:English theatre directors Category:Dance in New York City Category:Dance in New York (state) Category:People from Faizabad Category:Ballet teachers ","title":"Kathleen Crofton"},{"id":"34531308","text":"Abdul Aziz Keita (born 17 June 1990 in Guinea) is a professional footballer from Guinea.

It tells the story of an idealistic high-school teacher who believes society, like a pupil, is learning from experience and reason. Plot and content Eberhard Starusch is a 40-year-old teacher of German and history who lives in West Berlin and acts as the tragicomic centre of the novel. In the background one of his students, Phillipp Scherbaum, is planning to set fire to his dog Max on the Kurfurstendamm as a protest against the US involvement in the Vietnam War. Starusch undergoes a long sequence of dental operations in 1967 in a surgery where television is used as a method of distracting patients from the operations and the pain that is involved in them, with the resultant televisual images merging and melding into his consciousness and reflections. Starusch recounts his own meditations upon the political past and the post-war situation in Adenauer's Germany and the inadequacy, from his perspective, of both Left and Right political ideologies and party alignments in that period (with tooth decay acting as a metaphor for wider spiritual and political decay). The book is largely an internal monologue from Starusch's perspective, punctuated only on limited occasions by questions and observations from his dentist. Context and influences Grass had been deeply moved after learning about the H√ºbener Group, three teenage Mormons who distributed anti-Nazi material inspired by BBC London radio broadcasts and were arrested by the Gestapo in Hamburg. Two were released to labor camps, but the author himself, Helmuth H√ºbener, was executed by guillotine as a 17-year-old traitor to the Reich. Hitler personally refused to reduce or commute the sentence. When interviewed for the documentary Truth & Conviction (see external link below), Grass said it continually tore at him that he and other Germans couldn't somehow have dug deeper, seen through the Nazi deception sooner and found the courage to stand up. It eventually helped Grass sublimate his anguish to convert it into a novel. Critical reception Anatole Broyard wrote in The New York Times that \\"There is little in Grass's previous books to prepare us for this one. Where they were sprawling and self-indulgent, Local Anaesthetic is lean and ironic.\\" Broyard wrote that the author \\"unmercifully satirizes the impotence, the masochism, the desperate expedients, that make the lot of the liberal such a hard one\\". About the technical aspects, he wrote that \\"Grass has possessed himself of everything fiction has learned in the past two decades- and he uses that knowledge so well that the book is a brilliant tour de force. With this important difference: unlike most tours de force, it never condescends to its content. Every invention satisfies a need and comes out sounding natural.\\" See also * 1969 in literature * German literature References External links * ‚Äî documentary film on H√ºbener by Matt Whitaker Category:1969 German novels Category:German-language novels Category:Novels by G√ºnter Grass ","title":"Local Anaesthetic (novel)"},{"id":"34531360","text":"Geropaschia is a monotypic snout moth genus.

He was also promoted from lieutenant general to full general at that time. He previously served as commander of the Zimbabwe National Army. The Zimbabwe National Army is the land-based arm of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, formed at Zimbabwe's independence in 1980 following the integration of former members of the Rhodesian Army with Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army and Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) guerrilla movements (the armed wings of, respectively, Zimbabwe African National Union and Zimbabwe African People's Union).Rasmussen, R. K., & Rubert, S. C., 1990. A Historical Dictionary of Zimbabwe, Scarecrow Press, Inc., Metuchen, NJ, USA  Personal life  General Sibanda was educated at Marist Brothers Dete in Dete.  Rhodesian Bush War  During the Rhodesian Bush War, Sibanda trained and served as a ZIPRA military combatant. Sibanda left the country in 1973. He received military training at Morogoro under the likes of Retired Brigadier Ambrose Mutinhiri. His alias was Ananias Gwenzi. In 1974 after completing his training in Tanzania him and four others: Elisha Gagisa (Stanely Nleya), Elias Ndou, Abel Mazinyane and Joel Dambudzo were sent to Lebanon where they spent 9 months of rigorous training under the Palestinian Liberation Organization at Jalub. He even saw combat against the Israelis. Upon his return in 1975, he became an instructor at the newly opened Mbwembwesi training camp in Tanzania. He was then seconded to form part of the military commanders running Morogoro under the ZIPA. Among the Morogoro-based Zanla Commanders in ZIPA were Contsantine Chiwenga (commissar), Perence Shiri and Augustine Chihuri (Stephen Chocha). From ZIPRA there was Eddie Sigoge Mlotshwa and Sam Fakazi. He also became the commander of the GC-B region. After the death of Nikita Mangena in 1978, he became camp commander for the CGT (Communist Guerrilla Training) camp, located about 60 miles east of Lusaka. He was initially appointed to the ZIPRA High Command as chief of training however he swapped that position with Eddie ‚ÄúSigoge‚Äù Mlotshwa for Chief Of Reconnaissance leading the Military Intelligence department.  After Independence  Sibanda was attested into the Zimbabwe National Army at independence. He quickly rose through the ranks , by 1994 he was the only ex-ZIPRA cadre to have risen to the rank of major general.

By utilizing device-mapper, the \`multipathd\` daemon provides the host-side logic to use multiple paths of a redundant network to provide continuous availability and higher-bandwidth connectivity between the host server and the block-level device. DM-MPIO handles the rerouting of block I/O to an alternate path in the event of a path failure. DM-MPIO can also balance the I/O load across all of the available paths that are typically utilized in Fibre Channel (FC) and iSCSI SAN environments. DM-MPIO is based on the device mapperhttps://lwn.net/Articles/124703/, which provides the basic framework that maps one block device onto another.  Considerations  When utilizing Linux DM-MPIO in a datacenter that has other operating systems and multipath solutions, key components of path management must be considered. *Load balancing -- The workload is distributed across the available hardware components. Goal: Reduce I/O completion time, maximize throughput, and optimize resources *Path failover and recovery -- Utilizes redundant I/O channels to redirect application reads and writes when one or more paths are no longer available. History DM-MPIO started as a patch set created by Joe Thornber, and was later maintained by Alasdair G Kergon at Red Hat. It was included in mainline Linux with kernel version 2.6.12, which was released on June 17, 2005.Linux 2.6.12 kernelnewbies.org Components Simple multipath example DM-MPIO in Linux consists of kernel components and user-space components. * Kernel ‚Äì device-mapper ‚Äì block subsystem that provides layering mechanism for block devices. ** \`dm-multipath\` ‚Äì kernel module implementing the multipath device-mapper target. * User-space ‚Äì multipath-tools ‚Äì provides the tools to manage multipathed devices by instructing the device-mapper multipath module what to do. The tools consist of: ** Multipath: scans the system for multipathed devices, assembles them, updates the device-mapper's map. ** Multipathd: daemon that waits for maps events, and then executes multipath and monitors the paths. Marks a path as failed when the path becomes faulty. Depending on the failback policy, it can reactivate the path. ** Devmap-name: provides a meaningful device-name to udev for devmaps. ** Kpartx: maps linear devmaps to device partitions to make multipath maps partitionable. ** Multipath.conf: configuration file for the multipath daemon. Used to overwrite the built-in configuration table of multipathd. =Configuration file= The configuration file /etc/multipath.conf makes many of the DM-MPIO features user-configurable. The multipath command and the kernel daemon multipathd use information found in this file. The file is only consulted during the configuration of the multipath devices. Changes must be made prior to running the multipath command. Changes to the file afterwards will require multipath to be executed again. The multipath.conf has five sections: # System level defaults (defaults): User can override system level defaults. # Blacklisted devices (blacklist): User specifies the list of devices that is not to be under the control of DM-MPIO. # Blacklist exceptions (blacklist_exceptions): Specific devices to be treated as multipath devices even if listed in the blacklist. # Storage controller specific settings (devices): User specified configuration settings will be applied to devices with specified \\"Vendor\\" and \\"Product\\" information. # Device specific settings (multipaths): Fine tune the configuration settings for individual LUNs. Terminology *HBA: Host bus adapters provide the physical interface between the input/output (I/O) host bus of Fibre Channel devices and the underlying Fibre Channel network. *Path: Connection from the server through the HBA to a specific LUN. *DM Path States: The device mapper's view of the path condition. Only two conditions are possible: ** Active: The last I/O operation sent through this path successfully completed. Analogous to ready path state. ** Failed: The last I/O operation sent through this path did not successfully complete. Analogous to faulty path state. *Failover: When a path is determined to be in a failed state, a path that is in ready state will be made active. *Failback: When a failed path is determined to be active again, multipathd may choose to failback to the path as determined by the failback policy. *Failback Policy: Four options as set in the multipath.conf configuration file. **Immediate: Immediately failback to the highest priority path. **Manual: The failed path is not monitored, requires user intervention to failback. **Followover(for clusters): Only perform automatic failback when the first path of a pathgroup becomes active. This keeps a node from automatically failing back when another node requested the failover. **Number of seconds: Wait for a specified number of seconds to allow the I/O to stabilize, then failback to the highest priority path. *Active/Active: In a system that has two storage controllers, each controller can process I/O. *Active/Passive: In a system that has two storage controllers, only one controller at a time is able to process I/O, the other (passive) is in a standby mode. *LUN: SCSI Logical Unit Number *WWID: Worldwide Identifier is an identifier for the multipath device that is guaranteed to be globally unique and unchanging.

In art, he was a student of William Bradford, 1862, Boston; George Inness, Boston, 1862-3; Mauritz de Haas and R√©gis Fran√ßois Gignoux, New York. He studied under Eug√®ne Boudin for a year at the age of 19. He consulted with Samuel W. Griggs, Wallace Albert King, Jasper Francis Cropsey, Albert Bierstadt, and James Hamilton. Career Early in his career, Robinson established his reputation as a professional painter after exhibiting marine paintings of the San Francisco Bay. In the 1860s and 1870s, he made painting trips through Central America and Mexico. By 1876, he had regular painting exhibits, the works influenced by the styles of Hudson River School and En plein air. His illustrations and writing were included in Overland Monthly and The Century Magazine. Robinson received art awards from the California State Agricultural Society in 1878; and he received the gold medal for best collection of paintings in the exhibit of 1902. He lost 30 years worth of his sketches and paintings in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. Robinson was known for his seascapes and landscapes of Northern California. His paintings include, Ruins in Central America, 1870; Cyclorama of Yosemlte Valley, by , 1894; Burning of San Francisco, by , 1906; and Grand Canyon of Arizona, by . In 1892, assisted by five other well-established artists, Robinson began what would be one of the largest pictures ever painted in California, the Panorama of Yosemite. One of his paintings hangs in Buckingham Palace, 67 of his paintings are in Great Britain; his paintings were presented to Queen Victoria and to King Prajadhipok of Siam. An untitled seascape and The Wet Sand are part of the collection at the Oakland Museum. Other collections of his work include the 1860 California Panorama at the Bancroft Library, while others are held by the Society of California Pioneers, Maritime Museum of San Francisco, Crocker Art Museum, the Bohemian Club, and the Nevada Museum of Art. A 1921 home fire destroyed many of his California paintings. Robinson served as President of the Palette Club of San Francisco; and Dean of the Artists of California, since 1906. He was a member of the Bohemian Club and the San Francisco Art Association. Personal life He married Kathryn Evelyn Wright, cousin of Elmer E. Ellsworth, in 1874 in Ohio, and they moved to Alameda, California the next year. Since 1876 he made his home in San Rafael and had an office on Montgomery Street in San Francisco. Starting in 1880, Yosemite was his summer residence for the next 24 years; and he resided in Paris during the 1900 Exposition. He died at his San Rafael home in 1933.

Biography Tokyo University of the Arts, a school which Isawa Shuji helped establish Isawa Sh≈´ji was born in 1851 in the Takat≈ç Domain, Shinano Province, to an impoverished samurai family. Sh≈´ji's father, Isawa Katsusabur≈ç (‰ºäÊæ§Âãù‰∏âÈÉé, also known as Bunkoku ÊñáË∞∑), was a fairly low-ranking samurai secretary for the Takat≈ç Domain, and was also an amateur artist. Sh≈´ji's mother was Uchida Take (ÂÜÖÁî∞Â§öË®à). As a teenager, Isawa took part in the recently formed Dutch-style military drum and fife marching band in the Takat≈ç Domain. He also studied at the Takato Domain school, Shintokukan (ÈÄ≤Âæ≥È§®). In 1869, Isawa Sh≈´ji moved to T≈çky≈ç to reside with his uncle, the renowned physician Suda Tairei (È†àÁî∞Ê≥∞Â∂∫). While in T≈çky≈ç, Isawa briefly studied English privately with the missionary Christopher Carrothers and also with Nakahama Manjir≈ç, and in 1870 Isawa was selected to represent the Takat≈ç Domain as a student at the newly formed Daigaku Nank≈ç (predecessor of the University of Tokyo). In 1872, Isawa began working for the Japanese Ministry of Education and was dispatched to Aichi, where he served as the director of a teachers college. However, he was terminated from his ministry position after a dispute. In 1873 he began working for the Ministry of Industry (Japan), but in 1874 he was allowed to return to the Ministry of Education. In 1874, Isawa married Mori Chiyo (Ê£ÆÂçÉ‰ª£), the daughter of a former Tokushima Domain samurai. =American Studies= In 1875 Isawa was sent to the United States to study teacher training at the State Normal School at Bridgewater, Massachusetts (now Bridgewater State University). While visiting Boston, Isawa had a chance encounter with the American music educator Luther Whiting Mason, which led to private music study with Mason. Several years later, upon the joint recommendation of Isawa and his immediate supervisor in the Ministry of Education, Mason was invited to Japan to work with Isawa toward the development of the first Japanese school music curriculum. Isawa also studied English pronunciation and phonetics privately with Alexander Graham Bell, and taught Japanese to Bell. In addition, Isawa studied briefly at Harvard University before having to return to Japan upon his father's death. =Isawa and the Telephone= Sometime prior to January 20, 1877, Isawa became the first person to use a language other than English on the telephone. According to Bell, the telephone's inventor, ...a young Japanese student named Isawa...came to me for the purpose of studying the pronunciation of English. Of course, when he heard about the telephone he became very much interested. He said, ‚ÄúMr. Bell, will this thing talk Japanese?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúCertainly, any language.‚Äù He seemed very much astonished at that, and said he would like to try it. Mr. Isawa went to one end of the circuit and I stood at the other. He talked in Japanese and I reported the result to him. =Return to Japan= Isawa returned to Japan to head the Tokyo Normal School (now University of Tsukuba) in 1879. He was also involved in the development of the Tokyo School for the Deaf in 1880, the Tokyo School of Music (now Tokyo University of the Arts) in 1887, and the Taiwanese public school system in 1895. From the outset, it was never Isawa's intention to adopt Western music wholesale for use in the Japanese public schools, but rather to arrive at what he himself called a \\"compromise\\" between Western and Japanese music, the theory behind which had been culled from various European and American pedagogical treatises, and from Isawa's experiences in the United States, and which was also influenced to some degree by Christian church music that had entered Japan in the early Meiji era. Over time, Isawa's ideas about the goals of music education shifted. Initially, Isawa was chiefly concerned with what he saw as the psychological and physical merits of music education for young children. Gradually, however, he became interested in the use of music to promote character formation, and later he overtly emphasized the importance of moral education via music. A prolific writer and wide-ranging thinker, Isawa is also credited with some of the earliest works in Japanese on pedagogical theory and practice, education of the deaf, linguistics, and evolutionary biology. A music score composed by Isawa Sh≈´ji =Note about Spelling= The family name should be spelled Isawa, with an \\"s\\", and not Izawa. All period documents about Isawa Sh≈´ji written in Romanization‚Äîthose in Isawa's own hand as well as official documents maintained at Bridgewater Normal School and from his time at Harvard University‚Äîconsistently give the spelling as Isawa, not as Izawa. Music scores from the period also attest to the correct spelling: Isawa. Isawa's family roots are said to be near the village of Isawa, Kai Province, located in the present-day Higashiyatsushiro District, Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan. His ancestors had been warriors for the Takeda clan at Isawa, Kai, but they fled to the Takato Domain after the fall of the Takedas. In addition, Sh≈´ji himself sometimes spelled his given name \\"Shuje\\" during his stay in the USA, as can be seen in various documents housed in the Isawa Shuji Collection at Bridgewater State University. In writing his own family name in Japanese, Isawa consistently used the traditional and more complex form of the character for -sawa (Êæ§), and not the simplified form (Ê≤¢). Later in life, Isawa adopted the pen name Rakuseki (Ê•ΩÁü≥).

Jones is remembered as a 13-term member of the Oregon Legislative Assembly in which he represented citizens from four counties in the sparsely populated Eastern part of the state. Biography =Early years= Jones, known by his nickname of \\"Denny,\\" was born September 21, 1910 in rural Morrow County, Oregon in a house on a wheat farm located between the towns of Ione and Heppner.Andy Reiber, \\"Oregon Rancher and Statesman Denny Jones Looks Back on a Century,\\" Western Livestock Journal, October 29, 2010, pg. 8. His family moved briefly to the state of Montana before returning to Wheeler County in Eastern Oregon, where Jones attended public school in the small town of Spray. Jones' mother died when he was just 5 years old. Following his mother's death, his father moved the family to Crook County, where Jones attended school at Prineville.Larry Meyer, \\"Confessions of Red Meat Survivors: Oregon, Denny Jones, 98,\\" Range Magazine, Fall 2009, pg. 56. He completed two years of school at Crook County High School before being pulled out by his father, who had designs on making his diminutive son into a professional racing jockey. Jones spent over a year riding horses throughout British Columbia, Canada and in Tijuana, Mexico before he began to gain too much weight, making a further career in horse racing impossible. Jones returned to rural Malheur County, Oregon where he took a job on a cattle ranch. He would remain a ranch hand and rancher for the rest of his working life. In 1939, Jones went into a business partnership with a cousin who owned two cattle ranches, one near the small Oregon town of Jonesboro and the other in close proximity to Juntura. Jones managed the Jonesburo operation for the next ten years before ultimately buying the operation, on which he ran 400 head of cattle. Jones' ranch would ultimately grow to 550 head of cattle contained on 23,000 acres of high desert rangeland.Richard Cockle, \\"Still Kicking Against Excess: Denny Jones, 101, Helped Oversee Oregon's $7 Billion Budget in the 1990s,\\" The Oregonian, January 28, 2012, pp. A1, A6. Jones ran the ranch for the next 30 years, serving twice during this time as president of the Oregon Cattlemen's Association (OCA). In this capacity Jones gained his first legislative experience engaging in political lobbying on behalf of the interests of the OCA.\\"Capitol Celebrates Denny Jones Day,\\" Oregon State Capitol Foundation Newsletter, vol. 11, no. 2 (August 2011), pg. 1. =Political career= In 1971 Jones and his wife Mildred passed the ranch on to one of their sons and moved to the town of Ontario, one of the largest communities in Eastern Oregon. Jones was soon approached by a number of local business leaders who sought to convince the retired rancher to run for political office in the Oregon House of Representatives' 60th District, which was recently opened as a result of the retirement of Rep. Bob Smith of Burns. Jones was amenable to the idea of entering politics and entered the race as a Republican candidate, handily winning election in November 1972. Jones would serve in the Oregon Legislature continuously for the next 26 years, serving from 1973 until forced out of office by term limits in 1999.Peter Wong, \\"A laugh and a Lesson from Denny Jones‚Äô Celebration,\\" Salem Statesman-Journal Capitol Watch blog, May 27, 2011. Jones was a member for 18 years of the powerful Ways and Means Committee as well as the Oregon Legislative Emergency Board, a legislative executive committee dealing with financial matters which periodically met between the regular bi-annual sessions of the state legislature. He also sat on the Natural Resources Subcommittee. Jones was regarded as one of the most fiscally conservative members of the Oregon legislature during his time of service there. Jones would later recall that he was \\"tighter than the bark on a tree\\" when handling the state's money and opined that the state \\"didn't waste a dollar\\" on his financial watch. =Death and legacy= Jones was born eight days before the first Pendleton Roundup was held in 1910 and was consequently an honored guest at the event's 100th anniversary celebration in 2010. Jones rode atop a restored stagecoach in a parade held to mark the opening of the event, waving to the crowd. The Oregon State Legislature declared May 26, 2011 to be \\"Denny Jones Day\\" in honor of the centenarian legislative veteran. Jones met with Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber as well as top Republican and Democratic leaders of the Oregon House of Representatives and State Senate and was escorted to the floor of both houses for the reading of ceremonial resolutions. Jones was also feted with a mid-day chuck wagon lunch at the capitol, attended by former Oregon Governor Victor Atiyeh. Jones died April 25, 2012 at his home in Ontario, Oregon.Jeff Mapes, \\"Cowboy/Legislator Jones Dies at 101,\\" The Oregonian, April 26, 2012, pg. C2. At the time of his death Jones was remembered by Oregon Congressman Greg Walden, a former legislative colleague: > \\"Denny defined Eastern Oregon. He spoke little but said so much. He always > called it as he saw it, and never wavered from his conservative principles. > His word was better than a written contract.\\" Among Jones' numerous family survivors were four great-great grandchildren.

The idea was first developed by J. L. Jim√©nez at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Informally, it is the sum of the loads resulting from aerodynamic drag, acceleration, rolling resistance, and hill climbing, all divided by the mass of the vehicle. Conventionally, it is reported in kilowatts per tonne, the instantaneous power demand of the vehicle divided by its mass. VSP, combined with dynamometer and remote-sensing measurements, can be used to determine vehicle emissions. The United States Environmental Protection Agency held a \\"modelling shootout\\" in 2001, to help with the development of its (then) new MOVES (motor vehicle emissions simulator) vehicle emissions model. Two of the four modelling metholodogies in the shootout, one from North Carolina State University and one internal to the EPA, used vehicle-specific power metrics. MOVES was eventually implemented using vehicle-specific power as its primary metric. (See for the EPA MOVES draft VSP specification.)

It is based on the 1990 article \\"On Seeing a Sex Surrogate\\" by Mark O'Brien, a poet paralyzed from the neck down due to polio, who hired a sex surrogate to lose his virginity. John Hawkes and Helen Hunt star as O'Brien and sex surrogate Cheryl Cohen-Greene, respectively. The film debuted under its original title The Surrogate at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Audience Award (U.S. Dramatic) and a U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Prize for Ensemble Acting. Fox Searchlight Pictures acquired the film's distribution rights and released the film in October 2012. The Sessions received highly positive reviews from critics, in particular lauding the performances of Hawkes and Hunt. Hunt was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress at the 85th Academy Awards. Plot In Berkeley, California, in 1988, Mark O'Brien is a 38 year old poet who is forced to live in an iron lung due to complications from polio. Due to his condition, he has never had sex. After unsuccessfully proposing to his caretaker Amanda, and sensing he may be near death, he decides he wants to lose his virginity. After consulting his priest, Father Brendan, he gets in touch with Cheryl Cohen- Greene, a professional sex surrogate. She tells him they will have no more than six sessions together. They begin their sessions, but soon it is clear that they are developing romantic feelings for each other. Cheryl's husband, who loves her deeply, fights to suppress his jealousy, at first withholding a love poem that Mark has sent by mail to Cheryl, which she eventually finds. After several attempts, Mark and Cheryl are able to have mutually satisfying sex, but decide to cut the sessions short on account of their burgeoning feelings. One day sometime later, the power goes out in the building in which Mark lives, causing the iron lung to stop functioning and making it necessary for Mark to be rushed to the hospital. However, he survives and meets a young woman named Susan Fernbach. The film then cuts to Mark's funeral, held sometime later in 1999, and attended by four of the women he came to know and care for, including Cheryl. Father Brendan gives the homily and Susan reads the poem he had previously sent Cheryl. Cast * John Hawkes as Mark O'Brien * Helen Hunt as Cheryl Cohen-Greene * William H.

Lewin explained, \\"I felt that if I could do on film what he had done to me with his writing, then I could potentially deliver something powerful.\\" While writing the script, Lewin drew from his own experiences with polio and worked closely with Susan Fernbach, O'Brien's partner during the last years of his life, and Cheryl Cohen Greene, the surrogate. =Casting= John Hawkes said Lewin met and read with several disabled actors to take on the role of O'Brien but said \\"none of them felt quite right\\" for the character. Hawkes was drawn to the script due to Lewin's own experiences as a polio survivor. He read every article written by O'Brien, every poem by O'Brien he could find and credited Breathing Lessons for helping with his preparation: \\"It's 25 minutes of Mark O'Brien speaking frankly and often emotionally about his life ‚Ä¶ him being washed, getting outside. It was just invaluable. It was such an insight to him, and his poetry is throughout that documentary as well.\\" To simulate O'Brien's posture, Hawkes used a soccer-ball-sized piece of foam which he laid onto the left side of his back in order to curve his spine. Consequently, some of his organs began to migrate, and he was told by his chiropractor that as a result his spine lost movement. Nonetheless, he said it was \\"a minute amount of pain compared to what many disabled people face minute-to-minute.\\" Hawkes also practiced dialing the phone using a \\"mouth stick\\". Of his preparation, Hawkes commented that \\"As an actor in the most general sense, I try to figure out what the story is and how my character helps tell it, as a whole and from moment to moment in the script. I wanted to make all of the physical work second nature so I wouldn‚Äôt have to think about it, to just make it part of me.\\" On casting Hunt as Cheryl, Lewin noted that \\"She really understood the paradox of being a middle-class soccer mom and, at the same time, having sex with strangers for a living...That kind of complex role needs a thinking actress.\\" Hunt described meeting the real Cheryl Cohen-Greene as a valuable experience, explaining that \\"The moment I thought I actually understood this woman was when she used the term 'sex positive.' ... I thought it was pretty wonderful to get to embody that for the weeks that I was making the movie.\\" Hunt had few reservations in accepting a role which required multiple scenes of full nudity, saying \\"It's getting too late to not be brave, to not live my life fully, to not try to be an artist. Trivial things like how nice your hotel room is, or if you have to be naked for a while, they fade away.\\" She revealed that her performance was further inspired by her feelings about body image and motherhood, citing in particular a scene in which Cheryl disrobes to enter a mikvah bath as one of her favorites: \\"One of the things I love about the movie is when the mikvah lady says, ‚ÄòThis is the body God has crafted for you.‚Äô I want my daughter to get that message. Whatever shape she becomes‚Äîand she's sick of me saying this‚ÄîI just say, 'Love your body.'\\" Distribution and release The Sessions premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival as The Surrogate. According to Rachel Dodes, \\"the energy in the room was palpable\\" and the cast received several standing ovations. Fox Searchlight Pictures immediately acquired the film, paying $6 million for worldwide rights to it, a fee considered unusually high. The film has grossed $6,002,451 in North America and $3,135,887 in other territories, totaling $9,138,338 worldwide. For its Spanish-language edition, the film was renamed Seis sesiones de sexo (\\"Six Sessions of Sex\\"). Reception =Critical response= The Sessions has an approval rating of 91% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 203 reviews, and an average rating of 7.84/10. The website's critical consensus states, \\"Tender, funny, and touching, The Sessions provides an acting showcase for its talented stars and proves it's possible for Hollywood to produce a grown-up movie about sex\\".https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_sessions It also has a score of 79 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 39 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-sessions =Reviews= The Sessions was considered one of the 2012 Sundance breakout hits. John Hawkes received two prolonged standing ovations at the film's screening. It was praised by critics at the festival as \\"accessible, enjoyable, and light- hearted\\". Linda Holmes, writing for NPR, called the film's performances \\"uniformly terrific\\". Varietys Peter Debruge said, \\"performances are paramount in a film like this, and Hawkes works some kind of miracle despite the self- evident physical limitations of the role.\\" Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said: \\"... most decisively, in audience terms, it argues in favor of living a full life, whatever one's personal constraints, of not being intimidated by societal or religious dogma or, most of all, by one's fears... Hawkes' full-bodied vocal and emotional characterization stands in stark contrast to his frail corporal presence. Hunt's performance may be physically bold but is equally marked by its maturity and composure.\\" Kerry Weber of America Magazine criticized the depiction of the priest, saying: \\"His character constantly spouts platitudes that make him sound like his seminary training took place in the self-help section of Barnes & Noble.\\" Weber also criticized the film for not adhering closely enough to the writings of the real-life Mark O'Brien. As such, the film does not give due attention to the complex subject matter. Weber says: \\"Unfortunately for the viewer, The Sessions doesn't make things quite complicated enough.\\" The film also received criticism for the fact that while Hunt spent much of her time onscreen completely naked, Hawkes always remained covered. Director Ben Lewin stated that he made this decision on the grounds that showing an erect penis in a film would have guaranteed it an NC-17 rating rather than an R, which would have severely limited the film's viewership. Hunt also defended the decision, but commented on her own performance that \\"Anything less than the amount of nudity in the film would be antithetical to the spirit of the movie.\\" =Awards= The film received the Audience Award: U.S. Dramatic while the cast received a Special Jury Prize for Ensemble Acting at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. Both Hawkes and Hunt received Independent Spirit Awards for their performances. The Sessions won the Audience Award at the San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival. Ben Lewin received a nomination for Best International Direction at the 2nd AACTA International Awards, while Hawkes was nominated for Best International Actor.

His work laid the foundations for the establishment of several different congregations of Religious Sisters who now serve worldwide. The cause for his canonization was opened in France in 1991, and was accepted for investigation by the Holy See in 2007.Austrian Sisters Servants of the Sacred Heart \\"Gruender\\" Early life Victor Braun (as he called himself) was a native of Saint-Avold in the Lorraine region of France. A few years after his ordination for the Diocese of Metz, he moved to Paris to meet the spiritual needs of the German-speaking people of his region who were flocking from the farms to the capital at the height of the Industrial Revolution in France to find work.\\"Fr. Victor Braun & the Founding of our Congregation\\", Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary He became a regular confessor at the famed Basilica of Our Lady of Victories in Paris. In the course of his ministry, Braun also served in a seedy quarter of the city where he became aware of the struggle of the young women there who had come as unskilled workers, especially when they were not able to find work in the factories. He also saw single mothers struggling to survive with their children. With the help of a small group of volunteers he opened a hostel where the young women could find a refuge and place of support. He also opened a day care center so that mothers could find employment by which they could support their families. Additionally home visits were done by his volunteer ladies to the residences of the sick poor to care for them in their need. Founder By October 1866, Braun had reluctantly concluded that the work had to be entrusted to a congregation of professed Religious Sisters in order to guarantee its continuity. Thus he established three of these volunteers under the leadership of a Bavarian woman, Anna Katherina Berger, as a religious congregation, the S≈ìurs Servantes du Sacr√©-C≈ìur de J√©sus. Berger had come to Paris already a member of a community of Franciscan Sisters in Pirmasens, founded by the Blessed Paul Joseph Nardini. She was appointed as Mother Superior of the small community by Braun, under the name of Mother Mary Odilia. Braun expressed his vision for the congregation in these words: \\"The purpose of our congregation is to bring the love and compassion of the Sacred Heart of Jesus to all those we meet in our service of love.\\" Revolution and exile The sudden outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 caused a major change in the future of the small congregation. Rumors of anti-Catholic atrocities by the Paris Commune caused a group of the Sisters to flee to England for safety. They were followed by a larger group, who brought with them Braun, who was suffering from shock resulting from his ministry at the battlefront. Because of her nationality, the co-founder, Mother Odilia, was forced to return to her native Germany.Berger initially settled in the Rhineland, where she attempted to found a new community along the same lines. Thwarted by government policies of the period, she emigrated to the United States, winding up in St. Louis, Missouri, where she founded the Sisters of St. Mary, now the Franciscan Sisters of Mary. They established and still run hospitals throughout the Midwestern United States. The refugees were warmly received by Cardinal Henry Edward Manning, the Archbishop of Westminster, who gave them a small house in the Stratford area of the city. Braun and the Sisters quickly established themselves in the East End of London where they began again their mission of helping struggling workers and their families.\\"Beginnings\\" After the upheavals of the Franco-Prussian War and the subsequent uprisings, with the establishment of peace in France, Braun and some of the French Sisters returned to their homeland. They re-established the congregation there and its work. In 1873 he went to Austria where he started a new congregation of Sisters in the same form of work and with the same name as their French counterparts, (), whose motherhouse is in Vienna. Braun died in the Parisian suburb of Argenteuil on 18 May 1882.\\"Gruender\\" The Servants had been recognized in the Diocese of Versailles as a congregation in 1868 by the local bishop, Mgr. Jean-Pierre Mabile. Thus, in need of larger space, they chose to move their motherhouse to Versailles, where they arrived on Christmas Day 1884. They soon established services to the needy and the mentally handicapped of the region. Braun's remains were transferred to the chapel of the Motherhouse in 1925.Paroisse de Saint-Symphorien de Versailles Legacy The Sisters who remained in England later chose to separate and formed a new congregation in 1903, the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. In 2003 the three congregations stemming from Braun's work formed the Victor Braun Federation. Made up of the three congregations which trace their roots to Braun's original group, the members are: the S≈ìurs Servantes du Sacr√©-C≈ìur de J√©sus, Dienerinnen des heiligsten Herzens Jesu, and the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary.

Although this sea slug resembles a nudibranch, it is not a nudibranch; it belongs to the clade, Sacoglossa, the \\"sap-sucking\\" sea slugs. It was first described by Marcus in 1955 from specimens found in Brazil. Taxonomy Elysia clena is a species first described from Cura√ßao by Marcus in 1970. Jensen (1982) determined that it was a junior synonym of Elysia serca, first described by Marcus from Brazil in 1955. This was on the basis of the morphology of the radular teeth, the dorsal venation and biological observations. Elysia serca also bears great similarities to Elysia catulus (Gould, 1870), a species with a more northerly distribution, and Jensen (1983) considers that E. serca may be a subspecies or ecotype of E. catulus. Features in common between the two include the anatomy of the mouth, the shape of the radular teeth and the paths taken by the dorsal veins. Description Elysia serca is a small, slender sea slug with a maximum length of . The parapodia are less well developed than is the case in many other Elysia species and Elysia serca has a relatively large head. The characteristic radular teeth have the cusps bent at right angles to their bases. The base colour is some shade of brown or olive with many small patches of white and three larger white patches, two on the parapodia and one on the back near the heart.Elysia serca; Marcus, 1955 The Sea Slug Forum. Retrieved 2012-01-27.Elysia serca Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce. Retrieved-2012-01-28. Distribution and habitat Elysia serca is found in shallow waters in the western Atlantic from Florida south to Brazil. It was originally described from the southern end of its range, where it was found on brown algae and the green alga Ulva, on which it was presumably feeding. In Florida however it feeds on seagrasses including Halophila engelmannii, Halodule wrightii and Thalassia at depths of up to a few metres. Elysia catulus on the other hand, feeds on the seagrass Zostera and is found on the North American coast between South Carolina and Nova Scotia.Elysia catulus (Gould, 1870) The Sea Slug Forum. Retrieved 2012-01-28. Biology In Florida, there is a great variation in the size of populations of Elysia serca at different times of year. This is likely to be because the life span is less than a year and recruitment, and the establishment of new populations, comes as a result of planktonic larvae arriving from elsewhere and settling. Feeding is done by puncturing the plant cells with the radular tooth and sucking out the liquid contents. Elysia serca shows a preference for, and grows faster on, Halophila engelmannii. This may be because the plant has large epidermal cells which are easy to exploit or because of the absence of tannins, a chemical defence against herbivores used by some seagrasses.

As a geologist, she was noteworthy, not so much for the scientific value of her collection, but for the regard with which she was held in a predominately male profession. Her interest in geology started with stones she collected as a child and her enthusiasm continued until her death. Family and early life She was born at York Place, Oxford Road in the Chorlton-on-Medlock area of Manchester, the fourth and last child of Thomas Hornby Birley J.P. (1815‚Äì1885) and Anne Leatham (1820‚Äì1866). Her brother, Francis, was an amateur footballer who won the FA Cup three times in the 1870s and made two appearances for England. Her uncle was Hugh Birley, who was a Conservative Member of Parliament for Manchester from 1868 to 1883. In 1857, she moved with her family from York Place to Highfield in Heaton Mersey and then, in 1864, to Hart Hill Mansion, Pendleton, and again to 4 Seedley Terrace in 1884. Career as a geologist As a child, Birley developed an interest in geology and on her family holidays on the Isle of Man she would collect stones showing unusual peculiarities. At the age of 12, she became a subscriber to the Geological Magazine in its first year of publication in 1864. At first, she paid for her subscription from her own pocket before her grandmother made her an allowance to cover the cost. In 1884, she moved from Hart Hill Mansion to nearby Seedley Terrace. Before long, her collection had outgrown her home so she erected an iron building in her garden, which she named the \\"Seedley Museum\\"; the museum was opened to the public in 1888. In 1887, Birley joined the British Association for the Advancement of Science following the Association's conference in Manchester. The following year she became a life member, attending the Association's annual meetings every year until her death. In 1890, she joined the Geologists' Association and, in 1894, she joined the Malacological Society of London, founded the year before.home page of malacsoc.org.uk (official web site), accessed 2 March 2012 =Field trips= Dromiopsis birleyae ‚Äì a fossil crustacean discovered by Caroline Birley Mesodromilities birleyi ‚Äì fossil crab discovered by Caroline Birley Between 1887 and 1905, Birley regularly travelled abroad to collect geological specimens, usually accompanied by her friend Louisa Copland.

In the November 1901 edition of The Geological Magazine, Dr. Henry Woodward (of the Natural History Museum, London) described Birley's finds and named two new species of the genus Dromiopsis (D. birleyae and D. coplandae) after Birley and her friend, Louisa Copland. In naming Dromiopsis birleyae, Woodward wrote: > I dedicate this species to my friend Miss Caroline Birley, who has given so > much time and attention to the study of geology and palaeontology both at > home and abroad, and whose private collection bears testimony to her > devotion to science. During her 1889 visit to the Faeroes, she collected six hundredweight of rocks containing zeolites from the islands of Streymoy, N√≥lsoy and Eysturoy. In 1891, she and Louisa Copland contributed an article on the flora of the Faeroe Islands to The Journal of Botany. In September 1899, she discovered a new genus and species of crab in the gault clays at Folkestone, Kent; Woodward described this in The Geological Magazine and named it Mesodromilites birleyae. She also visited Ormara in Baluchistan (now Balochistan in western Pakistan); her collection of fossiliferous nodules was given to Richard Bullen Newton who described them in detail in the July 1905 edition of The Geological Magazine, with Woodward adding a further note. Children's author Jessamine and her Lesson Books (1887) Jack Frost's Little Prisoners (1887) She wrote several books for children, many of which were published by the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge. Her books include: * We are Seven (1879) * A Heap of Stones (1881) * Undine; a Romance of Modern Days; and Other Stories (1883) * Oh Dear! What Can the Matter Be? A Tale of Churchill Wakes (1883) * Eyes to the Blind: A tale (1886) * Gerald's Rescue (1886) * Jessamine and her Lesson Books, and How She Missed the Gipsey Tea (1887) * The Linen Room Window, or \\"What snow conceals, the sun reveals\\" (1898) She also contributed to two volumes of short stories: * My Birthday Present: A Series of Original Birthday Stories for Boys and Girls from Six to Twelve Years of Age (1886) Contributors:Sabine Baring-Gould, Caroline Birley, Helen Wilmot- Buxton, Ethel M. Wilmot-Buxton, Frances Charlton and Frances Clare. * Jack Frost's Little Prisoners: A collection of stories for children from four to twelve years of age (1887) Contributors: Stella Austin, Sabine Baring-Gould, Caroline Birley, Lord Brabourne (E.H.

Caroline Birley's contribution was A Christmas Wheatsheaf. =Other books= * My Lady Bountiful: A true tale of Harriet, Duchess of St. Albans (1888) Later life and death In 1896, she moved to Brunswick Gardens in Kensington, to where she also relocated her collection. Towards the end of her life, she returned to Pendleton. She spent most of her days in the British Museum, naming and arranging her specimens. Despite suffering from ill-health, she attended the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in York in August 1906. Her health continued to deteriorate in the autumn, but she still continued to label her latest finds, which included a large slab of New Red Sandstone from the Stourton Quarries near Birkenhead with Labyrinthodont footprints on its surface. In February 1907, she suffered a bout of influenza and died of a heart attack on 15 February. She was buried at Lingfield Church, Surrey, near the home of her brother, Francis. She was unmarried and had no children. Legacy In 1894, she donated eight specimens of zeolite group minerals from the Faroe Islands and Iceland to the Manchester Museum. Her will directed that most of her collection of geological specimens should be donated to the London Natural History Museum, with any material not wanted there to be passed to the Manchester Museum, with the request that her material should be labelled as belonging to the \\"Caroline Birley Collection\\". Her executors, Lazarus Fletcher of the Natural History Museum and her brother, Francis, distributed her collection more widely, with gifts to the Manchester Grammar School, the University of Oxford and to museums at Bolton, Bury, Rochdale, Radcliffe and Warrington. Her obituary, published in The Geological Magazine, said of her: > By the death of Miss Caroline Birley, a most ardent and enthusiastic student > has been lost to the science of Geology, one who from her childhood to the > end of her life never wavered in devotion to this her cherished pursuit, nor > thought any fatigue or personal sacrifice too great in order to visit places > of geological interest and obtain specimens for her beloved Museum.

Originally planned to be directed by McCarten in New Zealand, the film was shot on location in Ireland throughout 2010 and was directed by Ian FitzGibbon. The film stars Thomas Sangster alongside Andy Serkis. It tells the story of a dying 15-year-old boy who draws comic book stories of an invincible superhero as he struggles with his mortality. Plot In the first scene, 15-year-old Don (Sangster) attempts suicide by the train tracks or gives the viewer the impression he intends to commit suicide. However, he lets the train rush past him and simply watches. The next scene shows him getting therapy in a brightly coloured room. Don appears to have tuned out the therapist and simply jots down a drawing in his notebook. He then tears the page from his book and walks out the room leaving a puzzled therapist who eyes his drawing which features the therapist going 'bla bla bla bla bla'. Don asks his brother about his relationship with someone who his brother thinks fondly of. His brother seems happy with her. Don is a talented teenager who draws a lot of comic stories and since being told he had terminal cancer has lived in a world occupied by his superhero. Don frequently suffers from hallucinations and during a scan, sees a twisted woman (a cartoon and figment of his imagination) laughing hideously at him. In the reception room, a boy named Billy won't stop staring at Don. Don is drawing a picture and then rips it out of his book and hands it to Billy, getting up and leaving. It is a picture of a boy standing in a hole in a cemetery. Behind him there is a grave with the name 'Billy' written on it. In an effort to stop his suicide attempts, his parents send him to therapy. Eventually, he is sent to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Adrian King (Andy Serkis), one whom he initially does not like; but whom he forms a bond with quickly. Don walks home from school alone and balances on the wall of a bridge as cars rush past below him. He cautiously walks across, unaware that he has been spotted by the therapist. Don visually shows the therapist his opinion on his methods when he graffiti's a Skull 'n' Crossbones on his boat. However, later Don comes and cleans it off for him and his therapist offers love advice for his crush Shelly. Shelly reads out an essay from her book. Don looks at it and realises she has not done her homework and is left amazed. The teacher is on the phone and has not been listening to her. On the way out of the classroom, Don tells her: 'nice essay' and she smiles knowing he knows too. Don turns up at a party where he and his friends perfect a recipe for a drink made from alcoholic wines and beers. Grinning, Don takes a sip. On the way home he spots the woman again and it shows him spraying the air with something. In the morning there is graffitied woman on the school window which people crowd around taking pictures of. His parents are infuriated and he has been suspended from school for a week. Eventually, he is made to scrub it off and so does so when unexpectedly, Shelly kneels down and helps him. Don returns to the therapist and notices a picture of Dr. King's wife who died a while ago. During an English lesson Don and Shelly pass notes between each other and end up deciding to attend a party on the weekend. Don asks his therapist for 'love advice' and attends the party with Shelly. Before the party they both talk on top of a building admiring the view. Shelly tells Don she likes his drawings. Flattered, Don tells her she is the smartest girl in the class and really beautiful. Shelly does not think that is a 'talent' and would do anything for a talent like Don's. The party goes well until they discover a video of Shelly exposing her breasts and lying on the floor and beginning to strip off her clothes. Some one tells Don his girlfriend is 'dirty' and 'crazy' - intended as a joke. Embarrassed, Don claims she is not his girlfriend and they hardly know each other. Then he spots Shelly, who has heard what he said. She drives off on her motorbike without him. Don arrives home panicking and heartbroken and is then spotted by his therapist who asks him what's wrong. Don tells him to go away and leave shouting loudly. It results with him having a panic attack and needing to be rushed to the hospital. Don is informed his cancer has got worse and has only a few days left to live. His father decides to spend some time with his son smoking and the two get very emotional. When Don's mother finds out she tells the father to drive him to hospital. Don has a conversation with a younger patient who has cancer too. She claims she wants to be a 'dancer' when she is older. Billy says he'll be a prince and Don reveals he wants to be a superhero. Don's brother confesses to Don's friend that he does not want Don to die a virgin. They go around the school asking girls if they'll have sex with Don. All of the say that it sounds gross. Eventually they find some girls who are attractive and willing. Don is embarrassed when they show him pictures of the girls and ask for him to make a pick. Realising they've asked the majority of the girls in the school, Don hesitates. However, with the help of his therapist, they get one to agree. Don is completely nervous during his conversation with them and they stumble across the subject of 'true love'. She then asks for Don to show her some of his pictures. She is impressed and tells him she would do anything for a talent like his. He is reminded of Shelly. In a hallucination he sees the medic woman who tried kill him with a kiss. He leaves her apartment and goes to Shelly and apologizes. The two walk along a beach, hand in hand. Don makes her promise that if she's upset at all then she should go there and think of him. She promises. The scene fades and it shows Don on his bed dying in peace. His therapist gets on his sailboat which he has painted and drawn a similar Skull 'n' Crossbones on to what Don drew. Shelly is on the rock and the sailboat sails in the distance. It cuts into the credits.

After the war, he wrote A Compendium of the War of the Rebellion ‚Äì a complete record of every regiment formed under the Union Army, their histories, and the battles they fought in ‚Äì taking forty years to compile.  Background  Born in 1849, Dyer lost both his parents in childhood. In July 1863, at the age of 14, already two years into the civil war, Dyer and a friend ran away from school with the intention of joining the army. Although his friend's aunt provided guardian consent for him to enlist as a minor, Dyer's friend decided not to sign up. Dyer carefully assumed his friend's surname, Metzger, to avoid being traced and returned to school. On July 25, having passed the routine physical examination, he became a drummer boy in Company \\"H\\" of the 7th Connecticut Infantry Regiment.Dyer's Compendium (1959, New ed.). Introduction by Bell Irvin Wiley; July 1, 1959.  Army life  Dyer continued to serve with Company \\"H\\" during the remaining two years of the war. It is unknown whether he actively participated in any fighting, and most likely would have helped the wounded during engagements.Sifakis, p. 197. The 7th Connecticut was equipped with Spencer carbines in December 1863, making it better equipped to fight than those armed with the slower muzzle-loaded Enfield rifle. The regiment saw action in several battles during Dyer's service, including:Dyer, vol. III, pp. 1009‚Äì1010. *Battle of Olustee ‚Äì February 4, 1864 *Drewry's Bluff ‚Äì May 14‚Äì16, 1864 *Bermuda Hundred ‚Äì June 14, 1864 *Richmond‚ÄìPetersburg Campaign ‚Äì June 16, 1864 ‚Äì January 3, 1865 *Battle of Chaffin's Farm ‚Äì September 29‚Äì30, 1864 *Battle of Darbytown Road ‚Äì October 13, 1864 *Second Battle of Fort Fisher ‚Äì January 15, 1865 *Battle of Wilmington ‚Äì February 22, 1865 On July 20, 1865, the regiment was mustered out of service, the war having ended in April.  Post-war years  Dyer stopped using his false name after the war. He attended Russell Military Institute and Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven, Connecticut, reclaiming the education he left to become a soldier. From the age of 18, he became a commercial traveller ‚Äì an occupation he maintained for about fourteen years ‚Äì moving between various cities in the states of Pennsylvania and New York. He moved to Philadelphia in 1870, where he manufactured and sold escutcheons to veterans. In 1875, he was married in Bridgeville, Delaware and moved to Pittsburgh until the fall of 1876, then moved to Washington, Pennsylvania. Whilst living in Washington he went into business with a H. Frank Ward, forming \\"Dyer and Ward ‚Äì Printers, Stationers and Binders\\", which ran from 1881 until 1885. Dyer moved around on business, residing in several cities between 1885 and 1912, before settling his family in Cleveland, Ohio.Dyer's Compendium, p. 696-4: Dyer's movements can be found in his own handwriting in a copy of his letter to the Commissioner of Pensions, dated August 8, 1911. In 1904 he set up a temporary residence in Des Moines, Iowa, and dedicated himself to working in isolation on the Compendium, compiling his collection of around names and dates, for almost five intense years. Dyer remained in Des Moines until 1912, to promote the Compendium from his office, before moving to Boston, Massachusetts, with his family.  Dyer's Compendium  In 1867, Dyer became a member of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), a patriotic society of civil war Union veterans. It was around this time that he started to acquire details about Union regiments. His job as a commercial traveller brought him in touch with many veterans and officials, from whom he gathered official figures. The statistics he collected expanded into further areas, from regiments to details of formations, battles, movements, and similar data. He began to research using official records in various state capitals, and continued speaking to ex-soldiers and high- standing officers, such as General Sherman, who expressed interest in a comprehensive compendium and welcomed its future publication. Dyer utilized the official materials available at the War Department, namely the Official Records of the War of the Rebellion. After 35 years of information gathering, he moved into a single room in Des Moines to start producing a compendium worthy of print. He made seven revisions, each taking around seven months, as he sifted through piles of paperwork and notes, to produce an accurate account of the Union army. Working day and night, sleeping in a bed placed close to his desk, he toiled over the Compendium from 1904 until 1908, producing a 4,025 page typed manuscript. Published on February 15, 1909, by \\"The Dyer Publishing Company\\", through which he personally funded, wrote and promoted his work, printed by Torch Press of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a total of 4,500 copies of the Compendium were issued in a single-volume edition, measuring (imperial octavo), spanning 1,796 pages, and consisting of three parts: *Part I ‚Äì Number and organization of the Armies of the United States. *Part II ‚Äì Chronological record of the campaigns, battles, engagements, actions, combats, sieges, skirmishes. etc., in the United States 1861 to 1865. *Part III ‚Äì Regimental Histories. Part II also contains 90 photographs of Union soldiers and officers, maps and drawings of uniforms and battles from the civil war, but also includes reproductions of Dyer's 1863 recruitment medical form, and several personal letters. The original Compendium, which was bound in morocco leather and pebbled cloth, sold at $10 apiece (equivalent to $ in 2017 terms). The Compendium was well-received by civil war veterans and historians alike, who praised both its accuracy and value, as well as its thoroughness when compared to official military records.  Death  Dyer died on September 21, 1917, aged 68, of coronary sclerosis, survived by his wife and one of three children. He was buried at Mount Hope Cemetery, Boston, Massachusetts, in the GAR New Veterans lot on Webster Avenue, in an unmarked grave (no. 125). It was his own request to be interred without a monument, stating that his Compendium would serve as a memory to his life, long after any monument had crumbled away.  Works  Since its original publication in 1908, Dyer's Compendium has been reprinted several times in the U.S. due to its popularity amongst Civil War historians and enthusiasts.

It was originally known as the Mallards in 1943, but when assigned the F-8 Crusader the squadron pilots unofficially used the name \\"Challengers\\". The squadron was formally known as the Challengers from 1961 through 1993.A4skyhawks.org: VC-10 History There have been two separate and unrelated squadrons which have borne the designation VC-10. =First squadron designated VC-10WWIIJeepParts.com Composite Squadron 10 VC-10= The first squadron to bear the designation VC-10 was established as Composite Squadron TEN (VC-10) 23 September 1943 at Naval Air Station Seattle (Sand Point) in Seattle, Washington. It operated both fighters and torpedo bombers. The ceremony's presiding officer was LCDR G. L. Richard, CO of CASU 7, and the acting commanding officer was LT John R. Stewart, USNR. LCDR Edward J. Huxtable, Jr. took command of VC-10 the following week on 29 September 1943. Planes and material allowance for the squadron were drawn at Sand Point. On 5 April 1944, VC-10 was assigned as part of the air group for the escort carrier USS Gambier Bay.USS Gambier Bay VC-10http://www.ussgambierbay.org/the-battle/ CVE-73 was a Casablanca class escort carrier and was sunk in the second Battle off Samar. At the time, the squadron had 195 men and 31 pilots assigned. After Gambier Bays sinking the squadron operated for a time from fields on Leyte and from other carriers. With the Gambier Bay gone, most squadron members were sent back to the United States on leave, while some were transferred to other squadrons. In January 1945 the squadron was reconstituted at NAAS Ventura County Airport, California, LT Cleland S. Hathaway, USN acting commanding officer until the commanding officer; LCDR Huxtable, arrived on January 14. The squadron spent the remainder the war training in preparation for redeployment. It was disestablished with the end of the war. =Second squadron designated VC-10= This second squadron is the subject of this article. The squadron was established on 1 December 1943 as Utility Squadron SIXTEEN (VJ-16) at NAS Isla Grande in San Juan, Puerto Rico. VJ-16's mission was to provide gunnery target tow services, radar tracking, search and rescue, and photographic services to ships and aircraft in the Caribbean area. As was typical for most of its service, the squadron was equipped from the outset with a variety of aircraft types. Initially, the squadron's inventory consisted of Grumman J2F-5/6 Duck, Consolidated PBY-5/5A Catalina, Grumman TBF-1 Avenger, Douglas SBD-5 Dauntless and North American SNJ-4 aircraft. After a brief move to NAAF Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico in April 1944, VJ-16 settled in at NAS Miami, Florida in May 1944 and added Martin JM-1/2 Marauder, Grumman F6F-5 Hellcat, General Motors FM-2 Wildcat and Grumman TBM-1J/3J Avenger aircraft to its roster. For the remainder of World War II, the squadron operated detachments in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Brazil, Cuba, Panama and Trinidad. VJ-16 consolidated its operations at NAS Guantanamo Bay/McCalla Field, Cuba in April 1945 and was redesignated as Utility Squadron TEN (VU-10) on 15 Nov 1945. Over the next fifteen years, VU-10 variously operated JD-1, UF-1, Martin PBM-5A Marine, Consolidated PBY-6A Catalina, Douglas R4D-5 Skytain, Beechcraft SNB-5, Grumman F6F-5D Hellcat, Grumman F7F-2D Tigercat, Grumman F8F-2 Bearcat, Grumman F9F-6/8 Cougar and North American FJ-3 Fury aircraft, as well as Grumman F6F-5K Hellcat, Culver TD2C, and Radioplane KD2R-5 target drones. In 1957, VU-10 also established an operating detachment at NAS Jacksonville, Florida that was absorbed into Utility Squadron FOUR (VU-4) in 1963. With the closure of McCalla Field, VU-10 moved to the nearby NAS Guantanamo Bay/Leeward Point Field in January 1960 and added defense of the base as one of its missions after Communist rebels took over the Cuban government during the Cuban Revolution. During the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, VU-10's Vought F-8A Crusader fighters became the front line defense force for the base against both Cuban and deployed Soviet forces. The squadron, which acquired Grumman US-2C Trackers and, in succession, Vought F-8B/D/A/C/K Crusaders, was redesignated as Fleet Composite Squadron TEN (FLECOMPRON TEN or VC-10) on 1 July 1965. Douglas TA-4J Skyhawk IIs modified to carry air-to-ground ordnance and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles replaced the last of VC-10's F-8 Crusaders in 1976, augmented by a Douglas EA-4F Skyhawk II in the late 1980s. VC-10 continued to provide aerial target services for fleet training and dissimilar air combat maneuver training (DACT) for fleet aircraft during Atlantic Fleet carrier battle group deployment work- ups. VC-10 was disestablished at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba on 14 August 1993 as part of a post-Cold War reduction in naval forces and the transfer of the composite squadron mission to the Naval Air Reserve.http://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2006-06/lest-we-forget-fire- and-sword-vc-10 Patches * 1961-1972, VC-10's patch displays a Crusader's Cross on a shield (also, VU-10) * 1972-1993, VC-10's patch displays a Black Celtic Fighting Lion superimposed on a red, white and blue background Aircraft assigned F-8K Crusaders of VC-10 over Guantanamo, in 1974. * Martin JM-1 (B-26 Marauder) - 1943 * Grumman F8F Bearcat - 1947 * Grumman F9F Cougar - 1954 * North American FJ Fury (FJ-3) - 1953 * Chance Vought F-8 Crusader - 1961 * Grumman S-2 Tracker (US-2) - 1966 * Douglas A-4 Skyhawk (TF-4F) - March 1975 * Douglas A-4 Skyhawk (TA-4J) - July 1975 See also * History of the United States Navy * List of inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons * List of United States Navy aircraft squadrons References Externals Category:Composite squadrons of the United States Navy ","title":"VC-10 Challengers"},{"id":"34532317","text":"Clare Helminiak is a rear admiral in the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps.

It is based on the memoir, Eine Frau in Berlin, published anonymously (by Marta Hillers) in 1959 in German, with a new edition in 2003. (It was also published in English in 1954 and 2005, and in seven other languages.) The film premiered at the 2009 Berlin Film Festival and was praised for its portrayal of a morally complex and brutal period.  Plot  In the waning days of World War II, an assortment of women, children and elderly men struggle to survive in Berlin, cast out of their formerly middle- class lives. The Red Army arrives, defeating the last German defense. Its soldiers rape women of any age as they occupy the city. After being raped by a number of Soviet soldiers, the film's anonymous woman, a German journalist (played by actress Nina Hoss), petitions the battalion's commanding officer for an alliance and protection. After initially rejecting her, the married officer Andrei Rybkin (Eugeny Sidikhin) is gradually seduced by the beautiful but battered German woman. She has a cool, practical approach to her life and has been part of an informal community that developed among survivors in her apartment building. The officer subsequently protects, feeds and parties with her and her neighbors. Other women in the flats also take particular officers or soldiers for protection against being raped by soldiers at large. Rybkin comes under suspicion and he is reassigned.

It originally aired on Showtime on December 11, 2011. Brody takes his family on a trip to Gettysburg. The aftermath of the explosion finds Carrie experiencing a manic episode. Plot Saul (Mandy Patinkin) goes to the hospital to pick up Carrie (Claire Danes), who has been there for a week recuperating from her injuries. To his shock, he finds Carrie acting like a totally different person, talking a mile a minute, and ranting and raving about needing a green pen and theories about Abu Nazir. Saul and Maggie (Amy Hargreaves) take Carrie home. Maggie explains to Saul that Carrie has bipolar disorder, that the trauma from the explosion triggered a major manic episode in her, and that she will need to be supervised around the clock while her medication takes effect. Saul agrees to start staying overnight at Carrie's house. Meanwhile, Estes (David Harewood) meets with Vice President Walden (Jamey Sheridan) who is being kept in a safehouse after the bombing at Farragut Square. Walden is going to announce his candidacy for President soon and is frustrated that he is under protection and not out campaigning. He tells Estes he must track down Tom Walker and to \\"fire somebody...I don't care who.\\" Brody takes his family on a trip to Gettysburg, proposing it as a way to spend time together before he embarks on his campaign for Congress. Brody shows the family where the Battle of Gettysburg took place, and tells them stories of Civil War heroes. Later on, they go to a diner for lunch, and Brody excuses himself to get something at the drugstore. Brody instead heads to the back of a clothing store. Waiting there is a man who has tailored an explosive suicide vest for Brody. Brody tries on the vest while coldly asking whether the explosion will sever his head cleanly off his body. Saul spends the night going through the sea of papers that Carrie had been working on all day. He groups everything by the color that Carrie assigned it and puts it all up on a wall, effectively producing a timeline of Abu Nazir's activity. Carrie and Saul analyze the timeline the next morning and focus on a period of inactivity from Abu Nazir which, unbeknownst to them, coincides with the death of Issa. The Brody family returns home. Dana (Morgan Saylor) finds the package that contains the vest. Brody does not let her open it, claiming it is a gift for Jessica (Morena Baccarin). Dana shows her boyfriend some unsettling footage that she recorded of her father on her camera: a long period where he stood blankly in front of the battlefield, completely still. Despite her father's (James Rebhorn) protests, Carrie calls Brody. She describes the period that Abu Nazir went silent, and asks Brody whether he has any insights into it, since he was there and had a personal connection with Nazir. Brody offers to come over and discuss it. Shortly after, Carrie answers her door, anticipating Brody's arrival, but she finds Estes at the door instead. Estes reveals that Brody talked to him, confessing to an affair with Carrie and claiming that Carrie was spying on him and continually harassing him. He finds Carrie to be acting bizarrely and discovers the \\"timeline\\" which is made up of highly classified materials that should not be in her home. Estes, already looking for a scapegoat, needs no more convincing‚Äîhe fires Carrie. Production Consulting producer Meredith Stiehm and co-executive producer Chip Johannessen co-wrote the episode, it was Stiehm's second writing credit for the series and Johannessen's third credit. It was directed by Clark Johnson, his second directing credit for the series. Carrie Mathison's behavior during her manic episode was based in part on the personal experiences of writer Meredith Stiehm's sister, Jamie Stiehm, who is bipolar.

The study of their antigen receptors lead to the discovery of chromosomal inversion during the formation of the T cell receptor (TCR). Researchers at the CIML also published the first nucleotide sequence of a gene encoding a human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene and described how the TCR recognizes its MHC ligand. The functions of these T cells were also investigated, leading in particular to the identification of Granzyme A and GZMB (then called CTLA-1 and CTLA-3) and the demonstration of their playing a role in the perforin-granzyme-based mechanism of T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and to the discovery of the second, Fas ligand/Fas receptor based pathway of cytotoxicity. Other biologically important regulatory molecules identified at the CIML include interleukins such as interleukin-17 (as CTLA-8) and cell surface molecules, such as CTLA-4 regulating T cells. Subsequently, research at the CIML expanded to other cells of the immune system, including B cells, dendritic cells and natural killer cells, as well as other models systems, such as C. elegans. CIML researchers identified the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-containing KARAP/DAP12 that is important for NK cell function and characterized the key function of the killer activated receptor NKp46. Other recent advances include the discovery of early precursors of B-cell follicular lymphoma in apparently healthy individuals, and of dendritic cell aggresome- like induced structures (DALIS) in dendritic cells, thought to play an important role in regulating antigen presentation, as well as the discovery of MafB/M-CSF circuits in hematopoietic stem cell commitment, and macrophages.  Funding  The CIML is mainly supported by direct and indirect funding from INSERM, the CNRS, and Aix-Marseille University, covering for example the salaries of more than 125 permanent staff members. Other major funders include the European Research Council, European Union, the Agence Nationale de la Recherche, Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer, Fondation Recherche Medicale, Human Frontier Science Program, Institut National du Cancer, La Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, as well as CIML's industrial partners.  Education and training  The CIML's Master's and PhD program is integrated into the educational framework of Aix-Marseille University. Participation in the CIML program requires enrollment in the Master's-PhD program at the Ecole Doctorale des Sciences de la Vie. A unique part of the program is a student exchange scheme with Harvard Medical School.  Clinical activities  In immunology, more than in any other discipline, physiology is often revealed by pathology. Therefore, the Institute is involved in many studies with clinical objectives. A wide range of malignancies are studied at the CIML such as leukemias and hematopoietic cancers, lymphomas and primary immune deficiencies, or brucellosis and juvenile arthritis. Treatments are also a major concern of the institute, such as studies on the prevention, monitoring, and treatment of hematologic malignancies and on the impact of therapies on the immune system. Finally, theoretical work which may provide key solutions to medicine are performed at the CIML on inflammatory mechanisms associated with the development of inflammatory bowel. thumb References External links * Category:Immunology organizations Category:Organizations based in Marseille Category:Scientific organizations established in 1976 Category:1976 establishments in France Category:Medical and health organizations based in France ","title":"Centre d'immunologie de Marseille-Luminy"},{"id":"34532349","title":"Martin St≈ôelba"},{"id":"34532355","text":"A Multi-port Power Electronic Interface (MPEI) is a self-sustainable multiple input/output static power electronic converter, which is capable of interfacing with different sources, storages, and loads.

Some of the countries where the rite is exercised include Cameroon in West Central Africa, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. Traditionally, the rite is performed at numerous special occasions including funerals and weddings. Usually when an infant reaches four months of age or when a child becomes an adolescent, an Okuyi ritual is applied as well. Today, the Mekuyo rite is exercised by a range of ethnic peoples within the Bantu cluster. The coastal community known as Ndowe, also known as playeros, is a primary example, as peoples across Equatorial Guinea frequently perform the ritual in public. Gabon has two chief ethnic groups that exercise the Okuyi rite including the Mpongwe and Galwa from Lambar√©n√©, Gabon. The man in the custome is usually the leader of the group. The history of the Mekuyo can be traced back to Gabon. The dance is believed to have originated from the rites of passages initiated by western and southern ethnic groups like the Mpongwe and from the Galwa region. It was in the mid-nineteenth century when the Benga people, who are both native to Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, introduced the ethnic performance to the island of Corisco and Cabo San Juan. At the end of the century, the coastal group of the Kombe people had extended the routine to Mbini. By the beginning of the twentieth century, several clans in Bata such as the Punta Mbonda had embraced the Mekuyo tradition. Throughout the Mekuyo‚Äôs history there have been several famous Ukuyi performers. Some of the most famous are from Equatorial Guinea such as Alonga from Corisco and Boso bua Ndondjo from Mbini. Well known Okuyi dancers from the Litoral Province include Kungulu, Ngadi, Aduma and Ng√ºende a limba from Ekuku. Costume The typical Okuyi performer wears a large, loose costume that supposedly resembles the spirit of the clan members‚Äô ancestors. The ancestors are illustrated by the dancers as tranquil and serene and suggest that they were the people who safeguarded, counselled, and educated them from the residence of the deceased. Okuyi costumes are made either from the raffia palm, a tree native to tropical African nations, or bamboo. In the process of manufacture, the underlying outfit is produced using the woven fabric hessian. The thick textile forms the suit for the performer. After that design is complete, the material is covered by frills made from raffia palm which are woven into the hessian fabric. Performers usually wear black socks made of cotton on their feet as well as on their hands. Every dancer carries through his presentation wearing a mask made of a soft local wood known in Ndowe as ikuka (Alstonia congensis), a species from the evergreen tree genus Alstonia. The man in the costume is usually the leader of the group. In Gabon, the styles and colors generally remain the same throughout the country but in Equatorial Guinea, the types change depending on the location within the country. Hanging down from the mouth of the Okuyi is the skin of the servaline genet (Genetta servalina), a small forest cat. The skin has the role of protecting the Okuyi from bad spirits that threaten him. There is a relation with the Egyptian mythology of the feline type accompanying the journey of the soul of the dead, to the underworld. For the dead Okuyi who embodies the soul as well from the underworld simbolised by the genetta skin hanging from the mouth of the mask. The face masks on each performer is essential to identify the Okuyi. In Equatorial Guinea each mask differs from one another, however, in Gabon, the design has been kept constant since the nineteenth century. The design is basically a black chin and a black forehead with white covering the cheeks and upper face sides. The dark red eyes remain closed, as a sign that the person represented is dead. This contrasts with masks from Equatorial Guinea as the face masks range from geometrical forms to human faces. The majority of the masks have the eyes closed and very few have them open. Some masks that Mekuyo wear have a mirror attached on the forehead which also is used as a talisman. Mekuyo dancers also wear a cape known as an ecapa which is usually white and often features both the name of the Okuyi dancer, his birthplace and his birthdate. Okuyi mask from Gabon In Equatorial Guinea, there are commonly three principal colors painted on the wooden mask: white, red and black. These three colors represent diverse aspects which are illustrated to the audience but are mainly targeted to the initiated person who is the centre of the rite of passage. The colors on the mask aim to link in cosmogony to the ritual as the Mekuyo tradition is related to cosmos which are the customary dwellings of the spirits. The black on the mask typically symbolises darkness and death. The red displays the fight a person must perform during life, the strength needed to do so, the blood involved and the birth. The white demonstrates life, semen and the ancestors which the mask is supposed to portray. Rituals There are many types of Okuyi rituals exercised in several countries across Africa. In Equatorial Guinea, performances generally last approximately three hours, from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. mostly on Sundays. Performances usually consist of the Ukuyi dancer dancing in short and fast episodes as he stomps his feet on the ground usually to a beat played by three drums and wooden sticks. At the same time, a female chorus sing in the background chanting greetings and welcomes to the Mekuyo. Usually the Okuyi holds palm leaves or tall ibito branches or spears which gives them balance. The malanga leaves known as poto are used as a medium to plant the ibito. Palm branches are used to bless the members of the audience. The ibito is traditionally planted into the ground by the Mekuyo at the beginning of the ceremony in front of the chorus. The base of the ibito plant has a sack held by several poto leaves holding numerous barks from a variety of trees. This is supposed to provide security for the Mekuyo as well as for the members of the crowd. In all performances, the Mekuyo are assisted by the Mboni, which are a group of initiated young men who have the responsibility to care and assist the Mekuyo and encourage the dancing and singing. The Mboni also have the job to groom and carry the masks. The Okuyi‚Äôs identity is strictly secret and nobody in the audience is meant to know who is under the costume. The Mboni might become an Okuyi in the future. They are typically meant to be very agile and skilful dancers and musicians as well. =For infants= One of the most common types of rituals is for new mothers and their babies. When an infant reaches about four months of age, it is taken for a Mekuyo rite of passage where it enters another stage of his or her life. In the past, the Ukuyi used to take the baby from the mother and most of the time the baby didn't cry. As the baby was entering its new stage, a chorus chanted around the baby. Together they sang several songs, one of them being a tune about a panther taking the baby. However, in the present, the mother is permitted to hold the infant at all times in most of the rites. The actual ritual involves the mother and child being placed in the centre of the ring surrounded by the chorus and the audience, the mother holds the baby and sits on a chair. The Okuyi points at the baby with the malanga or sometimes a spear as a way to bless them. Then, water which has been previously placed in a bucket is sprinkled on the baby. The Okuyi dances around the baby and mother as they sit. =Funerals= Ukuyi during a performance in Equatorial Guinea The Mekuyo are known for their intermittent dances. In funeral performances the primary mourner traditionally sits on a chair in the middle of an open area and surrounding him or her is an Okuyi dancing in his normal method similar to the new mother's rite \\"djae\\". Like during most of the dances, the Mekuyo uses the palm, fern leaves or skins to bless both the mourner and the members of the audience. Music The songs featured in the Mekuyo presentations are normally in a polyrhythmic style. The instruments used are a certain type of drum known as Ngoma drums with the biggest kind being named the monduma. Traditionally, these drums used to be buried in the trunk of various banana trees. It is this that caused the sound to be heard as a deeper pitch. This was accompanied by the mosomba drum or, as it was called by the Kombe people, the ikubi. However, substitutes for drums are often used. One of the most common alternatives is a metal bucket filled with stones. Chants that are sung with the instruments are sometimes done in the old Benga language, proving incomprehensible for the actual people who perform them and listen to them. Often however, the tunes are sung in the language of the people who chant them. The songs‚Äô introductions are commenced by the males who give the first opening tones. Then the women follow. Women are the key voices of the chorus in Mekuyo dances as the Okuyi requires the female voice to dance appositely. The lyrics of the melodies the choir sings educate the listeners about everyday life possessions, experiences and traditional folklore. A common theme is reality of the Ndowe kinfolk or events that have happened to important people of the community in the past. The songs are an important way to communicate historical knowledge. This information is then passed to others through the singing and used as an expression to form a frame of the dances of the Mekuyo. In funerals, the Mekuyo music and dance is used to break the mourning period and bring hope to all the mourners for the future.

Archbishop Ganguly was a religious of the Congregation of Holy Cross. Career The local bishop sent him to the major seminary, called St. Albert's Seminary, run by the Jesuit Fathers at Ranchi of Bihar State, India. As usual, he was liked and appreciated by both the professors and seminarians for his studies and humble behaviour. He successfully completed two years of philosophy and four years of theology studies at the seminary and, on 6 June 1946, was ordained a diocesan priest at St. Mary's Cathedral, Ranchi, by Jesuit Bishop Oscar Sevrin. In 1947, newly consecrated Bishop Lawrence Leo Graner of the Diocese of Dhaka, sent Ganguly to the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, for higher studies in philosophy. He completed an M.A. in philosophy and then, in 1951, received his Ph.D. degree in philosophy with his doctoral dissertation on Purush and Prakriti (Self and Nature): A Philosophical Appraisal of Patanjali ‚Äì Samkhya ‚Äì Yoga. (Pata√±jali was an ancient Hindu philosopher promoting yoga for inner contemplation, born in India in about 250 B.C.)

These include: * George Shipway's novel Knight in Anarchy (1969) centres on a knight sworn to Geoffrey de Mandeville as he tries to gain power in the Anarchy. * Cecelia Holland's The Earl, also published as Hammer for Princes (1971), gives a vivid description of the last year of the struggle, Prince Henry's invasion of England and his eventual recognition as King Stephen's heir. * Graham Shelby's 1972 novel The Oath and the Sword (aka The Villains of the Piece), focuses on Empress Matilda's faithful supporter Brien FitzCount, Lord of Wallingford, through the years of the Anarchy. * Jean Plaidy's Passionate Enemies (c. 1976) from her multi-volume treatment of the British monarchy, captures the mood of the period and the personalities of Matilda and Stephen. * Ellis Peters set her series of Brother Cadfael books (published 1977‚Äì1994) against the background of the Anarchy.Kaler, Anne K. Cordially yours, Brother Cadfael. Bowling Green, OH : Bowling Green State University Popular Press, 1998. (pg. 55) * Diana Norman's novel Morning Gift (published in 1985) follows the trials of a Norman noblewoman as she struggles to keep safe her lands, her young son, and her people during the period of the Anarchy. * Ken Follett's novel The Pillars of the Earth (published in 1989) is set during this time, and was adapted to an eight-part TV miniseries debuting in the U.S. on Starz and Canada on The Movie Network/Movie Central on July 23, 2010. It premiered in the UK on Channel 4, October 16, 2010, and on CBC Television January 8, 2011. The book's plot is less concerned with the war as such, and more with how the weakening of Royal authority authority gave a free hand to various Aristocrats, such as the book's particularly rapacious Earl. * Sharon Kay Penman's 750-page novel When Christ and His Saints Slept (published in 1995) gives a comprehensive and informative view of the entire power struggle. * Elizabeth Chadwick's A Place Beyond Courage (published 2008, Sphere) is set during the Anarchy, focusing on the life of John FitzGilbert the Marshal. Her most recent novel The Lady of the English focuses on Matilda and on Henry's young wife Adeliza. * The Anarchy is the inspiration for the fictional civil war called Dance of the Dragons between princess Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon, depicted in George R.

Founded in the Southern Song dynasty, Xinye is noted for its well-preserved Ming and Qing era architecture and ancient residential buildings. Xinye is also known for holding ancestor worship ceremonies on the annual Shangsi Festival, an ancient tradition that is only practiced by a few communities in China today, including Xinye. In 2010 it was designated as a National Historic and Cultural Village of China. Location Xinye is located in western Zhejiang Province, in the southern part of Jiande bordering Lanxi. The village is governed by Daciyan town of Jiande city, which is in turn within the administrative boundary of the provincial capital Hangzhou. Xinye is overlooked on the northwest by Mount Yuhua () and Mount Daofeng (). The main access road is National Highway 330, 6 kilometers from the village. History Xinye was founded in 1219 during the reign of Emperor Ningzong of the Southern Song Dynasty, when founder Ye Kun () moved to the area. Ye Kun's grandson Ye Kecheng (, 1250-1323) expanded the village, building Xishan Ancestral Hall () on the western hills, and Youxu Ancestral Hall () at the center of the village. Most of the 3,900 villagers today are surnamed Ye and trace their lineage from Ye Kun through 29 generations. They are collectively called the Yuhua Ye Clan () after the mountain overlooking the village. During the eighth generation the village was further divided into subclans (), each building its own ancestral hall. There are now five subclans: Chongren (), Chongzhi (), Chongde (), Chongyi (), and Yuqing (), with the Chongren subclan being the most prosperous. Architecture With 16 ancestral halls and 230 white-washed ancient residences that are well preserved, Xinye is acclaimed as the largest open-air museum of ancient residences in China. Its architectural style is similar to that of the nearby historical Huizhou region which includes World Heritage Sites Hongcun and Xidi. Xishan is the oldest among Xinye's ancestral halls, and is now part of the Xinye Elementary School. Youxu remains the village's main ancestral hall where the most important ceremonies are held, though it is exceeded in size by Chongren Ancestral Hall of the eponymous subclan. Other major landmarks include the Ming dynasty Tuanyun Pagoda () and Wenchang Pavilion (). Also near the village is Daci Rock (), a Buddhist temple built on a sheer mountain cliff dating from the Mongol Yuan Dynasty. The village's remote mountainous location and strong sense of clanship are the major reasons for its excellent state of preservation. Even during the Cultural Revolution when much of China's cultural heritage was systematically destroyed, the villagers protected the ancient buildings by plastering lime and posting papers with quotes of Mao Zedong on their sculptures and carvings. Culture The main religious practice of the village is traditional ancestor worship; most temples in Xinye are dedicated to ancestors of the village or the subclans. To that end, the village has maintained a detailed genealogy book through the centuries, which is officially updated once every sexagenary cycle (60 years), accompanied by a major ceremony. While most regions of China celebrates the Chinese New Year as the main annual festival, in Xinye the most important festival is the Shangsi or Double Third, which falls on the third day of the third month of the Chinese calendar. Shangsi Festival is an ancient tradition that is only practiced by a few local communities in China today. The celebration includes a 3-kilometer ritual procession to Yuquan Temple () and back, and ancestor worship ceremonies and performances are held in many temples. In 2010 Xinye was designated as a National Historic and Cultural Village of China, and it plans to eventually apply for World Heritage Site status together with nearby Zhuge and Yuyuan villages.

Family Georges Charachidz√© was born into the Georgian √©migr√© community of Paris. His father David Sharashidze (French: Charachidz√©; 1886-1935) was a journalist and a member of the Constituent Assembly of Georgia before being forced to leave his homeland following the Soviet takeover of Georgia in 1921. Sentenced to death by the Soviet government, Charachidz√© had moved to Paris, where he had married a young French teacher, who gave birth to Georges Charachidz√© in 1930. Career Georges Charachidz√© grew up speaking both Georgian and French. In 1953, he obtained the supervision of Georges Dum√©zil, a leading French scholar of the Caucasus, for his doctoral thesis, which was published, in 1968, as his first book Le syst√®me religieux de la G√©orgie pa√Øenne (\\"The religious system of pagan Georgia\\"). In 1965, he accompanied Dum√©zil to Turkey for a field-work study of the Caucasian communities, descending from the 19th-century refugees of the Russian conquest wars in the Caucasus. While in Turkey, he assisted Dum√©zil in the reconstruction of the vanishing Ubykh language and in recording its last living speaker, Tevfik Esen√ß, who died in 1992. Charachidz√© produced several studies on the pagan religious systems of the Georgians and other Caucasians, the Georgian feudalism, the Avar grammar, Ubykh texts, and the Indo-European‚ÄìCaucasian interaction. Charachidz√© was a regular contributor to the long-running, Paris-based journal for Caucasian studies Bedi Kartlisa, founded and sponsored by the Georgian √©migr√©s Kalistrat Salia and Nino Salia.

He was killed in the course of the civil war between al-Amin and al-Ma'mun while defending al-Ahwaz against the army of Tahir ibn al-Husayn. Career Muhammad was a member of the prominent Muhallabid family, being a great-great-grandson of the eponymous al-Muhallab.Al-Tabari, p. 114. n. 435 At an unspecified date, he was appointed to the governorship of al-Ahwaz by the caliph al-Amin. When civil war broke out in early 811 between al-Amin, who was centered in Iraq, and his brother al-Ma'mun, who was in Khurasan, he remained loyal to al-Amin and defended al-Ahwaz for him.Al- Tabari, p. 114; Crone, p. 135 When the war began, the fighting between the two sides did not initially take place near al-Ahwaz, but by the autumn of 811 al- Ma'mun's general Tahir had advanced from Khurasan to the district of Hulwan at the edge of northern Iraq. Soon after this, Muhammad received news that an army was marching from Hulwan to take al-Ahwaz; in response, he gathered his own forces and advanced north to 'Askar Mukram. As the enemy forces approached, however, he grew nervous and decided to return to al-Ahwaz. He therefore turned around and headed back to the city, with Tahir's men following close behind him.al-Tabari, pp. 114-6 As soon as Muhammad arrived at al-Ahwaz, he entered the city and prepared his men for combat. They quickly encountered Tahir's advance forces, who attacked them with stones and arrows. A fierce battle between the two sides followed, and soon many of Muhammad's soldiers began to flee. When Muhammad saw that he was losing the fight, he and several of his freedmen dismounted, hamstrung their horses and charged at Tahir's men, killing many of them. In the midst of the charge, however, Muhammad was hit by a spear and fell; a group of enemy soldiers then rushed him and struck him until he was dead. Tahir therefore won the battle and took al-Ahwaz.Crone, p. 135; al-Tabari, pp. 116-8; al-Ya'qubi, p. 534 Notes References Al-Ya'qubi, Ahmad ibn Abu Ya'qub. Historiae, Vol. 2. Ed. M. Th. Houtsma.

In 1950 the remaining locomotives were renumbered as Class 99.590 by the Deutsche Reichsbahn.  History  In 1897, shortly after the railway company's foundation, the first of a new batch of locomotives was built for the NWE by Arnold Jung in Jungenthal. It was a Mallet engine, numbered NWE 11, with the front two axles in an inside frame and the rear two axles in an outside frame. The fleet quickly grew to 12 locos of which nine were made by Jung from 1897 to 1901 and three by the Mecklenburgische Maschinen- und Waggonbau AG in G√ºstrow in 1897 . The locomotives were very reliable, but six had to be handed over to the military railways during the World War I (including all three engines built in G√ºstrow) for use in France, and they never returned from their wartime duties. The remaining six engines received new, larger boilers with a higher performance. In 1927, locomotive NWE 12II suffered a derailment in Thumkuhlenthal upon which it fell off the high embankment. The engine, one passenger coach and the luggage van were so badly damaged that they had to be dismantled on the spot. In the mid-1950s, the first three newly designed locomotives (Neubauloks) of DR Class 99.23‚Äì24 came to the Harz Railway. As a result, the remaining five Mallets were no longer needed on the Nordhausen‚ÄìWernigerode line and were transferred to the Selke Valley Railway which suffered from a shortage of motive power. Two were scrapped - 99 5905 in 1975 due to damaged cylinders and an expired boiler certificate and 99 5904 in 1990 reportedly due to a damaged axle - but the remaining three are still in the fleet. 99 5901 suffered an accident in 1977, but could be repaired. After all passenger trains on the Harz narrow gauge lines were fitted with compressed air brakes, the HSB mallets could not be used for passenger duties any more and were stabled. Therefore, while 99 5901 passed inspection in 1991, it could only be used as a helper engine when the Brocken line was reopened. Only in 1992, suitable compressed air braking equipment was found for two engines. 99 5903 was converted first, followed by 99 5901 in 1993. These engines were repainted in their historic green livery with yellow ornamentation. In addition, they were given their old numbers again: NWE 11 and NWE 13II. 99 5901 was repainted in black in 1998, and received a new, more powerful boiler in 2002. No. 99 5902 was converted to compressed air brakes in 2000. It has now the number NWE 12III and runs in green livery. After its operational certificates expired, maintenance on no. 99 5903 has been deferred. Harz Narrow Gauge Railways currently operate the following engines of this type: * 99 5901: operational, * 99 5902: operational, used for specials, * 99 5903: certificates expired, stabled in Wernigerode Westentor station. A similar locomotive is no. 99 5906, but with the rear axles mounted in an inside frame.

Ltd. was a Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, based 'design and construct' building organisation, specialising in complex buildings. It was originally formed in 1961 as a wholly owned subsidiary of The Austin Company, Cleveland, Ohio, initially under the name of Austin Anderson Pty. Ltd. It changed its name to Austin Australia in 1982. With headquarters in Sydney and branches in Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide and South-East Asia, The Austin Company retained ownership of Austin Australia until 1997, when it was acquired by private Australian ownership. However, it retained an affiliation status with The Austin Company in the USA Business model Austin Australia's core activities were specialist design, consulting, architectural, engineering, project management and construction services for high-profile manufacturing clients in Australia and SE Asia for forty-three years between 1961 and 2004, including major production facilities for Kelloggs, Sanitarium, Borg-Warner, Pilkington Glass, Procter & Gamble, Wella, Nestle, Denso, Toyota and National Foods. The company also designed and constructed hotels, including Ibis and Formule 1 hotels for Accor, the Bankstown International Hotel; and communications facilities for A.A.P. and the A.B.C. and more. The company's other diverse activities included: * Mineral Processing and Minerals Exploration (1965‚Äì1990), with major projects for Newmont Australia, Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australasia and Alcoa. * Forest Products (1970‚Äì1980), including the APPM wood chip mill at Longreach Tasmania (1970‚Äì1972), reputed to be the largest in the world at the time. * Petro-chemicals (late 1960s ‚Äì late 1980s), major projects for Dow Corning, Esso, Mobil and BFGoodrich. * Physical asset management improvement services and products (2002‚Äì2003), carried out by associate company Austin Pragma. Liquidation Austin Australia was placed into voluntary administration on 31 December 2003 and went into liquidation on 10 March 2004, with debts now amounting to A$23 million according to the Liquidator's Report to Creditors (31 March 2011, page 4). The major causes listed in the Liquidator's Report to Creditors (dated 27 February 2004) were: tight profit margins which turned profitable jobs into losses (p2); lengthy legal proceedings on five projects (p2); inadequate business systems (p9-10); and low capital base relative to turnover (p8). The Liquidator, Ernst & Young, Sydney, sold the Melbourne and South East Asia branches and dissolved the remainder of the company, including both its principle Engineering and Construction divisions (based in Sydney). The Melbourne branch evolved into APDD Pty Ltd, whilst the South East Asia branch (based in Singapore) became Austin-SEA and now has close links with Austin-UKhttp://austin.co.uk/downloads/pdf/austin_update_2010.pdf A Judgment of the NSW Supreme Court (2 November 2007) determined that Austin Australia was trading insolvent as early as 30 June 2003.http://home.exetel.com.au/greybeard/Austin/2007-11-02%20Insolvency%20Judgment.pdf The settlement of the liquidation was heavily delayed by a long-running arbitration dispute with Auburn Council,http://www.aar.com.au/pubs/pdf/insol/pap8feb05.pdf for whom Austin Australia built the Auburn Civic Centre in 2003. The dispute was settled in Austin's favour in 2009.http://www.auburn.nsw.gov.au/Govern1/CouncilMeetings/Business%20Papers%202009/Agenda%20for%20Council%20Meeting%20-%2020%20May%202009%20-%20Late%20Item%20-%20Austin%20Australia%20Pty%20Ltd%20(In%20Liquidation)%20V%20Auburn%20Council.pdf However, the Austin Estate then became involved in a dispute with Hillcrest Litigation Services, the company which had funded Austin's legal campaign against Auburn Council (Liquidator's Report to Creditors (17 March 2010, p. 3). This matter was not resolved until 2011. During the liquidation process, a number of companies which had provided services to Austin Australia prior to its collapse were pursued by the liquidator to refund substantial sums of money under Unfair Preference legislation. However, the Liquidator advised creditors in its Annual report to creditors dated 31 March 2011 (p. 3‚Äì4), that the legal processes involved with retrieving the money had \\"negatively impacted the net result to the estate.\\" The Liquidator consistently advised that former employees of the company would receive a partial dividend of their entitlements but that no other creditors will receive payment. Employees waited eight years and fifty-two days in the hope of receiving a substantial portion of their entitlements. Their hopes were dashed when the Liquidator's \\"First and Final Priority Dividend\\" to former employees was mailed to them on 20 February 2012, providing them with a meagre 3.7% dividend on leave entitlements and 0% dividend on redundancy pay. The Liquidation process is expected to be formally wound up in by April 2012.

The yard is the major freight yard of the region, handling all of the rail freight movements and most of the railfreight traffic around the West Midlands. History Bescot is on the Walsall Line between Birmingham New Street and Walsall, part of the former Grand Junction Railway, opened in 1837. It was built to handle the coal and industrial traffic associated with the West Midlands. In April 1966, a remodelled Bescot Yard was opened which was capable of handling over 4,000 wagons daily. Traffic from the West Midlands Domestic Coal network was diverted away from Bescot to Washwood Heath sidings in July 1987. This allowed for extra capacity at Bescot. Bescot TMD is to the north-west of the yard. This entire complex of track is clearly visible from the northern end of the M6 and M5 motorway junction. Present After closure of the 1950s developed hump shunting yard, freight since the 2008 credit crunch have declined significantly, and the associated Bescot TMD now carries no allocation of locomotives. Washwood Heath sidings were closed to freight trains in the latter half of 2008 and all residual services were transferred back to Bescot yard. DB Schenker services workings are still the mainstay of operations in the area, Direct Rail Services nuclear flask trains pass once or twice a week, and Freightliner Group Intermodal and Automotive trains also pass through. Regular Freightliner Coal trains also ran around on the up goods on their way to Rugeley Power Station prior to the closure of the power station in 2016. The yard can be viewed in operation from Bescot Stadium railway station, served by West Midlands Trains.

United Kingdom. The site, important for the occurrence of the plant Dorset heath, was the first reserve to be purchased by the Cornwall Wildlife Trust. History The moor was mentioned in 1311, being called \\"Funtenvaes\\", meaning well or spring. Ventongimps Moor was the first nature reserve to be bought by the newly founded Cornwall Wildlife Trust in 1966. The site was spotted by a Trust volunteer, Dr Frank Smith, and purchased because it was under threat from intensive agriculture activities. A Second World War bomber was discovered on the site in 1977 and subsequently removed for restoration, leaving behind a new pond on the moor. Geography The SSSI, notified in 1951, is located within Perranzabuloe civil parish, near the hamlet of Ventongimps, north-west of the city of Truro.Ordnance Survey: Explorer Map 104 Redruth & St Agnes The nature reserve is currently owned and managed by the Cornwall Wildlife Trust. Wildlife and ecology The moor's predominant habitat is wet dwarf shrub heath, although others include bogland, marshland, mixed deciduous woodland and open water. The Cornwall Wildlife Trust utilises periodic burning and partial removal of scrub to manage the site. Of particular interest to the site are two Red Data Book plants, Dorset Heath (Erica ciliaris) and Cornish eyebright (Euphrasia vigursii). Other flora found on the site include Cornish Moneywort (Sibthorpia europaea), the hybrid heath 'Dawn' (Erica x watsonii), Hay-scented Buckler Fern (Dryopteris aemula), Wavy- leaved St John's Wort (Hypericum undulatum), Yellow Bartsia (Parentucellia viscosa) and Yellow Centaury (Cicendia filiformis). The nationally rare Scarce Blue-tailed Damselfly (Ischnura pumilio) is one of the 13 species of dragonfly and damselfly that the ponds on the moor supports. The site also supports 99 recorded species of Lepidoptera.

It is a defunct railway transit point on the Bangladesh-India border. Important track in the British period During the British period all connections from southern parts of Bengal to North Bengal were through the eastern part of Bengal. From 1878, the railway route from Kolkata, then called Calcutta, was in two laps. The first lap was a 185 km journey along the Eastern Bengal State Railway from Calcutta Station (later renamed Sealdah) to Damookdeah Ghat on the southern bank of the Padma River, then across the river in a ferry and the second lap of the journey. A 336 km metre gauge line of the North Bengal Railway linked Saraghat on the northern bank of the Padma to Siliguri. Chilahati railway station platform The 1.8 km long Hardinge Bridge across the Padma came up in 1912. In 1926 the metre-gauge section north of the bridge was converted to broad gauge, and so the entire Calcutta - Siliguri route became broad-gauge. The route thus ran: Sealdah- Ranaghat-Bheramara-Hardinge Bridge-Iswardi-Santahar-Hili-Parabtipur- Nilphamari-Haldibari-Jalpaiguri-Siliguri. With the partition of India, this track got trisected. The through route was formally closed after the India- Pakistan War in 1965. Haldibari-Chilahati There are proposals to reoperationalise the Haldibari-Chilahati section. Bangladesh Railway will have to construct 7.5 kilometres of new rail tracks from Chilahati to reach the border while the Indian authorities have to set up 4.5 kilometres of tracks from its border to Haldibari railway station. In the Joint Statement issued on the occasion of the visit of the Prime Minister of India to Bangladesh, on 7 September 2011, it was stated: \\"Bangladesh Prime Minister expressed her appreciation to the Indian Prime Minister for amendment of the MoU between the Bangladesh and Indian Railways allowing Rohanpur-Singabad as an additional route for both bulk and container cargo for Nepalese rail transit traffic. Bangladesh side also appreciated the assistance from India for the movement of fertilizers from Bangladesh to Nepal by rail route. They also agreed to re- establish rail connections between Chilahati-Haldibari and Kulaura-Mahishashan in the spirit of encouraging revival of old linkages and transport routes between the two countries.\\" Saidpur-Chilahati railway line As of 2010, the long Saidpur-Chilahati line was in such a bad shape that there was no fast train between Dhaka and Chilahati. In 2010, Taka 103.68 crore was sanctioned for the development of this line.

It grows underwater on sandy or muddy sea floors in shallow parts of tropical seas. Description Halophila is the only genus of seagrass that lacks basal sheaths on the leaf stems. Halophila decipiens has thin rhizomes that run along near the surface of sand or mud, with a root at each node to anchor the plant in place. The almost stemless leaves grow in pairs from the nodes with a pair of scales at their base. The leaves are paddle-shaped and have a finely serrated margin and are up to long and wide. Male and female flowers are found on the same spathe and a female flower can produce about 30 seeds. Flowering seems to be stimulated by a rise in water temperature above a certain threshold rather than day length.

Early years and education  John Coles was born at Church Pitt, Washfield, Devon, on 15 April 1833. His father, John Coles (1807‚Äì1859) was a prominent agriculturist of Washfield and Witheridge. His mother was Harriett Tidboald of an old Devonian family from Anstey Barton, Devon. He went to the Chilcott's Free School in Tiverton and then, from 1845 to 1850, to Mr. Thomas Quicke's Academy, Kings Lodge,Letter from John Coles to his parents, 1 June 1847. Exeter. At the age of 16, in 1850, he went to London as a clerk at the Medical, Clerical and General Life Assurance Society at a salary of ¬£40 per year. His mother's first cousin, George Henry Pinckard (1805‚Äì1892) a nephew of Dr. George Pinckard, was the chairman of the company at that time. He established a reputation for hard work and diligent study. He passed in three successive years (1853‚Äì56) the examinations of the Institute of Actuaries, of which he became a Fellow in 1864.  Career and activities  In 1863 Coles was admitted as a member of the London Stock Exchange, joining the firm of J. & J. Whitehead (formerly Sir R. Carden & Whitehead), which became Whitehead & Coles, with Coles as the head in 1865. He was a Director of the Company of Adventurers trading into Hudson's Bay (Hudson's Bay Company), visiting Canada in 1896 and 1914 to view and report on the progress of the Hudson's Bay Company, travelling as far as Vancouver. He was present at the opening of the flagship Calgary store in 1913. He was elected as a Director of the Medical and Clerical in 1871 and as chairman in 1903. He held that position until his death in 1919. He was Chairman of the East and West India Docks Committees in 1888; a Director of the Canadian Pacific Railway; a Director of the General Reversionary Company; and a Governor of Blundell's School at Tiverton, Devon. His personal charm and strong views gave him great respect and affection from all directors and friends. He was a friend of Cecil Rhodes. A number of accounts refer to Coles as a leading financial authority and of having great influence on the insurance industry. Coles joined the Honourable Artillery Company in 1859 and formed part of the guard of honour when Queen Victoria celebrated her silver jubilee in 1863. He was also present as a Volunteer of the Honourable Artillery Company at the Exhibition in 1862. He was Past Master of The Worshipful Company of Wheelwrights. In 1884 Coles was adopted as the prospective Liberal candidate for Tiverton; but, before an election took place, the borough lost its separate representation and became the centre of the county division. In 1885 he contested, unsuccessfully, the St Albans division of Hertfordshire. In 1890 he was made a Justice of the Peace for the County of London. When, in the first week of August 1914, war broke out, Coles was one of the financiers personally consulted by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer as to the measures to be taken to prevent panic and to safeguard the interests of the country.  Benefactions  John Coles was proud of his Devon heritage and was a great benefactor to the Parish Church of Washfield, the borough of Tiverton and to Blundell‚Äôs School. He is acknowledged as the largest donor to the restoration of St Mary‚Äôs Church, Washfield in 1874. A brass plaque fixed to the tower acknowledges his contribution to the church and notes that in 1901 he paid for the restoration of the tower and provided two new bells. The tenor is inscribed in Latin with the words meaning: Long live Edward VII King and Emperor. John Coles born in this parish gave me to God and the church. John Coles also paid for the repair of the first Parish Register (1554‚Äì1679). By gift of ¬£1,000 in 1887 he secured for Tiverton the site of the People's Park. He then provided additional funds to equip and beautify the park. He also provided funds for the Technical, Science, and Art School; the Town Library; and the Infirmary, including a completely equipped modern laundry at a cost of ¬£400 and a nurses' block (known as the Coles Institute). As a Governor and Vice-Chairman of Blundell's School, Tiverton, he established the Physics Laboratory which was named the John Coles Laboratory. At the time of the Tercentenary of the school, on 29 June 1904, he presented the school with the Temple Memorial Portrait to commemorate the school's greatest pupil, Frederick Temple, Archbishop of Canterbury. Among the awards competed for every year at Blundell's are the Coles Memorial Prizes for mathematics.  Freeman of the borough of Tiverton  John Coles JP, Freeman of Tiverton On 30 June 1904 John Coles was made a freeman of the borough of Tiverton. He was only the third person to be granted such an honour and followed Lord Chancellor Halsbury and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple. The day of celebration included the presentation, a procession, official luncheon, tree planting at People's Park, afternoon sporting events and an evening ball at Blundell's School.  Family  John Coles married, in 1863, Amelia, daughter of Frederick Lermitte, of Twickenham, Middlesex and Jane Pinckard of Winkleigh, Devon. Jane Pinckard was the sister of George Henry Pinckard (1805‚Äì1892). They had a family of five sons: Frederick Pinckard Coles; John Howell Coles; Herbert Edwin Coles; George Henry Coles and Edgar Lermitte Coles, and four daughters: Caroline Mary Coles; Emily Amelia Coles; Agnes Lermitte Coles and Ethel Sophia Coles.  Will  John Coles wrote his will on 17 October 1919. He died on 18 October 1919 at Kensington, London. Probate on the estate valued at ¬£461,780 was granted on 26 November 1919. His children were the main beneficiaries except for his son George who had inherited the estate of his godfather and great uncle, George Henry Pinckard, and under the terms of the will had changed his name from George Henry Coles to George Henry Pinckard by Royal Licence. Other bequests included ¬£1,000 each to Blundell's School for the upkeep of the John Coles Laboratory, the Poplar Hospital for Accidents, and the London Hospital.

It was once the summer home of various mayors (burgemeesters) of Haarlem and is currently privately owned. History In the Middle Ages the property was owned by the wealthy Van Berkenrode family, whose name is still associated with the neighboring property.

The IPA promotes the welfare and interests of Flight Crew and is owned and managed by Flight Crew. Overview The IPA carries out a wide spectrum of initiatives that aim to support and enhance British aviation and its member's working environment and job security. These range from improving flight safety through training and educational programs and initiatives, lobbying Government, funding important research initiatives to representing crews with career and employment issues. The origins of the Association can be traced to the early 1990s when a self-help group was organised at the Gatwick airport Job Centre for pilots out of work following the collapse of Air Europe in 1991. By the spring of 1992 most of the pilots were back in jobs, many with a new airline Excalibur Airways and a specialist in financial affairs suggested that if fifty or more of them formed a group then it would be possible to get better rates on pension provision, loss of licence insurance and similar services. And so the Independent Pilots Association was born. The IPA took premises in Haywards Heath in the back office of a benefactor and straight away began helping others. Although not in a position to help financially, the IPA lent support, office and storage space to the Dan Air Pilots Action Group who sought compensation from British Airways (BA) when Dan Air (Dan Air Services Limited) was taken over by BA and several more pilots found themselves out of work and seeking fair representation. Steady growth of membership has been experienced over the years with new members coming from both ends of the career spectrum. Current membership is spread throughout all British operators, from flying schools and air taxi operators to major airlines, as well as some overseas. In the early 2000s it was recognised by the Directors that members, particularly new members, wanted more than the Association could offer. Noel Baker, one of the founding members and a long serving Director suggested the idea of a parallel organisation that would be a Union. This was instituted in 2006 and initially was known as the Independent Pilots Federation (IPF). The IPF Union would offer all the advantages of such an organisation and offering the opportunity for some pilots to have a recognition agreement in their airline or similar organisation. The reason that the IPA could not become a Union is that a ruling in the IPA's constitution required a 75% majority of all registered members to vote in favour. Since the majority of the original founding members had been badly let down by their own union in 1992 they were not inclined towards such a grouping. The Association offices are in Haywards Heath, West Sussex manned by a number of full and part-time staff. The Board of Directors, who comprise current and retired pilots from a variety of UK airlines have a wealth of experience and background in all aspects of aviation, all feel a passion for the continued concept of a self-help group that seeks to enhance British aviation and which promotes the welfare and interests of the members.

One flew successfully but the D-40, like other variable geometry sailplanes, was not commercialised. Design and development The Akademische Fliegergruppe of the Technical University of Darmstadt (Akaflieg Darmstadt) was first formed in 1921. It was, and is, a group of aeronautical students who design and construct aircraft as part of their studies and with the help and encouragement of their University. Design work on the variable wing geometry D-40 began in 1980 but the first flight did not take place until 15 August 1986. As understanding of thermal soaring grew in the 1930s, glider pilots and designers became aware of two conflicting requirements for cross country flights. The aircraft needed good climb characteristics and low stalling speeds to enable tight turns within thermals but high speeds in the sinking air between them. These respectively called for low and high wing loadings on wings with high and low camber. Several designs, e.g. the 1938 Akaflieg Hannover AFH-4 and the later LET L-13 Blan√≠k and Beatty-Johl BJ-2, had added large area slotted Fowler flaps on the inner part of the wing to increase camber and add area when extended. These satisfactorily reduced stall speed and with it the turn radius, but disappointed hopes of improving climb rates because of vortex generation (induced drag) at the tips of the flaps, seriously decreasing the lift to drag ratio. A solution to this problem was to extend the whole trailing edge, including the ailerons, and this route was taken by both the disappointing, heavy and complicated Operation Sigma Sigma, the more successful but still heavy and complex Akaflieg M√ºnchen M√º27 and the World Championship winning 15 m class Akaflieg Braunschweig SB-11. These last three designs changed the wing geometry by extending the wing rearwards at right angles to the trailing edge. Akaflieg Darmstadt took a different approach, pivoting the single piece flap near the tip and sliding it out from within the wing trailing edge, gaining the mechanism the nickname \\"penknife wing\\". As it is extended, a track in the fuselage side guides the thin flap into its high camber position at the wing root. The wing area is increased by 21% with the flaps extended. Although this arrangement avoids the vortexes at the flap tip, like any area increasing method used on a fixed span wing it results in a lower aspect ratio and hence a lower lift to drag ratio. The D-40 is constructed from a mixture of plastic- fibre composites, glass reinforced plastic (GRP), carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CRP) and aramid reinforced plastic (ARP) with some use of balsa wood. The shoulder mounted wing has a spar built from CRP rovings and GRP-balsa webs. The skin of both wing and flaps is an ARP/CRP/balsa sandwich; the flaps have CRP stringers. In plan the wings are straight tapered, with an increase in taper close to the tips; these outboard sections carry the short span ARP ailerons. The wing has 1¬∞ of dihedral and is swept forward at 2.3¬∞ at 25% chord. There are Schempp-Hirth upper surface airbrakes slightly forward of mid-chord near to mid-span. When the flaps, pivoted immediately inboard of the ailerons, are deployed the wing trailing edge becomes almost straight, making the plan almost triangular, and 12¬∞ of washout is generated by the now strongly cambered inner sections. This produces a lift distribution close to that of the ideal elliptical wing, with its minimum induced drag. The D-40 uses the fuselage and empennage of the Rolladen-Schneider LS3. This is a GRP shell, slender aft of the wings and with a T-tail with straight tapered surfaces. The rather wide cockpit occupies most of the deeper forward fuselage and has a long, one piece, front hinged canopy. A retractable monowheel undercarriage was assisted by a tail bumper. Operational history Initially the D-40 proved difficult for the relative novices of the Akaflieg to fly. In particular the short ailerons were lacking authority. The more experienced Helmut Reichmann did show, at one competition, that the D-40 outperformed the other sailplanes present under weak thermal conditions, as hoped for. The ailerons were redesigned and tall, narrow winglets added, which much improved the handling. In the end nothing became of any of the variable geometry glider designs. They were too complex for club use and significantly increased the pilot's workload.

History Kay was the manager of Chris Connor and Herbie Mann, among others, and erstwhile husband of Diahann Carroll. Pete Kameron was the manager of The Weavers and an advisor to The Tarriers. Kay and Kameron formed a partnership called Village Planners and from this partnership they started FM Records. Kameron and Kay ended up being listed as producers on many of the FM albums, along with Alan Douglas (who also was responsible for the op-art record jackets). The output of FM was a mixture of jazz and folk releases. The label was distributed by Vee Jay initially, and later by Roulette. Kay and Kameron lost no time in signing up people they knew. Chris Connor, who had had several successful albums for Atlantic, was talked into leaving Atlantic for the fledgling FM label, where she recorded two albums ‚Äî and possibly a third (unreleased but bootlegged) album ‚Äî before the label folded in 1964. Kay also released a various artists album featuring a song by Herbie Mann. Other jazz artists included arranger Bill Russo, Eric Dolphy, and spoken-word artist Ken Nordine. On the folk side, Kameron signed Jo Mapes, Fred Neil, Len Chandler and ex-Tarrier Bob Carey. There was also a new folk group called the Big 3, a trio composed of future Mamas & Papas star Cass Elliot along with folk singer Jim Hendricks and future solo star Tim Rose. In Rose's debut solo album for Columbia a few years later, he remade several songs he had done with the Big 3, and recorded a slow arrangement of \\"Hey Joe\\" that Jimi Hendrix copied almost note for note a few months later from the edited 45 version. In addition, Kameron signed husband-and-wife team Jake and Kate Holmes, recording under the pseudonym Allen & Grier, who did parodies. Jake Holmes later had a minor hit in 1970 with \\"So Close\\" [Polydor 14041, #49], but is perhaps better known as the alleged source of Led Zeppelin's \\"Dazed and Confused.\\" By the time album #307 came out in late 1963, the label was already showing early signs of a money crunch. The label used for the albums had a complex graphic design, but when the Big 3 started selling more than expected, they ran out of label blanks and were forced to go to a less expensive label, in black and grey with no graphics. By the time #311 was issued in 1964, they were in trouble. Although plans had been made for the albums numbered 312 to 319, many were not issued, and the ones that were are scarce today. Jo Mapes was quoted as saying that while the copies of her album (#317) were on the docks ready to ship, the company went bankrupt. The albums that had been pressed were sold to cutout wholesalers. Most of the copies existing today of albums #311 to #319 were salvaged from the bargain bins of the 1960s and have cutout holes in the covers (or \\"NR\\" stamped on the back meaning they were not returnable) and stickers on the front reading \\"39 cents\\" and such. Vee-Jay, their first distributor, released some of the masters on their own label, such as the Big 3 on Tollie 9006 [\\"Winkin' Blinkin' and Nod\\"/\\"The Banjo Song\\"], and the Eric Dolphy album, which they reissued several times on Vee-Jay and Epitaph (see related discographies). Ultimately, other than the Eric Dolphy album, most of the other masters seemed to end up with Roulette. In 1968, some of the FM masters were reissued by Roulette, such as the Big 3 albums and some of the jazz issues, and later they were reissued on CD via the companies who issued Roulette Jazz recordings and licensed material from the Roulette catalog.

Due to family responsibilities, she only started photography when she was aged 34, after meeting the wildlife photographer Richard Kearton. She joined the Royal Photographic Society in 1901, and by 1904 she had started to give talks illustrated with her own photographic slides; by 1908 she was established as a professional lecturer. She spent part of each year in Norfolk, and also travelled widely in the United Kingdom and abroad photographing birds. Her 1911 photograph of a nestling bittern in Norfolk was the first evidence of the species' return to the United Kingdom as a breeding bird after its local extinction in the late 1800s. She wrote eight books and many journal and magazine articles, and her bittern picture resulted in her being awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Photographic Society. She was one the first women to be elected as fellows of the Linnaean Society and the first female honorary member of the British Ornithologists' Union. Though not a graduate, she was also an honorary member of the British Federation of University Women. She lost her sight two years before her death.  Early life  Turner was born on 9 June 1867 in Langton Green, Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent, to John and Emma (n√©e Overy) Turner. She was their fourth and last child, following a sister, Mary, and brothers John and Frank. Her father was a grocer and draper with three shop employees. The family was affluent enough to have a governess and a servant, and to send Emma to a boarding school.Parry & Greenwood (2020) pp. 1‚Äì6 Turner's mother died in 1880, when Emma was aged 13, and with the death of her elder sister Mary in 1891, Turner's life appears to have been mainly family-based, even after she started her photographic career, at least until the death of her father, aged 83, in 1913. She may also have helped her brother Frank's family between the death of his first wife, Annie, in 1895, and his remarriage some five years later. Turner was described as being \\"...small in stature but very wiry, quite capable with a punt or rowing boat\\", although she appeared to have suffered bouts of illness throughout her life, with a notable attack in the summer of 1907. The cause of her illness is unknown, although tuberculosis has been suggested. She was a keen gardener at her homes in Girton, Cambridgeshire and later in Cambridge, and kept terriers, particularly Manchester Terriers, which she trained to flush birds so that she could count them. Hickling Turner's hut and the Water Rail at Hickling Broad Turner took up photography after meeting pioneering wildlife photographer Richard Kearton in 1900, joining the Royal Photographic Society in 1901, and by 1904 she had started to give public lectures illustrated with lantern slides of her own photographs. By 1908 she was established as a professional lecturer producing her own publicity material, and in the 1911 Census she gave her occupation as \\"lecturer in ornithology\\". She typically photographed from close to her subject using dry-plate equipment. Turner first visited the Norfolk Broads in 1901 or 1902. Her early contacts included the gamekeeper Alfred Nudd, who would punt her to photographic locations, and his relative Cubit Nudd, who became her general helper on site. Another gamekeeper and professional wild-fowler, Jim Vincent, used his extensive knowledge of the area to find birds and nests. Turner's friend, the Reverend Maurice Bird, probably introduced to Turner by Richard Kearton, kept a natural history diary for 50 years and was therefore also able to share information.Parry (2020) pp. 11-16 For a quarter of a century, Turner lived and worked for part of each year, including two winters, at Hickling Broad in Norfolk, mainly on a houseboat of her own design, which she named Water Rail after the first photograph she took in The Broads, which was of a that species. The flat- bottomed boat was launched in March 1905, having been transported to the Broad on a trolley. She also had a hut on a small island in the south-east of Hickling Broad, which became known as Turner's Island. The hut was used as a photographic darkroom and as a spare bedroom when visitors stayed.Parry (2020) pp. 17-18 A highlight of her photography was finding, with Jim Vincent, and photographing, a nesting bittern, a species that had not been recorded as breeding in Britain since 1886. She also photographed a nest of the rare Montague's harrier, and the first breeding record of the ruff in Norfolk since 1890. Parry (2020) pp. 23-25 Turner was a pioneer of bird ringing in the UK, being allocated the first small-size rings issued by Harry Witherby's British Bird Marking scheme (numbers 1‚Äì10) in 1909. In practice, she seems to have done little, if any, ringing after the first year.Parry (2020) p. 33. Travels to 1923 Duchess of Bedford Although Turner spent part of the year in Norfolk every year from 1901 to 1935, she travelled widely elsewhere. From the family home in Langton Green, she would drive her horse and trap to sites in Kent and Sussex, but she also journeyed much further afield, including several weeks on remote North Uist in 1913, where she saw breeding red-necked phalaropes, divers and Arctic skuas. The following year she was a guest of Mary Russell, Duchess of Bedford at her house in Meikleour, Perthshire. The duchess was also a keen ornithologist, and the two women would have known each other for several years. When the duchess sailed to Fair Isle on The Sapphire, the ferry dropped Turner off at Stromness, Orkney on the way. On Orkney, Turner attempted to photograph breeding seabirds, took a day trip to Hoy, and through a chance encounter found herself a guest at Balfour Castle on Shapinsay. Her host, Colonel David Balfour, sailed her back to Orkney to get the ferry to Inverness, from where she went to Aviemore to search for crested tits.Parry & Greenwood (2020) pp. 49‚Äì53 She went to Lindisfarne Castle on Holy Island in the autumn as a guest of Edwin Hudson, owner of Country Life, and stayed there for the 1914‚Äì15 winter through to May. The island is a migration hotspot, and rarities she saw included great grey shrike and White's thrush. she also made several boat trips to the Farne Islands, six miles away.Parry & Greenwood (2020) pp. 54‚Äì55. Probably in early 1913, Turner had bought a house in Girton, her permanent home for the next decade. Her journals for 1916 and early 1917 are missing, but it appears that from the middle of WWI she was working as a cook for a Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) hospital near Cranbrook, not far from Langley Green.Parry & Greenwood (2020) pp. 56‚Äì58. Turner's first trip abroad came in early summer 1920, when she went to Texel island in the Netherlands. She explored the island by bicycle, her main targets being species that no longer bred in the UK, including black tern, ruff, black-tailed godwit and avocet. She was particularly struck by the large numbers of singing nightingales. A trip to Italy in late 1922 seem largely committed to art and architecture as she toured the major cultural centres, a rare ornithological comment being a mention of a blue rock thrushParry & Greenwood (2020) pp. 60‚Äì61. Scolt Head The hut on Scolt head The National Trust had purchased Scolt Head in Norfolk in 1923 for its terns and other breeding birds, but was concerned about the damage done to the breeding colonies by egg-collection and, inadvertently, by visitors walking around the island. By this time, Turner was established as a photographer, bird expert and author, and was president of the Norfolk & Norwich Naturalists' Society (NNNS). The society proposed to appoint a \\"watcher\\" (warden) to supervise the reserve, and when Turner was told they were struggling to find someone suitable, she proposed herself,Parry (2020) pp. 38‚Äì40. thus becoming the first \\"watcher\\" on the island.. Aged 57, Turner found herself living in a basic hut in the breeding season, with no electricity and significantly dependent on rain for her water supply. Once protected, the birds prospered, the number of breeding pairs of common terns rising from 17 to 800 by 1925, her final year, and Sandwich terns increasing from 59 nests to 640 in the same period. As well as studying the breeding seabirds, she was also able to monitor bird migration and found a rare black stork. She wrote a book, Birdwatching on Scolt Head, about her experiences on the island.Parry (2020) pp. 41‚Äì48. She was frequently described by the press as the loneliest woman in England, but she pointed out that she never felt lonely, and had frequent visitors. After 1925 Soon after her stay on Scolt Island, Turner moved from Girton to Cambridge proper, and, as at her former residence, she indulged her passion for gardening in her suburban home. She was active in the Cambridge Ornithological Club, later the Cambridge Bird Club, becoming a vice-president and committee member. She went to Scotland in 1926, although she seemed by then to be less active as a photographer, perhaps concentrating on her writing. Two years later, she was off to Cornwall to see choughs, where only a few pairs remained in the county.Parry & Greenwood (2020) pp. 62‚Äì63. In 1929 she travelled to Amsterdam as a member of the International Ornithological Congress, which organised excursions to Texel, Naarden Lake and Zwanenwater. Around 1933 she went on a Mediterranean cruise with Chief Constable of the Isle of Man Lieutenant colonel Henry William Madoc and his wife. They saw more than 150 species, including 52 that were new to Turner. After this trip, her journals become sporadic and incomplete, although she seems not to have travelled abroad again.Parry & Greenwood (2020) pp. 64‚Äì66. Recognition alt=monochrome photograph of a resting bittern, partially hidden by reeds or grass, with its neck elongated, its beak pointed almost vertically upwards and its feathers fluffed up Turner's was awarded the 1905 Gold Medal of the Royal Photographic Society for her photograph of a great crested grebe. Jim Vincent also received a gold medal for his part in obtaining her bittern picture, in his case from the RSPB She was elected one of the first 15 female fellows of the Linnaean Society in December 1904; Then aged 38, she was one of the younger women admitted. Turner was one of the first four female honorary members of the British Ornithologists' Union admitted in 1909. and was the only woman, along with 11 men, involved in the appeal that led to the foundation of the British Trust for Ornithology, a fact that led to the Daily Telegraph (7 July 1933) inadvertently listing her as Mr E L Turner. She was Presidents of the Norfolk & Norwich Naturalists‚Äô Society from 1921‚Äì22. Turner was a vice-president of the RSPB, although she later fell out with the organisation following what she considered an unfair and dismissive review of one of her books. She was made an honorary member of the British Federation of University Women, despite not being a graduate. Last years Turner lost her sight two years before her death on 13 August 1940, and an operation to remove cataracts was unsuccessful.l The failed surgery and the advent of colour photography, which she believed would lead to her life's work being forgotten, meant that her last years were not happy. In her will, she requested that she be cremated, and left her photographic materials to the British Trust for Ornithology. Her book copyrights and ¬£50 were bequeathed to her nephew Geoffrey Cater Turner. Her boats, furniture and most other personal possessions were left to her niece Enid Mary Fowler. She also cancelled the ¬£900 her brother Frank owed her.Parry & Greenwood (2020) p. 67. Her estate was valued at probate at ¬£3031 0s. 10d. Legacy James Sant's 1906 painting of the admission of women to the Linnean Society of London in 1904. Turner is at the extreme left.Parry & Greenwood (2020) pp. 75‚Äì78. Turner was a pioneer in her photographic work in terms of her preparation, achievements and aesthetics, and earned praise from professional photographers such as William Plane Pycraft, who wrote She was also respected for her writing, which attracted praise from national newspapers including the The Daily Telegraph, the Manchester Guardian and the The Observer.Parry & Greenwood (2020) pp. 70‚Äì71.. The Observer, reviewing Bird Watching on Scolt Head commended the book for the author's knowledge and commitment, and said of the quality of the writing It is as good as anything in the 'Voyage of the Beagle' . Her 1924 book, Broadland Birds, published in 1924 formed the basis of a radio programme about her life, Emma Turner; a life in the reeds, broadcast by the BBC in 2012, produced by Sarah Blunt and with sound recordings by Chris Watson. Publications Reed warbler and nest from Broadland Birds It has been estimated that Turner produced hundreds, if not thousands, of photographs in her life, many of which appeared in her numerous publications. Most of her original plates were donated to the RSPB, or bequeathed to the BTO, but apart from her bittern images, virtually all appear to now be lost. Turner wrote eight books, including:  1925  * * From at least 1911 to 1915 she was working on an account of the birds of Norfolk, but it was never published, probably because she could not include records from the Hickling area, and no manuscript has been found. She was also a major contributor or chapter editor to at least six other multi-editor publications. Turner wrote more than 30 articles for British Birds, one of which was a 1919 review of the breeding biology of the bittern illustrated with her own nest photographs. She contributed to other journals, most frequently the Transactions of the Norfolk and Norwich Naturalists' Society. Turner was a regular contributor to Country Life,Parry & Greenwood (2020) pp. 68‚Äì69 for which she wrote more than 60 articles, and also contributed frequently to other local and national publications including four articles in The Times on Norfolk wildlife.Parry & Greenwood (2020) pp. 83‚Äì84 In addition to her professional writing, Turner kept pocket diaries and daily journals. These along with press cuttings and photographs were donated to the BTO in 2011, although her handwriting is so illegible as to require specialist assessment.Parry & Greenwood (2020) p. iv.

F. Thompson, was a New Zealand solicitor and politician for the National Party. Early life Thompson was born in 1884 in Westport. His parents, Selina \\"Lena\\" Junker and Thomas Fraser Thompson had married in 1882; his father was the first engineer for the Buller County. After his father's retirement, his parents moved from Westport to Greytown in the Wairarapa to live with his brother Sinclair Thompson who farmed in the area. Professional life and community involvement Thompson worked for the Lands and Deeds Department in Wellington. After part time study, Thompson graduated LLB from Victoria College in Wellington in April 1912 having majored in jurisprudence, property law, criminal law, and torts. The degree was conferred by the University of New Zealand. In December 1912, he resigned from the Lands and Deeds Department to become a solicitor in the firm of Robert Ward Tate in Greytown. He also resigned his membership on the Athletics Council, where he had held positions since 1907. In early 1913, Thompson moved to Greytown. In 1918, he was admitted as a barrister of the Supreme Court. In February 1916, Thompson was elected as one of the stewards of the Wairarapa Trotting Club. In February 1919, he was elected the club's president. Decades later, in 1964, he was made a patron of the club. By 1919, Thompson was the president of the Greytown Chamber of Commerce. Political career Thompson was a member of the Wairarapa Hospital Board from 1919, representing the combined Greytown and Carterton boroughs. In April 1925, Thompson responded to a deputation that he would not want to stand for the Greytown mayoralty. In March 1938, it became known that Thompson was one of five candidates for the National Party nomination for the electorate. He was successful over Jimmy Maher (who became an MP in 1946) and Henry Featherston Toogood (father of Selwyn Toogood). At the general election in October 1938, Thompson was beaten by the incumbent from the Labour Party, Ben Roberts. He was appointed a member of the New Zealand Legislative Council on 22 June 1950. He was appointed as a member of the suicide squad nominated by the First National Government in 1950 to vote for the abolition of the Council. Most of the new members (like Thompson) were appointed on 22 June 1950, and served until 31 December 1950 when the Council was abolished. Abolition was voted for on 15 August 1950. Family and death In December 1912, he became engaged to Ryda Thornton, the daughter of a solicitor from Dunedin. Thornton and Thompson married on 19 February 1914 at St. Peter's Church in Wellington. In 1916, the Thompsons bought a large Victorian house at 40 Kuratawhiti Street. The house had been built by the solicitor and former mayor of Greytown, Henry Stratton Izard, in the early 1890s (Izard was the younger brother of Charles Hayward Izard and son of Charles Beard Izard). Izard sold the house in 1906 to a Mr White following his bankruptcy, and White sold the house in 1916 to Thompson. The Thompsons would live at the house for the rest of their lives. In 1919, a 20-ha woodland was put up for sale opposite Thompson's house. He suggested to the borough council that the land be bought as a memorial park for fallen soldiers, which was acted on. After WWII, a memorial swimming pool was built in the park and the site developed into a sportsground. In 1932, Thompson was ill for a long time. Upon medical advice, he went to Rarotonga for recuperation. Initially, he was due to leave in June but was too sick to travel. He returned in November 1932. Thompson's father died in Blenheim during a family visit in 1924; his body was found in the Omaka River. Thompson's brother Sinclair died suddenly in his sleep in 1929 aged 40 in Carterton. Their mother died in 1938 at Masterton Hospital. Thompson died on 28 April 1966. His wife had died in 1962.Death certificate 1962/35260 Honours In the 1956 Queen's Birthday Honours, Thompson was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, in recognition of his services as president of the Greytown Chamber of Commerce.

In technical terms, Li-Fi is a light communication system that is capable of transmitting data at high speeds over the visible light, ultraviolet, and infrared spectrums. In its present state, only LED lamps can be used for the transmission of visible light. In terms of its end use, the technology is similar to Wi-Fi -- the key technical difference being that Wi-Fi uses radio frequency to induce a voltage in an antenna to transmit data. Whereas Li-Fi uses the modulation of light intensity to transmit data. Li-Fi can theoretically transmit at speeds of up to 100 Gbit/s. Li-Fi's ability to safely function in areas otherwise susceptible to electromagnetic interference (e.g. aircraft cabins, hospitals, military) is an advantage. The technology is being developed by several organizations across the globe.  Technology details  li-fi modules Li-Fi is a derivative of optical wireless communications (OWC) technology, which uses light from light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as a medium to deliver network, mobile, high-speed communication in a similar manner to Wi-Fi. The Li-Fi market was projected to have a compound annual growth rate of 82% from 2013 to 2018 and to be worth over $6 billion per year by 2018. However, the market has not developed as such and Li-Fi remains with a niche market, mainly for technology evaluation. Visible light communications (VLC) works by switching the current to the LEDs off and on at a very high speed, too quick to be noticed by the human eye, thus, it does not present any flickering. Although Li-Fi LEDs would have to be kept on to transmit data, they could be dimmed to below human visibility while still emitting enough light to carry data. This is also a major bottleneck of the technology when based on the visible spectrum, as it is restricted to the illumination purpose and not ideally adjusted to a mobile communication purpose. Technologies that allows as roaming between various Li-Fi cells, also known as handover, may allow to seamless transition between Li-Fi. The light waves cannot penetrate walls which translates to a much shorter range, and a lower hacking potential, relative to Wi-Fi.Li-Fi ‚Äì Internet at the Speed of Light, by Ian Lim, the gadgeteer, dated 29 August 2011 Direct line of sight is not necessary for Li-Fi to transmit a signal; light reflected off walls can achieve 70 Mbit/s. Li-Fi has the advantage of being useful in electromagnetic sensitive areas such as in aircraft cabins, hospitals and nuclear power plants without causing electromagnetic interference. Both Wi-Fi and Li-Fi transmit data over the electromagnetic spectrum, but whereas Wi-Fi utilizes radio waves, Li-Fi uses visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light. While the US Federal Communications Commission has warned of a potential spectrum crisis because Wi-Fi is close to full capacity, Li-Fi has almost no limitations on capacity. The visible light spectrum is 10,000 times larger than the entire radio frequency spectrum. Researchers have reached data rates of over 224 Gbit/s, which was much faster than typical fast broadband in 2013. Li-Fi is expected to be ten times cheaper than Wi-Fi. Short range, low reliability and high installation costs are the potential downsides. PureLiFi demonstrated the first commercially available Li-Fi system, the Li-1st, at the 2014 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Bg-Fi is a Li-Fi system consisting of an application for a mobile device, and a simple consumer product, like an IoT (Internet of Things) device, with color sensor, microcontroller, and embedded software. Light from the mobile device display communicates to the color sensor on the consumer product, which converts the light into digital information. Light emitting diodes enable the consumer product to communicate synchronously with the mobile device.  History  Professor Harald Haas coined the term \\"Li-Fi\\" at his 2011 TED Global Talk where he introduced the idea of \\"wireless data from every light\\". He is Professor of Mobile Communications at the University of Edinburgh, and the co-founder of pureLiFi along with Dr Mostafa .https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/purelifi#/entity The general term \\"visible light communication\\" (VLC), whose history dates back to the 1880s, includes any use of the visible light portion of the electromagnetic spectrum to transmit information. The D-Light project at Edinburgh's Institute for Digital Communications was funded from January 2010 to January 2012. Haas promoted this technology in his 2011 TED Global talk and helped start a company to market it. PureLiFi, formerly pureVLC, is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) firm set up to commercialize Li-Fi products for integration with existing LED-lighting systems. In October 2011, a research organisation Fraunhofer IPMS and industry Companies formed the Li-Fi Consortium, to promote high-speed optical wireless systems and to overcome the limited amount of radio-based wireless spectrum available by exploiting a completely different part of the electromagnetic spectrum. A number of companies offer uni- directional VLC products, which is not the same as Li-Fi - a term defined by the IEEE 802.15.7r1 standardization committee. VLC technology was exhibited in 2012 using Li-Fi. By August 2013, data rates of over 1.6 Gbit/s were demonstrated over a single color LED. In September 2013, a press release said that Li-Fi, or VLC systems in general, do not require line-of-sight conditions. In October 2013, it was reported Chinese manufacturers were working on Li-Fi development kits. In April 2014, the Russian company Stins Coman announced the development of a Li-Fi wireless local network called BeamCaster. Their current module transfers data at 1.25 gigabytes per second (GB/s) but they foresee boosting speeds up to 5 GB/s in the near future.Li-Fi internet solution from Russian company attracting foreign clients , Russia and India Report, Russia Beyond the Headlines, 1 July 2014 In 2014 a new record was established by Sisoft (a Mexican company) that was able to transfer data at speeds of up to 10 GB/s across a light spectrum emitted by LED lamps. Recent integrated CMOS optical receivers for Li-Fi systems are implemented with avalanche photodiodes (APDs) which are highly sensitive devices. In July 2015, IEEE has operated the APD in Geiger-mode as a single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) to increase the efficiency of energy-usage and makes the receiver even more sensitive. This operation could be also performed as quantum-limited sensitivity that makes receivers able to detect weak signals from a far distance. In June 2018, Li-Fi passed a test by a BMW plant in Munich for operating in an industrial environment. BMW project manager Gerhard Kleinpeter hopes for the miniaturization of Li-Fi transceivers, for Li-Fi to be efficiently used in production plants. in August 2018, Kyle Academy, a secondary school in Scotland, had pilot the use of Li-Fi within the school. Students are able to receive data through a connection between their laptop computers and a USB device that is able to translate the rapid on-off current from the ceiling LEDs into data. In June 2019, French company Oledcomm tested their Li-Fi technology at the 2019 Paris Air Show. Oledcomm hopes to collaborate with Air France in the future to test Li-Fi on an aircraft in- flight.  Standards  Like Wi-Fi, Li-Fi is wireless and similar 802.11 protocols, but it uses ultraviolet, infrared and visible light communication (instead of radio frequency waves), which has much bigger bandwidth. One part of VLC is modeled after communication protocols established by the IEEE 802 workgroup. However, the IEEE 802.15.7 standard is out-of-date: it fails to consider the latest technological developments in the field of optical wireless communications, specifically with the introduction of optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (O-OFDM) modulation methods which have been optimized for data rates, multiple-access and energy efficiency. The introduction of O-OFDM means that a new drive for standardization of optical wireless communications is required. Nonetheless, the IEEE 802.15.7 standard defines the physical layer (PHY) and media access control (MAC) layer. The standard is able to deliver enough data rates to transmit audio, video and multimedia services. It takes into account optical transmission mobility, its compatibility with artificial lighting present in infrastructures, and the interference which may be generated by ambient lighting. The MAC layer permits using the link with the other layers as with the TCP/IP protocol. The standard defines three PHY layers with different rates: * The PHY 1 was established for outdoor application and works from 11.67 kbit/s to 267.6 kbit/s. * The PHY 2 layer permits reaching data rates from 1.25 Mbit/s to 96 Mbit/s. * The PHY 3 is used for many emissions sources with a particular modulation method called color shift keying (CSK). PHY III can deliver rates from 12 Mbit/s to 96 Mbit/s.An IEEE Standard for Visible Light Communications visiblelightcomm.com, dated April 2011. It is superfast modern intelnet technology. The modulation formats recognized for PHY I and PHY II are on-off keying (OOK) and variable pulse position modulation (VPPM). The Manchester coding used for the PHY I and PHY II layers includes the clock inside the transmitted data by representing a logic 0 with an OOK symbol \\"01\\" and a logic 1 with an OOK symbol \\"10\\", all with a DC component. The DC component avoids light extinction in case of an extended run of logic 0's. The first VLC smartphone prototype was presented at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas from January 7‚Äì10 in 2014. The phone uses SunPartner's Wysips CONNECT, a technique that converts light waves into usable energy, making the phone capable of receiving and decoding signals without drawing on its battery. A clear thin layer of crystal glass can be added to small screens like watches and smartphones that make them solar powered. Smartphones could gain 15% more battery life during a typical day. The first smartphones using this technology should arrive in 2015. This screen can also receive VLC signals as well as the smartphone camera.An Internet of Light: Going Online with LEDs and the First Li-Fi Smartphone , Motherboard Beta, Brian Merchant The cost of these screens per smartphone is between $2 and $3, much cheaper than most new technology. Signify lighting company (formerly Philips Lighting) has developed a VLC system for shoppers at stores. They have to download an app on their smartphone and then their smartphone works with the LEDs in the store. The LEDs can pinpoint where they are located in the store and give them corresponding coupons and information based on which aisle they are on and what they are looking at.  Applications  With the short wave radiation as used by Li-Fi, the communications cannot penetrate through walls and doors. This makes it more secure and makes it easier to control access to a network. As long as transparent materials like windows are covered, access to a Li-Fi channel is limited to devices inside the room. = Home and building automation = It is predicted that future home and building automation will be highly dependent on the Li-Fi technology for being secure and fast. As the light cannot penetrate through walls, the signal cannot be hacked from a remote location. = Underwater application = Most remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) are controlled by wired connections. The length of their cabling places a hard limit on their operational range, and other potential factors such as the cable's weight and fragility may be restrictive. Since light can travel through water, Li-Fi based communications could offer much greater mobility. Li-Fi's utility is limited by the distance light can penetrate water. Significant amounts of light do not penetrate further than 200 meters. Past 1000 meters, no light penetrates. = Aviation = Efficient communication of data is possible in airborne environments such as a commercial passenger aircraft utilizing Li-Fi. Using this light-based data transmission will not interfere with equipment on the aircraft that relies on radio waves such as its radar. = Hospital = Many treatments now involve multiple individuals, Li-Fi systems could be a better system to transmit communication about the information of patients. Besides providing a higher speed, light waves also have little effect on medical instruments. Wireless communication can be done during the use of such medical instruments without having to worry about radio interferences hindering the efficiency of the task. = Vehicles = Vehicles could communicate with one another via front and back lights to increase road safety. Street lights and traffic signals could also provide information about current road situations. =Industrial automation= Anywhere in industrial areas data has to be transmitted, Li-Fi is capable of replacing slip rings, sliding contacts and short cables, such as Industrial Ethernet. Due to the real time of Li-Fi (which is often required for automation processes) it is also an alternative to common industrial Wireless LAN standards. Fraunhofer IPMS, a research organisation in Germany states that they have developed a component which is very appropriate for industrial applications with time sensitive data transmission. = Advertising = Street lamps can be used to display advertisements for nearby businesses or attractions on cellular devices as an individual passes through. A customer walking into a store and passing through the store's front lights can show current sales and promotions on the customer's cellular device. = Education = Students and teachers can be part of a more active educational community in a classroom that is Li-Fi enabled. Students with devices such as smartphones or laptops can communicate with the teacher, or with each other, to create a more efficient learning environment. Teachers can be able to collaborate with students to help better understand class material.

Curvis fought professionally from the mid-1940s until 1953, winning both the British and Commonwealth titles when he beat Wally Thom in 1952. Curvis was one of four brothers who boxed, most notably British and Commonwealth champion Brian Curvis. Career Curvis was born in Swansea in 1937 to Dai Nancurvis. His father had been a bantamweight fighter during his time in the British Forces, and had set up a gym in Swansea in which Curvis trained as a youth. He turned professional in 1944 at the age of 16 weighing in at flyweight. His first fight was a second round knockout over local fighter Bryn Collins. By the end of 1945 he was fighting in larger venues in England, including a victory over Cliff Anderson at the Queensberry Club in Soho. Into his late teens, Curvis moved up to featherweight. He lost only one of his first 19 fights, and that came from a disqualifaction against Frankie Williams. As a featherweight he beat both Germain Perez, the French champion and former Northern Area champion, Tom Smith. On 2 December 1946, he faced Al Phillips at the Royal Albert Hall in a title eliminator for the British featherweight title. Phillips, who would the next year become the European champion, knocked Curvis out in the second round. Curvis had been finding it difficult to making the weight at featherweight, and after losing to Phillips he moved up to lightweight.Stead (2008) p.187 The next year he faced fellow Swansea-based fighter, Ronnie James. James had been unwell in the week before the fight but still met Curvis at the Vetch Field in Swansea on 2 June. Curvis was reported as being 'faster throughout' and came close to knocking his opponent out before James' team threw in the towel in the seventh. By 1949 Curvis was making headway as a lightweight and on 31 January he was awarded an eliminator bout for the British lightweight title. His opponent was Scottish boxer Harry Hughes and the two faced each other at the Drill Hall in Abergavenny. Curvis lost the match on points. Again Curvis reacted to an eliminator loss by moving up the weight scale to welterweight. Curvis continued his progression and in the summer of 1950 he won his first title eliminator, beating Gwn Williams to set up a shot at the British belt. Before the title challenge he beat ex-Dutch welterweight champion Giel de Roode, followed by a loss to Charles Humez, the recently deposed French welterweight champion. On 13 September 1950 Curvis faced Eddie Thomas for the British welterweight title. Held at St Helen's in Swansea, the fifteen round fight went the distance, Thomas winning by points decision. In April 1951, Curvis travelled to Ayr in Scotland to challenge Billy Rattray in an eliminator challenge for a British welterweight challenge. Rattray lasted only until the second when Curvis won by knockout. He followed this up with a fight against Wally Thom in July 1952, the final eliminator for the British welterweight belt. The fight was halted in the ninth, when Curvis was eliminated for hitting Thom after a break but before the referee had ordered 'box on'.Stead (2008) p.188 Thom went on to beat Eddie Thomas, capturing both the British and Commonwealth welterweight titles, and on 24 July 1952 Curvis was given his first shot at a British belt when he was lined up to challenge Thom. Curvis stopped Thom in the ninth via knockout, becoming British and European welterweight champion. Curvis lost the European belt to South African Gerald Dreyer on 8 December 1952. The match, held in the newly built Rand Stadium in Johannesburg, resulted in Curvis losing his Commonwealth belt. He had Dreyer down in the sixth, but he survived a 'long count' which lasted as long as sixteen seconds; this was followed by Curvis breaking his left hand and without his main attack he was forced to box defensively for the rest of the fight. Curvis lost the bout on points. His final fight was against Frenchman Gilbert Lavoine for the vacant EBU European title. Curvis was disqualified in the tenth and never fought professionally again.

Born in Cologne, Bungarten had his early influence of Guitar music when he was a teenager. In 1981, he got noticed in the international guitar scene, when virtuoso guitarist Andr√©s Segovia honored him with the first prize at the Guitar Competition of Granada, combined with an extensive concert tour of Spain. To date, he has performed in more than 40 countries. Among his recordings, \\"J.S.Bach ~ Sonatas and Partitas for Violin solo\\", got serious recognition. Although he is often regarded as a Bach expert on the Concert Guitar, Bungarten claims to love and play a wide & diverse repertoire.http://www.mdg.de/pdf/0834e.pdf  Life  Under the influence of rock music of the 60s, 10-year-old Frank had picked up his first Guitar. His first teacher was a Paraguayan virtuoso named Carlos Baez, a temporary resident of Rhineland. Frank played his first gigs as a guitarist when he was just 13 years old in a band formed by teachers and his school. His passion for jazz led him to learn self-taught tenor and soprano saxophone. Despite his later career as a classical musician playing the Classical guitar, he has always regarded John Coltrane as one of his towering influences. Bungarten had studied Music at the Academy of Music Cologne. After musical training with Karl-Heinz Bottner and Hubert K√§ppel and a master class with Oscar Ghiglia in Italy he slowly worked on his own artistic voice and direction on his principle instrument, which is the Classical Guitar. In addition to the guitar he has played the saxophone with his group \\"Extempore\\", a free improvised music with numerous engagements in radio productions, festivals and jazz clubs. After a second place at the Federal University Competition in 1981, he met with serious success the same year when Andr√©s Segovia awarded him first prize in the Guitar Competition in Granada, combined with a tour of Spain. Immediately following his studies (graduating with distinction), he commenced his career as a University lecturer and has been performing as a soloist in almost all countries throughout Europe and the Americas. Till date, he has played as a soloist in over 40 countries, including the ones that are commissioned by the Goethe Institute. He has played at the Berlin Philharmonic, the Arts and Convention Centre Lucerne, the Gasteig Munich, the Salzburg Festival, Schwetzingen Festival, the Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival, MDR Music Summer, the Lower Saxony Music Festival and International Guitar Festivals of the Mediterranean, Scandinavian, Indian and many more. Frank has won two Echo awards for his outstanding stylistic versatility on the Modern Classical Guitar.From 'An Interview with Colin Cooper' as featured on Classical Guitar Magazine January 2000 He holds a chair at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik, Theater und Medien Hannover in Hannover, Germany. He resigned his second professorship at Lucerne Academy of Music (Switzerland) in 2010 in favour of his artistic activities. He regularly conducts masterclasses and seminars all over the world.

This helps trade verification for the client/investor and retains the interest of the investor in the market. After the trade occurs, the client or investor can also verify with the depository whether the shares have been allotted to him or not. Similarly there is depository participant who provides depository services to the client/Investor References *NSE Clearing and Settlement System Category:Stock market ","title":"Custodial participant"},{"id":"34533566","text":"Out to Win is a 1921 British melodramatic play written by Roland Pertwee and Dion Clayton Calthrop.

Kluver first began writing the series around the mid-2000s and finished her first rough draft of Legacy at the age of fourteen. Kluver initially self- published the first volume in the series with the help of her parents, but was later re-released by AmazonEncore in 2008. AmazonEncore passed on further volumes in the series, with Harlequin Teen purchasing the rights to the entire trilogy and releasing the series between 2011 and 2012. Book rights have been sold to over fifteen countries. Plot =Legacy= Legacy follows Princess Alera of Hytanica, a willful young woman that cringes at the idea of marrying over bearing Steldor, her father's chosen suitor. Assuming that she will spend her days with a man that she's attracted to, yet does not actually love, Alera finds herself almost instantly drawn to a youthful intruder. Narian is initially captured by the palace guards as a spy from an enemy kingdom, but is eventually discovered to be the son of a noble family that was long since thought to be dead. Alera begins to secretly meet with Narian, who tells her of life in the other kingdom and the two begin to fall in love. Despite this, Alera is forced to marry Steldor while Narian is condemned as a traitor. =Allegiance= Allegiance finds Alera as Queen of Hytanica, married to Steldor. She finds herself unable to love him and equally unable to forget Narian, the one she truly loves. This provokes conflicted emotions in her, as she knows that Narian is destined to conquer her kingdom for the magic user Overlord, the ruler of the rival kingdom Cokyrian. Alera initially refuses to believe that Narian could be capable of these actions until she discovers him leading Cokyrian troops in an attack against the city. Despite her heartbreak, Alera must find a way to lead her kingdom to more hopeful times. =Sacrifice= Sacrifice is told through the dual perspectives of Alera, the fallen Queen of a conquered kingdom, and Shaselle, a rebel whose father was murdered. Alera must not only rebuild her kingdom under the rule of Cokyria, but she must also find a way to rebuild the spirit and pride of her people. Meanwhile, Shaselle seeks to shirk her duties as a Lady in favor of achieving her revenge against those responsible for her father's death. Both women are faced with the choice of love or country, a choice that might lead to painful repercussions. Reception Critical reception for the series has been mostly positive. RT Book Reviews has praised the trilogy as a whole, giving the final volume four and a half stars and marking it as a \\"top pick\\". Kirkus Review's opinion of the series is predominantly positive, with the site stating that while Allegiance was \\"formulaic\\" the final volume \\"rises above genre by including thought-provoking elements that examine the role of women, family allegiances and the damaging nature of prejudice\\".

Background After the division of Bengal (during independence in 1947) along communal lines many Hindu Bengalis fled East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). The first flow of refugees who were mostly the upper and middle classes from upper castes easily resettled in West Bengal. However most lower caste Hindus remained behind, seeing their plight as no better than the Muslims. However they too were persecuted by Muslims and were forced to flee to West Bengal as well. But this latter huge flow of poor, mostly low-caste Hindus couldn't be accommodated in Bengal. After initial resistance from the refugees they were forcibly sent to \\"rocky inhospitable land\\" of Dandakaranya (mostly in Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh)., Terai (Uttar Pradesh, now in Uttarakhand), and Little Andamans.  Massacre  Once the Left front came to power in 1978, the refugees started to return to Bengal in huge numbers. But the Left Front meanwhile changed its policy on refugee settling and considered the refugees as a burden to the state, as the refugees were not the citizen of West Bengal but India. An approximately 150,000, almost all of Dandakaranya refugees arrived (where most of them were deported back). In the meanwhile approximately 40,000 refugees went south and camping for few months in Hasnabad settled in Marichjhapi (renamed by them as \\"Netaji Nagar\\"), a protected place under Reserve Forest Act. A survivor claims that there were only shrubs on the island when they came. They were involved in fishing and had built schools and hospitals. The Left government considered that an unauthorized occupation of reserved forest land. The government tried to pursue them to return to their respective place, but with little effect. On 24 January 1979, the Government of West Bengal clamped prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC around the island of Marichjhapi. The police and the district administration started an economic blockade. Thirty police launches started patrolling the island, preventing anyone from providing food or water to the residents of the island. Survivors claim that on the morning of 31 January 1979, when some women tried to row boats to the next island to fetch drinking water, grains and medicine, the police rammed their launches into the boats and drowned all three. People who took boats into the river to save the drowning women were fired on by the police. Police continued attacking people who braved the action and took multiple boat trips back and forth to get the necessities. This ultimately resulted in a confrontation between refugees armed with crude implements like bows and arrows, lathis, bricks and stones, on one hand, and the police on the other. Eyewitness accounts say that on 31 January, the police opened fire on the settlers of the island when the settlers allegedly attacked a police camp with traditional weapons. After 15 days Calcutta High Court ruled that \\"The supply of drinking water, essential food items and medicines as well as the passage of doctors must be allowed to Marichjhapi\\". The media were barred from entering the area on that day. 13 people died when someone poisoned a tube well. The survivors were then sent back to Dandakaranya. Some of them were settled in Marichjhapi Colony near Barasat while others rehabilitated themselves in the shanties near railway tracks in Sealdah. Some of the survivors resettled themselves in Hingalganj, Canning and nearby areas. Death toll The death count was never confirmed. Official statistics put the deaths due to firing at two, but other sources put the total deaths between 50 and 100.

History  In 1918, the Maschinenbau-Gesellschaft Karlsruhe built seven Mallet locomotives for service on railways operated by the German Army, because the existing locomotives they had commandeered were no longer capable enough. To save time older designs were used. The locomotives were accepted into service by the Army Testing Commission For Field Railways (Heerespr√ºfkommission f√ºr Feldbahnen) or HK, and designated as HK 94 to 100. They were used on the Army's military railways known as Heeresfeldbahnen. The locomotives did not continue in military service, however, due to the end of the war, and were handed over to various private railways, some as substitutes for locomotives that had been commandeered for wartime service. Three locomotives went to the Ruhr-Lippe Railways, and one each to the Euskirchen District Railways, the Haspe-Voerde-Breckerfeld Light Railway, the Nordhausen- Wernigerode Railway Company (NWE) and the Alb Valley Railway. Apart from two, they were all retired by the late 1950s/early 1960s. In 1928, the loco from Haspe was sold to the South German Railway Company for the Zell im Wiesental‚ÄìTodtnau railway after the original line had been electrified. From there it went in 1968 to the Blonay-Chamby Museum Railway in Switzerland, where, in 2008, in went into service under its old number, 105.Loco portrait at the homepage of the Freundeskreis SelketalbahnHomepage of the Blonay-Chamby Museum Railway To supplement its Mallet locomotives (NWE Nos. 11 to 22), in 1920 the NWE bought NWE 41II (there was already a no. NWE 41). This was given number 99 5906 by the East German Deutsche Reichsbahn. In 1955 it was also given to the Selke Valley Railway along with the company's other Mallet locomotives. The locomotive is externally very similar to the other Mallet engines, only the driver's cab is noticeably different, and all axles are mounted in inside frames (the older engines have an outside frame for the rear two axles). The loco is in working order and is generally used by the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways on the Selke Valley Railway in charge of scheduled trains.  Design  SEG G 2x2/2 105 at Blonay The rear set of drivers with their high-pressure cylinders is fixed in the plate frame of the loco. The front set of drivers with their low-pressure cylinders are linked to the rear sets with king pins, the rivetted boiler lies on it with its slide plates (Gleitplatten) Leaf springs at the sides hold the driving gear in a central position. Both driving sets have an inside frame. The steam is fed to the rear cylinders first and from there it passes along flexible pipes to the front cylinders. All cylinders have flat slide valves and outside Heusinger valve gear with lifting links and Kuhn slides. The locos have a counterweight handbrake and a steam brake as an auxiliary. Depending on the railway, vacuum or compressed air brakes were later fitted as the train brake. On the boiler are two sand domes, one for each driving set.

Kennedy School of Government, where she was a Mason Fellow. Caballero began reporting for the Bogot√° newspaper La Republica at the age of 16. As a female journalist working in a culture that valued machismo, she has said that she was initially given poorer quality assignments, but overcame this obstacle by investigating \\"key issues\\" on her own time and becoming a \\"happy workaholic\\". She went on to become Editor of Investigations at El Tiempo, Colombia's largest daily paper, as well as at the news magazine Cambro. From 1998 to 2001, she worked as Director of Investigations at the weekly Semana. Her articles have also appeared in The New York Times, Newsweek, CNN Interactive, The Boston Globe, The Miami Herald, and the International Herald Tribune, as well as Columbia Journalism Review and Nieman Reports.

It is associated as an Arabic term, especially as related to Arabic Islamic architectural decoration. The first recorded use of the term ablaq pertained to repairs of the Great Mosque of Damascus in 1109, but the technique itself was used much earlier.  Technique  This technique is a feature of Islamic architecture. The ablaq decorative technique is a derivative from the ancient Byzantine Empire, whose architecture used alternate sequential runs of light colored ashlar stone and darker colored orange brick. The first known use of the term ablaq in building techniques is in masonry work in reconstruction improvements to the walls of the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus. According to records, these reconstruction masonry improvements to the north wall began in the early twelfth century. The local stone supply may have encouraged the use of alternating courses of light and dark stone. In the southern part of Syria there is abundance of black basalt as well as white-colored limestone. The supplies of each are about equal, so it was natural that masonry techniques of balanced proportions were used. The technique itself, however, was used much earlier, Mosque‚ÄìCathedral of C√≥rdoba being a notable example, Medina Azahara, and possibly Al-Aqsa Mosque, as well as the Dome of the Rock. The Mamluks utilized mottled light effects and chiaroscuro in their buildings, and among the architectural elements that complemented it was ablaq. Finely dressed ashlar stones was often combined with brickwork for vaults. These Mamluk and Syrian elements were applied and shared by the Ayyubids and Crusaders in Palestine, Syria, and Egypt.  History  In 1266‚Äì1269 Sultan al-Zahir Baybars al-Bunduqdari built a mosque known as Mosque of al-Zahir Baybars or the Qasr Ablaq Palace, which was constructed with alterations of light and dark masonry. Based on this mosque, ablaq as a masonry technique of alternate rows of light and dark, was fully in use in the thirteenth century. The Mamluk architecture of Syria, Egypt and Palestine adopted the ablaq technique in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. In these countries at about this time black and white stone were often used as well as red brick in recurring rows, giving a three colored striped building. The ablaq masonry technique is used in the Azm Palace in Damascus and other buildings of the Ottoman period. In fact, Dr.Andrew Petersen, Director of Research in Islamic Archaeology at the University of Wales Lampeter states that ablaq (alternating courses of white limestone and black basalt is \\"A characteristic of the monumental masonry of Damascus.\\") At the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, ablaq lintels in alternating red and white courses are combined to highlight the voussoirs of the Great Arch. Jerusalem mamluk architecture (period 1250 AD to 1516 AD) include multi-colored masonry in white, yellow, red and black. The origins of the marble ablaq treatments at the Dome are controversial, some theorizing them original, and some saying they were later additions (and differing then as to the dates and identity of the builders). In Jordan, the Mamluk fortified khan at Aqaba (ca 1145) is a medieval fortress modeled after those used by the Crusaders. It contains an arch above the protected entrance. The horseshoe arch has ablaq masonry, harkening to Mamluk architecture in Egypt. Pisan ecclesiastical monuments‚Äîparticularly the Cathedral of Pisa and Church of San Sepolcro (commenced building 1113)‚Äîused ablaq, not simple \\"black and white in revetment\\" between the conquest of Jerusalem in the First Crusade (1099) and the completion of the latter ca. 1130. Various architectural motifs‚Äîablaq, the zigzag arch, and voussoir (rippled and plain) were used. These embellishments were a direct appropriation of Moslem architecture, resulting from pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and war against the Saracen in the First Crusade. Those visitors to Jerusalem could see ablaq at the Dome of the Rock, and at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, as well as other examples that may no longer be extant. Thus zigzags (see Norman architecture) and ablaq became part of the repertoire of Romanesque architecture. South Carolina architect John Henry Devereux created a striking black and white ablaq edifice in the St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church. However, that original conception has since been plastered over in monochrome red.

The factory was engaged in the production of TNT for the war effort and was completely destroyed. Forty-three people were killed and most of the surrounding area was left devastated.Ashton Munitions Explosion by John Billings and David Copland. Background The Hooley Hill Rubber and Chemical Company was founded in 1914 by Sylvain Dreyfus and Lucien Gaisman. Dreyfus, a nephew of Charles Dreyfus, founder of the Clayton Aniline Company, was born in 1866 in Alsace in France. Gaisman was a Swiss national from Basel. The company established a factory in Stamford Road, Audenshaw and another in Chatham Street, Edgeley, Stockport. When war was declared against Germany on 4 August 1914, the company approached the War Office to offer its services. At first they were rebuffed, but they were subsequently involved in the production of TNT of which there was a chronic shortage. The total British output of TNT before the First World War was around 20 tons per year. A sustained artillery barrage could easily expend many times that amount in a day. On 28 October 1914 the company was asked to build a plant capable of producing around five tons of TNT per week and after further negotiations a contract was signed on 26 November 1914. The government awarded a grant of ¬£10,000 towards the cost of erecting the plant. A former cotton mill next to the canal in William Street, Ashton-under-Lyne was acquired. Its substantial brick walls and heavy concrete floors were deemed suitable to be adapted as a chemical plant but its location in the middle of a built up area with housing, schools, textile mills and two gasometers was far from ideal. The first deliveries of raw TNT were scheduled to begin in March 1915. Raw TNT was sent to other government-run factories to be refined and crystallised. Production at the site increased to around ten tons per week. By 1917, the capacity of the plant was around 25 tons per week. Accident On Wednesday 13 June 1917, it was business as usual at the works in Ashton-under- Lyne. Lucien Gaisman was on his way back from a meeting in London to discuss the future of the company as an explosives manufacturer. A government report had recommended dispensing with smaller, less economic producers of explosives such as the Hooley Hill Rubber and Chemical Company. Later that afternoon, Sylvain Dreyfus and a chemist, Nathan Daniels, were in the nitrating section of the works when the contents of number nine nitrator became unstable. Despite a frantic effort led by Dreyfus to bring the reaction under control, the contents of the vessel boiled over and set fire to the wooden staging around it. The fire quickly took hold, spreading to the roof. Workers fought to bring the blaze under control to no avail. The flames spread to an area where five tons of TNT packed into kegs was stored. A call was made to the local police station for assistance at around 4.20pm. A few minutes later the works was torn apart by an explosion. It destroyed the factory and threw heavy objects long distances. Most of the workers were killed instantly, including Dreyfus, whose dismembered body was found in the factory yard. The factory was obliterated and two large craters scarred the site. A large crater, where the kegs of TNT had been stored, was about 90 ft by 36 ft across and 5 ft deep. A smaller, shallow crater was just below where the dryer and setting trays used for the final preparation of the TNT had been. Two gasometers in a nearby street were ripped open by the blast, sending a massive fireball hundreds of feet into the air. Hundreds of buildings in the surrounding area were damaged, leaving many of the nearby houses uninhabitable. The casualties included 43 people dead, more than 120 hospitalised and several hundred with minor injuries. Amongst the dead were 23 employees of the Hooley Hill Rubber and Chemical Works, and eleven adults and nine children from the surrounding area.Daily Telegraph Friday 15 June 1917, reprinted in Daily Telegraph Thursday 15 June 2017 page 28 References External links * https://web.archive.org/web/20111104210701/http://www.ashton-under- lyne.com/history/explosion.htm Category:Explosions in 1917 Category:Explosions in England Category:1917 industrial disasters Category:Government munitions production in the United Kingdom Category:1917 disasters in the United Kingdom Category:1917 in England Category:Industrial fires and explosions in the United Kingdom Category:Ashton-under-Lyne Category:1910s in Lancashire Category:June 1917 events ","title":"Ashton-under-Lyne munitions explosion"},{"id":"34533827","text":"Coolah Shire was a former local government area in New South Wales, Australia from 1906 to 1994.

As the 164th Infantry Brigade, it remained in the United Kingdom throughout the Second World War, as part of the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division. Formation The brigade was raised in 1908 when the Territorial Force was created and was originally formed as the North Lancashire Brigade, attached to the West Lancashire Division. The brigade was composed of two Volunteer battalions of the King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) and two of the Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire). First World War The division was mobilised on 5 August 1914, the day after Britain declared war on Germany, thus beginning the Great War. From late 1914 to early 1915 units of the brigade began to be sent independently overseas, mainly to France and Belgium, and were replaced by the 2nd Line units being formed, the 170th (2/1st North Lancashire) Brigade of 57th (2nd West Lancashire) Division. To differentiate the 1st Line battalions from the 2nd Line, the prefix '1/' was adopted by all 1st Line battalions (1/4th King's Own) and '2/' for all 2nd Line. In April 1915 the 164th Brigade was redesignated 154th Brigade and joined the 51st (Highland) Division. In June 1916 the brigade, now again redesignated 164th (1st North Lancashire) Brigade, returned to the West Lancashire Division, now the 55th (West Lancashire) Division, and served with it for the rest of the war on the Western Front in battles at Passchendaele, Cambrai and Estaires in 1918. =Order of Battle= * 1/4th Battalion, King's Own (Royal Lancaster Regiment) * 1/5th Battalion, King's Own (Royal Lancaster Regiment) (left 15 February 1915) * 1/4th Battalion, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment * 1/5th Battalion, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment (left 13 February 1915) * 2/5th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers (from February 1915) * 1/8th (Irish) Battalion, King's (Liverpool Regiment) (from January 1916, left January 1918) * 164th Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (formed 19 February 1916, moved to 55th Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 7 March 1918) * 164th Trench Mortar Battery (formed March 1916) Interwar years Both the brigade and division were disbanded after the war in 1919 but later reformed in 1920 in the Territorial Army as the 164th (North Lancashire) Infantry Brigade and continued to serve with the 55th Division. The brigade was reconstituted with the same four battalions as it had before the First World War. However, in the late 1930s the brigade saw all of its battalions posted away or converted to other roles: in 1938 the 4th Battalion, King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) was transferred to the Royal Artillery and converted into the 56th (King's Own) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery, the 5th Battalion, King's Own was transferred to the 126th (East Lancashire) Infantry Brigade, 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division. They were both replaced in the brigade by the 4th and 5th battalions of the South Lancashire Regiment, from the 166th (South Lancashire) Infantry Brigade. The 4th Battalion, Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) was transferred to the Royal Engineers and became the 62nd (Loyals) Searchlight Regiment and the 5th Battalion was converted into a reconnaissance motorcycle battalion when the 55th Division was reorganised as a motorised infantry division and the 164th Brigade was disbanded. It was, however, reformed in mid-1939, now as the 164th Infantry Brigade, when the 55th Division was ordered to form a duplicate division, the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division. The 164th Brigade again came under command of the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division. Second World War The brigade again served in the Second World War with the division throughout the war and, in October 1941, no longer was an operational formation to be sent overseas. In January 1942 it was reduced to a Lower Establishment yet it was not reduced to a training division as most others were. In December 1943, with the division, it was sent to Northern Ireland and was raised to a Higher Establishment in May 1944, before returning to the United Kingdom in July.

It was manufactured between 1960 and 1963 by Dr C. Schleussner Fotowerke GmbH following the company's takeover of the Wirgin camera factory of Wiesbaden, Germany. The brothers who were the founders and original owners of the Wirgin company, fled Germany to avoid persecution from the government of the time. Description ADOX produced high-resolution fine-grained film material. The camera featured an Adoxar 45mm f/3,5 lens that would have been respectable on cameras in a much higher price range. The top, bottom and the lens base cover were made from pressed steel of about ¬Ωmm thickness. The rest of the chassis and most of the internal parts were made from mould-injected plastic. Metal was only used for parts where wear and tear make it unavoidable, such as the film pressure plate and the film transport cogwheels. Interior The viewfinder had neither lines for parallax compensation, nor for outlining the edge of the negative. With the camera held to take a picture in landscape format, the center mounting and poor enlargement of the viewfinder required the user to press the nose rather hard against the camera back. There was no rangefinder. The camera had no light meter. It offered three shutter speeds and aperture values had to be set by a separate light meter, by guesswork or by following the coarse exposure guide on the film package. An accessory shoe was on the top of the housing, but without a 'hot-shoe' contact. The rewind knob held a film speed reminder, covering ASA 8-800/DIN 10-30, but no folding rewind handle.

The two collections may be seen below, in the Gallery, the first being now owned by Lord Lloyd Webber,The first series was painted between 1868 and 1870, when Burne-Jones' affair with his pupil, the painter Maria Zambaco, was at its height. Although Burne-Jones thought he already had the perfect woman, in his wife Georgie, he was unable to prevent himself from longing for his model and muse, Maria, in a violent internal conflict. See also the artist's biography on BM&AG.; and the second housed at the Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery. This article deals with an appraisal of the second series. The second series =Pygmalion and Galatea I: The Heart Desires= As seen above right (1st image), this is the first of four paintings in the artist's second Pygmalion and Galatea series. This first series, which dates back to 1867‚Äì1870, used harsher tones, darker colours and less fluid lines ‚Äì as may be seen in the Gallery below. This second version, despite being painted in oils, has the sheen and soft tones of chalk. The story tells of Pygmalion, a sculptor of Cyprus, the birthplace of Aphrodite. It was first related in Ovid's Metamorphoses, although by the time of this series, William Morris had written his own version of the story.Most of the series was based on an episode from William Morris' cycle of epic poems, The Earthly Paradise. Pygmalion is seen here in his studio, pondering his lonely life, having chosen to remain celibate in disgust at what he saw as the debauched lifestyles of the local women. The statues behind him (in emulation of the Three Graces) echo the curious women peering in through his doorway. All five seem fluid, languorous and unself-conscious. Pygmalion, looking above the proliferation of ankles, thighs and buttocks reflected on the floor and pedestal in front of him, is pondering his next creation. His gaze ignores the women around him as he sees in his mind a statue of the perfect female.Most scholars agree, based on an excerpt from Georgiana Burne-Jones's Memorials, that the head of Pygmalion in Series Two was modelled by W.A.S. Benson in the 1870s. While Antonio Corsi sat as the model for Series One. In Series One, there are four sculptural figures in the background representing the Four Seasons or Horae; in Series Two, there are only three, now the Three Graces. Cf. BM&AG; =Pygmalion and Galatea II: The Hand Refrains= The Hand Refrains, 2nd Series, H.98.7 cm x W.76.3 cm (1878) In this second picture, Pygmalion's perfect woman is revealed. Playing God, he has created woman and now stands back to admire her, holding the cold chisel against his face as though scared to touch his creation again. The sculptor's expression is softer than The Heart Desires ‚Äì a look which betrays that he has fallen in love with a woman made of marble.See Ovid's mythology in his Metamorphoses, as well as the respective List of Metamorphoses characters. In spite of his scorning of Aphrodite, Pygmalion has created Galatea in a classical Venusian stance. However, unlike the three statues and two living women in the first picture above, Galatea appears embarrassedly conscious of her nudity ‚Äì in the act of attempting to cover herself. Pygmalion, despite his contempt for the local women, deliberately created her nude and now takes on the role of voyeur. Although Pygmalion is seen looking, rather than touching, the various tools around the base of the statue show how much work he has done to bring the statue to this finished state. In creating Galatea, he has used a hard mallet, chisel and file as well as an almost transparent, soft-bristled brush. =Pygmalion and Galatea III: The Godhead Fires= The Godhead Fires, 2nd Series, H.143.7 cm x W.116.8 cm (1878) In Ovid's version of the story, the scene is set while Pygmalion is at the temple of Aphrodite, praying for forgiveness for the years he has shunned her and begging for a wife as perfect as his marble woman. In his absence, Aphrodite appears in the studio to impart life to Galatea. In physical terms, the painting shows little difference between the two women: the same, unattainable facial expression; the marble colouring; the Amazonian stature. Ironically, their interlaced arms and Aphrodite's penetrating gaze emulate the intertwined women, so despised by Pygmalion, in The Heart Desires. Aphrodite is identified by the presence of doves and roses ‚Äì symbols commonly linked with the goddess ‚Äì and the water at her feet, reminiscent of her birth, fully formed, from the sea. This also represents Galatea's birth, fully formed, as a woman. In a scene that is strongly evocative of Michelangelo's Creation painting on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, the goddess adds colour and sensuality to Pygmalion's austere studio and Galatea's soft flesh.S. Wildman, Edward Burne-Jones: Victorian Artist-Dreamer, Yale University Press (1998), passim. The rich-colour drapery, wrapped suggestively around an intricately carved pole at left, is noticeably absent from the other images in the series.The BM&AG; also has a photogravure of this picture, from a leather bound portfolio of 91 photogravures of original paintings. The folio is signed by Edward Burne-Jones' son, Philip. The one shown at the Birmingham Art Gallery is one of an edition 200, purchased in 1900. Cf. =Pygmalion and Galatea IV: The Soul Attains= The Soul Attains, 2nd Series, H.99.4 cm x W.76.6 cm (1878) When Pygmalion returns home, he finds that his statue has come to life and humbles himself at her feet. Study for The Soul Attains, in The New Art Gallery Walsall This was not Burne-Jones' only series of pictures: others include The Briar Rose series (1885‚Äì1890), which was based on Charles Perrault's fairy tale, Sleeping Beauty (as retold by the Brothers Grimm), and Burne-Jones' spectacular Cupid and Psyche frieze. Although not imbued with the depth and texture of The Merciful Knight (1863), this second attempt at portraying the tale of Pygmalion and Galatea has become regarded as one of the artist's most important works. It was exhibited at Sir Coutt Lindsay's new Grosvenor Gallery in 1879, thereby establishing Burne-Jones as one of the leading artists in the burgeoning Aesthetic Movement.F. MacCarthy, The Last Pre-Raphaelite: Edward Burne-Jones and the Victorian Imagination, Faber and Faber (2011), Ch. 5ff. Cf. also C. Wood, Burne-Jones, Phoenix Illustrated (1997).

During the Second World War, as part of the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division, the brigade remained in the United Kingdom. Formation The brigade was raised in 1908 when the Territorial Force was created, by the amalgamation of the Yeomanry and the Volunteer Force, and was originally formed as the Liverpool Brigade attached to the West Lancashire Division. The brigade was composed of the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th battalions of the King's Regiment (Liverpool). First World War The Great War began in August 1914 and most of the men of the brigade immediately volunteered for Imperial Service overseas although they were not obliged to do so, as the Territorial Force was initially intended to act as a home defence force during wartime. The Territorial Force was, therefore, split into a 1st Line and a 2nd Line. The 1st Line was liable for service overseas and the 2nd Line was intended to perform a home defence role and to send drafts of replacements to the 1st Line units serving overseas. The West Lancashire Division and Liverpool Brigade formed a duplicate 2nd Line units, the 2nd West Lancashire Division and 2nd Liverpool Brigade. To distinguish the 1st Line battalions from the 2nd Line, they adopted the fractional '1/', for all 1st Line units, (1/5th King's) and '2/' (2/5th King's) for all 2nd Line. However, between November 1914 and March 1915, all the infantry battalions of the West Lancashire Division were sent overseas to France and Belgium to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front which had suffered heavy casualties and was struggling to hold the line. As a result, the division was temporarily disbanded and the 1st Liverpool Brigade joined with its 2nd Line, now numbered as the 171st (2/1st Liverpool) Brigade, and the division 57th (2nd West Lancashire) Division. In early 1916 the West Lancashire Division was reformed, and now numbered as the 55th (West Lancashire) Division and the brigades were also numbered, the 1st Liverpool Brigade becoming 165th (1st Liverpool) Brigade The brigade served with the 55th Division for the rest of the war on the Western Front at the Third Battle of Ypres, Battle of Cambrai and the Battle of Estaires in 1918. =Order of Battle= *1/5th Battalion, King's Regiment (Liverpool) (left 22 February 1915, rejoined January 1916) * 1/6th (Rifle) Battalion, King's Regiment (Liverpool) (left 25 February 1915, rejoined February 1916) * 1/7th Battalion, King's Regiment (Liverpool) (left 8 March 1915, rejoined January 1916) * 1/8th (Irish) Battalion, King's Regiment (Liverpool) (left February 1915) * 1/9th Battalion, King's Regiment (Liverpool) (from January 1916 to February 1918) * 165th Machine Gun Company, Machine Gun Corps (formed 26 February 1916, moved to 55th Battalion, Machine Gun Corps 7 March 1918) * 165th Trench Mortar Battery (formed March 1916)http://www.1914-1918.net/55div.htm Between the wars The brigade was disbanded after the war in 1919 when the Territorial Force was disbanded. It was later renamed in 1920 as the Territorial Army. The brigade came into existence again as the 165th (Liverpool) Infantry Brigade, again assigned to the 55th (West Lancashire Division and again had the same four battalions of the King's Regiment (Liverpool). However, under the Geddes Axe, the 8th (Irish) Battalion was disbanded on 31 March 1922 and were replaced in the brigade by the 10th (Scottish) Battalion, previously from the 166th (South Lancashire) Infantry Brigade. The composition of the brigade remained unchanged throughout most of the inter-war years. In the late 1930s, however, many infantry battalions of the Territorial Army were converted to new roles, mainly anti-aircraft or searchlight units. The 6th (Rifle) Battalion was transferred to the Royal Engineers and converted to 38th (The King's) Anti- Aircraft Battalion, Royal Engineers, assigned to the 33rd (Western) Anti- Aircraft Group, 2nd Anti-Aircraft Division, serving alongside other units converted from infantry battalions. They replaced in the brigade by the 4th/5th Battalion, Cheshire Regiment. In 1938, the 10th (Scottish) Battalion was transferred to the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders and was re-titled as the Liverpool Scottish but remained with the brigade. In the same year, when all infantry brigades of the British Army were reduced from four to three battalions, the 7th Battalion, King's was transferred to the Royal Tank Regiment and became 40th (The King's) Royal Tank Regiment, assigned to 23rd Army Tank Brigade. When the 7th Battalion left to become 40th RTR they were replaced by 4th Battalion, South Lancashire Regiment, previously from 166th (South Lancashire) Infantry Brigade. Sometime in 1939, the brigade was redesignated 165th Infantry Brigade.

History  The locomotive was the only unit to be built of a planned series of standard superheated steam locomotives with the axle arrangements 1'C1', 1'D1' and 1'E1', that the Nordhausen-Wernigerode Railway Company (NWE), the Gernrode-Harzgerode Railway Company and the South Harz Railway Company had ordered from Friedrich Krupp AG for replacing their older, less economic saturated steam engines. In standardising their designs, it was envisaged that as many parts of the locomotives as possible would be used across the whole range in the interests of economic production, simplified spare part stock holdings and easier maintenance and servicing. But because the development order was not given by the Deutsche Reichsbahn and because different construction conventions were followed in some cases, these were not seen as Einheitsloks, the standard locomotives produced by the DR between the wars. As a result of the outbreak of World War II, however, ony the prototyped of the 1'C1' version was built in 1939 by Krupp; orders for the other engines were cancelled. The prototype locomotive was accepted into service by the NWE as No. 21II and, following the takeover of the NWE by the East German Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1949, was renumbered to 99 6001. In 1970 the loco was given the computer number 99 6001-4. In 1956 the engine was transferred, initially temporarily, from the Harz Railway to the Selke Valley Railway. In 1961 this became permanent. After the re-joining of the two lines in 1983/1984 it was once again used for duties on the Harz Railway, for example to head the first scheduled passenger train between Gernrode and Hasselfelde via Stiege on 3 June 1984. No. 99 6001 in green, nickname Laubfrosch (\\"tree frog\\") Between 1991 and 1994 it did brief service in green livery as no. 21 in charge of the heritage train (Traditionszug), a special made up of historic coaches, which the Mallet locomotives to that point could not haul as their brakes were not compatible with the new compressed-air brakes of the train. In addition it carried out duties from its home station of Gernrode.  Technical features  In designing and building the NWE 21II the firm of Krupp made extensive use of welding, even for the boiler, in contrast with the contemporary design approach of the Reichsbahn Einheitslokomotiven. The three driven wheelsets are fixed firmly in a bar frame with a 70 mm side thickness (Wangenst√§rke). The two front and rear carrying axles are able to swing out radially and are housed in a Bissell truck. The boiler is fed by two feedwater pumps. The two outside cylinders, which are slightly tilted to cope with the constraints of the rail gauge, are driven by Heusinger valve gear with Kuhn slides. The factory-fitted Schulz piston valves were late replaced by Trofimoff piston valves. These gave better running performance when the locomotive was free- running (Leerlauf) and the regulator was closed, because they practically relieve the cylinder of its job as an air pump when the steam pressure is released. Together with the locomotives of Class 99.32, which were also permitted to run at up to , the engine was one of the five narrow gauge locomotives in Germany with the highest top speed.

It is bordered by Bojonegoro Regency in the north, Nganjuk Regency in the east, Ponorogo Regency in the south, and Magetan Regency and Ngawi Regency in the west. Its capital was formerly the city of Madiun but is now the Onderdistrict of Mejayan, in accordance with Government Regulation No.52 of the year 2010. Government Regulation No.3 of the Year 2019 as a revision of Government Regulation No. 52 the year 2010 mentioned that the capital city of Madiun Regency is \\"Caruban\\", not Mejayan. The change name of the capital city of Madiun Regency to be \\"Caruban\\" because of the historical and culture of the former Regency of Caruban. The name \\"Caruban\\" must resist and \\"Mejayan\\" is only a part of the former Regency of Caruban. In the Dutch Indies Government, Caruban was a District and Mejayan was an Onderdistrict, so after the Indonesian Independence, Caruban became Asisten of Regency (Pembantu Bupati) and Mejayan became Kecamatan. Caruban is more popular than Mejayan, because Caruban was formerly regency established by Raden Cakrakusuma (Tumenggung Alap-Alap) from The Sultanate of Demak Bintara. The regents of former Regency of Caruban were Raden Cakrakusuma I (Tumenggung Alap-Alap), Raden Cakrakusuma II (Tumenggung Emprit Gantil), Kanjeng Pangeran Mlatakusuma (a son of Kanjeng Pangeran Adipati Martalaya from Madiyun), Raden Tumenggung Somadirja, Raden Tumenggung Natasari, Raden Tumenggung Jayengrana II, Raden Tumenggung Wignya Subrata, and the last regent of Caruban was Raden Tumenggung Martanagara, so became the first regent of the modern Panaraga renamed Raden Adipati Martahadinegara. Most government buildings are located in areas that are part of Caruban District. Other buildings will be moved gradually from the City of Madiun and the move began in 2011. In everyday conversation, Madiun Regency residents use the Javanese language with the dialect or dialects of Mataraman Madiun who is more inclined to accent Surakarta/Sala.

Madiun word origin of the word means medi (ghost) and ayun-ayun (swing), the point is that when Ronggo Jumeno do \\"Tripe Madiun land\\" occurs many ghosts wandering around. A second explanation for the name keris owned by Ronggo Jumeno named Kris Tundhung Medhiun. At first not named Madiun, but Wonoasri. Since the beginning of Madiun is a territory under the control of the Sultanate of Mataram. In the course of the history of Mataram, Madiun is very strategically located in the region since the middle of the border with the kingdom of Kadiri (Daha). Therefore, during the reign of many rebels Mataram kingdom building a power base in Madiun. As the emergence of figures Retno Dumilah. Some relics of the Duchy of Madiun one of which can be seen in the Village Kuncen, where there is the tomb of Ki Ageng Panembahan Ronggo Jumeno, Patih Wonosari besides the graves of the Regent Madiun, Madiun's oldest mosque is Masjid Nur Hidayatullah, artifacts around the mosque, and spring (bathing place) sacred. Since the time of the Dutch East Indies, Madiun is a gemeente self-governing (autonomous) because the Dutch community working in various industrial estates and do not want to be governed by the Regents (which is Javanese). As an autonomous city, Madiun was founded on June 20, 1918, the first led by Madiun resident assistant. New since 1927 headed by a mayor. Madiun Affair The Madiun Affair was a communist uprising in 1948 during the Indonesian National Revolution in the town of Madiun. Leftist parties led an uprising against the leaders of the newly declared Indonesian Republic, but it was quashed by Republican forces. On 18 September 1948 an 'Indonesian Soviet Republic' was declared in Madiun, in the western part of East Java, by members of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) and the Indonesian Socialist Party (PSI). Judging the time as right for a proletarian uprising, they intended it to be a rallying center for revolt against \\"Sukarno-Hatta, the slaves of the Japanese and America\\". Madiun, however, was won back by Republican forces within a few weeks, and the insurgency leader, Musso, was killed. RM Suryo, the governor of East Java, as well as several police officers and religious leaders, were killed by the rebels. The quashing of the rebellion ended a perilous distraction for the Revolution, and it turned vague American sympathies based on anti-colonial sentiments into diplomatic support. Internationally, the Republic was now seen as being staunchly anti-communist and a potential ally in the brewing global Cold War between the American-led 'free world' and the Soviet-led bloc.

The telescopic fork uses fork tubes and sliders which contain the springs and dampers. The main advantages of the telescopic fork are that (i) it is simple in design and relatively cheap to manufacture and assemble; (ii) it is lighter than older designs using external components and linkage systems; and (iii) it has a clean and simple appearance that bikers find attractive. Telescopic forks sometimes have gaiters to protect the fork tubes from abrasion and corrosion. A more modern (and more expensive) version of the conventional telescopic fork is the inverted or \\"USD\\" (upside-down) fork. BMW's patented telelever front suspension appears at first glance to be conventional telescopic fork, but the fork tubes contain neither springs nor damping. Instead, a wishbone and an inboard monoshock perform suspension duties, and the forks serve to locate the front wheel and control steering. History Early oil-damped telescopic fork on a 1939 BMW R12 BMW R60US with conventional telescopic fork The first production motorcycles with hydraulically damped telescopic forks were the German BMW R12 and R17 in 1935. However, undamped telescopic forks were used on bikes made by The Scott Motorcycle Company from the beginning of production in 1908, and the Danish Nimbus used them from 1934 on. Design Telescopic fork in upside down design, with stanchions at the bottom. Conventional telescopic forks invariably have a pair of fork tubes, or \\"stanchions\\", at the top, clamped to a triple tree (also called a triple clamp or a yoke), and the sliders are at the bottom, attached to the front wheel spindle. Inside most tubes are springs, fork oil, and air, creating a shock absorber. Some forks allow pressurized air to be added through a valve in the top of the fork to stiffen the suspension. Quality forks have a flexible air tube between both fork tubes in order to balance the air pressure in both forks. Modern fork tubes have a method which employs a screw to compress fork spring to increase or decrease spring pre-load. = Damping = Cartridge forks provide regressive damping. Self-contained cartridges within the forks contain spring-covered orifices regulating fork oil flow. The springs resist low forces and thus provide high damping rates. Higher forces compress the springs, allowing more oil flow and less damping. Thus the fork is stiffer when responding to small bumps but will soften as larger ones are encountered. Most modern forks also are suspended on springs and control fork movement by damping through adjustable valving to control movement by controlling the flow of fork oil. The larger the orifice, the more free the flow and the less damped the fork. A selector atop the fork engages the desired hole size or valve and corresponding damping rate in compression, while usually the lower tube has a mechanism to control rebound (extension) damping. Single action damping is currently being manufactured, such that compression occurs in one fork tube while its partner tube controls the rebound damping. This is because the oil controlling the damping in each tube, then, has only to control one direction of damping and is therefore less aerated by it working in both directions, and it develops less heat while working, which causes a variation to the thickness of the oil, thereby adversely affecting the damping rate. = Upside down = On some modern sport bikes and most off-road bikes, this system is inverted, with \\"sliders\\" complete with the spring/damper unit at the top, clamped to the yoke, while the stanchions are at the bottom. This is done (1) to reduce unsprung weight by having the heavier components suspended, and (2) to improve the strength and rigidity of the assembly by having the strong large-diameter \\"sliders\\" clamped in the yokes. The inverted system is referred to as an upside-down fork, or \\"USD\\" for short. One disadvantage of the USD design is that the entire reservoir of damping oil is above the slider seal so in case of leak the oil drains out, rendering any damping ineffective. = Triple tree = Honda 919 A triple tree (\\"triple clamp\\" (US) or \\"yoke\\" (UK)) attaches the fork tubes to the frame via steering head bearings, which allow the fork assembly to pivot from side to side, and therefore steer the motorcycle. Most bikes have upper and lower triple trees, providing two solid clamping points that keep the fork tubes parallel while also connecting the forks to the frame via the steering head bearings. With the tendency to employ fork tubes with single action damping, fork triple trees need to be reinforced more than when the forks shared both damping roles, because the rigidity of the triple trees is relied upon to distribute the forces within the forks without flex. The BMW Telever fork has only a single triple tree, which allows its fork sliders to be longer than those on telescopic forks. This in turn allows for greater overlap of the sliders over the stanchion tubes, which improves stiffness and helps to reduce flex.

Concept  The event was inspired by the 1990 movie The March, in which a horde of starving people marches towards Europe. The Hunger March is a reminder that, if the world's need and distress is not relieved, the desperate victims will some day be knocking on the doors of the affluent. To remind people of the issues the world is facing, Galschi√∏t created 27 sculptures of starving African kids out of bronze. The \\"kids\\" have a sad look on their faces. The bronze is darkened to give them a sad, dark look. At the bottom of the sculpture, there is a shining new shoe, made by one of the major shoe companies that is responsible for the use of poor kids in the third world to work for a small payment. The first happening In May 2001, in the center of Odense, a bronze sculpture of a 12-year-old starved black boy, with a large pair of shining new Nike shoes, was set up so that it appeared to watch the well-fed Danes rushing by. The sculpture stood on a polished black granite pedestal, with the slogan \\"JUST DO IT\\" written on it. Galschi√∏t stated \\"With this sculpture, I'll pinpoint the hypocrisy of companies who in their lifestyle commercials are linking their brands with concepts such as freedom and equality and at the same time are cynically exploiting and oppressing the workers who make the products.\\" ASEM 4 During the ASEM 4 summit in Copenhagen in September 2002, 27 \\"starving boys\\" were placed in Copenhagen to demonstrate for social justice. The 27 sculptures were supposed to represent the starving people in the Third World countries that are influenced by the way that the summit focuses on corporations' profit, instead of poor peoples' interests. The event was arranged in co-operation with Care-Denmark and The Salvation Army. The latter organization supplied the boys with Adidas, Nike and Reebok shoes. Other happenings In the summer of 2002, a crowd of 27 starving African boys cast in copper started a tour throughout Denmark to protest against the government's cutback of development aid. Galschi√∏t launched the action in cooperation with the NGO Forum in Aarhus. Hundreds of volunteers took part in the creation of the sculptures in the artist's workshop, and subsequently in the mobilization of the boys all over the country. In March 2003, DanChurchAid is using the sculptures in their collection to support children who have been left orphans due to AIDS. The Hunger March has often appeared as a participant in different demonstrations in Denmark, such as the climate demonstrations. Usually the sculptures are placed on small wagons, where they appear as being a part of the marching crowd.

Hebgen Lake is on the Madison River. There are three buildings on the site: a wood frame cabin constructed circa 1919, a log boathouse built in 1958, and a wood frame outhouse built about 1930. The cabin is at the south end of the site, which is west of West Yellowstone and the entrance to Yellowstone National Park.  Description  The cabin sits among fir trees and was originally built 1919‚Äì1920 and remodeled in 1932‚Äì33, 1939, and 1973. It is a 1 story building with stone steps and a concrete stoop at the door. There is a fish motif rock mosaic, picnic area, and a row of rocks surrounds the cabin on three sides. Its dimensions are north/south by east/west. It has a steep gable roof with asphalt shingles. The exterior has 1950s-era log cabin-appearing lap wood with rabbetted cornerboards. There are three bedrooms, a dining room, a bathroom‚Äîadded in 1973, a screened in porch, and enclosed shed. The furniture is made of rustic wood. Several examples of fish art adorn the walls. The outhouse is , plank board walls, rolled roofing, and has no foundation. It is northwest of the cabin. The boathouse is is also northwest of the cabin. It has a concrete foundation and walls of concrete and flat sawn logs. The roof is gable with green metal roofing. The east wall with a wooden overhead garage door faces the lake and there is a concrete boat ramp. The interior has wooden walls and a concrete floor.  History  The Shoshone people were the predominant native people in this area. The first non-native people to arrive were fur trappers and traders who came in the 1820s. Two historic trails pass near here along the South Fork of the Madison River, the Bannock Trail which follows the trail system of the native people, and the Nez Perce National Historic Trail, which Chief Joseph led his Nez Perce tribe along during the 1877 Nez Perce War. The cabin was built pursuant to the Term Occupancy Act of 1915, which allowed private recreational residences to be built on United States Forest Service land from 1915‚Äì-1932. It was originally built by a group of fishermen from Salt Lake City who came to the region every year to fish the South Fork of the Madison River. They originally traveled by train and then by covered wagon over the Continental Divide. John Horlick was a member of this fishing group and the original owner of the cabin, which was then located within the Madison National Forest. The Madison National Forest became part of the Hebgen Lake Ranger District of the Gallatin National Forest in 1931. The cabin is the earliest permitted cabin within this tract. Running water was added about 1939. Additions over the years to all three structures have retained their original character and appearance. A significant change to the site was caused by the 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake when Hebgen Lake receded by , raising the south shore and lowering the north shore, leaving a wide gravel beach along the lakefront of the cabins on the southern side of the lake. Beginning in 2006, the Forest Service's Northern Region began encouraging qualifying buildings to be nominated for listing as National Registered Historic Place.  Use  The Gallatin National Forest operates campsites nearby on the public recreational Lonesomehurst tract with 27 campsites, 5 of them with electricity, on a first- come, first-served basis. Boat ramps are nearby.

The Hang Sang Index opened on November 24, 1969. Biography Stanley S. K. Kwan was born in Hong Kong in 1925 into a traditional Chinese banking family. He attended King's College until the fall of Hong Kong in 1941 and joined the Chinese army as an interpreter for US forces during the war. From 1962 until he retired in 1984, he headed the Research Department in Hang Seng Bank. He launched the Hang Seng Index in 1969, served on the government's Statistics Advisory Board during 1976‚Äì84 and was awarded the MBE in 1985. He now lives in Toronto, Canada. Kwan creation, the Hang Seng Index, has been widely used to measure the health and growth of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In 2008, Kwan published his memoirs, The Dragon and the Crown: Hong Kong Memoirs. In the book's foreword, written by Robert Neild, the President of the Hong Kong chapter of the Royal Asiatic Society, Neild calls the Hang Seng, \\"the ultimate capitalist measure of Hong Kong.\\" As of 2012, the Hang Seng Index consists of forty-eight companies incorporating some of the largest in Asia. These include PetroChina, which is Asia's largest company in terms of market value, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the largest lender in the world based on market value. Kwan launched his career within the Hong Kong banking industry following the end of the war. He joined the staff of Hang Seng Bank in 1962. In 1969, Hang Seng Bank chairman Ho Sin Hang and general manager Q.W. Lee decided that there should be a Hong Kong version of New York's Dow Jones Industrial Average. Kwan headed the Hang Seng Bank's research department at the time. Together with his staff of seven employees, Kwan created the Hang Seng Index using input from economists, statisticians and government officials. The Index debuted in Hong Kong on November 24, 1969. The Hang Seng Index would benefit, or suffer, based on the political and economic fortunes of Hong Kong. The Index crashed in 1974 following the 1973 oil crisis, and again in 1983, during a political stalemate in negotiations between China and the United Kingdom over the future status of Hong Kong. The Index grew following the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, when mainland Chinese markets were opened to Hong Kong business interests. Stanley Kwan retired from the banking industry and moved to Canada. He died in Toronto on December 31, 2011, at the age of 86.

Henley, of Columbia, Missouri, crash lands on Friday the 13th at Lawson Air Force Base, Georgia, on the Fort Benning reservation, resulting in fatalities to all 13 on board. Two G-15As had been released by a Fairchild C-82 towplane and were sloping in for what appeared to be a normal landing when one tipped sideways and smashed into the ground with a \\"tremendous roar\\" that spread wreckage over 700 feet of the runway. An enlisted man who witnessed the accident, stated that \\"bodies spilled out in every direction.\\" Two Air Force officers and eleven paratroop students of Company A, Airborne Battalion, died in the accident. The paratroopers were scheduled to \\"graduate\\" on 14 January. \\"First reports said a sudden, strong wind current caused a wing to rip into the ground. But officers later said they did not know the cause.\\" An observer in the control tower said that it happened so quickly that when he took his eyes from the apparently normal glider for a split-second he missed the crash. \\"Two gliders were coming in for a normal landing approach,\\" said Cpl. James P. Harr of Detroit. \\"Everything appeared normal, so I turned to look at the C-82 that had released them. Then I turned back to look at the gliders and saw a pile of debris out there.

'There was a neighbor, and my dad and I got in the truck and went over to the crash site,' recalled Lynch. 'There were probably less than 10 vehicles when we got there.' Hundreds of other cars would follow in the hour before the sheriff's department and fire department arrived. The drivers turned their cars so the headlights shone on the scene. The crash sight was on fire and the stench of gasoline filled the air. Lynch remembers seeing plane and body parts strewn across the field. 'It was a pretty gruesome sight,' he said.

Mervin C. ‚ÄúButch‚Äù Hare of the 803 Naval Fighter Squadron departs from Montreal, Quebec, in Hawker Sea Fury FB.11, TF997, but fails to arrive at home base of HMCS Shearwater, Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. Despite a massive international air search, nothing is found. In February 1968, two foresters discovered the wreckage in a remote area of Maine. The Sea Fury had struck a tree on top of the ridge with its port wing root and struck the ground within about 150 feet. The force of the impact dug a 15 foot diameter crater and the aircraft broke up and scattered, within a 50 yard radius. There had been several small fires. Lt. Hare‚Äôs parachute harness pieces were later found near the crater, ending an initial speculation that he had bailed out and perished elsewhere in the Maine woods. 6 July :Third prototype of three Vought XF7U-1 Cutlass twin-tailed fighters, BuNo 122474, suffers engine explosion during flight exhibition at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. Vought test pilot Paul Thayer ejects, parachutes into two feet of water, airframe impacts in dense woods on Drum Point island in the Patuxent River. An account in Naval Aviation News states that Thayer had made a couple of high speed passes over the field and was at ~15,000 feet when he had a flameout. Unable to get a relight, he attempts to roll the fighter inverted and unfastens his belt to drop out of the cockpit. Unable to get the jet to roll, he ejects at ~2,000 feet, believed to be the first ejection in which the pilot was not securely belted into the seat.Chief of Naval Operations, \\"Ejects Seat Without a Belt: Cutlass Lost After Flameout Up High\\", Naval Aviation News, Bureau of Aeronautics, Washington, D.C., September 1950, page 24. Pilot is returned safely to the admiral's reviewing stand, show announcer inquires \\"What will you do for an encore Mr. Thayer?\\" He learns that he suffered fracture to small bone at base of spine ‚Äì later tells Vought management that he was the only manager who actually \\"broke his ass for the Company.\\"Moran, Gerard P., The Corsair, and other:Aeroplanes Vought, Aviation Heritage Books, Sunshine House, Inc., Terre Haute, Indiana, 1978, , , page 106. 13 July :A USAF Boeing B-50D Superfortress, 49‚Äì267, of the 97th Bomb Wing out of Biggs AFB, Texas, carrying a nuclear weapon bomb casing (but no fissile pit), stalls at at about 1454 hrs. EST, crashes between Lebanon and Mason, Ohio, killing four officers and twelve airmen.Gibson, James N. Nuclear Weapons of the United States ‚Äì An Illustrated History. Atglen, Pennsylvania.: Schiffer Publishing Ltd., 1996, , , page 58. No radio communication was received before the crash, and although all crew wore parachutes, none bailed out. HE in bomb casing explodes on impact leaving crater 200X25 feet, explosion heard for . One account states that the weather was clear, but Joe Baugher reports that bomber was in a storm system. 28 July :Royal Navy Supermarine Seafire F.47 VP473 of 800 Naval Air Squadron operating from HMS Triumph, is shot down over Korean waters by a USAF Boeing B-29 Superfortress. Pilot is rescued by an American destroyer. 5 August :A USAF Boeing B-29 Superfortress, 44-87651, of the 99th Bomb Squadron, 9th Bomb Group, 9th Bomb Wing, carrying a Mark 4 nuclear bomb, suffers runaway propellers and landing gear retraction problems during takeoff at Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base, Fairfield, California; concerned that the aircraft cannot clear rising terrain ahead, aircraft and mission commander Brig. Gen. Robert F. Travis orders a return to the airfield. The pilot completes a 180-degree turn, but he and the copilot are subsequently unable to correct a descending turn to the left, and the B-29 crashes along the airfield perimeter at a speed of 120 mph (190 km/h) in a wing-low attitude, breaking apart and catching fire.Gero, David B. Military Aviation Disasters: Significant Losses Since 1908. Sparkford, Yoevil, Somerset, UK: Haynes Publishing, 2010, , pp. 52‚Äì53. After emergency personnel arrive at the scene, a huge explosion occurs, killing 7 on the ground and 12 aboard the plane, including Travis; the airfield is later renamed Travis Air Force Base in his honor. Numerous nearby mobile homes are severely damaged and dozens of civilians, firefighters, and USAF ground crew are injured. The USAF attributes the explosion to conventional 500-pound HE bombs aboard the B-29 and claims that the nuclear bomb's fissile pit was aboard a different aircraft, but admits that the bomb casing contained depleted uranium used as ballast, and later orders a public health assessment of the crash site. Investigators attribute the crash to improper maintenance and the USAF makes several changes to B-29 operating and maintenance procedures. 24 August :Two Douglas B-26 Invaders of the 729th Bombardment Squadron (Light), 452d Bombardment Group (Light), based at George AFB, California, collide in flight over El Mirage Dry Lake, 10 miles NW of Victorville, California. B-26B, 44-34174, piloted by Ouris H. Cuerton, and B-26B, 44-34677, piloted by Lyle N. Leavitt, both crash with crew fatalities during attempted bail-outs. The 729th/452d had been ordered to active service on 10 August 1950. 25 August :RAF Douglas Dakota C.4, KN630, of No. 52 Squadron crashes in dense jungle near Kampong Jenera during a target making and supply dropping mission, 12 dead. Nine Britons, along with three Malaysians on board, are killed when the Dakota crashes into a ravine near Kampung Jendera, in the Sungai Beluar valley in the communist- infested jungles of Gua Musang, Kelantan. The Britons who perished were identified as RAF crew pilot Lt Edward Robert Talbot, 27, from Dorchester; navigator Sgt Geoffrey Carpenter, 23, from West Norwood; and signaller Sgt Thomas O'Toole, 34, from Merthyr Tydfil. The Royal Army Service Corps air despatchers were Corporal Phillip Bryant, 25, from Southend-on-Sea; and Privates Peter Taylor, 20, from Bournemouth; Roy Wilson, 21, from Birkenhead and Oliver Goldsmith, 21, from Neston ‚Äì all drivers. The passengers were army officer Major John Proctor and land development officer Anker Rentse. The Malaysians were police constable Mohammed Abdul Lalil Jalil, civilian Yaacob Mat and an Orang Asli guide, Saiap Alais Sherda, from the Sakai tribe. RAF records showed the plane, based in Changi, Singapore, had flown to Kota Baru with three crew and four despatchers. In Kota Baru, the aircraft picked up the five passengers and flew east of Kampung Jendera to drop a marker flare at a clearing for eight Lincoln bombers. \\"The aircraft made a second low-level pass to drop another marker flare when it is believed that it suffered engine trouble due to the adverse weather condition, making it unable to clear a ridge. It then rammed into trees and crashed into a ravine, killing all aboard. The crash happened when the country was struggling with communist insurgents, a period known as the Malayan Emergency (1948‚Äì60), when British, Commonwealth and other security forces in Malaya fought the insurgents. The Communist Party of Malaya had demanded Malaya's independence, but Britain responded by mounting a large-scale military and political counter-insurgency operation. Malaya finally won Independence on Aug 31, 1957.\\" On 15 March 2012, the remains of the crew were reburied at the Commonwealth War Grave in Cheras with full military honours in the presence of both British and Malaysian Defence Ministry officials, and members of the Ex-British Army Association of Malaysia. 9 September :A Douglas R5D-3 crashed shortly after take off from Kwajalein atoll in the South Pacific Ocean en route to Tokyo, Japan. 26 U.S. Navy personnel were killed, including 11 nurses. Navy R5D-3, BuNo 56496, c/n 10624, was the airframe involved. 19 September :A U.S. Navy C-54 en-route to Korea crashed into the sea approximately one minute after takeoff from Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands. The aircraft had 26 personnel aboard including eleven nurses. There were no survivors. http://www.koreanwar- educator.org/topics/airplane_crashes/c54_skymaster_kwajalein_19500919/p_c54_skymaster.htm#:~:text=C%2D54%20Skymaster%20Crash%2C%20September%2019%2C%201950&text;=According%20to%20KWE%20member%20Art,26%20Naval%20personnel%20on%20board. 26 September :USAF Douglas C-54D-1-DC Skymaster medical aircraft, 42-72457, c/n 10562, of the 6th Troop Carrier Squadron, 374th Troop Carrier Wing, from Tachikawa Air Base, Japan, crashes in the Korea Strait, one mile from the end of the runway after taking off from Ashiya Air Base, Kyushu, killing 23 of 51 on board. 27 September :An Argentine Air Force Vickers VC.1 Viking, T-8, was burnt out in a hangar fire at El Palomar, Argentina. 29 September : Landing aboard USS Philippine Sea, which was operating as flagship of Task Force 77 in Korean waters, Grumman F9F-2 Panther, BuNo 123432, of VF-111, crashes through all barriers and hits eleven parked aircraft.Campbell, Douglas E., U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and MATS Aircraft Lost During the Korean War, Syneca Research Group, Inc., 2013, , page 56. 27 October :North American AJ-1 Savage, BuNo 124163, of VC-5, fails to climb out on launch from the USS Franklin D. Roosevelt, and goes into the water directly off the bow, reportedly off of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The Plane Commander was LCDR Dave Purdon, the B/N was LTJG Ed Decker, and the Third Crewman was Chief Edward R. Barrett. Only Decker escapes from the wreckage with minor injuries to be rescued by the plane guard helicopter. Cause was possibly accidental engagement of the flight control gust locks. Newsreel footage of this accident was released through Movietone News. 8 November : Boeing SB-17G Flying Fortress, 43-39364, of the 3d Air Rescue Squadron, is heavily damaged while parked when struck by SB-17G, 43-39365, of the same unit, at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, when its hydraulics failed. The noses of both are wrecked and both are written off.Marion, Forrest L., \\"That Others May Live: USAF Air Rescue In Korea\\", Air Force History and Museums Program, 2004, page 40.Campbell, Douglas E., U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and MATS Aircraft Lost During the Korean War, Syneca Research Group, Inc., 2013, , page 227. 9 November : Boeing RB-29A Superfortress, 44-61813, c/n 11290, built as a B-29A-50-MO, modified to F-13A, redesignated RB-29A, Circle X tailcode, of the 31st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, damaged by MiG-15s, during touch-down at Johnson Air Base, Japan, lands too hot and with too much nose-down attitude, overshoots runway, ends up in a cabbage patch, airframe breaks into five major portions. Small fire extinguished quickly but it is written off.Campbell, John M., American Bomber Aircraft Vol. II: Boeing B-29 Superfortress, Schiffer Publishing Ltd., Atglen, Pennsylvania, 1997, Library of Congress Card Number 97-66913, , page 244. Five crew died. 10 November :A USAF Boeing B-50 Superfortress of the 43d Bomb Wing on a routine weapons ferrying flight between Goose Bay, Labrador and its home base at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, loses two of four engines. To maintain altitude it jettisons empty Mark 4 nuclear bomb casing just before 1600 hrs. at above the St. Lawrence River near the town of St. Alexandre-de-Kamouraska, about northeast of Quebec, Canada. HE in the casing observed detonating upon impact in the middle of the twelve-mile (19 km)-wide river, blast felt for . Official Air Force explanation at the time is that the Superfortress released three conventional 500-pound HE bombs. 11 November :A Fairchild C-82A-FA Packet, 45-57739, c/n 10109, of the 375th Troop Carrier Wing (Medium), en route from Maxwell AFB, Alabama, and due to land at Greenville AFB, South Carolina, at 2230 hrs., crashes near Pickens, South Carolina, ~40 miles W of the destination, shortly after 2200 hrs. this date. On approach to Greenville, the aircraft strikes Bully Mountain in northern Pickens County, killing three crew and one passenger. KWF are Capt. John Miles Stuckrath, pilot; 1st Lt. Robert P. Schmitt, co-pilot; and S/Sgt. John Davis Bloomer; all were attached to Greenville AFB and were part of a Pittsburgh reserve wing called to active duty on 15 October 1950. The passenger was S/Sgt. Walter O. Lott, of Pensacola, Florida. He was a member of a Maxwell AFB unit. \\"The plane apparently began to plunge after it sheared off tree tops. It cut a cyclonic gap through the immense trees for about 100 yards and plowed into the 2,500-foot mountain near its peak. The impact of the crash sent one motor hurling 800 feet down one side of the mountain, and the other motor landed 500 feet down the opposite side.\\" A post-crash fire burned two acres of forest land.Pendleton, South Carolina, \\"Four servicemen lost their lives in 1950 Jocassee Gorges crash\\", Jocassee Journal, Spring/Summer 2004, Volume 5, Number 1, pages 6‚Äì7. The aircraft had just been overhauled at McChord Air Force Base, Washington, and had refueled at Maxwell AFB before transiting to its new assignment at Greenville AFB. 22 November :First official test flight of the U.S. Navy Vought XSSM-N-8 Regulus, FTV-1, (Flight Test Vehicle), '1', from Rogers Dry Lake, Edwards AFB, California, goes badly when, after reaching an altitude of several hundred feet after lift-off, the J33 jet-powered missile rolls violently right and crashes. Had it rolled to the left, it would likely have struck the USN Lockheed TV-2 Seastar chaseplane piloted by Chuck Miller with Roy Pearson on board as missile controller. Cause is found to be a broken brass pin in the port elevator pump assembly that allowed the elevator to deploy, the pin having been worn out during months of ground test runs. Brass is subsequently replaced by steel pins, and problem is solved.Spark, Nick T., \\"Out Of The Deep\\", Wings, Woodland Hills, California, April 2002, Volume 32, Number 2, pages 48‚Äì49. An AD-4 Skyraider of VA-115 crashes aboard USS Philippine Sea (CV-47). 12 December :A U.S. Navy Douglas AD-4 Skyraider of Attack Squadron 115 \\"Arabs\\", Carrier Air Group 11 (CVG-11), bursts into flame as the engine breaks off upon landing aboard the U.S. aircraft carrier . The Skyraider had been hit by enemy flak over Korea. 19 December :First prototype Douglas XA2D-1 Skyshark, BuNo 122988, c/n 7045, crashes at Edwards AFB, California, on its 15th flight. Taken up by Navy Lt. Cdr. Hugh Wood for dive tests, the first was initiated from 30,000 feet. During the 5 g pullout from the second dive, begun at 20,000 feet, vapor begins trailing from the airframe, soon enveloping it, but stops when the ventral dive brakes are retracted. While turning back for a visual inspection from the ground, the XA2D begins losing altitude rapidly. Pilot attempts to land on the dry lakebed but is unable to flare properly and the dive angle is too steep. With the undercarriage in the down position, the airframe strikes the ground at high speed at a 30-degree angle, shearing off the gear, the prototype then sliding several hundred yards before burning, killing the pilot. Investigation finds that the starboard power section of the coupled Allison XT40A turboprop engine had failed and did not declutch, allowing the Skyshark to fly on the power of the opposite section, nor did the propellers feather. As the wings' lift disappeared, a fatal sink rate was induced. Additional instrumentation and an automatic decoupler are added to the second prototype, but by the time it is ready to fly on 3 April 1952, sixteen months have passed, and with all-jet designs being developed, the A2D program is essentially dead. Total flight time on the lost airframe was barely 20 hours.McCullough, Anson, \\"Skyshark\\", Wings, Sentry Publications, Granada Hills, California, October 1995, Volume 25, Number 5, pages 18‚Äì20. 23 December :U.S. Navy Lockheed P2V-3W Neptune, BuNo 124357, of VP-931, NAS Whidbey Island, crashes on McCreight Mountain, Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Wreckage found 21 September 1961, according to Joe Baugher. Pilot Lt. Lalonde M. Pinne and ten crew KWF. Another source cites crash date of 18 December 1950. Yet another source lists discovery date as 21 October 1951, found by a Canadian aircraft that was off- course. 1951 10 January : Boeing B-50D-80-BO Superfortress, 48-0070, c/n 15879, of the Headquarters Squadron, 3077th Evaluation Group, Edwards AFB, California, piloted by Capt. William Alexander Bailey, Jr., and Maj. Gordon L. Payne, strikes a ridge in the Shadow Mountain range N of El Mirage Dry Lake, near Victorville, California, ~25 miles SE of Edwards AFB, while flying in overcast on approach to Edwards. All aboard are KWF. \\"In addition to Bailey and Payne, there were four Sergeants, and two civilians onboard. The sergeants were, Robert E. Mathusa, James H. Willingham, Lilburn N. Cate, and Carl A. Milhoan. The civilians were, C. A. White, and W. J. Christian. Both civilians worked for the Ryan Aircraft Co., and were classified as test engineers.\\" 11 January :Boeing B-29-95-BW Superfortress bomber, 45-21771, c/n 13671, of the 3512th AMS, 3510th AMG, returning to Randolph Air Force Base, Texas, after a seven-hour training flight, crashed 10 miles SW of Seguin, Texas. At 8,000 feet the pilot, Captain Norman A. Bivens, cut off the automatic pilot and began descending through an overcast, flying on instruments. Bivens reported losing all flight instruments and the aircraft became uncontrollable. Six of the crew members were killed, while five others parachuted to safety. 15 January :A Douglas B-26C, 44-35736, (built as an A-26C-45-DT), of the 168th Bomb Squadron, Illinois Air National Guard, based at O'Hare International Airport, suffers heavy icing conditions, attempts an emergency landing at NAS Glenview, Illinois, but explodes in midair just before landing, coming down in Northbrook along Willow Road, spreading wreckage over a half mile area. All five on board, pilot Capt. Myron A. Bourland, two other officers, and two enlisted men are killed. All victims were reported to be residents of the Chicago area. 21 January :Lockheed P2V-4 Neptune, BuNo 124227 , of VP-22, deployed to WestPac during the Korean War on 1 November 1950 and based at Naha Air Base, Okinawa, is lost this date due to starboard engine failure during takeoff. The P2V crashed and sank in 20 fathoms of water one mile off the end of the runway. There were 11 survivors and two crewmen were listed as missing (their bodies were later recovered). Crew: Pilot LCDR William R. McDowell (seriously injured), LT J. T. White (seriously injured), LT (jg) K. R. Kiddoo (minor injury), ENS W. E. Todd (minor injury), LCDR J. G.

Gentile Air Force Station, Kettering, Ohio, was named in his honor. 31 January :A Douglas C-54D-1-DC Skymaster, 282, c/n 10597, operated by the For√ßa A√©rea Portuguesa, crashes into the sea at 2303 hrs. while approaching Lajes Field, having taken off from Lisbon, Portugal, killing all 14 on board. Fatalities included two pilots, nine mechanics and three military personnel. 14 February :Major Raymond S. Wetmore, World War II ace (21.25 kills), and commander of the 59th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron at Otis Air Force Base, Massachusetts, is killed this date in the crash of North American F-86A-5-NA Sabre, 48-0149, c/n 151-43517 at age 27. After a cross-country flight from Los Angeles, California, to Otis AFB, he was on his final approach when his plane suddenly shot up skyward, and then turned towards the ground where it crashed. Raymond was killed instantly. He was reported to have said that he had trouble steering and ejecting from the plane. He was also reported to have said to the tower that, \\"I'm going to go up and bring it down in Wakeby Lake, so I don't hit any houses.\\" When he died, he left a widow and four children. 13 March :1st Lt. Henry A. Crescibene suffers forced landing due to mechanical failure 3 miles W of Aldenhoven, Germany, in Republic F-84E-15-RE Thunderjet, 49-2379, of the 307th Fighter- Escort Squadron, 31st Fighter-Escort Group, based at RAF Manston.

Nineteen are killed and two suffer serious burns. Wreckage of the plane was scattered over an area 250 feet wide by 100 feet long. A section of earth was gouged out on the side of the hill where the plane struck. It then apparently vaulted over the top of the hill and struck 50 feet on the other side, where it sheared off trees. Several Air Force veterans said if the plane had been 30 feet higher it would have cleared the hill top. At the time of the crash it was misting rain and the ceiling was almost at tree- top level. Pilot was Lt. Col. James K. McLaughlin of Charleston, deputy commanding officer of the 123d Fighter-Bomber Wing, of which the men are members. The two injured men were taken to Staats Hospital, where attendants said they had a 50‚Äì50 chance of surviving. They were identified as Capt. Harry K. Blackhurst of Charleston and Maj. Isaac E. Bonifas of Portland, Indiana. The airmen were to comprise an honor guard for the funeral at St. Albans yesterday of Maj. Woodford W. (Jock) Sutherland, 34.

Mission escorting B-36 Peacemaker bombers from Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio, to Selfridge AFB, Michigan. Worst mass air crash to date. Eight planes failed due to internal engine icing unknown to happen until this disaster. They were serials 50-1120, -1130, -1133, and -1209, and 51-0479, -0506, and -0679. Three pilots were killed. Approximately ten minutes after the 32-plane flight departed Wright-Patterson, the eight suffered engine failure. \\"Three of the pilots were killed as they dived into farm fields or manufacturing yards within a 25 mile circle around Richmond, Ind. The other five planes were brought into belly landings from which three pilots escaped unscathed and the other two suffered injuries. Bergstrom base identified one of the dead as Capt. Edward J. Moroney Jr., Austin, son of Mr. and Mrs. Edward J. Moroney of Highland Park, Ill. He also is survived by his wife and a daughter, 6. The other dead were listed as Maj. George W.

Maj. Richard E. Willsic (also reported as Willsie), in 50-1130, and Capt. Bryce E. Long, in 50-1120, parachuted from their aircraft, while Lt. Eustace Coltharp, in 51-0479, rode his plane in and escaped injury. Three other fighters which suffered partial power loss limped back into Wright-Patterson, while the remaining 21 landed at Selfridge. Sabotage as a cause is quickly discarded with initial suspicions falling on possible fuel contamination, as all of the flight had tanked up at the Dayton, Ohio, base before departure. Lt. Gen. Curtis LeMay heads up the investigation which initially samples fuel from the belly-landed jets as well as those that landed safely in Michigan to look for impurities. The presence of thunderstorms in the area is also acknowledged early in the investigation, with the three fatalities thought to have been due to pilots losing control of their powerless aircraft and then diving out of low clouds. 13 June :RAF English Electric Canberra B.1, VN850, bailed to Rolls-Royce for Avon engine tests.

Weston, survive. The Straits Times, Singapore, reported that despite the efforts of a working party, the crewman's body still had not been recovered by nightfall of 18 June, the twisted wreckage being located in the tidal portion of the river where low-water periods are brief, complicating the salvage and recovery. Deployed to fight Communist insurgents during the Malayan Emergency, the humid climate created operating problems for Brigands, not the least of which was a tendency to throw a propeller blade due to corrosion, the resultant imbalance shearing the engine from the wing, rendering the plane uncontrollable. VS857 lost its starboard engine in this manner. \\"Gas was spewing out and the aircraft was gyrotating, Alan could get no control at all except for the first couple of seconds, his words will never leave me, the plane was changing attitude all the way down, at first the engine bulkhead was acting like a dive brake just on one side, after that the controls gave up and she was in a dive, we hit the ground first at a slight angle, a bit of luck, (This all was surmised at the inquiry) the nose came away Alan was slung out for about 50/70 ft.into the water, it bounced on and over and \`then\` hit the water,\\" recalled Weston. The wings and the fuselage demated on impact. 18 June :An infamous day in the history of RAF Biggin Hill when three Gloster Meteors and their pilots are killed in accidents, all three crashing in an area of about 100 yards. The first, a Mk.8, WB110, piloted by Flight Lieutenant Gordon McDonald of 41 Squadron, crashed shortly after take off, corkscrewing as pieces of structure fell from the aircraft. The aircraft hit a bungalow killing the pilot. The jet wash of his flight leader was named as a possible cause. Within seconds of this accident two Mk.4 Meteors of 600 Sqn., Royal Auxiliary Air Force, piloted by Sergeant Kenneth Clarkson and Squadron Leader Phillip Sandeman, both circling over the wreckage and preparing to land, collided at above the scene. Although Sandeman managed to bail out he was killed when his parachute failed to open. Clarkson was killed in his aircraft. A week after this incident, another Meteor overshot the runway, narrowly missing passing cars. After these incidents, several residents stated they would be \\"selling up\\" and there were calls for traffic lights to be sited on the Bromley road for use during take-offs and landings.Ogley, Bob, Ghosts of Biggin Hill, Princess Elizabeth, soon to be Queen Elizabeth II, was visiting the station on this day. 21 June :On June 21, 1951, a PB4Y-2 Privateer patrol bomber on a training mission when the aircraft crashed in Skagit Bay about 50 miles north of Seattle killing 5 naval aviators with 5 survivors. Lt. Carl L. Hodge, Pilot departed NAS Seattle at 0611 PDT on a training flight through Admiralty Inlet and the Strait of Juan de Fuca at an altitude of 200 feet. Air to ground gunnery exercises were completed following which mining exercises commenced. Pilot descended from 500 feet to 300 feet on an easterly heading. Pilot commenced a left 20 degree banked turn at 160 knots. After turning 30 degrees towards North the aircraft struck the water. The Naval inquiry found it was not possible to determine with certainty the accident's primary cause. The aircraft had 10 aviators with 5 killed and 5 surviving. The 5 surviving members were exhaustively questioned none able to state the cause as either material or personnel error. :Possibilities of the accident are: Personnel errors: 1) at the time of the accident the plane was operating at an authorized altitude using radar pilotage which requires a high degree of skill and attention on the part of both pilot and crew; 2) Water over which the aircraft was flying was glassy making depth perception difficult; 3) No definitive evidence of material failure was presented to inquiry board; 4) Since radar operator was able to maintain a good picture on his scope prior to accident with no radical maneuvers being made prior to accident; 5) in view of the foregoing, pilot misjudged altitude due to glassy water, and even with unrestricted visibility, could fly the plane into the water. The pilot was seaplane qualified with 3700 hours total flying time. :Deceased: 1) Aviation Ordnanceman Third Class Donald W.

A special investigations team was dispatched early today (14 January) from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Dayton, Ohio. Salvage, and additional recovery of bodies, waited on the arrival of a crane sent from McClellan Air Force Base, Sacramento. Gridley residents said the doomed plane \\"barely cleared treetops\\" while passing over the town seconds before the crash, but regained altitude momentarily. Eyewitnesses to the actual crash said the bomber came out of the clouds at in a spin.

Collins was flown back to Fort Sill, Okla., Saturday to explain why he wrote a suicide note on his promotion orders, stole a plane and crashed it on a railroad track. Collins, 28, of Tacoma, Wash., surrendered to the 3223rd Air Police Detachment in Dallas late Friday night. He stole the plane ‚Äì an L19 Army trainer ‚Äì from the Fort Sill airport at 1:30 a.m. Wednesday and crashed it at Temple, Okla., 37 miles to the southeast. 'He made good sense when he talked to us,' an air policeman said. He didn't say where he'd been ‚Äì in fact, he said he didn't know. He said he didn't know how he got out of the plane and what had happened since.' The Air Police took Collins, who was dressed in parts of an Army uniform and a flying suit and needed a shave, to Carswell Air Force Base in Fort Worth. He did tell the Air Police that he stole the plane and intended to kill himself, as his note said. Capt. Robert Spence, the Carswell public information officer, asked Collins whether he wanted to make a detailed explanation. 'No, I don't want to make any comment until I see my commander,' he told Spence. Most of the note, addressed to his wife, was not legible. It was written in grease paint on the orders promoting him to captain. But one sentence said: 'I am going to die in the air like I want to.' Mrs. Collins, who lived near Fort Sill with their two children, said she had no idea why he stole the plane. Her husband is a former Marine, who was taking pilot training at Fort Sill as part of an Army aviation tactics course.\\"United Press, \\"Captain Writes Suicide Note, Steals Plane, Crashes It, Lives\\", The Sun-Telegram, San Bernardino, California, Sunday 10 January 1954, Volume VII, Number 40, page 1. 15 January :USAF Boeing B-29A-40-BN Superfortress, 44-61681, c/n 11788, of the 580th Air Resupply and Communications Wing, practicing low-level night mission over the Libyan desert, suffers controlled flight into terrain at cruise speed 40 miles S of Wheelus Air Base.

Lt.(jg) J. R. Maccoun, 23, of Dutch Flat, California, stated that his F9F-6 went into a spin at about 23,000 feet and that he ejected at about 9,000 feet when he could not effect a recovery. After he divorced the airframe and deployed his canopy at 5,000 feet, the fighter proceeded to pull out of the spin at ~4,000 feet, climbed to ~8,000 feet, and headed for land. Lt.(jg) C. W.

The squadron is a geographically separated unit assigned to the 168th Wing at Eielson Air Force Base. Mission The primary mission of the 213th Space Warning Squadron is to provide early warning of intercontinental ballistic missile and submarine-launched ballistic missile launches to the Missile Warning Center at North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). The secondary mission of the squadron is to provide space surveillance data on orbiting objects to the NORAD Space Control Center.  History  The Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) site at Clear Air Force Station began operation in November 1961, when Detachment 1, 71st Surveillance Wing took over the site from Air Force Systems Command. The detachment was manned by civilian contractors until 1964, when active duty United States Air Force personnel began to operate the site's tactical operations room. At the start of 1967, the detachment was replaced by the newly activated 13th Missile Warning Squadron. In August 1967, a severe flood inundated the region surrounding Fairbanks, Alaska, and the squadron provided shelter to 216 refugees. The squadron was assigned its first female officer in 1973. By 1986, the squadron would be employing all-female crews. Because of a fire that destroyed part of a similar facility at Thule Air Base, Greenland, in 1981 the missile tracking radar and its radome were disassembled and replaced. The radar at Clear was the last mechanically operated BMEWS site. In 1998 the radar began to be converted to a phased array radar by employing components of the PAVE PAWS submarine-launched ballistic missile detection site from the closed facility at El Dorado Air Force Station near Laredo Air Force Base, Texas. The new system, known as the Solid-State Phased-Array Radar System, achieved initial operating capability on 31 January 2001. On 21 May 2004, the 213th activated at Clear Air Force Station. In 2006, the 213th Space Warning Squadron became the majority force provider to the mission of Clear Air Force Station by providing both space operations crews for the early warning radar and security forces for the installation. The early warning radar supports ballistic missile warning for threats to North America. Clear Air Force Station consists largely of Air National Guard members assigned to the 213th, but the smaller active duty squadron, 13th Space Warning Squadron, maintains responsibility for both the installation and execution of the mission.

Crewman SFC Stanley C. Kozak, standing seven feet away, is caught in the flareback from booster ignition and suffers minor burns. Initial reports stated that the missile exploded about three miles (5 km) away, \\"several thousand feet in the air.\\" Later accounts state that the missile, which was not in the fully upright launch position when it unexpectedly left the rail, suffered structural damage as it took off, \\"coupled with rapid initial acceleration, rendered the missile aerodynamically unsound and led to the break up. The fact the crew had not removed the propulsion safety pin during the drill contributed to the failure of the sustainer motor to start. And, since the launch was unintended, the missile was not under radar control. Neither the missile nor the booster exploded in flight. The booster separated and fell onto Barber's Trailer Court more than a mile from the launch site. Fuel tank fragments fell on the Baltimore-Washington Expressway where the fuel and oxidizer caused a fire but little or no damage. The missile nose section was found 500 yards from the launcher with the guidance assembly still attached.\\" The Army board of inquiry isolated the cause as an electrical short caused by rain water in the junction box on the outside rear of the launcher control trailer.

The whole J40 project, upon which Westinghouse had staked their engine division's future, suffered developmental delays and never lived up to the performance expectations anticipated, and the engine was considered unusable due to reliability problems, especially in the development of a functional afterburner. The J40 project was cancelled entirely in 1955, and aircraft designed to use it were either cancelled outright, like the Grumman XF10F Jaguar, downgraded in performance expectations like the F3H Demon (six airframes and four pilots lost out of the initial production run), with Time Magazine calling the Navy's grounding of all Westinghouse-powered F3H-1 Demons a \\"fiasco\\", with 21 unflyable planes that could be used only for Navy ground training at a loss of $200 million. The A3D Skywarrior and F4D Skyray had been designed to permit replacement powerplants of a larger diameter and length and were subsequently fitted with the Pratt & Whitney J57 in lieu of the troubled J40, but the F3H required an enlarged fuselage and revised wing to accommodate an Allison J71, the only viable substitute, but even this combination was underpowered.

The aircraft was climbing, using rated military power, with 10‚Äì15 degrees of flaps to get on top of the overcast, when it impacted, skipped about 60 feet, and slid another 20 feet before partially burning, coming to rest almost at the crest of the ridge. Because of the secrecy involved with the Lockheed U-2 project, the C-54 crew was never in contact with Air Traffic Control, and, off course and lost in clouds, an error in plotting the position of the Skymaster in relation to the Spring Mountains range resulted in the crash only 50 feet below the crest of an 11,300-foot ridge leading to the peak of Mount Charleston.

The cause of the crash was later determined to be the aft slip ring, which carried flight data from the instrumented rotor blades to the data recorders in the cabin. The slip ring bearings seized, and the resultant torque load severed the instrumentation standpipe inside the aft rotor shaft. A segment of this steel standpipe tilted over and came into contact with the interior of the aluminum rotor shaft, scribing a deepening groove into it. The rotor shaft eventually failed in flight, which in turn led to the aft blades and forward blades desynchronizing and colliding. The aircraft was a total loss, the two test pilots, Harold Peterson and George Callaghan, were killed. This led to the cancellation not only of the YH-16, but also the planned sixty-nine-passenger YH-16B version. ;10 January :The most notorious incident of aircraft pitch-up known as the \\"Sabre dance\\" was the loss of brand new North American F-100C-20-NA Super Sabre, 54-1907, flown by Lt.

The aircraft was one of three being delivered from North American's Palmdale plant to George AFB, California, but the nose gear pivot pin worked loose, allowing the wheel to swivel at random, so he diverted to Edwards which had a longer runway. The pilot fought to retain control as he rode the edge of the flight envelope, but fell off on one wing, hit the ground, and exploded with fatal results.

PDT or 1700 hrs. on takeoff at Fairchild AFB near Spokane, Washington. All crew members are killed except the tail gunner. The incident is caused by trim motors that were hooked up backwards. The aircraft climbed straight up, stalled, fell over backwards and nosed straight down. Among the dead crewmen was the commanding officer of the SAC 92d Bomb Wing to which the aircraft was assigned, Col. Clarence Arthur Neely, 42, of Rockford, Illinois. The tail section broke away in the crash and the gunner, T/Sgt. Gene I. Graye, 25, Augusta, Kansas, survived a low-level ejection, relatively unscathed. All eight others on board perished, although four attempted ejection.Editors, \\"B-52 Database\\",B-52 Stratofortress: Celebrating 60 Remarkable Years, Key Publishing Ltd., Stamford, Lincs., UK, 2014, page 94.

The pilot \\"had tried to land once before but was waved off because [his] approach to the end of the runway was too low. Visibility was reduced to about a half mile by fog and mist. On the second run, the plane also came in too low and to the left. The tower again waved it off. The pilot gunned his ship as it started over the 'Cinder Block,' the station's name for a housing area for married enlisted personnel. Mrs. Howard Snyder, in one of the one-story, two family buildings, said, 'I looked out the window and all I saw was wings.' The plane cleared the housing area, but clipped treetops as the engines roared. The impact with the trees threw the plane out of control, and it seared a strip through the thin woods a quarter-mile long. Then it struck the ground and erupted into a huge ball of fire. Eight bodies were thrown clear of the wreckage by the exploding gasoline. A ninth was pulled out of the mangled cockpit section while it still smouldered.

The Navy said that the Tradewind's 5 hours and 54 minutes bettered an old record for a seaplane, also set by a Tradewind, at 6 hours and 54 minutes. After departing from Keehi Lagoon, Hawaii, the Tradewind suffered the loss of the number one propeller (port outer) when it tore loose about from the mainland, slashing a six- to eight-foot hole (2.5 m) in the hull below the waterline, and damaging electrical control lines. None of the 17 on board were injured, either, when the R3Y slammed into the breakwater after landing in San Francisco Bay, California, due to a runaway turboprop engine that would not respond to control inputs due to the electrical system damage from the propeller strike.

Ultimately, this was the last straw for the troubled P5Y and R3Y programme. Four of the design had crashed, including one of two XP5Y-1 prototypes, all attributed to on-going issues with the problematic Allison T-40 turboprop powerplants and their associated gearboxes. The Navy abandoned further interest in the engine and all aircraft using it.

CST, two minutes after the start of the takeoff roll, coming down S and slightly to the right of runway 14. The cargo load of an unspecified number and type of nuclear weapons was to be transported to Little Rock AFB, Arkansas. One weapon was destroyed by the post-crash fire which also burned out the airframe. No nuclear or high explosive detonation occurred, and contamination was limited to a confined area directly below the weapon. Six flight crew of crew R-41, and one substitution, all survived the crash. Although they denied any knowledge of engine malfunctions during the takeoff roll, witnesses stated that one or more engines were after firing or backfired from the beginning of the roll throughout the entire flight. After approximately of ground roll, the airframe assumed a nose high attitude as it climbed to between 50 and , with one or more engines after firing excessively during the climb. The aircraft leveled off briefly before again assuming a nose high attitude when it then settled back to earth amidst smoke and dust. An intense fire then broke out (the aircraft was carrying ~5,000 gallons of fuel). After firefighters extinguished the blaze, weapons were removed using a M246 wrecker and a trailer.Maggelet, Michael H., and Oskins, James C., \\"Broken Arrow: The Declassified History of U.S. Nuclear Weapons Accidents\\", Lulu Publishing, www.lulu.com, 2007, , chapter 18, pages 123‚Äì127. ;6 July :A USAF Lockheed F-104C-5-LO Starfighter, 56-0905, of the 436th Tactical Fighter Squadron, George Air Force Base, California, suffers a right main tire failure on take off from that base.

Morris Ballard Larson, of the, 434th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 479th Tactical Fighter Wing, was not injured. Taking-off in formation as number 2/Wing, Lt. Larson felt the right main gear tire blow at 4,200 ft. down the runway and at ~150 knots. He started to veer towards Lead and corrected with left brake and reduction of power to avoid collision. The pilot then aborted t/o, reducing throttle and engaging nose wheel steering and deploying drag chute. The pilot was able to keep the F-104C centered and radioed that he was taking the barrier. Aimed at the center of the barrier the pilot moved throttle to OFF. A successful barrier engagement was made and the aircraft decelerated, then veered right into the dirt just off the hard overrun surface.

In a career that lasted from June 1808 to July 1814 he had six different owners, ran twenty times and won nine races. His most important success came on his only appearance as a three-year-old in 1808 when he won the Derby as a 25/1 outsider. Pan won another eight races over the next four seasons, running mainly in match races at Newmarket. He raced for two more years without success before being retired as a nine-year-old in 1814. Background Pan's dam Arethusa, who was bred by the Prince of Wales, was one of the most successful broodmares of her era: apart from Pan she produced the leading stallion Walton the Derby winner Ditto and the Ascot Gold Cup winner Lutzen. Pan's sire St. George finished fifth in the 1792 Derby and raced up to the age of ten, winning many matches and Plate races. Pan was his most successful offspring. Pan was owned in his early racing career by his breeder, Sir Hedworth Williamson of Whitburn, near Sunderland. Racing career =1808: three-year-old season= Unraced as a two-year-old, Pan made his one and only appearance of 1808 in the Derby at Epsom on 2 June. Ridden by Frank Collinson, a \\"cunning Yorkshireman\\", he was a 20/1 and 25/1 outsider for the race, with the Duke of Grafton's colt Vandyke starting 9/4 favourite in a field of ten runners. In the straight, Vandyke moved to the front and after a \\"severe\\" struggle with Clinker and Rubens, looked the likely winner. Collinson however, produced Pan with a strong late run to catch the leaders inside the final furlong and win by half a length. It appeared that Vandyke's jockey had failed to notice the challenge of the outsider until it was too late for his colt to respond. The race was considered one of the finest Derbies ever run. After the race, the owners of the second, third and fourth placed horses all challenged the winner to match races, but Sir Hedworth did not accept. =1809: four- year-old season= For the next three seasons, Pan raced exclusively at Newmarket. On 17 April Pan raced for the first time in more than ten months when he started 11/10 favourite a four-mile Sweepstakes at Newmarket. The race brought together the first three horses from the 1808 Derby, and the result was a repeat of the Epsom Classic, with Pan, ridden by Frank Buckle prevailing from Vandyke and Chester. Pan's second win was followed by another long break before he reappeared for the autumn meetings at Newmarket. He carried 144 pounds in a King's Plate on 5 October and finished second of the four runners to Vandyke. He was withdrawn from the Oatlands Stakes on 20 October before starting 6/4 favourite for a Subscription Plate on 1 November at the Houghton meeting. He finished second of the ten runners in the two mile race to the five-year-old mare Nymphina, to whom he was conceding eleven pounds. =1810: five-year-old season= The death of Sir Hedworth Williamson in March led to the sale of all his horses and Pan was bought for 1,350 guineas by a Mr Bouverie. On 7 May he ran in a match race against Mr Shakespear's horse Tumbler, with Bouverie wagering 300 guineas against Shakespear's 200. Pan was beaten in the match, in which he carried seven pounds more than his opponent. He was then sold to Lord Sackville, in whose colours he ran for the next three years. In October, Pan was entered in a series of five match races against Mr Shakespear's Harpocrates. Each race was to be run over ten furlongs (\\"across the flat\\") and carried a prize of 100 guineas. Pan won the first match, receiving seven pounds from Harpocrates on 2 October, and the second at level weights two days later. At this point, Shakespear conceded defeat and withdrew Harpocrates from the remaining matches, agreeing to pay a forfeit of 60 guineas for each race. On his only other start of the season, Pan was beaten by Lord Grosvenor's six-year-old Eaton in a ten furlong Subscription Plate on 15 October. =1811: six-year-old season= Pan began 1811 with a rematch against Tumbler at Newmarket on 18 April. The conditions of this occasion saw him receiving seven pounds from Shakespear's horse and he won to claim the 500 guinea prize. Two weeks later sustained his only defeat of the year when he was beaten in a two-mile match in which he attempted to concede three pounds to Lord Oxford's mare Victoria for a prize of 200 guineas. On 27 June, Pan \\"raced\\" away from Newmarket for the first time since his Derby win more than three years earlier. At the Bibury Club meeting he was allowed to canter around the three mile course unopposed for a 100 guinea Plate when the entries of the other horses were withdrawn. Pan had three engagements at Newmarket in autumn. On 1 October he beat the filly Antelope in a 100 guinea match over the six furlong Two Year Old Course. At the next meeting, Lord Sackville was able to claim 100 guineas without running Pan, when Major Wilson withdrew his colt Juniper from a scheduled two mile match. Pan ended his most successful season by starting 7/4 favourite and beating four opponents in the ten furlong Cheveley Stakes on 30 October. =1812: seven-year-old season= At Newmarket on 17 April, ran a match against the seven-year-old mare Morel, the winner of the 1808 Epsom Oaks. Receiving six pounds from his opponent, Pan started the 2/7 favourite and defeated the mare over the Abingdon Mile to claim the 200 guinea prize. On his only other start of the year, Pan was matched against the 1810 Derby winner Whalebone for 200 guineas over four miles on 29 October. He sustained his first defeat for almost eighteen months as he failed to concede five pounds to the younger horse. =1813-1814: later career= In his last two years of racing Pan passed between various owners as the level of his form deteriorated. On 3 May 1813 he finished last of the five runners behind Sir Charles Bunbury's Rival in a three-mile Subscription Plate. He was then sold to a Mr Stephenson, in whose colours he finished unplaced behind Aquarius in a race on 13 July. Pan was off the course for more than a year, and became the property of a Mr Mitford, before he ran at Goodwood in July 1814. He finished second in both heats of the Goodwood Club Stakes, won by Mr Newnham's gelding Cambrian and ran again later the same day in the Ladies' Plate. In this race he was beaten in two heats by Albany, a four-year-old gelding to whom he was attempting to concede twenty-nine pounds. Pan changed owners again and ran for Mr Weston on his final racecourse appearance in which finished well beaten by a six-year-old horse named Beverley in both heats of a race at Basingstoke on 17 September. Stud career Pan began his stud career at the age of ten in 1815. He stood as a stallion at Lilley, in Hertfordshire at a fee of 5 guineas and five shillings for the groom. Pan does not appear to have been a great success at stud: he sired a few registered foals, the last of which was born in 1822. Pedigree *Pan was inbred 3 √ó 3 to Eclipse, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the third generation of his pedigree.

Plot =July 1942= The first plot follows the Starzynski family. On 16 July 1942, French police raided the Starzynski apartment in Paris, arresting ten-year-old Sarah and her parents. First, the family is sent to the V√©lodrome d'Hiver, an enclosed stadium that housed a bicycling track for racing. The captors held more than 7,000 Jews, mostly women and children in the stadium, which was made to hold far fewer people, and they were eventually sent to Drancy, a refugee camp, to separate the men from the women and children and then later, they separated the mothers from the children. Later, we find out, they were all sent to Auschwitz. Sarah, now on her own, is still tormented by thoughts of her brother locked in the secret closet at home, and tries to escape with Rachel, another Jewish girl at the camp. They are caught, but the officer that catches them is a man that Sarah knows from her old life. She begs him to let her go to rescue her brother. He reluctantly helps them escape and even gives the two girls money. The girls find refuge with an elderly couple who takes them into their house, but Rachel falls ill with what is probably diphtheria or typhus fever. The couple, Jules and Genevi√®ve Dufaure, are compelled to call a Nazi doctor, who reports to the Nazi officials that the elderly couple is hiding Jewish children. The Nazis arrive and search for more children, but without finding Sarah they take Rachel away and she presumably dies. Jules and Genevi√®ve dress Sarah in boy's clothes (her hair had been cut short at Drancy) and help her get to her former home in Paris. She had been keeping the key to the closet in her pocket the whole time. She knocks at the door, screaming her brother's name. A young boy or Eduoard as a child (Bertrand's father) opens the door and Sarah rushes into the house, nearly kicking the door to her former room and quickly opens the closet. She collapses and starts to cry hysterically. The boy's father, or Edouard's father comes into the room and removes Michel from the closet and laid him on Edouard's bed, who had died by then (shriveled up), hidden in the closet waiting for Sarah. =Julia Jarmond= The second plot follows Julia Jarmond. She was born in Boston, Massachusetts but moved to Paris in her early 20s and married a Frenchman named Bertrand Tezac and had a daughter, Zo√´. Sometime prior to the action of the book, Bertrand had cheated on Julia with a woman named Am√©lie after Julia had suffered a miscarriage. The apartment they are thinking of moving into happens to have belonged to the Starzynski family prior to being inhabited by Bertrand's grandparents and father, who was then about Sarah's age, but neither Julia nor Bertrand are aware of this. Julia's boss, Joshua, asks her to write an article about the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup, as the 60th anniversary was nearing. Julia tries to find out more about the roundup and through her research and questioning of Bertrand's grandmother discovers whom the apartment once belonged to. When Julia finds out and tells Bertrand, he does not seem to care. Julia becomes obsessed with the story of young Sarah Starzynski, who was recorded to have been taken to Beaune-la-Rolande, but was not recorded to have returned nor taken to a gas chamber. She does more research and finds out she ran away, but she loses trace of her after that. She does a little more research and becomes in touch with descendants of Jules and Genevi√®ve and they tell her that Sarah had continued to live with the family into her teens, but she grew up an introverted, sad young woman. Julia finds out she is pregnant, but Bertrand says she must either choose between an abortion or a divorce. She chooses to have the baby. She discovers that Sarah married and had a son. Sarah had died when her son William was a young boy and Julia arranges to meet him in his home of Italy. He is very reluctant to learn of his mother's story and asks that Julia not contact him again. Weeks later, the same night Bertrand's grandmother has a stroke, William shows up in France, finally ready to hear Sarah's story. After Julia delivers her daughter she and Bertrand part ways; Bertrand moves in with Am√©lie and Julia does not feel comfortable about moving into the apartment they were to have moved into, with its sad history of Sarah, Michel and their parents. She moves to New York City with Zo√´ and the baby. William, having uprooted his own life too in the wake of everything he has learned about his mother, also moves to New York City and eventually tracks down Julia again. He shares with her some of Sarah's writings that he found in his father's drawer. It is revealed that Sarah did not merely die from a car accident as previously believed, but had killed herself intentionally, unable to bear with the pain of her secret past any longer. Characters =Sarah Starzynski= Sarah Starzynski is one of the two protagonists of the book. Ten years old, she lives in Paris in July 1942, with her parents and brother. When she gets taken to Beaune-la-Rolande, she desperately tries to escape. After she finds her brother's body, she grows up a broken woman and eventually commits suicide (the official story is that she died in a car accident but Julia discovers that she deliberately crashed her car into a tree). =Julia Jarmond= Julia Jarmond is the other protagonist of the book. She was born and raised in Brookline, Massachusetts, but always preferred France over America and moved to Paris in her early twenties. She marries Bertrand Tezac and has a daughter, but they are no longer in love when the book starts. She is deeply touched by Sarah's story and names her second daughter after her. =Other characters= * Michel Starzynski, Sarah's four-year-old brother, is an important character, as he is Sarah's motivation to escape her captors. He is not taken to the camp, but dies in the secret room where Sarah locked him when the family was taken to Vel' d'Hiv. * Wladyslaw & Rywka Starzynski are Sarah and Michel's parents who are both transported to Auschwitz for extermination. Starzynski is deeply marked by the events she witnesses and it seems that she would willingly allow herself to be killed until they separate her from Sarah - this is when the mother Sarah knew and remembered reemerges. M. Starzynski is willing to fight, but he is sent almost immediately from the French camp to Auschwitz where he is sent to the gas chambers. * Jules and Genevi√®ve Dufaure are an older couple who find Sarah and Rachel hiding in their doghouse after they escaped from the concentration camp. The couple take the two girls in to live in their house. The Dufaures try to hide the two girls from any Nazi Police, but eventually Rachel is taken away by the Nazi Police when the Dufaures must find medical help for her because she is deathly ill. Sarah tries to leave by herself to find her brother in their apartment in Paris, but the couple goes with her to then find her brother dead. Sarah stays with the couple and their family until adulthood when she moves to the United States to become a nanny. * William Rainsferd is Sarah's only child and lives in Lucca. He does not know much about his mother's past and does not want to know much at the beginning. He later reaches out to Julia and learns all about his mother's past, something that moves him greatly. * Richard Rainsferd is Sarah's husband and William's father. * Rachel is Sarah's friend who escapes with her. She dies of what appears to be typhus or diphtheria. * Zo√´ Tezac is Julia's older daughter. She is 11 years old at the beginning of the book and 13 at the end. She Julia's support system and is described as a ‚Äúcalm and mature‚Äù child. She takes a keen interest in Julia's quest to find Sarah. * Bertrand Tezac is Julia's husband who is, as Zo√´ describes him, \\"totally rude\\". He is no longer in love with Julia and has an affair with his friend Amelie. *Amelie is Bertrand's girlfriend. Julia recalls an event from the past when she found out her husband was having an affair with Amelie. Later in the novel, Julia suspects that Bertrand is still in love with Amelie. They receive a divorce and he admits his love for Amelie. *Christophe is Julia's friend in Paris when she first moved to Paris she lived with him and Herve. *Herve is Julia's friend in Paris. *Guillaume is a friend of Herve and Christophe; some from his family were taken during the roundup. He helps to give Julia some information about it. * Mam√© is Bertrand's grandmother and the current owner of Sarah's former apartment. Her name is not revealed throughout the book, but she is very old and no longer lucid, suffering from Alzheimer's. She resides in a home. * √âdouard Tezac is Bertrand's father who is present when Sarah finds Michel's body in 1942. He helps Julia uncover the secrets of Sarah's life later in the novel. * Andr√© Tezac is Mam√©'s husband and √âdouard's father who is also present in 1942 and takes Michel's body out of the closet. * Sarah is Julia's younger daughter. Her last name is not revealed. As Julia and Bertrand have separated, her last name may be Jarmond or it may be Tezac.

He notably worked for the Henty Brothers, who established the first permanent Victorian settlement in Portland, upon his arrival in Australia. Richard ultimately settled in Charam, near Edenhope, in Victoria and raised 13 children, most of whom lived to their 80s and 90s. When he died at the age of 97, Richard left a strong legacy in Australia in the form of his contributions to the fledgling colony and his hundreds of descendants. Life =Early years= Richard Charles Guthridge (also spelt Gutteridge and Guttridge in different records) was born in Poplar, East London on 11 June 1837, the son of James Gutteridge and Ann Illingworth. He was baptised at St Anne's Limehouse on 2 July 1837. Richard had at least three siblings, Susannah Hall (b. 22 Feb 1832), Mary Ann Susannah (b. 17 Apr 1835) and James John (b. 19 Sep 1842), each born to James and Ann Gutteridge. James and Ann were married on 4 January 1841 at St Dunstan's church in Stepney, indicating that Richard and two of his siblings were born several years out of wedlock. James Gutteridge worked as a sawyer near East London's docks and also as a merchant seaman. James and Ann Gutteridge lived at 17 Whitehorse Street in Limehouse when they were married in January 1841 and were still living at this address when son James John Gutteridge was christened in September 1842. The 1841 Census finds Richard aged 4 and his mother Ann working as a laundress at Catherine's Place, All Saints Poplar but there is no mention of his other siblings or his father. Likewise, the 1851 Census finds Ann Gutteridge working as a mangler in Limehouse whilst caring for the 8 year-old James Junior. James Senior's work as a mariner would explain his absence from the 1841 and 1851 census records. It remains unclear whether Richard's siblings survived to adulthood or whether they maintained contact with their brother after his arrival in Australia. However, the Gutteridges living in East London appear to have been a close- knit family because the 1851 Census shows Ann Gutteridge living next door to Elizabeth Gutteridge (her sister-in-law and Richard's aunt) and her family in Limehouse, East London. Additionally, William Gutteridge (James Gutteridge's brother and Richard's uncle) and his daughter Hannah are recorded as visitors of Elizabeth Gutteridge in the 1861 Census. This suggests that Richard would certainly have known his aunts, uncles and cousins on his father's side very well. Richard followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a mariner at a young age and even looks to have sailed with his father on at least one occasion. The Merchant Shipping Act 1844 stipulated that every British seaman should have a register ticket. These records confirm that Richard's seaman's ticket (ticket number 473023) was issued in London on 24 November 1851 and that he first went to sea at the age of 14. For his first official voyage he joined the crew of the \\"Albermarle\\" for a round trip from London to ports in Australia, leaving London on 29 November 1851 and returning on 21 January 1853. The Master of this vessel was John F Trivett and the Agreement and Crew List (A&CL;) states that Richard acted as a Caddy/Servant on this voyage. Several crewmen deserted the vessel in Adelaide in 1852 in pursuit of the goldfields but Richard returned to London and was honourably discharged on 24 January 1853. The Albermarle's A&CL; also shows that a James Gutteridge (ticket number 18987), aged 36 and born in Poplar, worked as a Steward on this voyage alongside Richard. This is almost certainly Richard's father and he was discharged in London on 5 February 1853. Richard subsequently joined the crew of the \\"Index\\" and made voyages in 1853 and 1854. In 1854 the 220-ton Index travelled to Saint Kitts in the West Indies. Although Richard had planned to stay and work on a local banana plantation, he was forced to return to London due to poor health. He later joined the crew of the \\"Severn\\" under Captain Scowcroft and travelled again to Australia, leaving London on 7 October 1855 and arriving on 31 December 1855. A contemporary account from a passenger travelling on another Australia-bound vessel described the excitement of arriving into Portland Bay after the 3-month voyage and the sighting of the Severn in November 1852: The arrival of the Severn into Portland Bay in December 1855 generated additional excitement in the colony because the vessel transported a famous racehorse called \\"King Alfred\\" from England. The celebrated four-year-old thorough bred stood fifteen and a half hands and was imported by its owner Mr Richard Lewis, apparently as breeding stock for the local racehorsing industry.\\"The Portland Guardian\\" article from Thursday 3 December 1855 File:King Alfred horse_photo.jpgThe racehorse \\"King Alfred\\" =Arrival and life in Australia= Richard was discharged from the Severn in March 1856 and was employed by the Henty Brothers in their store. Shortly after this he met and married Eliza Pitts (1844 - 1913, born in Keinton, Somerset, England), the daughter of Frederick Richard Pitts and Julia Galer. Their marriage ceremony was conducted at the residence of a Mrs Rhodes in Wattle Hill, Portland, Australia on 30 August 1860. According to his marriage certificate, Richard was working as a labourer at this time, most likely in the employ of the Hentys. The couple lived in Portland for some years and then moved to Millicent in South Australia where Richard carted the stone for the building of the hospital. Shortly after this Richard and his family returned to south-west Victoria and took up land one mile NW of Carapook. Contemporary records showed that Richard, with 4 school-aged children, added his signature to the 1875 petition aimed at establishing a new school at Carapook. As a small settlement on the wagon route north from Portland Bay, Carapook was originally a part of the \\"Muntham\\" Pastoral Run settled by the Henty Brothers in 1837. The land around Carapook was made available to Selectors after 1850 and many settlers came to the region and secured blocks of land. The early pioneers would have faced many difficulties as timber had to be transported from nearby Digby due to the limited availability of timber for houses and public buildings in Carapook. Many trees had to be felled with saws and axes and carted by bullock drays to Carapook. Frequently, the drays would become bogged at river crossings and there were few bridges or opportunities to make a firm crossing.\\"Early Days at Carapook\\" by Jean Hutcheson Murray (1882-1972) Despite building a new life for himself and his family in Carapook, Richard selected land in the Charam district near Edenhope in 1880 where he and Eliza successfully raised their 13 children. In the Australian Electoral Rolls from 1909 Richard stated his occupation as \\"farmer\\", indicating that he continued to work this land well into his old age. Death and legacy =Death= Richard's beloved wife Eliza predeceased him by two decades. In a letter to his son George Henry on 4 April 1919, Richard described the pain of losing his wife: Richard Guthridge died aged 97 on 13 October 1934 in Charam, Victoria and was buried beside Eliza in the Edenhope Cemetery. Richard died at his daughter Annie's home in the presence of his youngest son, John. He was 97 and considered by the pioneers of the district as one of the earliest pioneers of the Western District. The following obituary was printed shortly after his death in the \\"Edenhope Newspaper\\" in 1934:Edenhope Newspaper, 1934 - Mr Richard GUTHRIDGE It is important to note that some of the details contained in the obituary vary from the recorded facts. For example, Richard's seaman ticket states that his voyage on the \\"Albermarle\\" when he was 14 years old was his first, and he records here that he hadn't worked on any previous vessels. The obituary also states that he worked under Captain Moffat during his trips to the East Indies. In reality, Captain Moffat was the master of the \\"Parrock Hall\\" and this vessel made several trips to the West Indies between 1847 and 1851. According to the Parrock Hall's crew lists, Richard's father James was the Steward on the 1849 and 1850 voyages so it is possible that Richard travelled with him as a boy but had no official duties on the ship. Additionally, the Captain Pivett referred to in the obituary was most likely Captain Trivett and he was the master of the vessel \\"Albemarle\\" and not the \\"Severn.\\" Finally, the obituary states that Richard's father died when he was only 12 months old and this appears to contradict much of the evidence that has been collected. Burial records in Poplar indicate that a James Gutteridge died aged 59 years in July 1839 but this would appear to be Richard's grandfather (also called James, born in 1781). Hence, it is possible that the obituary refers to the death of Richard's grandfather at a young age and not his father. The discrepancies are understandable given that the obituary was would have been written by one of Richard's children and not himself. Richard also suffered from senility in his final yearsRichard's death certificate (1934) so he may have had trouble recollecting the facts perfectly. Additionally, the oldest of Richard's children would have been in their 70s themselves so their own recollections would be questionable due to the passage of time. Nevertheless, the obituary provides rich biographical information that can be largely substantiated by the records of the day. =Children= Richard Guthridge and Eliza Pitts raised 13 children together and they now have hundreds of descendants across Australia and other parts of the world. Many of them had extremely long lives like their father. With an average of 78.6 yrs between them, the Guthridge family held the Western District's longevity record in 1950. Four of Richard's children lived into their 80s and four lived into their 90s, with two reaching the age of 99.

The festivities commenced with the firing of a cannon on the Portland foreshore by Jim Guthridge from Edenhope who, at the age of 85, was the oldest participant at the reunion. This was the final time a live cannon was fired in the State of Victoria. This was followed by a reenactment of Richard's arrival on the Portland foreshore. Sea cadets rowed a clinker boat from the TS Henty with three of Richard's great great grandchildren on board: James Richard Guthridge, 20; Rodney Guthridge, 32; and Erin Freame, 21. They landed on the foreshore to the sounds of bagpipes played by Jacqueline Holmes, another of Richard's descendants. Other highlights of the historic reunion included a vintage car parade, rides for attendees on Cobb & Co coaches, and an extensive photographic exhibition. A group photograph was taken in front of the historic Mac's Hotel which was built in 1855 and would have greeted Richard when he arrived in Portland 140 years earlier. The Portland Shire President Shirley Elliot unveiled a plaque commemorating Richard's arrival in and contributions to the embryonic State. In recognition of the contribution to the State of Victoria, Jeff Kennett AC MLC, the Premier of Victoria, unveiled a plaque on the Portland foreshore on 23 November 1998 dedicated to Richard.\\"The Standard\\" reported his visit on Tuesday, 24 November 1998; the \\"Portland Observer\\" reported the visit on Wednesday, 25 November 1998 In his speech, Kennett recognised Richard's role as one of the foremost settlers in the State of Victoria.

He is best known for the so-called Baines Note, a list of accusations against the poet and playwright Christopher Marlowe, which has been described by Paul Kocher as the \\"master key to the mind of Marlowe\\" and that \\"for revolutionary impact and scope it stands alone, an extraordinary document in the history of free thought\\".Paul Kocher, quoted by Roy Kendall in his Christopher Marlowe and Richard Baines: Journeys Through the Elizabethan Underground (based on his Ph.D. thesis with a similar title). Early life and education Nothing is known about where and when Baines was born, but 1554 would seem to be a reasonable estimate for the latter. The first mention we have of him is his matriculation in November 1568 as a pensioner at Christ's College, Cambridge. There was another Richard Baines, favoured by earlier biographers, who was at Oxford, but Kendall has convincingly argued that the Baines who was connected with Marlowe was the Cambridge one. Assuming that this was the right Richard Baines, he gained his BA (Bachelor of Arts) degree in 1573, commencing MA (i.e. being awarded the degree of Master of Arts) at Caius College, Cambridge, in 1576. Double agent The English College at Rheims in France was a Catholic seminary at which English Catholics studied for the priesthood, with the aim of returning covertly to England to provide Catholic clergy for those who still adhered to the \\"old religion\\" in what was now a Protestant country. Some would support action to return England to the Catholic faith, even if this entailed the assassination of its Protestant Queen, Elizabeth I. On 4 July 1579 Baines arrived at Rheims, being ordained a sub-deacon three years later on 25 March 1581, a deacon on 8 May, and a priest on 21 September that year. On 4 October 1581 he celebrated his first Mass as a priest. Unfortunately for him, however, he confided to a fellow-seminarist his rejection of the Catholic faith and his plans to return to England to report to the queen's spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham about the various plots being hatched in Rheims. In May 1582 he was imprisoned in Rheims town gaol, but a year later was back at the seminary, still a prisoner, where he wrote a lengthy confession of his offences.This included the possible intention to murder the members of the college by poisoning either the soup or its well, something which appeared‚Äîprobably not by coincidence‚Äîin Marlowe's play The Jew of Malta. It seems quite likely that he had in fact been an agent of Sir Francis Walsingham all along. Flushing Walsingham died in 1590, and Baines was next heard of in early 1592, when he was in Flushing, at that time an English possession in the Netherlands, apparently sharing a room with Christopher Marlowe. According to a letterhttp://www2.prestel.co.uk/rey/flushing.htm sent by the Governor, Sir Robert Sidney, to the Lord Treasurer, Lord Burghley, Baines accused Marlowe of having been involved in the counterfeiting of coins. Only one of these‚Äîa Dutch shilling made of pewter‚Äîhad been put into circulation ('uttered'), but some pieces of \\"Her Majesty's coin\\" had also been counterfeited, and this made it petty treason, a capital offence. Marlowe was sent back under guard to face Lord Burghley, but seems to have been released almost immediately, suggesting that whatever he was doing was on behalf of Burghley, and that Baines was unaware of this. Whether Baines was there on behalf of some rival faction of the Privy Council is a possibility, but at the moment unknowable. The Baines Note A year later, in May 1593, it seems that Baines was instrumental in getting the playwright Thomas Kyd wrongly accused of an offence for which he was imprisoned and tortured and shortly after this Baines was called upon, apparently by the Lord Keeper, Lord Puckering, to provide an account of what he knew of the heretical views of Christopher Marlowe. Seemingly relishing the task, he produced the so-called Baines NoteSee a transcript of the original at http://www2.prestel.co.uk/rey/baines1.htm which, with some amendment by Puckering,. For example, he removed the famous comment alleged to have been made by Marlowe, \\"that all they that love not Tobacco & Boys were fools\\". A transcript of the version eventually sent to her is at http://www2.prestel.co.uk/rey/baines3.htm was sent to the Queen. Before any action could be taken against Marlowe, however, an inquest reported him dead, stabbed in self-defence by Ingram Frizer‚Äîa man with whom he had been dining‚Äîin a dispute over payment of the bill or \\"reckoning\\".Discovered by Leslie Hotson in 1925, his translation of the inquisition is at http://www2.prestel.co.uk/rey/inquis~2.htm . A majority of Marlowe's more recent biographers have nevertheless expressed doubts about whether the inquest jury's finding was what really happened. Vicar or thief? It had been thought in the past that a Richard Baines who finished up as a vicar in Waltham, Lincolnshire, might have been the one described as Marlowe's nemesis. Roy Kendall, however, has persuasively argued that he was framed for a capital crime the following year by an unnamed man with whom he went drinking, a crime about which a ballad was even written. The details of the cup-stealing scene in Doctor Faustus between \\"Dick\\" and \\"Robin\\" in fact seem so similar to those of the Baines caseIn fact the name 'Rafe' in the \\"A text\\"‚Äîthought more likely to be nearer Marlowe's original‚Äîwas even changed to Baines's name \\"Dick\\" in the 1616 \\"B text\\". that it may well have been an addition made after 1594, in December of which year this Richard Baines was hanged at Tyburn.

Located north of the M4 motorway between junction 16 and Croft Road, Wichelstowe has three neighbourhoods: East, Middle and West Wichel. The development will comprise up to 4500 homes, employment space, public open space, shopping, community facilities for residents and various schools. In 2014 it was described as the country's largest housing project on public-owned land. History The medieval history of the site is reflected in the name: Wichel is the original name of the area as recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, and stowe is an Old English word meaning \\"meeting place\\". In 1995 the first proposals for the site were put forward for consideration by Wiltshire County Council as structure planning authority. The following year, the first public proposal for the site considered a comprehensive development to help meet Swindon's housing needs up to 2011. In 2001 Front Garden Action Group (FRAG) and Bloor Homes launched an unsuccessful High Court challenge against the Structure Plan and the green light was effectively given for Wichelstowe to go ahead. An extensive programme of public consultation was undertaken on the proposals by Taylor Woodrow and an outline planning application submitted in 2002. Infrastructure works commenced on site in 2006. The first home occupations in East Wichel took place in 2009. East Wichel homes Development Wichelstowe began as a collaboration between Swindon Borough Council and Taylor Wimpey to jointly provide and finance infrastructure. This agreement was re-shaped in the early part of 2009 into a new co-operation agreement; both parties now operate independently but in a mutually supportive way to develop the site. Taylor Wimpey continues with its responsibility to develop East Wichel, with Swindon Borough Council responsible for Middle and West Wichel. =East Wichel= East Wichel, the eastern quarter, is owned by Taylor Wimpey who operate independently with support from Swindon Borough Council. 830 homes are due for completion in this area of the development, and all development is expected to be finished by 2016. *Work on East Wichel commenced in 2008. *Construction was by Taylor Wimpey, Barratt, David Wilson Homes, Persimmon plc, and Bloor Homes. *The first home in East Wichel was occupied in April 2009. *East Wichel Community Primary School opened in July 2011. *A Marston's pub/restaurant called The Bayberry opened in 2012. =Middle and West Wichel= All development land in this area is currently owned by Swindon Borough Council. The council will form an equal joint venture partnership with a successful bidder for the residential development of 3600 homes, 12 hectares of employment land and a new District Centre, after a bidder is chosen in 2014. A Waitrose supermarket, in Middle Wichel, opened its doors to the public in 2014. alt= Governance East Wichel is part of Central Swindon South civil parish, and the first tier of local government is South Swindon Parish Council. Middle and West Wichel are part of Wroughton civil parish, and the first tier of local government is Wroughton Parish Council. The local authority is Swindon Borough Council, a unitary authority. Wichelstowe forms part of the council's South Locality, alongside Old Town, Wroughton, Chiseldon and Lawn, and Ridgeway wards. Press =2014= :Waitrose, in Middle Wichel, opened its doors to the public in April 2014 after a 20-year wait for the right location to set up in Swindon. The store could provide an estimated 230 jobs in the area. A proportion of the population of water voles on site were re-homed in the River Meon in Hampshire. It is expected that once canal-side works are finished, nearby water voles will recolonise the stretch of canal, leaving no long-term impact here. =2013= :Revisions to the original Wichelstowe plans were made by Swindon Borough Council, to retain an increased number of hedgerows, mature trees and landscape contours. Re-alignment of proposed Croft Road/Hay Lane link road to bring more vitality to the planned District Centre and reduce traffic headed to Wroughton. Change to the trigger point for certain infrastructure and an emphasis on walkable neighbourhoods; ensuring facilities can be reached on foot from all directions. The commitment to large areas of green public open space is retained. =2011= :One kilometre of newly restored or new canal was completed in East Wichel, one of the longest sections of canal built anywhere in England in recent years. The project, in cooperation with the Wilts & Berks Canal Trust, received a commendation in the Partnership category and runner-up in Masterplanning in the Waterways Renaissance Awards. :Before the opening of the new roads there were complaints about Swindon Borough Council leaving lights on while the site was uninhabited, while on the other hand supposedly saving money by switching off lights on other main roads in Swindon.

It is located off Rocks Lane on Barnes Common. History The cemetery was established in 1854 on two acres of sandy ground purchased by the Church of England for the sum of ¬£10. A chapel, lodge and landscaping were provided at a further cost of ¬£1,400. The cemetery functioned as an additional burial ground to the local parish churchyard. It was well-used and a number of distinguished Victorians were buried there, with a variety of monuments and statues erected to their memory. At the centre of the cemetery is a large memorial to the Hedgman family, who were local benefactors in Barnes. The cemetery was claimed to be haunted by a ghostly nun that would hover over the grave of Julia Martha Thomas, the victim of an infamous murder in 1879. In 1966 the cemetery was acquired by the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames with the intention of turning it into a lawn cemetery, a grass-covered area where each grave is marked with a commemorative plaque rather than standing memorials. The council demolished the chapel and lodge and removed the boundary railings to prepare the cemetery for its new role. However, it then dropped the plans and effectively abandoned the cemetery. Ebenezer Cobb Morley's grave Memorial to William Hedgman at Barnes Cemetery Over the next thirty years or so, the site was subject to considerable damage and vandalism to graves and monuments. However, within the past decade, the site has seen significant change. No longer neglected, much thought and care now goes into the management of this beautiful old cemetery. Indeed, its resultant ‚Äògothic charm‚Äô and evocative light levels that have been enhanced by selective thinning and conservation work, make it a popular site for local art and film students. The overgrown nature of today's cemetery provides a valuable sanctuary for birds and other fauna. With good feeding grounds all around, many native birds and summer visitors breed in the cemetery, including thrushes, wrens, tits, finches, blackcap, chiff chaff, willow warbler, goldcrest while others migrate through. Some of the original planting is still in evidence: large specimens of Yew, Cedar, Holly, Holm Oak, Pines and Wych Elm. Many of these have produced thickets of seedlings and saplings. There are also native deciduous trees such as Oak, Ash and Birch, and bird-sown shrubs such as Elder. In some of the more open glades you can see pretty herbaceous species like Herb Robert, Ox-eye Daisy and Foxglove. For its part, Richmond upon Thames Council describes the cemetery as an \\"atmospheric and romantic place\\" with \\"an evocative atmosphere of decay and seclusion\\".

He was twice elected Mayor of Monmouth. Biography Heath was born in 1761 in Hurcott, near Kidderminster in Worcestershire, to a family who owned paper mills in the area. He went to school in Hartlebury before training as a printer in Nottingham. He set out on his own in 1791, and established a printing business in the county town of Monmouth. This was the second printing press in Monmouthshire, following one set up in Pontypool in 1740. Heath wrote and published a number of books on antiquarian subjects, and the topography and sights of the Wye Valley, which at the time was a popular location for tours by boat and carriage. He was an acquaintance of Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and in 1801 presented a copy of his Excursion down the Wye to Viscount Nelson and Emma Hamilton when they visited the town. All his topographical books went through several editions.

Heath came to prominence in 1813 when he was amongst the leaders of a popular movement against the Dukes of Beaufort who controlled the town and the election for \\"Monmouth Boroughs\\". This constituency included not only Monmouth but also Newport and Usk. They had manoeuvred the electorate down from over 2,000 a hundred years before to one of about 250 by 1813. At that election Henry Somerset, the Marquis of Worcester was elected and Heath was moved to action. The election of Henry Somerset was the third consecutive M.P. from the Somerset family. Heath, together with Hezekiah Swift, a local timber merchant, employed Henry Brougham as counsel and Herbert Harris as attorney and they challenged the result of the election. He was elected Mayor of Monmouth of his adopted town in 1819 and 1821.Charles Heath, Dictionary of Welsh Biography, accessed January 2012 The mayor who followed him in 1822 was his 1813 partner, Hezekiah Swift. Heath died on New Year's Day in 1831 aged 69 although some report his death as 30 December 1830. A monument was not placed on his grave until 25 years later, but that memorial outside St Mary's Priory Church is now a listed building.

Gessmann developed and has taught humanistic psychodrama since 1979 as a new form of psychodrama. It became an integral part of humanistic psychology. Gessmann moved the collective action and nature of the people at the center of the therapeutic ethic. Faith, love, hope, and the idea of a human community are essential to meaningful humanistic psychodrama. Intuitive look for detecting the wholeness of a thing, the dialectical conception of polarities, the renunciation of absolute authority, take decisive influence on the image and life of man. The goals and methods of classical psychodrama were necessarily re-evaluated and described. This led to a fundamental change in international psychodrama practice. Gessmann is a member of the American Society of Group Psychotherapy and Psychodrama as well as the International Association of Group Psychotherapy and Psychodrama since 1977. Gessmann teaches clinical psychology in the faculty of social psychology of the Kostroma (KSU) since 2007 and is a professor of general and developmental psychology in the governmental Academy of Social Administration Moscow (ASOU).

After finishing her studies at the University of Montreal, she made her first film, a short entitled Moi, un jour... for Expo 67. The film was well received and enabled her to move to London, England to attend the Royal College of Art. She obtained her master's degree in Film and Television and made another short film, Compromise, which won first prize at the 1969 Great Britain Student Film Festival. Dansereau worked a variety of jobs - researcher, script assistant, sound recorder - before returning to Quebec. There, she co-founded L‚ÄôAssociation Coop√©rative des Productions Audio-visuelles (ACPAV) and became the first woman in Quebec to direct a fiction feature film in the private sector; the film, La vie r√™v√©e (1971) was produced by the ACPAV and became a landmark that received a wide theatrical release and national critical acclaim. She joined the NFB following her success and directed 2 feature documentaries for the En tant que femmes Series, J'me marie, j'me marie pas (1973) and Famille et variations (1977). She returned to the private sector to direct her next fiction feature, L'Arrache-Coeur (1979), a bleak, and penetrating examination of a marriage in crisis which earned Dansereau a Genie Award for Best Screenplay nomination, and Le Sourd dans la ville (1987), a dark, disturbing and experimental adaptation of Marie-Claire Blais's novel centered on a rooming house.

Construction began on 17 April 1565 in order to build a church for the Order of Knights of St Stephan, founded by the Grand Duke Cosimo de' Medici to fight Saracen piracy in the Mediterranean. The project with designs and oversight by Giorgio Vasari and David Fortini was to build a church on the site of an older church called San Sebastiano alle Fabbriche Maggiori, which dated at least to 1074. The new church on the site was consecrated by 21 December 1569. The facade, in white marble was designed by Don Giovanni de' Medici, illegitimate son of Cosimo I, with the help of Alessandro Pieroni; their designs were chosen over Vasari‚Äôs original plan. An inscription commemorates completion during the reign of Ferdinando I de' Medici. The bell-tower, also designed by Vasari, was completed by 1572 by Giovanni Fancelli. The main altar designs were by Pier Francesco Silvani. Many alterations and additions were proposed and made over the next two centuries, including plans by Gherardo Mechini, Paolo Guidotti, Ranieri Gherardi, Torp√® Donati, Alessandro Gherardesca, Florido Galli, Niccol√≤ Matas, and Pasquale Poccianti. The final reconstruction in 1859, completed after the suppression of the order, creates the clearer interior systematization of columns we see today. Interior Bronzino, Birth of Christ The church display numerous trophy banners, captured during naval encounters with Saracen pirates. The font for holy water (1568) was sculpted by Giovanni Fancelli, based on designs by Vasari. In the counterfacade are five monochrome paintings of Stories of St Stefano Pope and Martyr, including one celebrating the entrance of Ferdinando I on 31 March 1588. This grand-duke was to commission the wooden ceiling by Bartolomeo Atticciati (1604). The Ceiling has six paintings on wood depicting episodes historic events in which the military order was active, including the Granting of uniforms by Cosimo I de' Medici by il Cigoli, the Return of the Fleet from the Battle of Lepanto and Sacking of Prevesa by Jacopo Ligozzi, The embarcation at Livorno of Maria de' Medici by Allori, Victory in the Greek Archipelago and Capture of Bona by l'Empoli, Detail of the wooden ceiling The polychrome pulpit (1627) was completed by Chiarissimo Fancelli. It contains paintings by the Pisan Aurelio Lomi of Madonna and child with Saints Joseph and Stefano (1593) and a painting of the palace of the Order. The Main altar (1702‚Äì1709) in the presbytery was designed and sculpted by Giovanni Battista Foggini with a statue of St Stefano Pope and allegorical figures of Religion and Faith, and on the bronze throne, a relief with the Decapitation of St Stefano. At the right is a painting by Giorgio Vasari, with the Entombment of St Stefano (1571), while at the right is a Birth of Christ (1564) by Bronzino. In the Sacristy is a sculptural group by Foggini of St Stefano and the allegory of Reason and the Trinity (1683), made in occasion of the translation of the body of the saint to this church in 1682. The chapel of the Holy Sacrament was completed in 1837 by Florido Galli. Organ There are three organs in the church, the first from 1571 by the Cortonese organ-maker Onofrio Zeffirini. On the left is an organ by the Sienese Azzolino Bernardino della Ciaja reconstructed in 1733. In 1931, Giovanni Tamburini builds a new organ behind the 1733 organ. The modern organ is the only functioning one in the church.

A tile-matching video game is a type of video game where the player manipulates tiles in order to make them disappear according to a matching criterion.The definition proposed by Juul (2007). In many tile-matching games, that criterion is to place a given number of tiles of the same type so that they adjoin each other. That number is often three, and these games are called match-three games.Juul (2009) p. 100 The core challenge of tile-matching games is the identification of patterns on a seemingly chaotic board. Their origins lie in late 1980s games such as Tetris, Chain Shot! (SameGame) and Puzznic. Tile-matching games were made popular in the 2000s, in the form of casual games distributed or played over the Internet, notably the Bejeweled series of games.Juul (2007) They have remained popular since, with the game Candy Crush Saga becoming the most-played game on Facebook in 2013.San Francisco Chronicle Thursday, March 28, 2013 Business Report \\"Tech Chronicles\\" Page C2 Tile-matching games cover a broad range of design elements, mechanics and gameplay experiences. They include purely turn-based games but may also feature arcade-style action elements such as time pressure, shooting or hand-eye coordination. The tile matching mechanic is also a minor feature in some larger games. Video game researcher Jesper Juul therefore considers tile matching to be a game mechanic, rather than a distinct genre of games.Juul (2009) p. 84 History The mechanism of matching game pieces to make them disappear is a feature of many non-digital games, including Mahjong solitaire and Solitaire card games.Juul (2009) p. 98 Jesper Juul traces the history of tile-matching video games back to Tetris and Chain Shot!, published in 1984 and 1985. While both focus on pattern matching, they differ in important design points such as time pressure, tile manipulation and match criteria. A second generation of influential matching games ‚Äì Puzznic, Columns, Dr. Mario and Plotting ‚Äì was published in 1989 and 1990. Another early Mahjong-style pair matching game was Shanghai (1986). SameGame was released in 1985 and has since been ported to many platforms Games building on Dr. Mario's mechanics include Puyo Puyo (1991), Baku Baku Animal (1995) and Puzzle Fighter (1996). Building on the shooting mechanic introduced in Plotting, Dr. Mario also influenced Puzzle Bobble (1994), which in turn inspired Puzz Loop (1998), Hexic and Zuma (2004), and Luxor (2005). Columns was the basis of a line of development of tile matching games based on shifting or swapping tiles. It includes Yoshi's Cookie (1992) and Panel de Pon (1995), which introduced the swapping mechanic. Magic Jewelry followed in 1990. Puzzled included multiplayer games and was released for the Neo Geo console in the same year. 1994 saw BreakThru! and Gururin published with FlipOut! and Vid Grid released the following year. Hebereke's Popoitto was released in 1995 containing a two player competitive game. Sega Swirl for handheld devices was released in 1999. Microsoft bundled Jawbreaker Windows Mobile 2003. Several multiplayer modes, both local and networked, featured in early tile-matching games such as Columns and Dr. Mario and later with TetriNET (1997) and Tetris Worlds (2001). Multiplayer introduced elements of race and competition as players were able to attacks opponents in various ways resulting in more difficult matchmaking for their opponent. The first of what eventually became known as \\"match-three\\" games, where the goal is to create clusters of three or more identical items on a grid, was Shariki (1994). It led directly to the successful Bejeweled (2000), which became a series and inspired similar games including Zoo Keeper (2003), Big Kahuna Reef (2004), Jewel Quest (2004), and Chuzzle (2005). Tidalis (2010) developed the idea further with 20 game modes and the goal of creating the longest possible chain of matching colors. Frozen Bubble Towards 2010, new trends in tile- matching games appeared. The first was driven by the popularity of mobile games. Prior to 2012, most tile-matching games had no end goal, instead challenging the player to continue as long as possible until the board reached a state where no turn was possible, or, in the case of Tetris, where tiles have filled up past a given point on the board. King, which had made similar tile-matching games for browser-based games, explored a different approach with its first mobile app, Bubble Witch Saga, which had puzzle-oriented gameplay like Puzzle Bobble, but applied finite restrictions on the number of moves the player could take and setting target goals such as score or clearing the board. This enabled them to create numerous levels that could be completed in a short time, making the game ideal for mobile players, and apply a microtransaction model to provide players temporary boosts and power-ups for more difficult levels. This approach proved highly successful and King reused it for the tile-matching game Candy Crush Saga in 2012, itself which was inspired by Bejeweled. Candy Crush Saga became one of the most financially successful mobile games, and established a new type of tile-matching game based on creating games broken up into levels and establishing goals to reach within a limited number of moves. This \\"saga\\" approach also extended to other genres of mobile games. The second innovation in tile-matching games was the incorporation of their mechanic into other genres. One of the first such games was Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords released in 2008. While based on a Bejeweled-like tile-matching game, Puzzle Quest added elements of a computer role-playing game atop this. The player would take turns against a computer opponent, making matches on a common game board, with the types of tiles matched representing role-playing game elements like attacks, defense, and magic which the player used to battle their current enemy, the larger game component had the player improve their character and obtain gear that improved the value of the tiles they matched or created special effects on the tile board, such as removing all tiles of a specific type. Puzzle Quest was very popular and led to numerous games which uses the tile-matching as part of a battle system. While not directly influenced by Puzzle Quest, Puzzle & Dragons in 2012 was another successful mobile title that used the tile-matching part of the game for combat-related actions. Both Push Panic and Heroes of Kalevala arrived in 2010. In 2011 New Puzzle Bobble was released for iOS while Bubble Safari, Ruby Blast, Gems with Friends and Puzzle & Dragons were first released in 2012. Juice Cubes, Tower of Saviors, Alien Hive, Marvel Puzzle Quest, Jelly Splash and Doctor Who: Legacy were released for mobile devices from 2013 onwards. In 2015 Dragon Ball Z: Dokkan Battle, Ironcast, HuniePop, Hex Frvr and Sailor Moon Drops were all released. By 2016 millions of players were logging into titles such as Gardenscapes: New Acres. The genre continues to appeal to gamers, with numerous titles including Boost Beast (2017) and Dr. Mario World, Tetris 99 and Crystal Crisis (2019) among the more recent. Many casual tile matching games continue to be published. Their development is characterized by gradual evolution, where new games makes only small changes, if any, to a formula known from previous games.Juul (2009) p. 92 In the highly competitive market for downloadable casual games, new entries must be familiar enough to appeal to players of earlier games, but innovative enough to differentiate the new game from earlier ones. This leads to developers, according to Juul, \\"simultaneously trying to out-innovate and out-clone each other\\".Juul (2009) p. 94 Features Tile-matching games that are set in a fictional background are normally based in a \\"bright and positive\\" fiction, as opposed to the warlike background of strategy games or the fantasy background of massively multiplayer games.Juul (2009) p. 67 Tile matching game mechanics have been combined with other mechanics to produce a great variety of puzzle game experiences. This section discusses a number of these mechanics. =Gameplay limitations= Early tile-matching games like Tetris were timed ‚Äì that is, new tiles are continuously added and the player is under pressure to make matches before the board fills up. The rate of tile addition often increased as to make for a more difficult challenge in longer games. Untimed (turn-based) games, in which new tiles are added only after the player has made a move, used to be the exception, although the 1985 game Chain Shot! already had an untimed mode. In untimed modes, the player is able to continue to make matches until they reach an unplayable state, in which case the game is considered over. The addition of an untimed mode to Bejeweled! was integral to that game's success, as well as one of its most important influences on subsequent games, as it made the game more accessible to less skilled players. With the introduction of Candy Crush Saga, games with levels featuring limits on the number of moves were introduced. In this, the player may be challenged to achieve a certain score, or match enough tiles of a specific color before running out of turns, or otherwise would have to complete the level again. =Tile arrangement, manipulation and matching= Tiles may be arranged on a horizontal surface or vertically (that is, stacked atop one another, and dropping down when tiles below are removed). In the latter case, some games allow moving or rotating new tiles as they fall down from the top of the playing area, as in Tetris or Dr. Mario; or they may allow only the manipulation of tiles that have already fallen, as in Yoshi's Cookie. Panel de Pon introduced, and Bejeweled popularized the mechanism of tile swapping, in which tiles may be moved by exchanging the position of two adjacent tiles. Another frequently used tile manipulation method is having the player shoot the tiles onto the board, such as in Plotting and its descendants including Zuma. The first method, which allows only moves that create a match, results in a more strategic, thoughtful style of play, whereas the second method requires hand-eye coordination in addition to pattern recognition skills, and makes for a more hectic style of play. Tetris and its derivatives are somewhat unusual in that they feature irregularly shaped tiles composed of squares, which match with all other tiles no matter what their color is. In other games, the tiles are most often uniformly square or round, and are distinguished for the purpose of matching by color or some other decoration. This shifts the game's focus towards pattern recognition and away from the act of manipulating the tiles. Tetris's matching criterion of filling a full line on the board has not been taken up by most other tile-matching games. In most games, a match occurs when a given number (often three) or more tiles of the same type adjoin each other. At that time, they are removed from the board. A great number of gameplay variations are possible by introducing special tiles that behave differently, such as by being indestructible, or by destroying surrounding tiles when involved in a match. =Scoring= In most tile- matching games, players obtain points for each match. Higher scores are awarded for more difficult matches, such as those involving a greater number of similar tiles. In some tile games, when tiles are matched and removed, pieces above them fall to fill the space (as with Bejeweled and Candy Crush Saga). This creates the potential for additional matches and creating scoring combos, with all subsequent matches scored at higher point values. =Victory and loss= Some games drop tiles at random, others according to algorithms. In most tile-matching games, new tiles are randomly added to the board continuously, either turn by turn or in real time. This may continue indefinitely or for a given period of time or number of turns. The player must continuously remove the newly added tiles through matching. The game may end with a loss when the board is filled with tiles or if there are no more possible matches. It may end with a victory when the player clears the board or reaches a given score. Significance Among downloadable casual video games, according to a survey referred to by Juul, tile-matching games were the second most popular game type in 2004 and by far the most popular in 2005. After that, their popularity declined: they were the fourth most popular of several genres in 2006 and 2007, and in 2008 a games publisher referred to them as a \\"niche\\" genre.Juul (2009) p. 100; making reference to data from casualcharts.com for the \\"match3\\" and \\"chainpopper\\" mechanics as tracked by \\"popular portals\\" (footnote 52) But as they became well known and therefore assumed to be immediately playable by many people, tile-matching games migrated to other, more ubiquitous distribution channels such as cell phones and smartphones.Juul (2009) p. 100 Despite their commercial popularity, tile- matching games are among the games with the lowest status among video game enthusiasts, to the point where reviewers have advised gamers not to be ashamed of playing them. This may be because critics consider that there are too many of these games, which differ only slightly from each other. It may also be because, as casual games, tile-matching games are designed to be easily accessible and easy to play, which conflicts with a traditional video gaming ethos that demands games to be challenging and punishing.Juul (2009) p. 85 Computational complexity Match-three games are NP-hard when generalized to an n √ó n playfield and played such that the player knows in advance all the tiles that will appear, with no random chance involved. In particular, it is NP-hard to determine: * Is there a sequence of moves that allows the player to match a specific tile? * Can the player get a score of at least x? * Can the player get a score of at least x in less than k moves? * Can the player cause at least x tiles to match? * Can the player play for at least x turns?

It stands beside the B5569 which was formerly the A556 road between the M6 and the M56 but was bypassed by the new A556 road to the west in 2017. It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Knutsford, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield, and the diocese of Chester. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History St Paul's was built between 1853 and 1855 for Revd Joseph Horder at a cost of ¬£1,316 (). It was designed by Anthony Salvin. The land was given by the Langford-Brooke family of nearby Mere Hall, and the foundation stone was laid by Thomas William Langford-Brooke. The completed church was consecrated on 18 March 1855, but later that year it was severely damaged by a fire. It was restored, following Salvin's plans, and re-opened in 1856. Architecture and furnishings =Exterior= The church is constructed in sandstone, with slate roofs. Its architectural style is Early English. The plan consists of a three-bay nave, a north aisle, a two-bay chancel at a lower level, and a north vestry. At the west end is a square bellcote with shingle side and a hexagonal roof. On the gables are cross finials of differing designs. =Interior= The interior walls of the church are plastered. Inside the church is an elaborate rood screen carved by F. H. Crossley in 1908; it is thought that more of the carvings in the church were executed by him. These include those on the chancel roof including depictions of badgers (representing the Langford-Brooke family) and swans (representing Over Tabley). The stained glass in the east window and the south windows in the chancel is in memory of Thomas William Langford-Brooke. They were designed by Henry James Salisbury and date from about 1884. The west window is in memory of Henry Langford-Brooke and depicts Saint Peter and Saint Paul. In the nave are two windows by Christopher Whall dating from about 1900. The original organ had been built in 1855 by Kirtland and Jardine, but it was replaced by an electronic organ in 1957. External features In the churchyard is a monument that is included in the listing. It is the sandstone chest tomb of Henry Langford-Brooke, carved by Macdonald and Eric Gill in about 1909. It includes the representation of a stylised tree, and text in Gill Sans lettering.

It was established subscriber stations and base stations for communicating with them. Technical information From the technical standpoint \\"Altai\\" was fairly ordinary UHF/VHF trunked radio, but it was equipped with the automatic switching circuits on both mobile and static nodes that allowed the mobile end of the link to generate and transmit dialing signals and to connect the static end to the PSTN. Few initial installations used 150 MHz frequency, but as the network grew the later iterations switched to 330 MHz. Base stations have had up to 22 independent trunks of 8 channels each, and were commonly mounted together with the TV transmitters, sometimes even sharing the HF circuitry.

It was founded in 1953 and its official journal is the Annals of Clinical Biochemistry. The association is a full, national society member of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine IFCC as well as a full member of the regional European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine. History Founded as the Association of Clinical Biochemists, the association has evolved as biochemistry has changed with advances in laboratory medicine. Recognizing an increasing number of medical members, the name was changed in 2005 to Association for Clinical Biochemistry. In 2007 the \\"Association of Clinical Scientists in Immunology\\" merged with the ACB. The membership expanded in 2010 with the merger with the \\"Association of Clinical Microbiologists\\". The broader nature of the membership contributed to the renaming of the ACB to its current name at the annual meeting in 2013. Clinical concerns The ACB is responsible for determining the specific content for courses related to certification as a clinical biochemist in the UK. Normally this is a three or four year academic sequence followed by qualification examinations. Because of the competitive admission criteria, many applicants have advanced degrees before beginning the biochemistry program.* Papers published by ACB members are related to the use of laboratories by doctors and patient health diagnostic testing in the UK. * Blood draw procedures and tests by junior doctors and nurses in the A&E; department of a Birmingham hospital were frequently performed with the wrong collection equipment or were mishandled afterward. The College of Emergency Medicine said the issue identified by the audit at Birmingham is \\"universally relevant\\". * A 2008 study emphasized issues with junior doctors who were not being trained in pathology and laboratory testing. Eighteen percent of junior doctors in the sample were not confident they could interpret the results of tests they ordered for patients. More than 70% felt a need for more training in clinical biochemistry. The ACB was part of a 2008 effort by a consortium to support a Scottish government initiative aimed at emphasizing the need for quality laboratory services to the practice of medicine.

The ecosystem may have been stopped from reaching its full climatic climax or deflected towards a different climax by activities such as: * Cutting down the existing vegetation * Burning as a means of forest clearance * Planting trees or crops * Grazing and trampling by domesticated animals * Harvesting of planted crops These are known as disturbances, or arresting factors. In each case, human activity has led to a community which is not the climax community expected in such an area. If the human activity continues, the community will be held in a stable position and further succession will not occur until the human activity ceases. Examples An example may be in a beach dune system where the impact of the human race has caused footpath erosion to occur, affecting the vegetation so that feet trampling on the dune plants eventually destroys them. The uplands of Northern England were once covered by deciduous woodland. Some heather would have been present, but in relatively small amounts. Gradually the forests were removed during the early Middle Ages for timber and fuel purposes, and to create space for agricultural activities. The soil deteriorated as a result and heather came to dominate the plant community. Sheep grazing was the major form of agriculture in the area at the time and the sheep prevented the re-growth of woodland by destroying any young saplings. In more recent times the process of controlled burning of the heather has taken place. The heather is burnt after 15 years of its life cycle before it becomes mature and allows colonisation of the area by other plants. The ash adds to the soil fertility and the new growth that results increase the productivity of the ecosystem and provides the sheep with a more nutritious diet than is provided by the elder heather. This controlled burning maintains a plant community which is not the climatic climax of the area, and is therefore a plagioclimax. In Studland Heath in Dorset, England, the management agency prevents the climax community (in this case trees) becoming established. At Studland the aim is to keep the area as heathland, so that the small reptiles that inhabit the dune system continue to survive. If the area is allowed to develop naturally into woodland, the reptiles would be replaced by other species of animals.

Life and death  Bell was born in 1783, it is thought in Newcastle, and was a printer, sometime surveyor, collector (or probably more correctly, an obsessive hoarder) of anything and everything, but particularly to do with the music that was popular at the time. Bell followed the precedent set by Joseph Ritson, an eminent and eccentric scholar from Stockton, was probably one of (if not the) first to set down some of the local dialect songs popular in the day. He published a series of ‚ÄúNorthern Garlands‚Äù in 1793 which contained among others ‚ÄúThe Collier's Rant‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Keel Row‚Äù, ‚ÄúBobby Shaftoe‚Äù and ‚ÄúElsie Marle.‚Äù Bell followed close behind, but adopted a more organised and professional approach. His many sources ranged from the rich and famous down to the characters of the Newcastle Quayside. His book ‚ÄúRhymes of Northern Bards‚Äù was published in 1812. It included ‚ÄúBobby Shaftoe‚Äù, ‚ÄúBuy Broom Besoms‚Äù, ‚ÄúWater of Tyne‚Äù, ‚ÄúDollia‚Äù, but with very few mining themed songs except ‚ÄúThe Collier's Pay Week\\", ‚ÄùFooty Agin the Wall‚Äù and ‚ÄúByker Hill‚Äù. There appears to be no logic or method behind the selection of the lyrics, except that they were all local dialect, as it covers a wide range of topics including politics, history, crimes, local characters, work and pleasure. Bell had added notes which two hundred years later are historically very interesting and important. Bell died in 1864.  Rhymes of Northern Bards  The front cover of the book was as thus :- Rhymes Of Northern Bards: being a curious Collection of old and new Songs And Poems, Peculiar to the Counties of Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland, & Durham. Edited by John Bell, Jun. ‚ÄúNorthumbria‚Äôs sons stand forth, by all confest ‚ÄúThe first and firmest of fair freedom‚Äôs train; ‚ÄúEach brave Northumbrian Nurses in his breast ‚ÄúThe sacred spoark, unsullied by a stain.‚Äù Newcastle upon Tyne: (printed in an old English style) Printed for John Bell, by M. Angus & Son, and sold by them, and other Booksellers in Town. MDCCCXII  Legacy  John Bell's part in local history is secure due to the vast amount of material from books, broadsheets, chap books and notated songs he published. His company eventually went bankrupt in 1856 and the collection was split, although many items went to another collector, Robert White, and some have ended up in the collection of Newcastle University. In 1813, acting on an idea put forward by Bell, the Newcastle Society of Antiquaries was founded. It held its first meeting at the Turks's Head, believed to have been located in the large listed building in Grey Street.

Ironically, in an era of grunge and the MTV Unplugged trends, Cale became immersed in electronics and synthesizers. ‚ÄúI did the unplugged, live kind of thing in the ‚Äò70‚Äôs and the ‚Äò80‚Äôs,‚Äù he told one interviewer. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve gone to the other direction now that all that‚Äôs become popular.

The presiding deity is KundalaKaraneswarar, a form of the Hindu god Shiva and his consort Bala Tripura Sundari. This place is also referred to as ThiruKurakkukka or Thiru KoranguKukka .  Legends  =Ramayana (Yuddha Kandam : Vanquishing of Ravana by Lord Rama= thumb After Lord Rama vanquished Ravana in the battle of Ramayana, he returned to Ayodhya to be crowned King. Ravana, although a personification of evil, had acquired his immense powers through years of penance and devotion to Lord Shiva Hence while Lord Rama vanquished the evil that Ravana represented, he had at the same time also vanquished a devout Bhakt of Lord Shiva. To atone for killing a devotee of Lord Shiva, regardless of the justification, Lord Rama was advised to pay obeisance to Lord Shiva at Rameshwaram in South Tamil Nadu, within 2 days of the victory. His devotee Lord Hanuman was assigned the task of finding a linga suitable for the atonement-rituals. He was to be accompanied by Jatayu in his search. Lord Hanuman and Jatayu searched high and low before finding one in Northern India, near present-day Kashi. However they found it difficult to get their hands onto the lingam as it was guarded by Lord Kala Bhairava, another incarnation of Lord Shiva. A battle ensued between Lord Hanuman and Lord Kala Bhairavar with the former finally prevailing. Back in Rameshwaram, time was running out. With no sign of Lord Hanuman or Jatayu, Lord Rama advised his consort Lord Sita to prepare a lingam out of the sea sand nearby. She did so, and this was used for the atonement rituals. As the rituals were coming to a close, Lord Hanuman was sighted with the lingam in hand. However, on noticing that the rituals were completed without his presence, he was extremely disappointed. He tried prevailing on Lord Rama to use the lingam procured by him, for the rituals, instead of the one constructed by Lord Sita. In a bid to appease him Lord Rama suggested that if that were to be done, Lord Hanuman would have to move aside the lingam constructed by Lord Sita and place the lingam brought by him, in its place. As hard as Lord Hanuman tried, he could not move the lingam. Finally he tried to wrap his tail around it and yank it off the ground. The force he applied was so great that the lingam did get uprooted, but landed a few miles away from Rameshwaram in a place called Hanuman Pallam (pit created by Lord Hanuman). In the process, his tail got separated from his body. Lord Hanuman realized his folly. It was pre-ordained that the lingam prepared by Lord Sita was to be used for the rituals and sought forgiveness from Lord Rama and Sita to regrow his tail. Lord Rama suggested to Lord Hanuman that he seek forgiveness from Lord Shiva instead and suggested that Lord Hanuman visit Thirukurungaval and worship Lord Shiva there to get back his tail. Hence the place has acquired its name, Tirukurunkaval (Place where Lord Shiva was worshipped by a monkey-faced God) The testimony to this story is that it is one of the few Lord Shiva temples in the world, with a shrine to Lord Hanuman facing Lord Shiva. Finally Lord Hanuman Understood that lord Rama is great devotee of lord Shiva http://www.vedagnana.org/Content/Temples/List/1099_Kurakkukka.php =Temple= Kuntaleswarar temple is located near the well known Vaideeswaran Koyil.

Shiva (Aparadha Kshameswarar) is said to have blessed Hanuman at Karuppariyalur, and Hanuman is believed to have built a temple for Shiva at Kurakkukka nearby. Lord Hanuman is said to have offered his Kundalams (ear rings) to Lord Shiva here, hence goes the name of the deity, Kundalakaraneshwarar. It is said that even to this day, a pack of monkeys enter the sanctum in the summer months of Chittirai and Vaikasi making offerings of flowers or Blilva leaves to the deity.http://www.templenet.com/Tamilnadu/s099.html This is also one of the five Kaavus, though much less visited today: The other four are ‚Äì Thirukkodikkaa in Thirukkodikaaval, Thirukkolakkaa (Osai Kodutta Nayaki temple, Sirkazhi), Thirunellikkaa (near Thiruvarur) and Thiruvaanaikkaa (Trichy).https://www.dharisanam.com/temples/sri-kodeeswarar-temple-at- thirukkodikkaval The temple has a shrine to Lord Kundalakaraneshwarar (Lord Shiva), his consort, the Ambal Kuntalalambika or Sri Elasowndari Ambal or Bala Tripura Sundari, and Lord Anjaneya. Lord Anjaneya's shrine faces that of Lord Shiva.

Well known for her work sculpting in the medium of butter, she also worked with more traditional materials such as marble. Early life Caroline Shawk was born on April 28, 1840 in Cincinnati, Ohio. Her father, Abel Shawk, manufactured fire engines and steam locomotives, and invented a fire engine ‚Äì the first successful one which was powered by steam. She showed her artistic talents as a young child, enjoying painting and drawing. Her first sculpting project, modeled in clay from a creek, was Dante's head. At the age of twelve, she won a medal for her wax flowers. She graduated from the St. Louis Normal School in 1862, and later that year married railroad worker Samuel H. Brooks. The Brookses initially lived in Memphis, Tennessee, where Samuel's railroad job was located. They later lived in Mississippi for a short time, before moving in 1866 to a farm near Helena, in Phillips County, Arkansas. The couple had one child, a daughter named Mildred. Butter sculpting Brooks was the first known American sculptor working in the medium of butter, and she would come to be identified as \\"The Butter Woman\\". In 1867, she created her first butter sculpture, when, after the failure of the farm's cotton crop, she sought a source of supplemental income. Farm women of the time often created decoratively shaped butter using butter molds, but rather than molding, Brooks sculpted the butter into shapes such as shells, animals, and faces. Rather than traditional sculpting tools, she used \\"common butter-paddles, cedar sticks, broom straws and camel's-hair pencils\\". Her customers appreciated the skillfully sculpted butter, and there was a good market for her works. She continued producing her butter sculptures for about a year and a half, then took a break from it for a few years. She resumed making butter art in 1873, when she created a bas-relief portrait, which she donated to a church fair. Her husband safely transported it, on horseback, the seven miles to the fair. The sale of the portrait earned the church enough money to fix their roof. A Memphis man who saw Brooks's work there admired it so much that he arranged for her to create a butter portrait, of Mary, Queen of Scots, to be displayed in his offices. Dreaming Iolanthe, butter sculpture, 1876 Centennial Exhibition In late 1873 Brooks read King Ren√©'s Daughter, a verse drama by Danish poet and playwright Henrik Hertz. In the story, the character of Iolanthe is a princess who is blind, but does not understand the nature of this condition because her parents had hidden the truth from her. She came to realize that she was blind on her sixteenth birthday. Brooks was inspired by this character, and created a butter sculpture, Dreaming Iolanthe, depicting the innocent girl just before learning the truth. This work was displayed in early 1874 at a Cincinnati gallery, to financial and critical success. During its two-week exhibition, about two thousand people paid admission to view it. An article appearing in The New York Times declared that the \\"translucence [of the butter] gives to the complexion a richness beyond alabaster and a softness and smoothness that are very striking\\", and that \\"no other American sculptress has made a face of such angelic gentleness as that of Iolanthe.\\" Brooks created other versions of Iolanthe, including an alto-relievo which was exhibited at the Centennial Exposition ‚Äì the 1876 world's fair held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her butter sculpture, in the Women's Pavilion, attracted huge crowds. She was invited to move from the Women's Pavilion to the main exhibit space in order to demonstrate her sculpting skills. This was an honor, but there may have been an additional motivation behind the invitation. There were often suspicions and accusations during this time period that female artists in general did not actually create the works for which they were taking credit. As a demonstration that she had, in fact, sculpted the piece, she created another head, in about ninety minutes, for a panel which included Exposition officials and members of the press. Observers were impressed both by the quick performance using crude instruments to sculpt in an unusual medium and by the artistic qualities of the finished work. One guidebook proclaimed Dreaming Iolanthe to be the \\"most beautiful and unique exhibit in the Centennial\\". Even though the circumstances of the demonstration may have seemed like a stunt, Brooks was largely considered to be a serious artist whose creations should be regarded similarly to work sculpted using more traditional methods and materials. Commentary about her piece said that \\"the difficulties attached to the employment of such a material should be taken into account, while it must be conceded that, whatever material the artist employs, the work itself is one exhibiting a high degree of talent, a fine ideal feeling, as well as exceeding delicacy and brilliancy of manipulation.\\" After the Centennial Exposition Following her very successful showing at the Centennial, Brooks gave lectures and demonstrated her craft while touring many cities, including New York, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Des Moines. Brooks demonstrated her butter sculpting in 1877 at Boston's Amory Hall, where she created Pansy and The Marchioness. The latter, based on the Charles Dickens character who was a friend of Dick Swiveller from The Old Curiosity Shop, was reported to be Brooks's first full-length sculpture. Her daily demonstrations in Boston, for which she charged admission, helped raise money for a trip to Europe. Around this period, it appears that Brooks and her husband had separated. (Samuel, who chose to stay in Arkansas, won an election as a state legislator in 1882.) She opened a Washington, D.C. studio and in 1878 sculpted a life-size version of Dreaming Iolanthe in butter, and shipped it to be exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. She found it amusing that customs officials had listed her sculpture not as a work of art, but as \\"110 lbs. of butter\\". Brooks with a butter sculpture bas-relief of Columbus, 1893 Columbian Exposition After opening a New York studio, Brooks sculpted many portrait busts in 1883 to 1886. Finally financially able to purchase marble, she used that material to sculpt subjects including Thomas Carlyle, George Eliot, James A. Garfield, Lucretia Mott, Emanuel Swedenborg, Thurlow Weed, and a group sculptural portrait of Alicia Vanderbilt La Bau (daughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt) with her four children. Brooks exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts and the Woman's Building at 1893's World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, including a bas-relief of Christopher Columbus in butter, and four marble sculptures ‚Äì Lady Godiva Departing, Lady Godiva Returning, the Vanderbilt family portrait, which she renamed La Rosa, and a marble version of Dreaming Iolanthe. She lived in San Francisco from 1896 to 1902. Not much is known about her later years. She maintained a studio in her home after she moved to St. Louis, Missouri. She died in St. Louis in 1913. Very little of her work survives in public collections. She may be remembered not only as the \\"Centennial Butter Sculptress\\", but also as a feminist pioneer. Butter as an art medium Working with, transporting, and exhibiting butter sculptures presented Brooks with a unique set of challenges. To preserve her delicate butter sculptures, she created them in flat metallic milk pans which she set in larger pans filled with ice. By continuing to supply the outer pans with ice, she was able to keep her butter sculptures in good condition for months. When attempting to sail from New York to France with a life-size butter sculpture, she was forced to delay her departure until she was able to secure passage on a ship with sufficient ice to preserve her work throughout the journey; and then she faced the task of finding a railroad car which also had enough ice to safely transport the piece from Le Havre to the final destination of Paris. Brooks was said to prefer butter over clay as a molding medium. The latter had to kept moist and wrapped to prevent it from cracking, was not as sensitive for sculptural manipulation, and was more difficult to cast. Brooks had conquered the major disadvantage of butter simply by using ice. She discovered that she could even use butter for casting. After preserving her original butter Dreaming Iolanthe for a half a year, she desired a method which would not require keeping it in cold storage. Without knowing ahead of time what the results may be, she mixed up some plaster and poured it onto the butter sculpture. The plaster quickly set, and she cut a hole in the bottom of the milk pan which held her creation. Brooks then set the pan over a container of boiling water, and the butter melted and drained out of the hole. She removed the remainder of the bottom of the pan, and was left with a greased plaster negative. She placed more plaster inside and, after some difficulty removing the outer layer, was left with a successful plaster positive. Brooks was issued a patent in 1877 for her process of creating lubricated plaster molds. She did not, however, use plaster casts to reproduce her butter sculptures, instead preferring to sculpt a new one for each exhibit. While others came along, inspired by Brooks, to create butter displays, almost all of them were done in conjunction with commercial butter interests and dairy associations for promotion of their products at fairs and expositions, but Brooks dedicated her work to the creation of butter art purely for its artistic merit.

Escape Plan is the first title from new developer Fun Bits Interactive and is produced by Chris Millar, known for his previous work on Fat Princess. In previews of the game it was noted for its sharp, black-and- white visuals, gruesome yet humorous tone and its intuitive use of the PlayStation Vita's inputs including touch and gyroscopic control. Gameplay Players control two characters, Lil and Laarg (centre). One of Bakuki's minions can also be seen in this image (top left). In Escape Plan, the player controls two characters, Lil and Laarg, through a series of booby-trapped rooms using the PlayStation Vita's front and rear multitouch panels and motion controls. The gesture-based control system requires players to trace paths for the characters and tap obstacles to move them out of the way and clear a path for them. Traps range from a single brick lying on the floor to enormous rotating fan blades. Failure to guide Lil and Laarg to safety usually results in a gruesome death. The characters can traverse the game world in numerous ways. In some levels they are inflated with helium, requiring the player to tilt the console to guide them as they float around the room. Lil and Laarg usually move relatively slowly and in order to avoid fast-moving traps the player must grab the characters and pull them quickly to safety by pinching the Vita, touching both the front and rear panels at once. =Bakuki's Lair= Chris Millar, Fun Bits Interactive team lead, announced on PlayStation Blog that Escape Plan owners would receive Bakuki's Lair, a downloadable content (DLC) pack for Escape Plan, on April 10, 2012. It adds 19 prequel puzzle rooms to the adventures of Lil and Laarg. Together with the DLC, the update brings new tweaks and improvements based on player feedback, allowing for more pin- point accuracy on tap blocks, as well as an adjustment to the game's Star Rating system. The patch also lays the foundation for future updates. Reception At a preview event in October 2011, IGN editors ranked Escape Plan as their favourite PlayStation Vita game so far, commenting specifically on the game's \\"stunning\\", black and white chiaroscuro visuals, \\"great\\" classical soundtrack and gameplay which makes good use of many of the Vita's control features. In a December 2011 preview of the game, Destructoids Samit Sarkar described it as \\"perhaps the best showcase of the Vita‚Äôs unique capabilities\\". Upon release, the game received \\"average\\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Digital Spy gave the Vita version four stars out of five and called it \\"one of the most unique and charming looking games you'll ever play, and the pick-up-and-play value makes it perfect for a handheld. Minor control issues prevent it from achieving perfection, but it's still perhaps the most effective showcase of the Vita hardware to date.\\" The A.V. Club gave it a B and said that its \\"macabre humor and beautiful black-and-white chiaroscuro look make it a welcome respite from the noise and flash of the other Vita launch titles. Sony has a knack for finding and funding indie developers with a refined sense of style.\\" The Digital Fix gave it seven out of ten and said, \\"In all, we can't help but think that Escape Plan represents a missed opportunity. The wonderfully stunning visuals, the understated sound track [sic] and intuitive control system so very nearly elevate the game into a posterboy for the new hardware. However, the short, unchallenging nature of the game moves us away from this territory and instead positions Escape Plan as more of an experience than an outright game, with the nods to cinematic practices of the past aiding its artistic endeavours.\\" As of April 2012, Escape Plan was the number one selling PlayStation Network game on the PlayStation Vita.

The largely peaceful protest movement has demanded President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz institute political, economic, and legal reforms. Common themes of protest have included slavery, which is officially illegal in Mauritania, but is widespread in the country, and other human rights abuses the opposition has accused the government of perpetrating. Timeline =Start of protests= Demonstrators outside parliament in Nouakchott on 18 March 2011 Following the example of Mohamed Bouazizi, a Tunisian fruit vendor who set himself on fire the previous month to protest the government of Tunisia, a middle-aged businessman named Yacoub Ould Dahoud burned himself in front of the Presidential Palace in Nouakchott on 17 January 2011. He left behind a note explaining that injustice in Mauritania led him to commit suicide in this way. Dahoud died on 23 January in hospital. His self- immolation set off a round of protests in the capital starting on 20 January, when protesters gathered in Place 1 Mai to declare their intent to peacefully assemble as an act of civil disobedience until the government recognised their demands. =Protests ramp up= The 25 February Movement took off on 25 February 2011 when protesters across Mauritania assembled a 28-point list of reforms they demanded the government institute. The protest movement spread quickly outside the capital to cities like Aleg, Aoujeft, Atar, and Zouerate. The following month, protesters in many cities were met with a police crackdown. On 25 April 2011, protesters again gathered to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Moulaye Ould Mohamed Laghdaf. These protests against the prime minister came despite some economic concessions by authorities, including a promise by Laghdaf to create at least 1,700 new jobs in food production, and an offer from the Interior Ministry to negotiate with an appointed representative of the youth movement. =Protests against the census= Demonstrators in Ka√©di on 24 September 2011 Hundreds of black African Mauritanians marched starting in late September 2011 to decry the government census as \\"racist\\" due to a higher standard for blacks to prove Mauritanian citizenship than Arabs. On 27 September 2011, seven black protesters were shot by police in Maghama, near the international border with Senegal, and two of them died from their wounds. Days later, 56 protesters were arrested in Noaukchott. Protesters gathered in Inal in the country's north, as well as in Noaukchott, on 28 November to again rally against the census. At least one was wounded and another was detained as security forces intervened to stop the protest in the capital city. =Student protests= Students at the Advanced Institute for Islamic Studies and Research (ISERI) began protesting on 14 December 2011. Police responded with force, firing tear gas and frequently clashing with student groups. The unrest led to the closure of ISERI, but students continued to assemble. Several were detained on 16 January 2012, only to be released by police five days later in response to public anger. On 25 January, students organised a \\"Day of Anger\\" to protest ISERI's closure. =Anniversary= To mark the one-year anniversary of Yacoub Ould Dahoud's self-immolation, protesters gathered in Noaukchott to denounce President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz and his government. Peaceful rally-goers held homemade signs and chanted slogans calling for reform. Several days later, on 28 January 2012, Qatar-based news network Al Jazeera ran a story on the Mauritanian protests, characterising them as \\"overlooked\\" due in part to the relative lack of Internet penetration in Mauritania. It is estimated only 2 percent of Mauritanian households have reliable Internet connections. =Opposition protests= On 3 April, thousands of people in Mauritania have attended demonstrations in the capital calling for President Mohamed Ould Abdelaziz to resign. The opposition groups held peaceful \\"decentralised\\" rallies in the nine districts of Nouakchott. Organisers said they opposed \\"anti-democratic\\" policies of the government. They accused the president of rigging elections held in 2009 which confirmed him in power and refusing to hold a serious national dialogue with opposition groups.BBC News ‚Äì Mauritanian protests against President Abdelaziz. Bbc.co.uk (3 April 2012). Protests flare up again on 19 July, when thousands of Mauritanians protested in the capital late Wednesday, calling for the departure of President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, whom they accuse of despotism and mismanagement.

It employs [FeFe]-hydrogenases to produce hydrogen gas (H2) by fermenting many different types of carbohydrates. History First discovered in the sediment of a marine geothermal area near Vulcano, Italy, Thermotoga maritima resides in hot springs as well as hydrothermal vents. The ideal environment for the organism is a water temperature of , though it is capable of growing in waters of . Thermotoga maritima is the only bacterium known to grow at this high a temperature; the only other organisms known to live in environments this extreme are members of the domain Archaea. The hyperthermophilic abilities of T. maritima, along with its deep lineage, suggests that it is potentially a very ancient organism. Physical attributes T. maritima is a non-sporulating, rod shaped, gram- negative bacterium. When viewed under a microscope, it can be seen to be encased in a sheath-like envelope which resembles a toga, hence the \\"toga\\" in its name. Metabolism As an anaerobic fermentative chemoorganotrophic organism, T. maritima catabolizes sugars and polymers and produces carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2) gas as by-products of fermentation. T. maritima is also capable of metabolizing cellulose as well as xylan, yielding H2 that could potentially be utilized as an alternative energy source to fossil fuels. Additionally, this species of bacteria is able to reduce Fe(III) to produce energy using anaerobic respiration. Various flavoproteins and iron- sulphur proteins have been identified as potential electron carriers for use during cellular respiration. However, when growing with sulfur as the final electron acceptor, no ATP is produced. Instead, this process eliminates inhibitory H2 produced from fermentative growth. Collectively, these attributes indicate that T. maritima has become resourceful and capable of metabolizing a host of substances in order to carry out its life processes.  Hydrogenase Activity  Hydrogenases are metalloenzymes that catalyze the reversible hydrogen conversion reaction: H2 ‚áÑ 2 H+\\\\+ 2 e‚àí. A Group C [FeFe]-hydrogenase from Thermotoga maritima (TmHydS) has showed modest hydrogen conversion activity and reduced sensitivity to the enzyme's inhibitor, CO, in comparison to Group A prototypical and bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenases. The TmHydS has a hydrogenase domain with distinct amino acid modifications in the active site pocket, including the presence of a Per- Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain. Genomic composition The genome of T. maritima consists of a single circular 1.8 megabase chromosome encoding for 1877 proteins. Within its genome it has several heat and cold shock proteins that are most likely involved in metabolic regulation and response to environmental temperature changes. It shares 24% of its genome with members of the Archaea; the highest percentage overlap of any bacteria. This similarity suggests horizontal gene transfer between Archaea and ancestors of T. maritima and could help to explain why T. maritima is capable of surviving in such extreme temperatures and conditions. The genome of T. maritima has been sequenced multiple times. Genome resequencing of T. maritima MSB8 genomovar DSM3109 determined that the earlier sequenced genome was an evolved laboratory variant of T. maritima with an approximately 8-kb deletion. Moreover, a variety of duplicated genes and direct repeats in its genome suggest their role in intra- molecular homologous recombination leading to genes deletion. A strain with a 10-kb gene deletion has been developed using the experimental microbial evolution in T. maritima.  Genetic system of T. maritima  T. maritima has a great potential in hydrogen synthesis because it can ferment a wide variety of sugars and has been reported to produce the highest amount of H2 (4 mol H2/ mol glucose). Due to lack of a genetic system for the past 30 years majority of the studies have been either focused on heterologous gene expression in E. coli or predicting models since a gene knockout mutant of T. maritima remained unavailable. Developing a genetic system for T. maritima has been a challenging task primarily because of a lack of a suitable heat-stable selectable marker. Recently, the most reliable genetic system based on pyrimidine biosynthesis has been established in T. maritima. This newly developed genetic system relies upon a pyrE‚àí mutant that was isolated after cultivating T. maritima on a pyrimidine biosynthesis inhibiting drug called 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA). The pyrE‚àí mutant is an auxotrophic mutant for uracil. The pyrE from a distantly related genus of T. maritima rescued the uracil auxotrophy of the pyrE‚àí mutant of T. maritima and has been proven to be a suitable marker. For the first time, the use of this marker allowed the development of an arabinose (araA) mutant of T. maritima. This mutant explored the role of the pentose phosphate pathway of T. maritima in hydrogen synthesis. The genome of T. maritima possesses direct repeats that have developed into paralogs. Due to lack of a genetic system the true function of these paralogs has remained unknown. Recently developed genetic system in T. maritima has been very useful to determine the function of the ATPase protein (MalK) of the maltose transporter that is present in a multi-copy (three copies) fashion. The gene disruptions of all three putative ATPase encoding subunit (malK) and phenotype have concluded that only one of the three copies serves as an ATPase function of the maltose transporter. It is interesting to know that T. maritima has several paralogs of many genes and the true function of these genes is now dependent upon the use of the recently developed system. The newly developed genetic system in T. maritima has a great potential to make T. maritima as a host for hyperthermophilic bacterial gene expression studies. Protein expression in this model organism is promising to synthesize fully functional protein without any treatment. Evolution T. maritima contains homologues of several competence genes, suggesting that it has an inherent system of internalizing exogenous genetic material, possibly facilitating genetic exchange between this bacterium and free DNA. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the small sub-unit of its ribosomal RNA, it has been recognized as having one of the deepest lineages of Bacteria. Furthermore, its lipids have a unique structure that differs from all other bacteria.

He coached for two more seasons before a legend would guide the Mavericks for the next 26 seasons. Butch McBroom amassed 756 wins, which is by far the most for any Maverick coach and still second all-time in the Southland. His teams won two Conference Championships, were runners-up six times and participated in two NCAA tournaments. He occasionally landed in national rankings as well. His players earned four pitcher-of the-year awards, one player of-the-year, one hitter-of- the-year and three newcomer-of-the-year while he, himself, won four coach-of- the-year honors. In 1994, the Mavericks finished four games under .500, breaking a streak of 14-straight winning seasons. It marked the first of six- consecutive sub-.500 years, until he retired after the 1999 season. Clay Gould was hired as the fourth coach in Maverick history. He played for the Mavericks in the early 1990s during their two NCAA tournament runs and was named the 1993 Southland Conference Player-of-the-Year. His first year was a rebuilding year, but in 2001, UTA won their first Southland Conference tournament and advanced to the NCAA tournament. Against the Houston Cougars, Craig Martin, who retired as UTA's all-time hits leader and is still currently UTA's all- time doubles leader, hit a late-inning home run to win UTA's first NCAA tournament game. UTA's two losses were to host Rice University, which advanced to the Super Regional. During the season, Coach Gould was battling colon cancer, and he died shortly after the season ended. Jeff Curtis succeeded Coach Gould in 2002 and in 2006, UTA won their second Southland Conference tournament. Current Head Coach Darin Thomas, who was an assistant coach under Clay Gould and associate head coach with Jeff Curtis, officially took the reins in 2008. In 2012, his team won the Southland Conference Tournament to advance to an NCAA regional for the fifth time in program history. In 2013, as the team played their first and last season in the Western Athletic Conference, the team was Co-Champions with California State University- Bakersfield. In 2017, the team won a program record 20 conference games en route to a West Division championship in the Sun Belt. Since 2013, the baseball team annually plays one game against a Division I opponent in Globe Life Park.http://www.utamavs.com/sports/m-basebl/sched/txar-m-basebl- sched.html Season-by-season results See also * List of NCAA Division I baseball programs References External links * ","title":"UT Arlington Mavericks baseball"},{"id":"34536176","title":"Texas A&amp;M‚ÄìCorpus Christi Islanders baseball"},{"id":"34536191","text":"The North Dakota State Bison baseball team is the varsity intercollegiate baseball program of North Dakota State Bison in Fargo, North Dakota, United States.

For more than 800 years, until the 1930s, it was the city's only bridge across the river. It is a masterwork of medieval construction and an emblem of the city. Location The south end of the bridge may have been the location of an ancient city gate.Arch√§ologische Grabungen: Die aktuellen Grabungsergebnisse (Stand 18.9.2009), Aktuelles, Steinerne Br√ºcke, Tourismus, Stadt Regensburg The early 16th-century Amberg Salt Store () and the early 17th-century Regensburg Salt Store were built against it.Lageplan der Steinernen Br√ºcke, Architektur und Baugeschichte, Projekt Steinerne Br√ºcke zu Regensburg, Geschichte, University of Regensburg The Regensburg Sausage Kitchen east of the Salt Store was built against the city wall in the 14th century; an earlier building on the same site probably served as a canteen for the workers building the bridge.Historische Wurstkuchl, Tourismus, Stadt Regensburg Further east is the Regensburg Museum of Danube Shipping.

This was removed in 1964. Since modern barge traffic requires more clearance than the arches of the bridge provide, this stretch of the river is now only used by recreational and excursion shipping.

The Stone Bridge was built in only eleven years, probably in 1135-46.The Stone Bridge: 850 Years in Regensburg, Enduring Time and Man, Regensburg.deJohn Dornberg, \\"Where the Middle Ages Live\\", The New York Times 18 January 1987. Louis VII of France and his army used it to cross the Danube on their way to the Second Crusade. It served as a model for other stone bridges built in Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries: the Elbe bridge (now Augustus Bridge) in Dresden, London Bridge across the Thames, the Pont d'Avignon across the Rh√¥ne and the Judith Bridge (predecessor of the Charles Bridge) across the Vltava in Prague. It remained the only bridge across the Danube at Regensburg for about 800 years, until the construction of the Nibelungen Bridge. For centuries it was the only bridge over the river between Ulm and Vienna, making Regensburg into a major centre of trade and government.\\"Steinerne Br√ºcke--Nadel√∂hr f√ºr den Fernhandel\\", \\"13. Jahrhundert: Regensburg\\", Das bayerische Jahrtausend Episode 3, Bayerisches Fernsehen, Bayerischer Rundfunk, 3 April 2011, updated 9 January 2012 (video) The bridge originally had its own administration, using a seal depicting it, the oldest example of which dates to 1307; tolls were used for its upkeep.Das Stadt- und Br√ºckenwappen, Denkm√§ler an der Steinernen Br√ºcke, Projekt Steinerne Br√ºcke zu Regensburg =Construction and modifications= The Stone Bridge is an arch bridge with 16 arches. At the south end, the first arch and first pier were incorporated into the Regensburg Salt Store when it was built in 1616-20, but remain in place under the approach road to the bridge. An archaeological investigation was performed in 2009, and revealed fire damage during the Middle Ages. The bridge was originally long; the building in of the first pier reduced it to .Technische Daten, Architektur und Baugeschichte, Projekt Steinerne Br√ºcke zu Regensburg The southern, Old Town end of the bridge is half a metre lower than the northern, Stadtamhof end, and the bridge bends slightly because of the course of the river at that point. Construction of the bridge was made easier by an unusually hot, dry summer in 1135, which caused very low water levels in the Danube.R≈æiha, p. 37. Some of the bridge piers are on the two islands in the Danube within the city, the Upper and Lower W√∂hrd. The others rest on foundations of oak logs on the riverbed, which were constructed inside cofferdams of oak planking. To protect them from being undermined by the river, they are surrounded by pillar-shaped artificial islands or abutments; these were enlarged in 1687. The bridge abutments are a substantial impediment to the flow of water, with as little as 4 metres between them, creating strong whirling currents under the bridge and downstream, which are referred to as the \\"Regensburg Danube Strudel\\". Five of them were reduced in size in 1848 as part of construction of the Ludwig Canal, and they were all reduced and strengthened with concrete and stone during renovation work in 1951-62. The construction using abutments is a modification of the technique used by the Romans for the bridge over the Mosel at Trier, where the piers rest directly on the riverbed. Watermills were built at the south end of the bridge, making use of the currents it created; the revenues contributed to the upkeep of the bridge. The Bavarians had them burnt in 1633 during the Thirty Years' War; some were rebuilt in 1655 but in 1784 an ice dam on the river destroyed them. One was rebuilt at the foot of the Salt Store for a few more years.Die ehemaligen M√ºhlen, Architektur und Baugeschichte, Projekt Steinerne Br√ºcke zu Regensburg The remaining tower at the south end of the bridge, with tramway arch to the right, and Salt Store; Regensburg Cathedral in the background. In the Thirty Years' War, during the Swedish attack on the city in 1633, the fourth bridge span (the third now visible) was blown up. The gap was filled by a wooden drawbridge and only repaired in 1790/91 after it became apparent that the missing section was weakening the bridge.Krieg und Zerst√∂rung im Umkreis der Steinernen Br√ºcke, Architektur und Baugeschichte, Projekt Steinerne Br√ºcke zu Regensburg The bridge originally had three towers, of which only the south tower, a gate tower to the Old City, survives. The original south tower was built around 1300; beside it stood a chapel of St Margaret. In the mid-16th century this was converted into a debtors' prison and the tower became known as the Debt Tower (Schuldturm).Das Br√ºcktor, Architektur und Baugeschichte, Projekt Steinerne Br√ºcke zu Regensburg The middle tower was built around 1200.Der ehemalige Mittelturm, Architektur und Baugeschichte, Projekt Steinerne Br√ºcke zu Regensburg Both the south and the middle towers were destroyed by fire in the Thirty Years' War, when the city was under occupation by the Swedes. They were rebuilt in 1648, the clock being added to the south tower at that time, but the middle tower was demolished in 1784 after being almost destroyed by the ice dam. The north tower (the Black Tower), was probably built in the second half of the 12th century, in association with the bridge itself.Der Schwarze Turm, Architektur und Baugeschichte, Projekt Steinerne Br√ºcke zu Regensburg It was heavily fortified between 1383 and 1429, including a drawbridge. This tower was damaged in 1809 during the Napoleonic Wars when the French and Bavarians retook the city from the Austrians, and had to be demolished the next year. In 1824/25 the site where it had stood was widened to accommodate a bazaar. Bruckmandl at the highest point of the bridge The chapel was removed and replaced by a tollhouse in 1829. In the early 20th century, when the tramway was built, all buildings between the remaining tower and the Amberg Salt Store were removed, widening the street approaching the bridge, and a wide arch was built over it beside the tower. Late in the Second World War, on 23 April 1945, German troops dynamited the second pier of the bridge immediately in front of that point, and also the eleventh, to slow the advance of American troops. The Americans installed temporary planking the following winter, but the damage was not fully repaired until 1967. The bridge originally had thick stone balustrades, with very narrow pedestrian gangways beside them. The balustrades were replaced in 1732 with thinner slabs of sandstone, widening the roadway.R≈æiha, p. 40. In 1877 these were in turn replaced with granite from Flossenb√ºrg, and the wooden ramp which had connected the bridge to the Upper W√∂hrd since 1499 was replaced with an iron one at the same time. Finally, in 1950, the bridge was given concrete balustrades. The north end of the bridge was formerly the border between the Duchy (later Electorate) of Bavaria and the Free Imperial City of Regensburg. At the highest point of the bridge is a stone carving called the Bruckmandl or Br√ºckenm√§nnchen (bridge mannikin), a largely naked young man shielding his eyes with one hand and with an inscription reading \\"\\" (likely a reference to the hot summer when the bridge was begun). He has been said to symbolise the city's freedoms and its emancipation from the control of the Bishop. He has also been said to represent the bridge builder, and another figure on the cathedral to represent the cathedral builder.Zwei Regensburger Wahrzeichen oder \\"Des Baumeisters Bund mit dem Teufel\\" , Sagen √ºber Dom und Br√ºckenbau, Sagen und Zeitgeschichte: Rund um die Steinerne Br√ºcke, Projekt Steinerne Br√ºcke zu Regensburg He was originally seated on the roof of a mill, and now sits on the bridge itself on the roof of a miniature toll-house.

On the evening of 1 August 2008 it was also closed to buses and taxis and became a pedestrian and bicycle bridge. This was because of a report that the balustrades would be insufficient to stop a bus.\\"Steinerne gesperrt: Was steckt dahinter?\\", Regensburg-digital 3 August 2008 The bridge has been under restoration since 2010; completion was originally expected in 2014 but is now expected in 2017 at the earliest.Ablauf der Instandsetzung, Instandsetzung, Tourismus, Stadt Regensburg Mathias Wagner, \\"Auf der Br√ºcke geht‚Äôs endlich weiter\\", Mittelbayerische Zeitung, 19 August 2013 Temporary bridges are being used to enable the over 120,000 annual users of the bridge to bypass the section being rebuilt.

A satisfactory kind of sandstone was eventually found in an abandoned quarry near Ihrlerstein.\\"Steinerne Br√ºcke: Regensburger Haltung √§rgert Ihrlersteiner Unternehmer\\", Mittelbayerische Zeitung 22 February 2010 The bridge is to remain closed to motor vehicles after the renovation. Legend There is a legend that the bridge builder and the cathedral builder (who were apprentice and master) had a bet as to who would finish first. When the building of the cathedral progressed faster than that of the bridge, the bridge builder made a pact with the Devil: the Devil would aid him in exchange for the first three souls (or the first eight feet) to cross the bridge. The Devil helped as requested, and the bridge was finished first. But the bridge builder sent a rooster, a hen and a dog across the bridge first.For variants of this trope, see \\"Devil's Bridge\\". A statue of a falling man on the cathedral is said to represent the master throwing himself off in reaction. Enraged, the Devil attempted to destroy the bridge, but failed, but that is why it is bent. In fact the bridge was already complete when construction began on the cathedral in 1273.

From 1778 to 1788, Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c proclaimed himself Emperor Th√°i ƒê·ª©c ( ). In 1788 after his younger brother proclaimed himself Emperor Quang Trung, Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c resigned his Emperor title and declared himself as King of T√¢y S∆°n. Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c and his brothers, namely Nguy·ªÖn L·ªØ and Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá, known as the T√¢y S∆°n Brothers, ended the centuries-long civil war between the two feudal families- the Tr·ªãnh Lords in northern Vietnam and the Nguy·ªÖn Lords in southern Vietnam, seizing reigning power from these groups and the L√™ dynasty.Nghia M.

Vietnamese historian Tr·∫ßn Tr·ªçng Kim described him as a courageous and clever man. He had two younger brothers: Nguy·ªÖn L·ªØ and Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá. Their talents are highly appreciated by their martial arts master, Tr∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Hi·∫øn. T√¢y S∆°n brothers lived by trading betel. Legend stated that Nh·∫°c got a magical sword from barbarians, so he was respected by many people. Later, Nh·∫°c became a tax- collector of Nguy·ªÖn lord. He robbed off all tax he had collected, and distributed to poor farmers. He had to flee with his brothers, and became an outlaw. Hi·∫øn encouraged Nh·∫°c to revolt against Nguy·ªÖn lords: \\"The prophecy says: 'Revolt in the West, success in the North'. You are born in T√¢y S∆°n District, you must do your best.\\" Nh·∫°c agreed with him. Revolted against Nguy·ªÖn lords At that time, the lord of Cochinchina Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Thu·∫ßn was young, the regent was a corrupted official, Tr∆∞∆°ng Ph√∫c Loan. Loan was so unpopular that people compared him with Qin Hui. There were rumors that Loan changed the former lord's will and throned the young prince Thu·∫ßn. In 1771, Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c, Nguy·ªÖn L·ªØ and Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá rebelled against Nguy·ªÖn lord. They took T√¢y S∆°n District as base camp, aimed to overthrow Loan and enthrone Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c D∆∞∆°ng, the eldest grandson of the former Nguy·ªÖn lord. The rebels became famous for their policy: \\"fair, no corruption, only looting the rich, and help the poor.\\"Les Espagnols dans l‚ÄôEmpire d‚ÄôAnnam, Spanish Catholic Priest Diego de Jumilla. Soon they were widely supported by poor people. Ethnic minorities in Cochinchina, including Montagnards, Chams and Sino-Vietnamese, also took part in the rebellion. The rebels grew rapidly and government troops were unable to put down. One day, Nh·∫°c sat in a prison van, ordered his men to take him to Quy Nh∆°n. The governor, Nguy·ªÖn Kh·∫Øc Tuy√™n (ÈòÆÂÖãÂÆ£), was very happy, and threw him into prison. At night, Nh·∫°c escaped from prison and opened the city gate. Quy Nh∆°n was taken by T√¢y S∆°n army, and used as the new base camp.

Several months later, T√¢y S∆°n army took Qu·∫£ng Nam, Thu·∫ßn had to flee to Gia ƒê·ªãnh. Not long after, from Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i to B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n was occupied by T√¢y S∆°n rebels. Tr·ªãnh army marched to Qu·∫£ng Nam, and came into conflict with T√¢y S∆°n army. They met in the battlefield in C·∫©m Sa (a place in modern H√≤a Vang). Nh·∫°c ordered T·∫≠p ƒê√¨nh to take the lead and L√Ω T√†i in the middle, Nh·∫°c himself to bring up the rear. T·∫≠p ƒê√¨nh was raided by Tr·ªãnh cavalry and ultimately led to T√¢y S∆°n's defeat. Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c and L√Ω T√†i retreated to B·∫øn B·∫£n. Nh·∫°c prepared for the reception of the crown prince D∆∞∆°ng, and went to Quy Nh∆°n together with him. In the same time, a Nguy·ªÖn army under T·ªëng Ph∆∞·ªõc Hi·ªáp (ÂÆãÁ¶èÊ¥Ω) resumed B√¨nh Thu·∫≠n, Di√™n Kh√°nh and B√¨nh Khang (modern Ninh H√≤a), then recaptured Ph√∫ Y√™n. T√¢y S∆°n army fell in a two-front war with both Nguy·ªÖn lord and Tr·ªãnh lord. Nh·∫°c sent an envoy to Tr·ªãnh army to sue for peace. Nh·∫°c swore allegiance to Tr·ªãnh lord, in return, he received the position Ti√™n-phong-t∆∞·ªõng-qu√¢n and T√¢y-s∆°n Hi·ªáu-tr∆∞·ªüng from Tr·ªãnh lord. After concluding a peace deal with Tr·ªãnh lord, Nh·∫°c married a daughter to Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c D∆∞∆°ng, and urged him to ascend the lord throne, but D∆∞∆°ng refused. Nh·∫°c sent a letter to T·ªëng Ph∆∞·ªõc Hi·ªáp. In the letter, Nh·∫°c said he decided to swear allegiance to the crown prince D∆∞∆°ng, and prepared to resume the capital Ph√∫ Xu√¢n. Nh·∫°c then ordered Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá to launch a raid on Nguy·ªÖn army. H·ª£p was defeated and fled to V√¢n Phong. Tr·ªãnh army marched to Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i, but most of soldiers died from disease, Ho√†ng Ng≈© Ph√∫c had to retreat. Ph√∫c died of illness on his way back to Ph√∫ Xu√¢n; his assistant, B√πi Th·∫ø ƒê·∫°t, was appointed as the successor. Qu·∫£ng Nam was reoccupied by T√¢y S∆°n army; now, Nh·∫°c could concentrate on fighting against Nguy·ªÖn lord. He sent Nguy·ªÖn L·ªØ to the south. Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Thu·∫ßn was defeated and fled to Bi√™n H√≤a. Establishment of T√¢y S∆°n dynasty In 1776, Nh·∫°c titled himself T√¢y S∆°n v∆∞∆°ng (Ë•øÂ±±Áéã \\"king of T√¢y S∆°n\\"). He used Citadel ƒê·ªì B√†n (Vijaya) as the capital, and appointed many officials. Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c D∆∞∆°ng was imprisoned in a Buddhist temple; later, he fled to Gia ƒê·ªãnh, there he was supported by L√Ω T√†i and ascended the lord throne. In the next year, Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c was recognized as the new ruler of Cochinchina by Tr·ªãnh S√¢m. He received the noble rank Cung-qu·∫≠n- c√¥ng (ÊÅ≠ÈÉ°ÂÖ¨ \\"provincial duke Cung\\") from Tr·ªãnh lord. T√¢y S∆°n army marched further south, finally, both Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Thu·∫ßn and Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c D∆∞∆°ng were captured and executed by Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá. In 1778, Nh·∫°c crowned the emperor, and changed era name to \\"Th√°i ƒê·ª©c\\" (Ê≥∞Âæ∑), marking the establishment of T√¢y S∆°n dynasty. A nephew of Thu·∫ßn, Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh, managed to escape to H√† Ti√™n then to Poulo Panjang. In late 1777, the main part of the T√¢y S∆°n army left Saigon and marched north. Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh landed in Long Xuy√™n. There, he was supported by many Nguy·ªÖn generals, and raised the flag of restoration. ƒê·ªó Thanh Nh∆°n, the leader of ƒê√¥ng S∆°n army, also swore allegiance to √Ånh. Nguy·ªÖn army became much more stronger, and captured many places. √Ånh also made an alliance Siam. However, the assassination of ƒê·ªó Thanh Nh∆°n by Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh causing the revolt of ƒê√¥ng S∆°n army, thus badly weakening the Nguy·ªÖn army. Taking this opportunity, Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c and Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá invaded Gia ƒê·ªãnh and finally recaptured it in 1782. Nh·∫°c returned to Quy Nh∆°n. In the next year, Ch√¢u VƒÉn Ti·∫øp, a supporter of Nguy·ªÖn lord, defeated the T√¢y S∆°n garrison in Saigon, and invited Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh to return. Nguy·ªÖn L·ªØ and Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá were sent to Gia ƒê·ªãnh, and forced √Ånh to flee to Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc. In 1785, Hu·ªá defeated Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh and Siamese navy. √Ånh had to flee to Siam.  Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá's overthrow of Tr·ªãnh lords The ruler of Tonkin, Tr·ªãnh S√¢m, died in 1782. His favorite son Tr·ªãnh C√°n ascended the lord throne, but soon was deposed in a military coup. The mutinying soldiers installed Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£i as the new lord. Tonkin fell into chaos. In 1786, an army under Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá, V≈© VƒÉn Nh·∫≠m and Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Ch·ªânh marched north to attack Ph√∫ Xu√¢n. After the capture of Ph√∫ Xu√¢n, Ch·ªânh encouraged Hu·ªá to overthrow Tr·ªãnh lord. Hu·ªá took his advice, marched further north without Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c's order, and finally captured ThƒÉng Long.Vi·ªát Nam s·ª≠ l∆∞·ª£c, Quy·ªÉn 2, T·ª± ch·ªß th·ªùi ƒë·∫°i, Ch∆∞∆°ng 9 Nh·∫°c did not want to take Tonkin; he sent an envoy to Ph√∫ Xu√¢n to prevent Hu·ªá from marching north, but Hu·ªá had left. Then he got the message that Hu·ªá had captured ThƒÉng Long, and realized that Hu·ªá was hard to be controlled. Nh·∫°c led 2500 men and marched north to meet with Hu·ªá and the L√™ emperor. In ThƒÉng Long, Nh·∫°c promised that he would not take any territory of Tonkin. Then he retreated from Tonkin together with Hu·ªá. Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c proclaimed himself as Trung ∆∞∆°ng Ho√†ng ƒë·∫ø (‰∏≠Â§ÆÁöáÂ∏ù \\"the Central Emperor\\"). Nguy·ªÖn L·ªØ was given the title ƒê√¥ng ƒê·ªãnh v∆∞∆°ng (Êù±ÂÆöÁéã \\"King of Eastern Conquering\\"), Gia ƒê·ªãnh was his fief; Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá received the title B·∫Øc B√¨nh V∆∞∆°ng (ÂåóÂπ≥Áéã \\"King of Northern Conquering\\") and lived in Ph√∫ Xu√¢n, the area north to H·∫£i V√¢n was his fief.Vi·ªát Nam s·ª≠ l∆∞·ª£c, Quy·ªÉn 2, T·ª± ch·ªß th·ªùi ƒë·∫°i, Ch∆∞∆°ng 10 Civil war between two brothers Not long after, Nguy·ªÖn Nh·∫°c came into conflict with Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá. A civil war broke out, Hu·ªá besieged Quy Nh∆°n for several months. The main forces of Gia ƒê·ªãnh was called back to support Nh·∫°c, but was defeated in Ph√∫ Y√™n, its commander ƒê·∫∑ng VƒÉn Ch√¢n surrendered to Hu·ªá. Nh·∫°c climbed onto the city wall, and shouted to Hu·ªá: \\"How can you use the pot of skin to cook meat like that.\\" In B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province, if hunters seized a prey, they would flay it and use its skin to cook meat. Using this metaphor, Nh·∫°c indicated that brothers should not fight with each other. Hu·ªá was moved to tears, and decided to retreat, and reached a peace agreement Nh·∫°c. They chose B·∫øn B·∫£n as a boundary; the area north to Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i was Hu·ªá's area; the area south to ThƒÉng B√¨nh and ƒêi·ªán B√†n belonged to Nh·∫°c. From then on, they ceased fire with each other. Final years Later, Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá marched north and put down the rebellion in Tonkin. Hu·ªá proclaimed himself as Emperor Quang Trung in 1788, and defeated Qing army in Battle of Ng·ªçc H·ªìi-ƒê·ªëng ƒêa. Meanwhile, the civil war of T√¢y S∆°n brothers had provided Nguy·ªÖn √Ånh with the chance to go back to Cochinchina again. Nh·∫°c's territory was eroded by Nguy·ªÖn lord. During his final years, he only controlled three provinces: Quy Nh∆°n (modern B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh), Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i and Ph√∫ Y√™n. He was described as \\"an old man who is resigned to the present state of affairs\\" by Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá. Hu·ªá was also worried about the future of T√¢y S∆°n dynasty. Nguy·ªÖn Hu·ªá suddenly died in 1792. Nh·∫°c prepared to attend Hu·ªá's funeral, however, the road to Ph√∫ Xu√¢n was blocked by the successor Nguy·ªÖn Quang To·∫£n, he had to return, and sent a sister to attend the funeral.

Coming to power three decades after the death of the Muslim prophet Muhammad and immediately after the Rashidun Caliphate, the Umayyads were a feudal Arab empire ruling over a population which was overwhelmingly non-Arab as well as primarily non-Muslim. Non-Arabs were treated as second-class citizens regardless of whether or not they converted to Islam, and this discontent cutting across faiths and ethnicities ultimately led to the Umayyads' overthrow.Paul Rivlin, Arab Economies in the Twenty-First Century, p. 86. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009. The Abbasid family claimed to have descended from al-Abbas, an uncle of the Prophet. The revolution essentially marked the end of the Arab empire and the beginning of a more inclusive, multiethnic state in the Middle East.Sa√Ød Amir Arjomand, Abd Allah Ibn al-Muqaffa and the Abbasid Revolution. Iranian Studies, vol. 27, Nos. 1‚Äì4. London: Routledge, 1994.

New York: Infobase Publishing, 2009. Background By the 740s, the Umayyad Empire found itself in critical condition. A dispute over succession in 744 led to the Third Muslim Civil War, which raged across the Middle East for two years. The very next year, al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Shaybani initiated a Kharijite rebellion that would continue until 746. Concurrent with this, a rebellion broke out in reaction to Marwan II's decision to move the capital from Damascus to Harran, resulting in the destruction of Homs ‚Äì also in 746. It was not until 747 that Marwan II was able to pacify the provinces; the Abbasid Revolution began within months.G. R. Hawting, The First Dynasty of Islam: The Umayyad Caliphate AD 661‚Äì750, p. 105. London: Routledge, 2002. Nasr ibn Sayyar was appointed governor of Khurusan by Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik in 738. He held on to his post throughout the civil war, being confirmed as governor by Marwan II in the aftermath. Khurusan's expansive size and low population density meant that the Arab denizens ‚Äì both military and civilian ‚Äì lived largely outside of the garrisons built during the spread of Islam. This was in contrast to the rest of the Umayyad provinces, where Arabs tended to seclude themselves in fortresses and avoided interaction with the locals.Peter Stearns, Michael Adas, Stuart Schwartz and Marc Jason Gilbert.\\"The Umayyad Imperium.\\" Taken from World Civilizations:The Global Experience, combined volume. 7th ed. Zug: Pearson Education, 2014. Arab settlers in Khorasan left their traditional lifestyle and settled among the native Iranian peoples.

Al-Baladhuri, Futuh al-Buldan, p. 417. it slowly became a habit within eastern Khorasan; as the Arabs began adopting Persian dress and the two languages influenced one another, the ethnic barriers came down.G.R.

Following the Battle of Karbala which led to the massacre of Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad, and his kin and companions by the Umayyad army in 680 CE, the Shias used this event as a rallying cry of opposition against the Umayyads. The Abbasids also used the memory of Karbala extensively to gain popular support against the Umayyads. The Hashimiyya movement (a sub-sect of the Kaysanites Shia) were largely responsible for starting the final efforts against the Umayyad dynasty, initially with the goal of replacing the Umayyads with an Alid ruling family.Farhad Daftary, Ismaili Literature: A Bibliography of Sources and Studies, p. 4. London: I.B. Tauris and the Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2004. H. Dizadji, Journey from Tehran to Chicago: My Life in Iran and the United States, and a Brief History of Iran, p. 50. Bloomington: Trafford Publishing, 2010. To an extent, rebellion against the Umayyads bore an early association with Shi'ite ideas.Matthew Gordon, The Rise of Islam, p. 46. Westport: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005. A number of Shi'ite revolts against Umayyad rule had already taken place, though they were open about their desire for an Alid ruler. Zayd ibn Ali fought the Umayyads in Iraq, while Abdallah ibn Mu'awiya even established temporary rule over Persia. Their murder not only increased anti-Umayyad sentiment among the Shia, but also gave both Shias and Sunnis in Iraq and Persia a common rallying cry. At the same time, the capture and murder of the primary Shi'ite opposition figures rendered the Abbasids as the only realistic contenders for the void that would be left by the Umayyads.G.R. Hawting, The First Dynasty of Islam, p. 113. The Abbasids kept quiet about their identity, simply stating that they wanted a ruler from the descendant of Muhammad upon whose choice as caliph the Muslim community would agree.ŸÑŸÑÿ±ÿ∂ÿß ŸÖŸÜ ÿ°ÿßŸÑ ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ øALƒ™ AL-RE≈ªƒÄ, Irannica Many Shi'ites naturally assumed that this meant an Alid ruler, a belief which the Abbasids tacitly encouraged to gain Shi'ite support.The Oxford History of Islam, pp. 24‚Äì25. Though the Abbasids were members of the Banu Hashim clan, rivals of the Umayyads, the word \\"Hashimiyya\\" seems to refer specifically to Abd-Allah ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, a grandson of Ali and son of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah. According to certain traditions, Abd-Allah died in 717 in Humeima in the house of Mohammad ibn Ali Abbasi, the head of the Abbasid family, and before dying named Muhammad ibn Ali as his successor.Hala Mundhir Fattah, A Brief History of Iraq, p. 76. Although the anecdote is considered a fabrication, at the time it allowed the Abbasids to rally the supporters of the failed revolt of Mukhtar al-Thaqafi, who had represented themselves as the supporters of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya. By the time the revolution was in full swing, most Kaysanite Shia had either transferred their allegiance to the Abbasid dynasty (in the case of the Hashimiyya),Farhad Daftary, Ismaili Literature, p. 15.Moojan Momen, An Introduction to Shi'i Islam, pp. 47‚Äì48. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1985. or had converted to other branches of Shi'ism and the Kaysanites ceased to exist.Heinz Halm, Shi'ism, p. 18. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004. =Discontent among Sunni Muslims who were non- Arab= The Umayyad state is remembered as an Arab-centric state, being run by and for the benefit of those who were ethnically Arab though Muslim in creed.Ivan Hrbek, Africa from the Seventh to the Eleventh Century, p. 26. Melton: James Currey, 1992. The non-Arab Muslims resented their marginal social position and were easily drawn into Abbasid opposition to Umayyad rule. Arabs dominated the bureaucracy and military, and were housed in fortresses separate from the local population outside of Arabia. Even after converting to Islam, non-Arabs or Mawali could not live in these garrison cities. The non- Arabs were not allowed to work for the government nor could they hold officer positions in the Umayyad military and they still had to pay the jizya tax for non-Muslims.Stearns, Adas et al., \\"Converts and People of the Book.\\"The Umayyads: The Rise of Islamic Art, p. 40. Museum with No Frontiers, 2000. Philip Adler and Randall Pouwels, World Civilizations, p. 214. Boston: Cengage Learning, 2014. Non-Muslims under Umayyad rule were subject to these same injunctions.John Esposito, Islam: The Straight Path, p. 34. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998. Racial intermarriage between Arabs and non Arabs was rare. When it did occur, it was only allowed between an Arab man and a non- Arab woman while non-Arab men were generally not free to marry Arab women. Conversion to Islam occurred gradually. If a non-Arab wished to convert to Islam, they not only had to give up their own names but also had to remain a second-class citizen. The non-Arab would be \\"adopted\\" by an Arab tribe, though they would not actually adopt the tribe's name as that would risk pollution of perceived Arab racial purity. Rather, the non-Arab would take the last name of \\"freedman of al-(tribe's name)\\", even if they were not a slave prior to conversion. This essentially meant they were subservient to the tribe who sponsored their conversion.Fred Astren, Karaite Judaism and Historical Understanding, pp. 33‚Äì34. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press, 2004. Although converts to Islam made up roughly 10% of the native population ‚Äì most of the people living under Umayyad rule were not Muslim ‚Äì this percent was significant due to the very small number of Arabs. Gradually, the non-Arab Muslims outnumbered the Arab Muslims, causing alarm among the Arab nobility. Socially, this posed a problem as the Umayyads viewed Islam as the property of the aristocratic Arab families.G.R. Hawting, The First Dynasty of Islam, p. 4.Fred Astren, Karaite Judaism and Historical Understanding, p. 33 (only). There was a rather large financial problem posed to the Umayyad system as well. If the new converts to Islam from non-Arab peoples stopped paying the jizya tax stipulated by the Qur'an for non-Muslims, the empire would go bankrupt. This lack of civil and political rights eventually led the non-Arab Muslims to support the Abbasids, despite the latter also being Arab.William Ochsenwald and Sydney Nettleton Fisher, The Middle East: A History, pp. 55‚Äì56. Volume 2 of Middle East Series. New York: McGraw-Hill Education, 1997. Even as the Arab governors adopted the more sophisticated Iranian methods of governmental administration, non-Arabs were still prevented from holding such positions. Non-Arabs were not even allowed to wear Arabian style clothing,Ign√°c Goldziher, Muhammedanische Studien, vol. 2, pp. 138‚Äì139. 1890. so strong were the feelings of Arab racial superiority cultivated by the Umayyads. Much of the discontent this caused led to the Shu'ubiyya movement, an assertion of non-Arab racial and cultural equality with Arabs. The movement gained support among Egyptians, Arameans and Berber people,Susanne Enderwitz, \\"Shu'ubiya.\\" Taken from the Encyclopaedia of Islam, vol. 9, pp. 513‚Äì514. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1997. though this movement was most pronounced among Iranian people. Repression of Iranian culture Coinage depicting Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan The early Muslim conquest of Persia was coupled with an anti-Iranian Arabization policy which led to much discontent.Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub, Two Centuries of Silence. Tehran: Sukhan, 2000. The controversial Umayyad governor Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf was upset at the usage of Persian as the court language in the eastern Islamic empire, and ordered all written and spoken Persian to be suppressed in both government and even among the general public, by force if necessary.Abdolhosein Zarrinkoub, \\"The Arab Conquest of Iran and its Aftermath.\\" Taken from Cambridge History of Iran, vol. 4, p. 46. Ed. Richard Nelson Frye. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975. Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani, Kitab al-Aghani, vol. 4, p. 423. Contemporary historians record that al-Hajjaj contributed to the death of the Khwarezmian language, closely related to Persian. Once the Umayyads expanded into Khwarezm, a stronghold of east Iranian civilization, al-Hajjaj ordered the execution of anyone who could read or write the language, to the point that only the illiterate remained.Ab≈´ Ray·∏•ƒÅn al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´, The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries, pp. 35‚Äì36 and 48. =Discontent among non-Muslims= Support for the Abbasid Revolution was an early example of people of different faiths aligning with a common cause. This was due in large part to policies of the Umayyads which were regarded as particularly oppressive to anyone following a faith other than Islam. In 741, the Umayyads decreed that non-Muslims could not serve in government posts.Aptin Khanbaghi, The Fire, the Star and the Cross: Minority Religions in Medieval and Early Modern Iran, p. 19. Volume 5 of International Library of Iranian Studies. London: I.B. Tauris, 2006. The Abbasids were aware of this discontent, and made efforts to balance both its Muslim character as well as its partially non-Muslim constituency.Ira M. Lapidus, , p. 58. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002. Persecution of Zoroastrians was part of state policy during the Umayyad era. Al-Hajjaj allegedly killed all Zoroastrian clergy upon the conquest of east Iranian lands, burning all Zoroastrian literature and destroying most religious buildings. The non-Muslim aristocracy around Merv supported the Abbasids, and thus retained their status as a privileged governing class regardless of religious belief. Events =Buildup= Beginning around 719, Hashimiyya missions began to seek adherents in Khurasan. Their campaign was framed as one of proselytism. They sought support for \\"a member of the House of the Prophet who shall be pleasing to everyone\\",ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ∂ÿß ŸÖŸÜ ÿ°ÿ¢ŸÑ ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ :al-re≈ºƒÅ men ƒÅl Mo·∏•ammad without making explicit mention of the Abbasids.ABBASID CALIPHATE, Encyclop√¶dia Iranica. Retrieved 8 November 2014. These missions met with success both among Arabs and non-Arabs, although the latter may have played a particularly important role in the growth of the movement. A number of Shi'ite rebellions ‚Äì by Kaysanites, Hashimiyya and mainstream Shi'ites ‚Äì took place in the final years of Umayyad rule, just around the same time that tempers were flaring among the Syrian contingents of the Umayyad army regarding alliances and wrongdoings during the SecondThe Oxford History of Islam, p. 24 only. and Third Fitna.G.R. Hawting, The First Dynasty of Islam, pp. 105 & 107. At this time Kufa was the center for the opposition to Umayyad rule, particularly Ali's supporters and Shias. In 741‚Äì42 Abu Muslim made his first contact with Abbasid agents there, and eventually he was introduced to the head of Abbasids, Imam Ibrahim, in Mecca. Around 746, Abu Muslim assumed leadership of the Hashimiyya in Khurasan.AB≈™ MOSLEM ·∏¥ORƒÄSƒÄNƒ™, Encyclop√¶dia Iranica. Retrieved 30 April 2014. Unlike the Alid revolts which were open and straightforward about their demands, the Abbasids along with the Hashimite allies slowly built up an underground resistance movement to Umayyad rule. Secret networks were used to build a power base of support in the eastern Muslim lands to ensure the revolution's success. This buildup not only took place right on the heels of the Zaydi Revolt in Iraq, but also concurrently with the Berber Revolt in Iberia and Maghreb, the Ibadi rebellion in Yemen and Hijaz,Daniel McLaughlin, Yemen and: The Bradt Travel Guide, p. 203. Guilford: Brandt Travel Guides, 2007. and the Third Fitna in the Levant, with the revolt of al-Harith ibn Surayj in Khurasan and Central Asia occurring concurrently with the revolution itself. The Abbasids spent their preparation time watching as the Umayyad Empire was besieged from within itself in all four cardinal directions,Bernard Lewis, The Middle East, Introduction, final two pages on the Umayyad Caliphate. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2009. and School of Oriental and African Studies Professor Emeritus G. R. Hawting has asserted that even if the Umayyad rulers had been aware of the Abbasids' preparations, it would not have been possible to mobilize against them. Revolt of Ibn Surayj In 746, Ibn Surayj began his revolt at Merv without success at first, even losing his secretary Jahm bin Safwan.G.R. Hawting, The First Dynasty of Islam, p. 108. After joining forces with other rebel factions, Ibn Surayj drove Umayyad governor Nasr ibn Sayyar and his forces to Nishapur; the two factions double-crossed each other shortly thereafter, with Ibn Surayj's faction being crushed. Western Khorasan was controlled by Abdallah ibn Mu'awiya at the time, cutting Ibn Sayyar in the east off from Marwan II. In the summer of 747, Ibn Sayyar sued for peace, which was accepted by the remaining rebels. The rebel leader was assassinated by a son of Ibn Surayj in a revenge attack while at the same time, another Shi'ite revolt had begun in the villages. The son of the remaining rebels signed the peace accord and Ibn Sayyar returned to his post in Merv in August of 747 ‚Äì just after Abu Muslim initiated a revolt of his own. =Khorasan phase= On June 9, 747 (Ramadan 25, 129AH), Abu Muslim successfully initiated an open revolt against Umayyad rule,The Cambridge History of Iran, p. 62. Ed. Richard N. Frye. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975. which was carried out under the sign of the Black Standard.Bernard Lewis, The Middle East, Introduction, first page on the Abbasid Caliphate.The Cambridge History of Islam, vol. 1A, p. 102. Eds. Peter M. Holt, Ann K.S. Lambton and Bernard Lewis. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995. Close to 10,000 soldiers were under Abu Muslim's command when the hostilities officially began in Merv. On February 14, 748 he established control of Merv, expelling Nasr ibn Sayyar less than a year after the latter had put down Ibn Surayj's revolt, and dispatched an army westwards.Matthew Gordon, The Rise of Islam, p. 47. Newly commissioned Abbasid officer Qahtaba ibn Shabib al-Ta'i, along with his sons Al-Hasan ibn Qahtaba and Humayd ibn Qahtaba, pursued Ibn Sayyar to Nishapur and then pushed him further west to Qumis, in western Iran.G.R. Hawting, The First Dynasty of Islam, p. 116. That August, al-Ta'i defeated an Umayyad force of 10,000 at Gorgan. Ibn Sayyar regrouped with reinforcements from the Caliph at Rey, only for that city to fall as well as the Caliph's commander; once again, Ibn Sayyar fled west and died on December 9, 748 while trying to reach Hamedan. Al-Ta'i rolled west through Khorasan, defeating a 50,000 strong Umayyad force at Isfahan in March 749. At Nahavand, the Umayyads attempted to make their last stand in Khorasan. Umayyad forces fleeing Hamedan and the remainder of Ibn Sayyar's men joined with those already garrisoned. Qahtaba defeated an Umayyad relief contingent from Syria while his son al-Hasan laid siege to Nahavand for more than two months. The Umayyad military units from Syria within the garrison cut a deal with the Abbasids, saving their own lives by selling out the Umayyad units from Khorasan who were all put to death. After almost ninety years, Umayyad rule in Khorasan had finally come to an end. At the same time that al-Ta'i took Nishapur, Abu Muslim was strengthening the Abbasid grip on the Muslim far east. Abbasid governors were appointed over Transoxiana and Bactria, while the rebels who had signed a peace accord with Nasr ibn Sayyar were also offered a peace deal by Abu Muslim only to be double crossed and wiped out. With the pacification of any rebel elements in the east and the surrender of Nahavand in the west, the Abbasids were the undisputed rulers of Khorasan. =Mesopotamia phase= Balami depicting As-Saffah as he receives pledges of allegiance in Kufa The Abbasids wasted no time in continuing from Khorosan into Mesopotamia. In August 749, Umayyad commander Yazid ibn Umar al-Fazari attempted to meet the forces of al-Ta'i before they could reach Kufa. Not to be outdone, the Abbasids launched a nighttime raid on al-Fazari's forces before they had a chance to prepare. During the raid, al- Ta'i himself was finally killed in battle. Despite the loss, al-Fazari was routed and fled with his forces to Wasit.G.R. Hawting, The First Dynasty of Islam, pp. 116‚Äì117. The Siege of Wasit took place from that August until July 750. Although a respected military commander had been lost, a large portion of the Umayyad forces were essentially trapped inside Wasit and could be left in their virtual prison while more offensive military actions were made.G.R. Hawting, The First Dynasty of Islam, p. 117. Concurrently with the siege in 749, the Abbasids crossed the Euphrates and took Kufa. The son of Khalid al- Qasri ‚Äì a disgraced Umayyad official who had been tortured to death a few years prior ‚Äì began a pro-Abbasid riot starting at the city's citadel. On September 2, 749, al-Hasan bin Qahtaba essentially just walked right in to the city and set up shop. Some confusion followed when Abu Salama, an Abbasid officer, pushed for an Alid leader. Abu Muslim's confidante Abu Jahm reported what was happening, and the Abbasids acted preemptively. On Friday, November 28, 749, before the siege of Wasit had even finished, As-Saffah, the great- grandson of Muhammad's uncle, al-Abbas, was recognized as the new caliph in the mosque at Kufa.\\"Mahdi.\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam, p. 1,233. 2nd. ed. Eds. Peri Bearman, Clifford Edmund Bosworth, Wolfhart Heinrichs et al. Abu Salama, who witnessed twelve military commanders from the revolution pledging allegiance, was embarrassed into following suit. Just as quickly as Qahtaba's forces marched from Khorosan to Kufa, so did the forces of Abdallah ibn Ali and Abu Awn Abd al-Malik ibn Yazid march on Mosul. At this point Marwan II mobilized his troops from Harran and advanced toward Mesopotamia. On January 16, 750 the two forces met on the left bank of a tributary of the Tigris in the Battle of the Zab, and nine days later Marwan II was defeated and his army was completely destroyed.Bertold Spuler, The Muslim World a Historical Survey, Part 1: the Age of the Caliphs, p. 49. 2nd ed. Leiden: Brill Archive, 1968. The battle is regarded as what finally sealed the fate of the Umayyads. All Marwan II could do was flee through Syria and into Egypt, with each Umayyad town surrendering to the Abbasids as they swept through in pursuit. Damascus fell to the Abbasids in April, and in August Marwan II and his family were tracked down by a small force led by Abu Awn and Salih ibn Ali (the brother of Abdallah ibn Ali) and killed in Egypt. Al-Fazari, the Umayyad commander at Wasit, held out even after the defeat of Marwan II in January. The Abbasids promised him amnesty in July, but immediately after he exited the fortress they executed him instead. After almost exactly three years of rebellion, the Umayyad state came to an end. Tactics =Ethnic equality= Militarily, the unit organization of the Abbasids was designed with the goal of ethnic and racial equality among supporters. When Abu Muslim recruited mixed Arab and Iranian officers along the Silk Road, he registered them based not on their tribal or ethno-national affiliations but on their current places of residence. This greatly diminished tribal and ethnic solidarity and replaced both concepts with a sense of shared interests among individuals. =Propaganda= The Abbasid Revolution provides an early medieval example of the effectiveness of propaganda. The Black Standard unfurled at the start of the revolution's open phase carried messianic overtones due to past failed rebellions by members of Muhammad's family, with marked eschatological and millennial slants. The Abbasids ‚Äì their leaders descended from Muhammad's uncle Al-‚ÄòAbbas ibn ‚ÄòAbd al-Muttalib ‚Äì held vivid historical reenactments of the murder of Muhammad's grandson Husayn ibn Ali by the army of the second Umayyad ruler Yazid I, followed by promises of retribution. Focus was carefully placed on the legacy of Muhammad's family while details of how the Abbasids actually intended to rule were not mentioned.Bertold Spuler, The Muslim World a Historical Survey, p. 48. While the Umayyads had primarily spent their energy on wiping out the Alid line of the prophetic family, the Abbasids carefully revised Muslim chronicles to put a heavier emphasis on the relationship between Muhammad and his uncle. The Abbasids spent more than a year preparing their propaganda drive against the Umayyads. There were a total of seventy propagandists throughout the province of Khorasan, operating under twelve central officials.G.R. Hawting, The Final Dynasty of Islam, p. 114. =Secrecy= The Abbasid Revolution was distinguished by a number of tactics which were absent in the other, unsuccessful anti-Umayyad rebellions at the time. Chief among them was secrecy. While the Shi'ite and other rebellions at the time were all led by publicly known leaders making clear and well-defined demands, the Abbasids hid not only their identities but also their preparation and mere existence.Jonathan Berkey, The Formation of Islam: Religion and Society in the Near East, 600‚Äì1800, p. 104. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003. As-Saffah would go on to become the first Abbasid caliph, but he did not come forward to receive the pledge of allegiance from the people until after the Umayyad caliph and a large number of his princes were already killed. Abu Muslim al-Khorasani, who was the primary Abbasid military commander, was especially mysterious; even his name, which literally means \\"father of a Muslim from the large, flat area of the eastern Muslim empire\\" gave no meaningful information about him personally. Even today, although scholars are sure he was one real, consistent individual, there is broad agreement that all concrete suggestions of his actual identity are doubtful. Abu Muslim himself discouraged inquiries about his origins, emphasizing that his religion and place of residence were all that mattered. Whoever he was, Abu Muslim built a secret network of pro-Abbasid sentiment based among the mixed Arab and Iranian military officers along the Silk Road garrison cities. Through this networking, Abu Muslim ensured armed support for the Abbasids from a multi-ethnic force years before the revolution even came out in the open. These networks proved essential, as the officers garrisoned along the Silk Road had spent years fighting the ferocious Turkic tribes of Central Asia and were experienced and respected tacticians and warriors. Aftermath National borders in the region by 800AD The victors desecrated the tombs of the Umayyads in Syria, sparing only that of Umar II, and most of the remaining members of the Umayyad family were tracked down and killed. When Abbasids declared amnesty for members of the Umayyad family, eighty gathered in Jaffa to receive pardons and all were massacred.Michael A. Palmer, The Last Crusade: Americanism and the Islamic Reformation, p. 40. Lincoln: Potomac Books, 2007. In the immediate aftermath, the Abbasids moved to consolidate their power against former allies now seen as rivals. Five years after the revolution succeeded, Abu Muslim was accused of heresy and treason by the second Abbasid caliph al-Mansur. Abu Muslim was executed at the palace in 755 despite his reminding al-Mansur that it was he (Abu Muslim) who got the Abbasids into power, and his travel companions were bribed into silence. Displeasure over the caliph's brutality as well as admiration for Abu Muslim led to rebellions against the Abbasid Dynasty itself throughout Khorasan and Kurdistan.Arthur Goldschmidt, A Concise History of the Middle East, pp. 76‚Äì77. Boulder: Westview Press, 2002. Although Shi'ites were key to the revolution's success, Abbasid attempts to claim orthodoxy in light of Umayyad material excess led to continued persecution of Shi'ites. On the other hand, non-Muslims regained the government posts they had lost under the Umayyads. Jews, Nestorian Christians, Zoroastrians and even Buddhists were re-integrated into a more cosmopolitan empire centered around the new, ethnically and religiously diverse city of Baghdad. The Abbasids were essentially puppets of secular rulers starting from 950, though their lineage as nominal caliphs continued until 1258 when the Mongol hordes killed the last Abbasid caliph in Baghdad. The period of actual, direct rule by the Abbasids lasted almost exactly two-hundred years.Andrew Marsham, , p. 16. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010. One grandson of Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik, Abd ar-Rahman I, survived and established a kingdom in Al-Andalus (Moorish Iberia) after five years of travel westward. Over the course of thirty years, he ousted the ruling Fihrids and resisted Abbasid incursions to establish the Emirate of C√≥rdoba.Roger Collins,The Arab Conquest of Spain, 710‚Äì797, pp. 113‚Äì140 & 168‚Äì182. Hoboken: Wiley-Blackwell. Simon Barton, A History of Spain, p. 37. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004. This is considered an extension of the Umayyad Dynasty, and ruled from Cordoba from 756 until 1031. Legacy The Abbasid Revolution has been of great interest to both Western and Muslim historians. According to State University of New York professor of sociology Sa√Ød Amir Arjomand, analytical interpretations of the revolution are rare, with most discussions simply lining up behind either the Iranic or Arabic interpretation of events. Frequently, early European historians viewed the conflict solely as a non-Arab uprising against Arabs. Bernard Lewis, professor emeritus of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, points out that while the revolution has often been characterized as a Persian victory and Arab defeat, the caliph was still Arab, the language of administration was still Arabic and Arab nobility was not forced to give up its land holdings; rather, the Arabs were merely forced to share the fruits of the empire equally with other races. Al-Ukhaidir Fortress, an early example of Abbasid architecture C.W. Previt√©-Orton argues that the reasons for the decline of the Umayyads was the rapid expansion of Islam. During the Umayyad period, mass conversions brought Iranians, Berbers, Copts, and Assyrians to Islam. These \\"clients,\\" as the Arabs referred to them, were often better educated and more civilised than their Arab masters. The new converts, on the basis of equality of all Muslims, transformed the political landscape. Previt√©-Orton also argues that the feud between the Arabs in Syria and the Arabs in Mesopotamia further weakened the empire.C.W. Previt√©-Orton, The Shorter Cambridge Medieval History, vol. 1, p. 239. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1971. The revolution led to the enfranchisement of non-Arab people who had converted to Islam, granting them social and spiritual equality with Arabs.Fred Astren, Karaite Judaism and Historical Understanding, p. 34. With social restrictions removed, Islam changed from an Arab ethnic empire to a universal world religion. This led to a great cultural and scientific exchange known as the Islamic Golden Age, with most achievements taking place under the Abbasids. What was later known as Islamic civilization and culture was defined by the Abbasids, rather than the earlier Rashidun and Umayyad caliphates. New ideas in all areas of society were accepted regardless of their geographic origin, and the emergence of societal institutions that were Islamic rather than Arab began. Though a class of Muslim clergy was absent for the first century of Islam, it was with the Abbasid Revolution and after that the Ulama appeared as a force in society, positioning themselves as the arbiters of justice and orthodoxy. With the eastward movement of the capital from Damascus to Baghdad, the Abbasid Empire eventually took on a distinctly Persian character, as opposed to the Arab character of the Umayyads. Rulers became increasingly autocratic, at times claiming divine right in defense of their actions. Historiography An accurate and comprehensive history of the revolution has proven difficult to compile for a number of reasons. There are no contemporary accounts, and most sources were written more than a century after the revolution.The Umayyads: The Rise of Islamic Art, p. 41.Kathryn Babayan, Mystics, Monarchs, and Messiahs: Cultural Landscapes of Early Modern Iran, p. 150. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Center for Middle Eastern Studies, 2002. Because most historical sources were written under Abbasid rule, the description of the Umayyads must be taken with a grain of salt;Jacob Lassner, The Middle East Remembered: Forged Identities, Competing Narratives, p. 56. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2000. such sources describe the Umayyads, at best, as merely placeholders between the Rashidun and Abbasid Caliphates.Tarif Khalidi, Islamic Historiography: The Histories of Mas'udi, p. 145. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1975. The historiography of the revolution is especially significant due to Abbasid dominance of most early Muslim historical narratives;Muhammad Qasim Zaman, Religion and Politics Under the Early  ªAbbƒÅsids: The Emergence of the Proto-Sunnƒ´ Elite, p. 6. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1997. it was during their rule that history was established in the Muslim world as an independent field separate from writing in general.E. Sreedharan, A Textbook of Historiography, 500 B.C. to A.D. 2000, p. 65. Hyderabad: Orient Blackswan, 2004. The initial two-hundred year period when the Abbasids actually held de facto power over the Muslim world coincided with the first composition of Muslim history. Another point of note is that while the Abbasid Revolution carried religious undertones against the irreligious and almost secular Umayyads, a separation of mosque and state occurred under the Abbasids as well. Historiographical surveys often focus on the solidifying of Muslim thought and rites under the Abbasids, with the conflicts between separated classes of rulers and clerics giving rise to the empire's eventual separation of religion and politics.Muhammad Qasim Zaman, Religion and Politics Under the Early  ªAbbƒÅsids, p. 7.

As the most serious threat to Guatemala's liberty and sovereignty as a republic, it was the most important military victory in the country's history as an independent state. Background After Rafael Carrera returned from exile in 1849, the Salvadorean ruler, Doroteo Vasconcelos, granted asylum to the Guatemalan liberals, who harassed the Guatemalan government in several different forms: Don Jos√© Francisco Barrundia did it through a liberal newspaper that had been established with that specific goal; Vasconcelos gave support during a whole year to a rebel faction \\"La Monta√±a\\", in eastern Guatemala, providing and distributing money and weapons. By late 1850, Vasconcelos was getting impatient due to the slowness of the progress of the war with Guatemala and decided to plan an open attack. Under that circumstance, the Salvadorean head of state started a campaign against the conservative Guatemalan regime, inviting Honduras and Nicaragua to participate in the alliance; only the Honduran government led by Don Juan Lindo accepted. Meanwhile, in Guatemala, where the invasion plans were perfectly well-known, President Don Mariano Paredes started taking precautions to face the situation, while the Guatemalan Archbishop, Don Francisco de Paula Garc√≠a Pel√°ez, ordered peace prayers in the archdiocese. On 4 January 1851, Vasconcelos and Lindo met in Ocotepeque, Honduras, where they signed an alliance against Guatemala. The Salvadorean army had 4,000 men, properly trained and armed and supported by artillery; the Honduran army numbered 2,000 men. The coalition army was stationed in Metap√°n, El Salvador, due to its proximity with both the Guatemalan and Honduran borders. Declaration of war On 28 January 1851, the Salvadorean president sent a letter to the Guatemalan Ministry of Foreign Relations, in which he stated the following: # He demanded that the Guatemalan president relinquish power, so that the alliance could designate a new head of state loyal to the liberals. # He demanded that Rafael Carrera be exiled, escorted to any of the Guatemalan southern ports by a Salvadorean regiment. # That once the invading alliance took power in Guatemala, they would convene a constituent assembly. # That the Salvadorean army could occupy any Guatemalan territory they deemed necessary, for an indefinite time. The Guatemalan government responded laconically in the following terms: :\\"You have no authority under the laws of San Salvador to make declarations of war, neither can you send troops without permission from the senate. Presenting yourselves armed and declaring war on Guatemala, the government considers you and those in your company as seditious, executing an affront against the sovereignty and freedom of the Republic of Guatemala. We cannot therefore do anything else than communicate to the Commander in Chief of the Guatemalan Army, the announcement that you will send your troops into this territory, so that he takes the appropriate measures to preserve the honor and sovereignty of the Republic. May God guard you many years.\\" Battle The Allied army entered Guatemalan territory at three different places. On 29 January, a 500-man contingent entered through Pi√±uelas, Agua Blanca and Jutiapa, led by General Vicente Baquero, but the majority of the invading force marched from Metap√°n. The Allied army of 4,500 men was commanded by the following: * Doroteo Vasconcelos, President of El Salvador and Commander in Chief. * General Isidoro Saget, Chief of Staff of the Army, was an experienced French soldier, who had participated in prior wars against Guatemala. * General Jos√© Santos Guardiola, commander of the 1st Division. * General Ram√≥n Belloso, commander of the 2nd Division. * General Indalecio Cordero, commander of the 3rd Division. * General Domingo Asturias, commander of the 4th Division. * General Jos√© Trinidad Caba√±as, commander of the Honduran Division. * General Gerardo Barrios, commander of the \\"San Miguel\\" Division. Additional troops were led by the Salvadorean General Ciriaco Bran y Carrascosa and by the liberal Guatemalan Generals Jos√© Dolores Nufio and Doroteo Monterroso. Guatemala was able to recruit 2,000 men, led by: * Lieutenant General Rafael Carrera, Commander in Chief. * Colonel Manuel Mar√≠a Bola√±os. * Colonel Vicente Cerna Sandoval, Corregidor (Mayor) of Chiquimula. * Colonel Ignacio Garc√≠a Granados, commander of the 1st Division. * Colonel Joaqu√≠n Solares, commander of the 2nd Division. * Lieutenant Colonel Leandro Navas, commander of the Rearguard. * Colonel Mariano √Ålvarez, Artillery officer. Carrera's strategy was to feign a retreat, forcing the enemy forces to follow the \\"retreating\\" troops to a place he had previously chosen; on February 1, 1851, both armies were facing each other with only the San Jos√© river between them. Carrera had fortified the foothills of La Arada, its summit about above the level of the river. A meadow deep lay between the hill and the river, and boarding the meadow was a sugar cane plantation. Carrera divided his army in three sections: the left wing was led by Cerna and Solares; the right wing led by Bola√±os. He personally led the central battalion, where he placed his artillery. Five hundred men stayed in Chiquimula to defend the city and to aid in a possible retreat, leaving only 1,500 Guatemalans against an enemy of 4,500. = February 2nd, 1851= The battle began at 8:30 AM, when Allied troops initiated an attack at three different points, with an intense fire opened by both armies. The first Allied attack was repelled by the defenders of the foothill; during the second attack, the Allied troops were able to take the first line of trenches. They were subsequently expelled. During the third attack, the Allied force advanced to a point where it was impossible to distinguish between Guatemalan and Allied troops. Then, the fight became a melee, while the Guatemalan artillery severely punished the invaders. At the height of the battle when the Guatemalans faced an uncertain fate, Carrera ordered that sugar cane plantation around the meadow to be set on fire. The invading army was now surrounded: to the front, they faced the furious Guatemalan fire, to the flanks, a huge fire and to the rear, the river, all of which made retreat very difficult. The central division of the Allied force panicked and started a disorderly retreat. General Saget ordered a retreat for the division of General Caba√±as. The Honduran division which was fighting alongside the Salvadoreans in the center also retreated in panic. Soon, all of the Allied troops started retreating, but more than a retreat, it was a rout. Guatemalan historian Francis Polo Sifontes describes the scene after the battle: :\\"...around five in the afternoon, the fire was less intense and the eastern sun illuminated a terrible scene: amid the smoke and ash, the field was full of corpses. When the battle came to an end, people noticed that the Guatemalan Chief was nowhere to be seen; the search for his body started and he was found, alive, on his back under the shadow of a tree, with his arms crossed and breathing slowly; his right hand still brandished his sabre, covered in blood. He could not let go of it because his swollen hand did not allow it.\\" The 500 men of the rearguard under Colonel Navas were still fresh and pursued what was left of the Allied army, which desperately fled for the borders of their respective countries. The final count of the Allied losses were 528 dead, 200 prisoners, 1,000 rifles, 13,000 rounds of ammunition, many pack animals and baggage, 11 drums and seven artillery pieces. Polo Sifontes also noted: \\"...President Vasconcelos sought refuge in El Salvador, while two Generals mounted on the same horse were seen crossing the Honduran border.\\" Carrera regrouped his army and crossed the Salvadorean border, occupying Santa Ana, before he received orders from the Guatemalan President, Mariano Paredes, to return to Guatemala, since the Allies were requesting a cease-fire and a peace treaty. Consequences As an immediate result of the triumph of the Guatemalan Army at La Arada, a National Constituent Assembly enacted, on October 19, 1851, a Fundamental Letter of Government, called Acta Constitutiva de la Rep√∫blica (\\"Constitutive Act of the Republic\\"). It was brief, with only 18 articles, but established the general principles of the Republic of Guatemala, which had been formed four years earlier. The battle of La Arada represented the dominance of Guatemala in Central America and ensured a period of restoration, security and economic progress. It also marked the beginning of Rafael Carrera's position as President for Life.
