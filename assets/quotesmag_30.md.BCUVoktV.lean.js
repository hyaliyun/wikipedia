Lira won the Chicago Novice Golden Gloves championship at middleweight. As a professional, Lira went on to win the United States Boxing Association lightweight title by knocking out undefeated, Andrew Ganigan in the sixth round in August 1978, having started his pro career undefeated in his first 18 professional bouts. In August 1979, Lira fought for the World Boxing Association Lightweight title and lost to then champion Ernesto Espana in his only world title opportunity. Before losing, Lira had knocked Espana down to the canvas, but was unable to finish him. Lira boxed professionally from 1976 to 1984, compiling a record of 29 wins, 6 losses, and 1 draw, with 16 knockouts. Lira retired at age 34 after a ten round decision loss to Russell Mitchell in Illinois in 1984. Life After boxing Lira later underwent liver transplant surgery to save his life. Appearing in relatively good health for many years after 'the fight of his life', Lira taught amateur boxing to children at the Union League Boys and Girls Club, and made public appearances at boxing cards in the Chicago area. Lira died of Stage 3 of 4 CTE (not liver disease as many think) at age 61 in his native Chicago, Illinois, on Saturday, December 8, 2012. His brain was donated to Boston University, where CTE was observed. He was survived by his four children: daughters and his son.

He is the founder and current director of the Western Writers' Centre in Galway. He co-founded the Irish Writers' Co-operative in 1974, and founded Galway's annual C√∫irt International Festival of Literature in 1986.  Life  Johnson was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, into a mixed, unorthodox background: his father's side were Belfast, Methodist, and both Unionist and Trade unionist; his mother's side were Dublin, Catholic, followers of Michael Collins and admirers of the Queen. He spent the first seven years of his life in Toronto, Canada. He went to St Malachy's College's grammar school in Belfast from 1962‚Äì68. During these years he learnt guitar and banjo and listened to and played folk music. He performed on the cabaret lounge circuit, made appearances on Ulster TV, released some singles and, aged 16, an LP of rebel and football songs called The Flags Are Out for Celtic. After school he moved to Dublin and worked in journalism, writing for the Evening Press and The Belfast Telegraph, and in Public Relations. He had several prose pieces published in the New Irish Writing section (edited by David Marcus) of the Evening Press, and won a Hennessy Literary Award (the judges being V. S. Pritchett and James Plunkett) in 1972. In 1974 he met up with Neil Jordan and Peter Sheridan to found the Irish Writers' Co-operative, a publishing outlet for new Irish fiction. Early publications under its imprint Co-op Books were Desmond Hogan's The Ikon Maker (1976) and Ronan Sheehan's Tennis Players (1977). He moved to Galway in 1978 and in 1979 published his first collection of poems, Life and Death in the Midlands, and a collection of short stories, Picture of a Girl in a Spanish Hat. In 1986 he founded the poetry festival C√∫irt, which became an annual literary festival in Galway and is now one of the largest of its kind in Ireland. He ended his association with it in 1988. In the 1990s he formed an Irish traditional folk group, Parson's Hat, which released two albums: Cutty Wren and The Better Match. Tracks by the group have been included on a number of compilation albums. In 2000 he received the Prix de l'Ambassade Translation bursary to work on translations of the French poet Michel Martin. He has also translated the Senegalese poet Babacar Sall, and more recently the Breton poet Colette Wittorski. In 2004 he received The Ireland Fund of Monaco bursary to be writer-in-residence for a month at the Princess Grace Irish Library in Monaco, where he continued working on his novel-in-progress The Neon Rose (published 2007), wrote some new poems, and sourced some Mon√©gasque poems which he later translated. In 2005 he founded the Western Writers' Centre, or in Irish Ionad Scr√≠bhneoiri Chaitl√≠n Maude (the Caitl√≠n Maude Writers' Centre, after the Galway Gaeltacht poet), which bills itself as \\"the only writers' centre West of the Shannon\\". The centre holds readings, lectures, workshops and courses, and organises the Gort literary festival. He has released two solo albums, Get You and Local Papers. Johnston has been a regular poetry reviewer for Poetry Ireland Review and Books Ireland and on occasion for the Southern Humanities Review, The Irish Times and Harpers & Queen, and has contributed to the literary magazines Orbis, New Letters, The Southern Review, The Seneca Review, and Irish Studies Review.

Flower Power is a photograph taken by American photographer Bernie Boston for the now-defunct newspaper The Washington Star. Taken on October 21, 1967, during the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam's \\"March on The Pentagon\\", the photo shows a Vietnam War protester placing a carnation into the barrel of an M14 rifle held by a soldier of the 503rd Military Police Battalion. It was nominated for the 1967 Pulitzer Prize. Events The National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam's \\"March on The Pentagon\\" took place on October 21, 1967. When the antiwar demonstrators approached The Pentagon, they were confronted by a squad of soldiers from the 503rd Military Police Battalion. The soldiers pointed their rifles, marched into the crowd and formed a semicircle around the demonstrators to prevent them from climbing the Pentagon steps. Washington Star newspaper photographer Bernie Boston had been assigned by his editor to cover the demonstration. Boston was sitting on a wall at the Mall Entrance which allowed him to see the events unfold. In a 2005 interview he said, \\"When I saw the sea of demonstrators, I knew something had to happen. I saw the troops march down into the sea of people and I was ready for it.\\" A young man emerged from the crowd of demonstrators and started placing carnations into the barrels of their rifles. Boston captured the moment in what would become an iconic image and his signature photograph. When Boston showed the photograph to his editor at The Washington Star, \\"the editor didn't see the importance\\" and the picture was run on a page deep inside the newspaper. It was after Boston entered it into photography competitions, which it won, that it gained recognition. Legacy Identity of the demonstrator Young protesters at \\"March on The Pentagon\\" on 21 October 1967. The young man in the photo is most commonly identified as George Edgerly Harris III, an 18-year-old actor from New York who moved to San Francisco in 1967. Harris performed under the stage name of Hibiscus and co-founded The Cockettes, a \\"flamboyant, psychedelic gay-themed drag troupe.\\" Harris died in the early 1980s during the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Paul Krassner, in a 2008 article in the Huffington Post, said the young man in the photo was Joel \\"Super-Joel\\" Tornabene, a counter-culture leader of the Youth International Party who lived in Berkeley, California in the 1960s. Tornabene died in Mexico in 1993. Symbolic significance A young woman offers a flower as a symbol of peace to a military police officer at \\"March on The Pentagon\\", 21 October 1967. The Flower power movement began in Berkeley, California as a means of symbolic protest against the Vietnam War. Beat Generation writer Allen Ginsberg, in his November 1965 essay How to Make a March/Spectacle, promoted the use of \\"masses of flowers\\" to hand to policemen, press, politicians and spectators to civilly fight violence with peace. The use of nonviolent objects such as toys, flags, candy and music were intended to show that the movement was not associated with anger or violence. Members of the movement even went as far as trying to negate the rallies of the Hells Angels motorcycle gang who supported the war. Cultural significance Flower Power was nominated for the 1967 Pulitzer Prize. It had an influential effect on both the antiwar movement of the sixties, and as a visual representation of how photojournalism can help with a movement. Specific exhibits and discussions have been curated solely around the photograph to display the political, cultural and social aspects of the Flower power movement. The exhibit From Kennedy to Kent State: Images of a Generation, was shown at Worcester Art Museum in Worcester, Massachusetts, which displayed Boston's image as a large gelatin silver print. The image was included as a representation of the antiwar movement. In 1993, the National Press Photographers Association presented Boston with its highest honor, the Joseph A. Sprague Memorial Award‚Äî\\"the honor recognizes a working photojournalist who advances, elevates, or attains unusual recognition for the profession by their conduct, initiative, leadership, skill, and devotion to duty.\\" Flower Power continues to be used as an iconic image of the 1960s.

Alc√°ntara (born in Caracas on June 27, 1898 and died December 2, 1991) was a plastic artist, urban developer, thinker and businessman. He was one of the founders of the impressionist/pointillist movement in Venezuela and founding member of the School of Caracas. Painter of Avila He was well known for his novel chromatic interpretations of the Caracas Valley, the Avila Mountains, the Litoral Central as well as other landscapes around the world. His paintings attracted attention not only for the quality of his craft but for his unique technique that captured the essence of midday tropical light and sunsets. The importance of his work earned him the name \\"Painter of Avila\\", an honor he shares with his contemporary Manuel Cabr√© - (January 25, 1890 ‚Äì February 26, 1984). His fruitful career spanned over eight decades, although he was most prolific between 1915 and 1930 and 1950 and 1980. Antonio Alcantara painted all over Venezuela, Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe and Asia. Between 1925 and 1950 he dedicated the bulk of his time to private business in order to provide support to his extensive family. As businessman, Alcantara developed large portions of the San Agustin neighborhood in Caracas (residential housing), upscale residential housing in what is now the Chacao District, La Guaira and many buildings throughout the city. Education Antonio Alcantara studied at the Caracas School of Fine Arts (1917‚Äì1923), under the guidance of Cruz √Ålvarez Garc√≠a, Pedro Zerpa, and other leading artists of that generation. Early in his career, he was awarded a scholarship to study in Paris, but the outbreak of World War I led to the cancellation of his studies in Europe. Throughout his adult life, Alcantara travelled to Europe, where he spent significant periods of time independently studying the old masters. At the Academy, his friends and classmates included Egea Lopez, Pedro Centeno Vallenilla, Abdon Pinto and Luis Alfredo Lopez Mendez.

The wedding of Nora Augusta Maud Robinson with Alexander Kirkman Finlay, of Glenormiston, was solemnised in St James' Church, Sydney on Wednesday, 7 August 1878 by the Rev. Canon Allwood, assisted by Rev. Hough. The bride was the second daughter of the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Hercules Robinson, GCMG, and his wife. The groom, owner of Glenormiston, a large station in Victoria, was the second son of Alexander Struthers Finlay, of Castle Toward, Argyleshire, Scotland. As this was only the second vice-regal wedding to take place in the colony, it generated enormous public interest. The crowd, estimated at between 8,000 and 10,000, thronged the streets outside the church and a large body of police had trouble preserving order. The wedding was attended by the most important members of Sydney society at the time - leaders, administrators, officials, legislators, naval officers, lawyers and aristocrats, many of whom had Scottish connections. There was extensive coverage in the press around the country, including in The Sydney Morning Herald, The Queanbeyan Age, the South Australian Register, the Australian Town and Country Journal, The Argus, The Wagga Wagga Daily Advertiser and the Riverine Herald.  Wedding service St James' Church (1880s) by Charles Bayliss The first carriages to arrive at the church brought Lady Robinson, Mrs. St. John, Captain St. John, A.D.C., and H. S. Lyttleton, private secretary. The following carriage contained the bridegroom and Captain Standish (chief-commissioner of police in Victoria) as best man. The carriage containing the bride, her father, (the Governor) and the bridesmaids (Miss Nereda Robinson and Miss Neva St. John) came immediately afterwards. The people cheered the arrival of each carriage. The service was performed by Canon Allwood, who was assisted by Rev. Hough. Inside St James', the church was decorated with plants and flowers, which had come from the Botanic Gardens, including \\"palms, tree ferns, crotons, dracoenas, dieffenbachia, and pandanas, and immediately in front was a number of richest orchids and ferns. Among the former were vandas, graccelebium, and a Graeceum sesquapedale and superpetam, which will at once be recognised by florists as among the richest we have here ...\\" The Robinson-Finlay bridal party arrived at the church shortly before 1 o'clock. The bridegroom was accompanied by his best man, Captain Standish, Chief Commissioner of Police in Victoria, and the bride entered the church leaning on the arm of her father, the Governor of New South Wales. The service was accompanied by music provided by a choir and the organ and the bridal couple departing to the music of a wedding march. The bells of the nearby St Mary's Cathedral were rung (St James' had no bells at the time). Wedding breakfast and honeymoon Government House in 1872 The wedding breakfast took place at Government House where the toast to the bride and groom was given by Sir Alfred Stephen, followed by other toasts.

Her head dress comprised a very long soft tulle veil, and a wreath composed of orange blossoms, intermixed with flowers in compliment to the Scottish bridegroom: heather and myrtle. Public reaction There was intense public interest in the event, the second vice-regal wedding in the history of the colony. Ite predecessor was the marriage of Sir Edward Deas Thomson, C.B., K.C.M.G., with the daughter of Governor Sir Richard Bourke. The press reported that eight to ten thousand onlookers \\"...thronged King street from Macquarie Street to Elizabeth Street, and gave a large body of police great trouble to preserve order ... the crushing and screaming were almost continuous\\". > King-street from Elizabeth-street to Macquarie-street, was thronged, and it > became exceedingly difficult for the police, who were present in > considerable force under Mr. sub-inspector Anderson, to preserve anything > like order.

The company began with a financial backing of ¬£6,000 which was soon increased to ¬£10,000. \\"In 1840 Niel Black‚Äôs men were nearly all Highlanders brought out under the bounty immigration scheme.\\" Melbourne and Adelaide had been linked by telegraph for since December 1857 and graziers like Niel Black found the service \\"indispensable\\" for making arrangements about the herds. In 1867, the Duke of Edinburgh (the first member of the Royal family to visit Australia), had arrived in the district in late November after visiting Melbourne and sailing to Geelong in his ship the Galatea. He was met by Niel Black and his two sons in full Highland regalia and they escorted him to Glenormiston where a kangaroo shoot had been organised. The Duke had his Highland piper \\"pipe him into dinner\\". Author Anthony Trollope, who travelled extensively in Australia in the 1870s and wrote about each State, said that rich landowners of Victoria erect European country houses \\"with the addition of a wide verandah\\". Glenormiston was one of the homesteads where life at the time continued \\"not only pleasantly, but ... with grace.\\" Trollope's observation was that at this time, life in the Western District must have been like \\"English country life in the eighteenth century\\" when the roads were bad, there was great plenty but not luxury, the men were fond of sport, the women stayed at home and looking after the house was done by the mistress and her daughters or the master and his sons rather than by domestics or servants as in England at the time. Trollope commented that \\"horses are cheap and servants are dear in Victoria.\\" Guests Many dignitaries and colonial leaders - important members of Sydney society at the time - including administrators, officials, naval officers, lawyers and aristocrats, attended the ceremony. Among them were: \\"Hon. Sir Alfred Stephen, C.B., K C.M.G., M.L.C., Lieutenant Governor, and Lady Stephen; Commodore Hoskins, C.B., A.D.C., and several other naval officers; Colonel Roberts, N.S.W.A.; the Hon. Sir John Hay, K,C.M.G., President of the Legislative Council, and Lady Hay; the Hon., Sir George Wigram Allen, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, and Lady Allen; His Honor Sir William Manning and Lady Manning; the Hon. Professor Smith C.M.G., M.L.C., and Mrs. Smith; the Hon. R. Molyneaux; the Hon. Sir George Innes M.L.C., and Lady Innes; Mr. Edward Hill, and Mr. Edward Lee.\\" Gifts The wedding presents, detailed in the press along with the names of their givers, were valuable and numerous. The bride's father gave her \\"a massive gold bracelet\\" and her mother \\"a large gold necklace and locket\\". The best man (Captain Standish) gave solitaire large diamond earrings. Other gifts of jewellery included a gold bracelet and pendant, set with amethyst, diamonds and pearls (from the Hon. Sir George Wigram and Lady Allen); a gold locket with diamond, centre of shamrocks (from Mr. and Mrs. William Gilchrist); a sapphire and diamond ring (from Mrs. Salamon); a diamond bracelet (from the Hon. John Campbell); a gold bracelet set with diamond, sapphire, ruby, and emerald (from the Hon. Sir John Hay and Lady Hay). The list reveals much about the relationship of the giver to the bridal couple, their social standing and what items were regarded as appropriate, beautiful or useful at the time. For example, the children of some guests, such as Master Robinson and Miss Allwood, gave gifts appropriate to their age. Master Robinson - Hercules Arthur Temple (1866-1933) - Nora's brother, gave a silver pencil case. Miss Allwood's gift was a set of doilies, painted from subjects in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The butler at the bride's home (Government House), gave \\"a handsome butter dish\\". Practical gifts included work-baskets, a travelling bag, a biscuit-box, a thimble, an egg-boiler and a photograph-book. Some gifts give a glimpse of items necessary at the time but which are no longer needed or are now less valuable and more disposable. For example, \\"carved ivory\\" hair brushes have been replaced by plastic ones; visiting cards, inkstands and riding whips are no longer in regular use. Some of the gifts and references were consciously Australian. For example, the gift from the Marquis and the Marchioness of Normanby, (the Marquis was at the time Governor of New Zealand) of a writing set was made from silver and blackwood, probably the Australian timber Acacia melanoxylon. The gift from Mrs Bladen Neill of a silk dresspiece was noted as \\"the product of Australian silkworms\\". Subsequent events St Peter's Eaton Square, Belgravia, London The groom returned to Castle Toward, his family home in Scotland, where he died on 29 July 1883 from \\"phthisis\\" (now known as tuberculosis), five years after his marriage.\\"1883 Register of deaths in the Parish of Dunoon, County of Argyle, p.25 He would have been about 38 years old. His will, showing a personal estate of ¬£493 14s. 9d. was proved by his older brother, Colin Campbell Finlay, who was present at Alexander's death and one of his Executors. Four years later, on 8 September 1887, Nora Finlay married Charles Richard Durant (born about 1854) of the Parish of St James, Piccadilly, at the Parish Church of Eaton Square, London. Her son, Noel Fairfax Durant was born in 1889, while their recorded address was 13 Egerton Gardens, London. She died in London on 31 December 1938, leaving an estate of ¬£124,344 7s. 2d. At the time she was a widow living at 22 Emperors-gate, Kensington.

It is the largest species of land snail to be found in Australia. Description Hedleyella falconeri has a helicoid (spiral) shell and grows to a height of about . The colour is some shade of brown marked with radially arranged irregular bands and splotches of black. When the snail is quiescent, the head and foot are retracted into the shell, but these are extended when the animal wants to move around and feed. The upper surface of head and foot has a reticulate pattern in grey and the foot is rimmed with orange. The head bears two pairs of retractable, dark-coloured tentacles, the upper pair, with the eyes on their tips, being twice as long as the lower pair. There is a dark line leading from between the tentacles along the nape of the neck. Distribution and habitat Noisy pitta anvil with broken snail shells Hedleyella falconeri is found in subtropical eastern Australia from Smiths Lake in New South Wales to just north of Brisbane. Its western limit is the Great Dividing Range. It lives on the forest floor among leaf litter and mossy logs and has not been observed to climb up trees to heights of more than . Biology Hedleyella falconeri is nocturnal. It spends the day stationary and may hide itself under a rotting log or similar location but often remains in the open although it is usually at least partially covered in leaf litter. On most nights it starts to move around and feed, favouring wet nights. In a study, the average distance travelled by a snail in any night on which it moved was . It appeared to wander at random and did not seem to have a homing instinct. Hedleyella falconeri is a fungivore and feeds on the fruiting bodies of such fungi as Polyporus varius and the bioluminescent fungus Omphalotus nidiformis. It may also feed on rotting leaves on the forest floor. It is itself eaten by a number of birds including the noisy pitta (Pitta versicolor) which smashes the shell on a hard surface, the Albert's lyrebird (Menura alberti) and the superb lyrebird (Menura novaehollandiae). Hedleyella falconeri is a hermaphrodite and mating usually occurs in February. Two snails come together overnight and each deposits a sac of sperm in a reproductive opening in the other. Fertilisation is internal and some time later, each snail lays a batch of up to twenty eggs. These are cream coloured and nearly spherical, weigh and measure in diameter. The eggs are buried in a cavity under the leaf litter and take about six weeks to hatch. The juvenile snails that emerge are about long and grow slowly.

He was Minister of Justice from 1984 to 1988 and subsequently served twice as Secretary-General of the Presidency, from 1988 to 1991 and from 2008 to 2011. He also served as Ombudsman from 2011 to 2012. Sissoko was appointed as Prime Minister in the evening of 11 December 2012 shortly after the arrest of his predecessor, Cheick Modibo Diarra, by the leaders of the March 2012 coup d'etat; Diarra had been forced to resign. Early life Sissoko studied the National School of Administration in Mali and France's University of Caen, International Institute of Public Administration and the University of Rouen. Civil service From 1972 to 1979, Sissoko was successively the Deputy Director and Director of Prison Services, as well as Director of the Central Prison of Bamako, the Malian capital. Subsequently he was the National Director of the Civil Service and Personnel from 1982 to 1983 and Director of the Cabinet of the Minister of Labor and the Civil Service from 1983 to 1984. Sissoko has also worked for the IMF, World Bank, African Development Bank and the Islamic Development Bank. Politics Sissoko entered the government as Minister of Justice in December 1984; he held that position until February 1988, when he was appointed as Secretary-General of the Presidency. He was Secretary-General of the Presidency until the ouster of Moussa Traor√© in March 1991, obtaining the rank of Minister in June 1989. Sissoko worked as a consultant from 1994 to 2002. He then became Director of the Cabinet of the Prime Minister on 13 November 2002, and after serving in that post for over five years, he was instead appointed to his former position as Secretary-General of the Presidency, with the rank of Minister, on 26 January 2008. He was succeeded as Director of the Cabinet of the Prime Minister by Sanoussi Tour√© on 4 February 2008. Sissoko was then appointed to the post of Ombudsman on 18 May 2011. Prime Minister Sissoko was appointed as Prime Minister of Mali on 11 December 2012 following the arrest by the perpetrators of the 2012 Malian coup d'etat and subsequent resignation of his predecessor Cheick Modibo Diarra. His appointment was announced on state television. Tensions between the military and Diarra, who was appointed due to external pressure, arose after he supported an ECOWAS intervention force of 3,300 troops to Azawad, which ran counter to Malian military opposition to foreign intervention instead of simple financial and logistical support. It also came a day after European Union's support for a 250-member training mission for about four battalions of the Malian army. Meanwhile, the coerced resignation of Diarra was condemned by the UN; however, Captain Amadou Sanogo said it was not coerced, only facilitated, by the military. His appointment also followed assurances from President Dioncounda Traor√© to appoint a civilian prime minister within 24 hours of Diarra's resignation after the United Nations threatened to impose sanctions over the arrest, with the United Nations Security Council saying it could take \\"appropriate measures\\" against the perpetrators for allegedly undermining Mali's stability. A statement by the UNSC read: \\"The members of the Security Council express their readiness to consider appropriate measures, including targeted sanctions, against those who prevent the restoration of the constitutional order and take actions that undermine stability in Mali;\\" while UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he was \\"troubled\\" by incident which ran counter to what he said was national and international efforts to resolve the political crisis in Mali after the earlier coup d'etat and northern takeover. The events were also condemned by ECOWAS and the United States, who said the military's return to politics was a \\"setback\\" to democracy. The composition of Sissoko's government was announced on 15 December 2012. It was largely unchanged from the previous government, headed by Diarra, but it was more representative of the northern regions, which were occupied by Islamist rebels. Several important portfolios were retained by ministers associated with the coup leaders, illustrating their continued influence over the government.Serge Daniel, \\"Mali's new PM unveils unity government\\", Agence France-Presse, 16 December 2012.

The division was formed three separate times during the course of the war. First Formation The 308th Rifle Division first started forming on 25 December 1941 at Ivanovo in the Moscow Military District. On 7 January 1942, while still forming the division was redesignated the 117th Rifle Division. See the 117th Rifle Division's entry for more information. Second Formation The 308th Rifle Division (2nd formation) was formed in accordance with Order Number 0044 of the Siberian Military District dated 21 March 1942.Armchair general It was formed at Omsk in the Siberian Military District, using 20% Red Army men (active duty), 25% returning wounded veterans, 25% reservists from industry, and 30% new recruits from the classes of 1922-23. Most of the recruits and reservists came from the Omsk and Krasnoyarsk oblasts. When the division left for the west it had 12,133 officers and men assigned. The division remained in the Siberian Military District until May 1942 until it was moved to the west. In late May, the division was assigned to the 8th Reserve Army in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. On 1 June 1942, the division, still with the 8th Reserve Army, was at Saratov. From August 29 to September 6, 1942, the division covered at least 300 kilometers on foot. On 1 August 1942 the 308th Rifle Division was part of the 24th Army in the area of Kotluban. The division joined the active army on 29 August 1942 when it was assigned to the 24th Army on the Stalingrad Front. The first fight in the division took the 24th Army on the territory of the state farm \\"Kotluban.\\" The division had to seize the hamlet of Borodkin and heights of 133.4, 143.8 and 154.2. Division troops backed 217th Tank Brigade, 136 mortars, heavy artillery regiment in 1936. The enemy forces unleashed on the division powerful artillery fire, mortars, aircraft and tanks. By the end of September 1942 the division was assigned to the 62nd Army inside Stalingrad. In the fighting at Stalingrad the division arrived came on the night of October 2, 1942, under Colonel Leontii Gurtev. As part of General V.I. Chuikov's 62nd Army, the division seized positions in the area of the \\"Barricades\\" plant. The division was finally pulled out of the city and the 62nd Army in December with only 500 men still assigned to the division. For its actions at Stalingrad September to December 1942 it was awarded the Order of the Red Banner by an order dated 19 June 1943. Reassigned to the Volga Military District to be rebuilt, the division spent the next several months reconstituting its strength. By 1 March 1943, the division was shipped back to the front and assigned to the Kalinin Front reserves and then to the 11th Army in the STAVKA reserves. The division went back to the front in the 3rd Army of the Bryansk Front in Operation Kutuzov. Distinguishing itself in combat, the division was awarded Guards status and redesignated the 120th Guards Rifle Division. During the remainder of 1943 the division participated in the Orel, Bryansk, and Gomel - Rechitsa operations.Keith Bonn (ed), Slaughterhouse, 2005, 376 As the 308th Rifle Division, the unit had two commanders. Colonel Leontii Nikolaevich Gurt'ev took over the division on 1 March 1942, was promoted to Major General on 7 December 1942, and was killed in action at Pamanlovo on 3 August 1943. For his actions in taking that town, he became a Hero of the Soviet Union posthumously on 27 August 1943. His successor as division commander was Colonel Nikolai Kuz'mich Maslennikov, who took over officially on 4 August 1943 and was promoted to Major General on 22 September 1943. Maslennikov was commander until the 308th became the 120th Guards Rifle Division in September 1943 in accordance with NKO Order Number 285. Third Formation This division was organized as a Red Army national unit from 5 June to 7 July 1944 from the 1st Latvian Riflemen Reserve Regiment at Gorkiy in the Moscow Military District. The division was the last national, \\"ethnic\\" division formed during the war. The division was formed as a Latvian Division under the 130th Latvian Rifle Corps.

The film marks the directorial debut of still photographer Aneesh Upasana while Mammootty's nephew Maqbool Salmaan plays his first lead role. The story is about two person's journey to filmdom and how their life changes on one Friday's matin√©e show. The film's lead role is played by Maqbool Salmaan who had earlier appeared in a short role in A. K. Saajan's Asuravithu. Maqbool is the nephew of noted actor Mammootty. He is the son of Ibrahimkutty, the younger brother of Mammootty who had been a popular star in the miniscreen. The film is produced by AOPL Entertainment which also launched Mammootty's son Dulquer Salmaan earlier the year through Second Show.\\"AOPL presents Maqbool Salman\\" Matinee released on 13 December to positive reviews from critics and audiences. The film was appreciated for its realistic approach and the performances by lead actors. Plot The plot of this film revolves around two people who come from different backgrounds but are united by fate. Najeeb (Maqbool Salmaan) is a youngster from an orthodox background who wishes to be a film star while Savithri (Mythili) is a motherless girl from an economically backward family who lands up in the film industry to escape her abusive father (Sasi Kalinga). The duo get a chance to be the lead pair in a film that appears to be an ordinary love story but turns out to be a sleaze-fest when it releases. The pair, subsequently, is ostracised from society.

It was widely reported that an unofficial ban from the exhibitors came in the wake of AOPL-owned Carnival Cinemas, Angamaly not participating in a theatre strike organised by the Association. But AOPL maintained that the ban was based on a technical error as AOPL Entertainment is a separate private limited company and Carnival belongs to another company though both have some common investors. The ban was lifted after a discussion between AOPL and the Association and the film released on 13 December 2012.\\"Matinee may be delayed\\" Reviews The film opened to mostly positive reviews from critics. Paresh C. Palicha of Rediff.com rated the film and said that the film \\"tackles a dark subject with much conviction.\\" He concluded the review saying, \\"Matinee shows that there are many interesting avenues to explore if you want to tell the story of the film industry other than lampooning the superstars, Sreenivasan style.\\"\\"Review: Matinee is an interesting film\\" Dalton L. of Deccan Chronicle rated the film while appreciating the performances by the lead, editing, cinematography and music. The critic stated: \\"One occasionally stumbles upon a rotten canvas with strokes of a genius or a great canvas tarnished by splashes of awkwardness. Matinee is neither of the extremes; it simply appears to have been created either by two different painters or one with opposing moods / sensibilities.\\" Rating the film , Veeyen of Nowrunning.com said, \\"Matinee is a dark parable that splendidly traces the ever changing contours of human lives. It reaffirms that the human power of endurance is immense and that as individuals we wobble along alleys of hope, fear, distress, anger and regret before turning around and walking down the hope street all over again.\\"\\"Matinee Review\\" IBN Live rated the film and said that the film \\"stands out for its realistic approach.\\"\\"'Matinee' Review: This Malayalam film stands out for its realistic approach\\" Controversies The film courted considerable controversy with the item dance by Mythili. Another row originated when anti-tobacco activists turned against the film, thanks to the movie posters portraying Mythili with a lit cigarette and a bottle of booze. Activists of the Ernakulam district Anti-tobacco Council protested against the film and blackened several posters of the movie in the city. They also filed a petition before the police and the district collector against the movie posters. \\"When youngsters have slowly started quitting and keeping away from cigarettes, this movie has come up with posters of its actor with a cigarette. The movie-makers have failed to put up a statutory warning too. This certainly affects the awareness created by Kerala Voluntary Health Services and other anti-tobacco organisations,\\" said K. S. Dilip Kumar, secretary of the Ernakulam district Anti-tobacco Council. A case was registered by the Health Department against Mythili and the producers of the film on 19 December. Music The film features songs composed by Ratheesh Vegha and Bollywood composer Anand Raj Anand. Anand composed the song \\"Ayalathe Veetile\\" written by Vinukrishnan, an item number featuring Mythili.\\"Malayalam actress Mythili sizzles in Matinee\\" The song was a profound success and hit 4.5 lakh views on YouTube in just two weeks of its release.\\"Music of Malayalam film Matinee was released by Universal Music - a leading music company\\" Gireesh Puthenchery's son Dinanath Puthenchery has penned the lyrics for two of the songs in the movie. Actress Kavya Madhavan has lent her voice to the song \\"Maunamayi Manassil\\" which was also well received among music critics.

It is not formally registered as a professional association, as that would place it under the jurisdiction of Egypt's Ministry of Social Affairs and limit its independence, an outcome the club's members wished to avoid. It considers itself and acts as the de facto representative of Egypt's judges, and has a history of speaking out in favor of judicial independence and political democracy. Any member of the Egyptian judiciary and any Egyptian prosecutor can join it. It has over 9,000 members, including over 90% of Egyptian judges. History In the late 1960s, the Judges' Club criticized what it viewed as the disregard by the government of Egyptian President Gamel Abdel Nasser for the law. In August 1969, the Nasser government dissolved the board of the Judges' Club, announced that the president would appoint its officers, and dismissed over 200 judges in what the judiciary called the \\"Massacre of the Judges\\". Subsequently, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat re-appointed the dismissed judges in 1973, and two years later the Judges' Club re-attained its autonomy. In the late 1970s, the Judges Club' issued statements in support of human rights improvements in Egypt, and greater respect by the government for the rule of law. The 2012 Egyptian protests On 22 November 2012, President Mohamed Morsi issued a decree that immunised his actions from any legal sanction. This and other concurrent acts led to the 2012 Egyptian protests, and the Judges Club called for a strike. In December 2012, Egyptian Prosecutor General Talaat Ibrahim Abdallah filed a complaint charging Judges Club head Ahmed al-Zend and leading opposition figures with espionage and inciting to overthrow the government. Later in December 2012, when President Morsi called for a referendum to be held over the objections of protesters on a 2012 Draft Constitution of Egypt, al-Zend indicated that the Judges Club refused to supervise the referendum, saying: > More than 90 per cent of judges clubs all over Egypt will refrain from the > supervision process ... Judges have always been at the forefront whenever we > are called to perform any patriotic mission, however, this time it‚Äôs > different. Most judges are refraining from monitoring the referendum because > they have sensed severe violation of their authority as well as their > independence. On December 24, Al-Zind was attacked by around a dozen people who threw rocks at him as he left the club‚Äôs headquarters in downtown Cairo, injuring him and sending him to the hospital. Leadership As of 2012, the Chairman of the Club was Judge Ahmed Zend.

Early life and family Lakhajirajsinhji was born Rajput family in Rajkot on 17 December 1885. His father, Bavajirajsinhji, had succeeded to the throne of Rajkot in 1862, aged six, upon the death of his own father, Meramanji IV. Rajkot State, comprising various territories in the interior of Gujarat's Kathiawar peninsula, had been founded in 1611 by Vibhoji (or Vibhaji), a member of the Jadeja clan and a grandson of Sataji, a 16th- century Jam of Nawanagar. Vibhoji had been granted the sanad (authority) to rule the pargana of Sardhar by Jahangir, a Mughal emperor.Brahmbhatt, p. 4 Although Rajkot was at one time occupied by a force led by a Mughal subedar, the rulers of Rajkot were generally able to maintain their independence.Brahmbhatt, p. 5 However, from 1808, Rajkot (and most other Kathiawar states) paid tribute to the Gaekwad rulers of Baroda, under the terms of a settlement arranged by Colonel Alexander Walker, the British resident in Baroda.Brahmbhatt, p. 5‚Äì6 The Walker Settlement largely brought peace to western Gujarat, and in 1820 the British leased land in Rajkot for the purpose of establishing a cantonment.Brahmbhatt, p. 6 The British, succeeding the Mughals as paramount power, leased a further from Rajkot in 1863, allowed by Naniba, Bavajirajsinhji's grandmother and regent.Brahmbhatt, p. 7 However, under the terms of the Minority Administration Act, Naniba was soon removed as regent and replaced by a British-appointed administrator. Rajkot, as the headquarters of the Kathiawar Agency, was often the subject of British attention, and its ruler was consequently granted a nine-gun salute, despite its small size.Brahmbhatt, p. 2 Its importance was further enhanced in 1870 by the establishment of the Rajkumar College, which was attended by many of the Kathiawar rulers' sons. Bavajirajsinhji, who was one of the first to attend the college, was formally invested with the full powers of the gadi in 1876.Brahmbhatt, p. 9 Appreciated by the British for his \\"careful and energetic administration\\", he implemented a number of significant reforms, including the devolution of some of his powers to municipal governments.Brahmbhatt, p. 10 Bavajirajsinhji married eleven times, producing five sons and two daughters.Brahmbhatt, p. 15 Lakhajirajsinhji, the fourth son, was born to Thakurani Anand Kunverba, who was the oldest daughter of Narandevji II, the Raja of Dharampur in southern Gujarat. His three older brothers each died in childhood, making him the heir apparent, and his younger brother, Karasinhji, also died young. Education and sporting career During his early childhood, Lakhajirajsinhji lived in Dharampur with his maternal uncle, Baldevji. He was very close to his uncle and aunt, and also to their daughter, Lal, who was later married to Hari Singh, the future Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir. Her death during pregnancy in 1915 reputedly affected him so much that he retracted an earlier proposal to fight with the British Indian Army in Europe.Brahmbhatt p. 16 Like his father, Lakhajirajsinhji attended the Rajkumar College in Rajkot. His younger brother, Karasinhji, also attended the school at the same time, and their close relationship, unusual among members of royal families, was noted by the college's principal.Brahmbhatt, pp. 16‚Äì17 Regarded well by both his teachers and his peers, Lakhajirajsinhji was a keen participant in school sports, excelling at tennis, polo, athletics, and the equestrian discipline tent-pegging, for which he was awarded a prize by the Governor of Bombay, Lord Northcote.Brahmbhatt, pp. 19‚Äì20 His preferred sport, however, was cricket, and he captained his school against several other similar Kathiawar institutions.Brahmbhatt, p. 18 In 1904, during his final season as a student at the college, he reputedly won several matches with his \\"dashing\\" bowling, with his highest score of 93 runs made against a Wadhwan high school.Brahmbhatt, pp. 18‚Äì19 He also excelled academically, and in his penultimate year was the only student to pass all his classes.Brahmbhatt, p. 21 Lakhajirajsinhji left the Rajkumar College in 1905 for the Imperial Cadet Corps in Dehra Dun, a predecessor of the present Rashtriya Indian Military College and National Defence Academy.Brahmbhatt, p. 22 During his two years at the Imperial Cadet Corps, which trained the sons of both native rulers and Anglo-Indians, Lakhajirajsinhji was again highly regarded.Brahmbhatt, p. 24 He graduated in March 1907.Brahmbhatt, p. 23. During this time, Lakhajirajsinhji maintained his interest in cricket, becoming a patron of the game as well as playing. He visited England several times, and during a 1908 visit played a game for the Gentlemen of England against Oxford University, which was accorded first-class status. In an attempt to anglicise his name, the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack recorded him as \\"Prince Chakorsab\\". Lakhajirajsinhji would play two further first-class matches: one in 1912, for Hindus in the Bombay Quadrangular, and one in 1922, captaining a combined Hindus and Muslims side against a combined Europeans and Parsees side. The latter match was his most successful, and included the first three wickets of his opponents' first innings, on the way to career-best figures of 3/77. Reign Lakhajirajsinhji was invested with the full powers of the gadi in October 1907, at a ceremony in Rajkot conducted by the British resident, Percy Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald had also conducted the installation of Jam Sahib Ranjitsinhji on the gadi of Nawanagar earlier in the year, Ranjitsinhji being another keen cricketer. A conflict arose between Fitzgerald and Lakhajirajsinhji as to the time of the investiture ceremony. Fitzgerald wished to hold the ceremony at 8:30 a.m., so as to beat the heat, but Lakhajirajsinhji had been informed by his astrologers that the optimum time for the ceremony was at 9 o'clock. Fitzgerald appeared to have won out, but on the morning of the ceremony, according to an anecdote, Ranjitsinhji, who had been staying with Fitzgerald at the Thakore Saheb's official residence and was to travel in the same carriage, deliberately delayed his morning ablutions so that their carriage arrived half an hour late. Like his father, Lakhajirajsinhji was considered a progressive ruler, which was encouraged by the British administration of the time. He was in attendance at the Delhi Durbar in 1911, which marked the coronation of George V, Emperor of India, and was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire in June 1918. Encouraging the development of public debate and intellectualism within Rajkot, Lakhajirasinhji established a State Council and State Bank in 1910, as well as a Peoples' Assembly in 1923. He died at the Ranjit Villas Palace in February 1930, and was succeeded firstly by his oldest son, Dharmendrasinhji (1910‚Äì1940), and then by his third son, Pradyumansinhji. Both Pradyumansinhji and his son, Manoharsinhji, also played first-class cricket.

It was the Army's first unit of military artificers and labourers ‚Äì the existing Corps of Engineers was entirely made up of commissioned officers ‚Äì and it replaced the traditional but unreliable practice of employing civilian craftsmen. The company was an immediate success and was responsible for upgrading the British fortress's defences before the Great Siege of Gibraltar. During the siege between 1779‚Äì83, the Soldier Artificer Company played a key role in repairing the damage caused to the fortifications by Spanish bombardments. They also excavated tunnels inside the Rock of Gibraltar to enable the defenders to fire down into the Spanish lines. After the siege, they assisted in rebuilding the civilian settlement at Gibraltar. The Soldier Artificers' numbers were increased several times to a peak of about 250 men organised in two companies. Their success was such that similar units were raised back in Britain to form the Corps of Royal Military Artificers, a predecessor to today's Royal Engineers. The Soldier Artificer Company merged with the Royal Military Artificers in 1797. History Establishment Members of the Soldier Artificer Company in their working dress King's Bastion, built by the Company between 1773‚Äì76 The Soldier Artificer Company was established by Lieutenant Colonel William Green to assist his programme of improvements to the fortifications of Gibraltar. He was posted to the fortress in 1761 as its Senior Engineer and in 1769 he put forward improvement plans which were eventually accepted after much debate. The go-ahead was given in October 1770, when the British Government authorised a major programme of construction works. The works were initially carried out by civilians recruited from England and elsewhere in Europe. They were not subject to military discipline, which made them difficult to manage. The only punishments available for misconduct were reprimands, suspension and dismissal; the latter incurred costs and disruption in having to find replacements. These problems caused significant delays and extra expense in completing the works.Connolly, p. 1 To remedy this situation, Green proposed that a company of military artificers should be raised to work on the fortifications. The garrison had occasionally used the artificing skills of individual soldiers, especially artillerymen, over the previous 70 years. Green's suggestion was welcomed by the Governor and Lieutenant-Governor of Gibraltar and was recommended by them to the Secretary of State for endorsement. It was duly agreed and on 6 March 1772 Royal consent was granted.Connolly, p. 2 A warrant was issued authorising the raising of a 68-man company consisting of one sergeant-adjutant, three sergeants, three corporals, one drummer and 60 privates working variously as stonecutters, masons, miners, lime-burners, carpenters, smiths, gardeners and wheel-makers. Officers of the existing Corps of Engineers (which consisted entirely of commissioned officers) were put in command of the newly established Military Company of Artificers. It was almost immediately renamed the Soldier Artificer Company.Connolly, p. 3 Many of the civilian engineers, including almost all of the non-English ones, were dismissed when the Company was established, though a few of the better qualified and more reliable ones were retained. None took up an offer to join the Company.Connolly, p. 4 There was little difficulty in finding enough men to make up the numbers, as men from the garrison volunteered to join it.Connolly, p. 3 The Company soon proved to be a great improvement on the civilian workforce and a fresh warrant issued on 25 March 1774 authorised its expansion to 93 members, the additions comprising one extra sergeant and corporal and a further 23 private artificers.Connolly, p. 6 This proved to be a great improvement on the previous arrangements. General Robert Boyd, the Lieutenant-Governor of Gibraltar, commended the work of the Company in a letter to Lord Rochford, the Secretary of State: \\"We can depend only upon the artificer company for constant work, and on soldiers occasionally. Had it not been for the artificer company, we should not have made half the progress in the King's Bastion, as well as in the other works of the garrison.\\" The building of the King's Bastion was one of the most important projects carried out by the Company. It was a key fortification positioned on the waterfront between the fortress's old and new moles. The bastion's foundation stone was laid in 1773 but the progress of its construction was slow at first.Connolly, p. 7 It was hindered by the departure of foreign artificers and the loss of manpower resulting from the withdrawal of three Hanoverian regiments which had provided a number of artificers to supplement the Company. It was decided to expand the Company to make up for the shortfall and this was authorised on 16 January 1776, bringing its numbers to 116 non-commissioned officers and men.Connolly, p. 8 The Company worked on the bastion \\"from gun-fire in the morning to gun-fire in the evening, as also on Sundays\\" and completed it in 1776. The bastion, which mounted over 20 guns and had bomb-proof casemates capable of housing 800 men, demonstrated its military worth only a few years after its completion when it withstood several years of heavy bombardment during the Great Siege of Gibraltar, which began in June 1779.Hills, p. 309 The Great Siege The Soldier Artificers played a central role during the siege in successfully defending Gibraltar against the besieging Spanish and French armies. They were divided into three groups to direct works to strengthen the fortifications after the start of hostilities with Spain.Connolly, p. 10 At the height of the siege in 1782‚Äì83, nearly 2,000 men of the garrison were put to work on the fortifications under the direction of the Soldier Artificers.Connolly, p. 20 On 27 November 1781, after the Spanish had set up their own siege lines, the artificers participated in a highly successful British raid to demolish the Spanish entrenchments and spike their cannon. The Governor, General George Eliott, subsequently praised in a despatch the role they had played in the sortie: they had \\"made wonderful exertions, and spread their fire with such amazing rapidity, that in half an hour, two mortar batteries of ten 13-inch mortars, and three batteries of six guns each, with all the lines of approach, communication and traverses, &c.; were in flames and reduced to ashes. Their mortars and cannon were spiked, and their beds, carriages and platforms destroyed. Their magazines blew up one after another, as the fire approached them.\\"Connolly, pp. 12‚Äì13 The artificers were also responsible for providing the gunners with a supply of red-hot shot to be fired at the besieging forces, which they accomplished by building kilns around the fortress to heat 100 pieces of shot at a time.Connolly, p. 22‚Äì3 Despite British counter-fire, the Spanish were able to advance slowly along the isthmus linking Gibraltar with Spain by extending their trenches towards the British lines. The closer they came, the more difficult it was for the British to aim their cannon down into the Spanish lines. The near-vertical cliff of the North Front of the Rock of Gibraltar greatly restricted the space in which the British cannon could be deployed. By May 1782 the Spanish had been able to knock out many of the British batteries on the North Front without the British being able to return fire adequately.Connolly, p. 13 Mock-up showing members of the Soldier Artificer Company digging the Upper Gallery General Eliott offered a bounty of 1,000 Spanish dollars to \\"any one who can suggest how I am to get a flanking fire upon the enemy's works\\". In response, the Company's Sergeant-Major, Henry Ince, proposed to tunnel a gallery through the Rock to reach an outcrop called the Notch, so that a cannon could be mounted there to cover the entire North Front.Connolly, p. 14 His suggestion was immediately approved and the Soldier Artificers began tunnelling on 25 May 1782. As the works progressed, the tunnellers decided to create an opening in the cliff face to provide them with ventilation. It was immediately realised that this would offer an excellent firing position. By the end of the siege, the newly created Upper Gallery ‚Äì known today as the Great Siege Tunnels ‚Äì housed four guns, mounted on specially developed \\"depressing carriages\\" to allow them to fire downwards into the Spanish positions. The Notch was not reached until after the siege had ended; instead of mounting a gun above it, the outcrop was hollowed out to create a broad firing position. Apart from the tunnelling work, the Company was kept busy during the siege by repairing damage caused by the Spanish bombardment of the fortress. Its single worst loss of life during the siege occurred on 11 June 1782 when a Spanish shell hit the magazine of Princess Anne's Battery, causing a devastating explosion. The magazine was completely destroyed and debris was ejected down the slope into the British lines below, causing heavy casualties in the vicinity. Fourteen soldiers were killed and another 15 were wounded. By July the Company had lost 22 men through various causes, six of them killed by enemy action, with the rest falling victim to illnesses.Connolly, p. 15 Replacements and an increase in numbers were urgently requested from England. Under a fresh Royal Warrant issued on 31 August 1782, the company's numbers were increased to one sergeant-major, 10 sergeants, 10 corporals, 209 privates and four drummers. The new recruits, numbering 141 men, were quickly despatched to Gibraltar and arrived there in October.Connolly, p. 16 The Company also included two boys, Thomas Richmond and John Brand, dubbed \\"Shell and Shot\\" by their older comrades. They were sons of Company sergeants and were trained as, respectively, a carpenter and a mason. They were put to work in the fortifications to look out for enemy shells being fired and give warning of their approach. Their keen eyesight enabled them to save many lives, earning them a fair amount of celebrity within the garrison.Connolly, p. 32 The pair were given a proper education after the siege and in due course were commissioned as second lieutenants. Both were posted to the West Indies but died there of yellow fever in 1793.Connolly, p. 33 Rebuilding and merger Uniform of the Royal Military Artificers, which the Soldier Artificer Company adopted in 1788 Working dress of the Royal Military Artificers By the end of the siege in February 1783, seven men of the Company had been killed and a further 23 had died from sickness, with an additional two men executed in May 1781 for looting. However, it had suffered no desertions during the siege, unlike several of the other British formations in the garrison.Connolly, p. 26 The great success of the Company's tunnelling work led to a large-scale programme of further tunnelling leading to of tunnels being excavated by 1790. Ince remained in charge of the work. The Soldier Artificers were also occupied with the rebuilding of the civilian settlement at Gibraltar, which had been reduced to ruins, and repairing and further strengthening the fortifications.Connolly, p. 39 Their numbers were replenished with men transferred from regiments stationed at Gibraltar.Connolly, p. 40 They were uniquely privileged among the garrison's lower ranks; they were exempted from guard duty and their cleaning and cooking was done for them by soldiers of the line.Connolly, p. 41 The structure of the Soldier Artificer Company underwent major reform in June 1786 when it was divided into two companies, in recognition of its increased size. It also underwent a major turnover in personnel, with 86 members being discharged ‚Äì over a third of its numbers. Apart from disciplinary problems with some Soldier Artificers, the main reason for the mass discharge was that many of them were simply too old and weak to be able to bear the rigours of their work. As experienced craftsmen were required, this meant that their average age skewed much higher than regular units. Due to military necessity, recruits had generally been admitted between the ages of 35‚Äì45 and occasionally as old as 50.Connolly, p. 44 The older members were replaced with younger men aged 35 or under, primarily masons and bricklayers, and the overall number of Soldier Artificers was increased again.Connolly, p. 45‚Äì6 However, the journey of the second batch of new recruits ‚Äì 58 men, 28 wives and 12 children ‚Äì ended in disaster on 24 September 1786 when their ship, the Mercury, was shipwrecked on a sand bank off Dunkirk. Only three men were pulled from the water, two of whom died soon afterwards.Connolly, p. 46‚Äì7 The following year, the Master-General of the Ordnance, the Duke of Richmond, proposed to Prime Minister William Pitt that six companies of 100 soldier artificers should be raised in Britain along the lines of the Soldier Artificer Company. Connolly, p. 58 Richmond was intent on a major programme of building and renovating fortifications,Connolly, p. 55 just as Green had been in Gibraltar 15 years earlier, and like Green he was dissatisfied with the existing system of hiring civilian labourers and artificers. Although the proposal was strongly opposed by those who argued that it was ridiculous to put labourers under military discipline, it was approved by Pitt and King George III and a warrant was issued in October 1787 authorising the creation of the Royal Military Artificers and Labourers. The Soldier Artificers in Gibraltar were asked if they wanted to change their existing scarlet uniforms for the new blue uniforms of their British-based counterparts. They agreed and from 1788 all the soldier artificers in the British Army wore the same uniforms. Serg. John Catto, Soldier Artificer Company, d.1802, Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia) In June 1797 the Soldier Artificers were amalgamated with the Corps of Royal Military Artificers, a predecessor to today's Royal Engineers. By this time they comprised two companies with two sergeant-majors, five sergeants, five corporals, two drummers and 125 private artificers in each company (though the actual numbers on amalgamation were somewhat lower than this).

Designed by J. J. Talbot Hobbs, the building is of Federation Filigree style. Built in 1898, it is one of the earliest surviving hotels in Perth's southern suburbs. The Windsor is sited to take advantage of patrons visiting Perth Zoo, coming via ferry along the Swan River. Since its construction, the hotel has had several major renovations.  History  The Windsor Hotel was designed by prominent architect J. J. Talbot Hobbs, and built for George Stickland in 1898 at a cost of ‚Ç§4,050. The hotel opened on the corner of Mends Street and Mill Point Road at a time when the popularity of South Perth was increasing; by the mid-1890s the suburb was well established. In 1898, the Perth Zoo opened, along with a post office, which operated out of the hotel for a period of time. Part way through World War II, the Stickland family sold the hotel to Mary Thomas (later Mary Raine), who willed it to the University of Western Australia. Major works have taken place since the Windsor was constructed in 1898, with renovations carried out in 1962, 1965, 1970, the 1980s and 1991.  Style  The building was designed in Federation Filigree style. The building is constructed with tuck-pointed brickwork in Flemish bond and its corrugated iron roof is concealed behind a parapet. The veranda and balcony extend along both street facades and are covered with a lean-to roof. The veranda roof is broken by gables, which highlight the main entrance to each street facade and the truncated corner. The veranda roof is supported on fine, ornamental cast-iron posts with capitals and cast-iron balustrading. Its intact street veranda and roof details are now very scarce and so have rarity value. The Windsor Hotel is representative of the Australian pub tradition: a two-storey hotel with verandas, usually located on a prominent street corner in a suburb or country town. It was listed with the Heritage Council of Western Australia in 1995.

From the outset it was international in its membership and it set itself a parental and advisory role for the then nascent national societies to develop in each country for intraocular implant surgeons. However, this global role was only acknowledged in the name change in July 1975, when the Intra-Ocular Implant Club became The International Intra-Ocular Implant Club (IIIC). In November 2011, The International Intra-Ocular Implant Club (IIIC) became incorporated as a Private Limited Company under English law. History and present-day activity The Intra-Ocular Implant Club (IIIC) was established on 14 July 1966 at the Royal Society of Medicine in London. The sixteen founder members were: Mr. John Pike (Rayners), Dr. Murto (USA), Michael J. Roper-Hall (UK), Svyatoslav Fyodorov (USSR), Neil Dallas (UK), Dr. Brown (UK), Dr. Rubinstein (UK), Warren Reese (USA), Dr. Lurie (UK), Jorn Boberg-Ans and Sonja Boberg-Ans (Denmark), Cees Binkhorst (The Netherlands), Peter Choyce (UK), Harold Ridley (UK), Benedetto Strampelli, (Italy) and Edward Epstein (South Africa). An account of the Club‚Äôs early history was made by Michael J. Roper-Hall in his 2007 IIIC Medal Lecture at the Club annual dinner meeting in Stockholm that year. The Club has two annual meetings. The Spring meeting coincides with the annual meeting of the ASCRS (the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons). The second is in the autumn at the time of the ESCRS (the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons).annual congress meeting. The meeting format is a working-lunch or dinner wherein Club business is discussed then followed by a Medal lecture. There are two awards of medals made each year: the IIIC Medal lecture and the Jan Worst Medal lecture, named after the Dutch surgeon and pioneer in phakic lens surgery Dr Jan Worst of Groningen. 'G.

Milne first appeared and competed as part of the national team at the 2006 IAAF World Cross Country Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, where he placed twenty-eighth in the men's senior eight kilometre run. In 2008, he set his personal best time and an equal Olympic A-standard of 3:36.00 by winning the 1500 metres at the Harry Jerome International Track Classic in Burnaby, British Columbia, which earned him a qualifying spot for the Summer Olympics in Beijing. Two weeks later, Milne captured his another title and set a new championship meet record of 3:38.03 at the Canadian Track and Field Championships in Windsor, Ontario, to fully secure his place for the Olympics, along with fellow athletes Nathan Brannen and Kevin Sullivan, who considered to be his personal hero. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Milne ran in the first heat of men's 1500 metres, against ten other athletes, including Leonel Manzano of the United States, and New Zealand's Nick Willis, who eventually won the silver medal in the final. He finished the race in ninth place by approximately two seconds behind Reyes Est√©vez of Spain, outside his personal best of 3:41.56.

Overview  In 1985, Paul Reilly Jr. founded Rytec Corporation in Addison, Illinois. Under a license agreement with Labex GmbH (which later became a division of the H√∂rmann Group), Rytec manufactured and sold high-speed folding doors in the United States. Widespread adoption of this product in cold storage environments helped establish the viability of the high-speed door concept in North America. In 1987, Rytec moved to a larger facility on Eagle Drive in Jackson, Wisconsin. Several years later, in 1990, Rytec developed the first high-speed rolling door that could withstand accidental impacts and reset without tools. Donald P. Grasso and Fred L. Turner purchased Rytec Corporation in 1994. In 1996, Rytec built a new a facility on Cedar Parkway in Jackson, Wisconsin, which was subsequently expanded in 2001 and 2006. This expanded facility increased manufacturing capacity and included a research and development facility with a wind tunnel for door testing. , Don Grasso is the principal shareholder, Chairman and CEO. In January 2018, Rytec purchased the former Steel Craft building in Hartford, Wisconsin, which signals a major product expansion.  Recognition  In 1994, the Wisconsin Society of Professional Engineers presented Rytec with the Governor's New Products Award. That same year, the company received its first of 5 Plant Engineering magazine's Product of the Year awards for product innovation.

Born on 9 March 2012, she is kept at the place of her birth, at the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences and Animal Husbandry, Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology of Kashmir, Shuhama, Srinagar in the Indian territory of Jammu and Kashmir. Birth Noori was born on 9 March 2012 to three mothers (one provided the egg, another the DNA and a third carried the cloned embryo to term). She was created using the technique of somatic cell nuclear transfer, in which the cell nucleus from an adult cell is transferred into an unfertilised oocyte (developing egg cell) that has had its nucleus removed. The hybrid cell is then stimulated to divide by an electric shock, and when it develops into a blastocyst, it is implanted in a surrogate mother using laparoscopic surgery. This is the same method as was used in cloning the first mammal of the world, Dolly. Noori was cloned by Dr. Riaz Ahmad Shah, Dr.Syed Hilal Yaqoob, Dr. Maajid Hassan Bhat, Dr. Mujeeb Fazili, Firdous Ahmad Khan and colleagues at the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences and Animal Husbandry of Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology of Kashmir in Shuhama, 13 km to the east of Srinagar. The successful cloning of Noori, which took two years, will assist the department in cloning the endangered species of Kashmir stag (hangul); they previously cloned a water buffalo in 2009. The funding for Noori's cloning was provided by the World Bank, which runs the National Agricultural Innovation Project (NAIP) of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. Pashmina goat Noori also offers hope to the people of Kashmir of increasing production of pashmina, a type of fine cashmere wool. At present pashmina wool is being imported from China to fulfill demand, due to the rarity of pashmina goat, which is a special breed of goat indigenous to high altitudes of the Himalayas in Ladakh.

It is part of the FrontRunner South extension. Description The station is at 690 South University Avenue U.S. Route 189 on 15 acres and covers a two city block area between Freedom Boulevard (200 West) and University Avenue. It is accessed from I-15 by way of either the University Avenue or Provo Center Street (SR 114) interchanges. Art at the Provo station The station has a Park and Ride lot with over 800 free parking spaces available. The station is one block east of the Provo Amtrak station, which is a stop for the California Zephyr. While there are several retail business (including fast food restaurants) just south of the station, it is within walking distance of downtown Provo. The station is within the Quiet Zone, so all trains (including Amtrak's and Union Pacific's) do not routinely sound their horns when approaching public crossings within this corridor. The station opened, along with the rest of FrontRunner South, on December 10, 2012 and is operated by Utah Transit Authority. The Provo FrontRunner Station is the main part of the Provo Intermodal Center. UTA refers to it as an intermodal center because of the UVX BRT transfer station just south of the rail platform. UVX connects the station with Orem Central station by way of BYU and UVU. All of UTA's TRAX and FrontRunner trains and stations, as well as all fixed route buses, are compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act and are therefore accessible to those with disabilities. Since not all FrontRunner passenger cars are wheelchair accessible, signage at the stations, on the passenger platforms, and on the passenger cars clearly show accessibility options. In addition, each train has one or more Train Hosts available to provide assistance as may be needed, including the placement of ramps for wheelchair boarding. In accordance with the Utah Clean Air Act and UTA ordinance, \\"smoking is prohibited on UTA vehicles as well as UTA bus stops, TRAX stations, and FrontRunner stations\\". Future Having completed Phase One of the Provo Intermodal Center which includes the FrontRunner station, the local and intra- county bus stops, and the Park and Ride lot, UTA completed Phase Two in 2018 and anticipates to have Phase Three complete a few years after that. Phase Two will include accommodations for UVX as well as a parking structure (to be built on the northeast corner of the Park and Ride lot and adjacent to the University Avenue viaduct). Phase Three is anticipated to include mixed-use, transit oriented development (TOD). However, unlike the TOD at other stations (such as Station Park at the Farmington station), UTA plans to include these facilities within the confines of the intermodal center, rather than just close by. FrontRunner On weekdays the FrontRunner has about twenty-three round trips between Ogden and Provo (through Salt Lake City) and about five more round trips between Ogden and Downtown Salt Lake City. On Saturdays there are only nineteen round trips between Ogden and Provo. Trains run hourly from about 4:30 am to just after midnight on weekdays (with additional half hour runs for the morning and evening commutes). Saturdays have hourly runs from about 6:00 am to 2:30 am Sunday morning. As of August 2013 the FrontRunner does not run on Sundays or holidays. Each weekday, service is extended to Pleasant View station with two trains picking up (no dropping off) passengers early in the morning and two more trains picking up and dropping off passengers in the evening.

Dixit and first published in 1973 by Chetana Publications.Chetana Publications. The book was revised and reedited in July 1981. These publications led to the spread of Nisargadatta's teachings to the West, especially North America and Europe. Excerpts of the book were published in Yoga Journal in September 1981, the month Nisargadatta died at age 84. The book is considered the author's masterpiece and a spiritual classic by authors and teachers like Eckhart Tolle,Eckhart Tolle on Nisargadatta Maharaj (video) Wayne Dyer, Deepak Chopra Peter Crone and Adyashanti, who called the book a \\"standout\\" and \\"the clearest expression I've ever found.\\" Dyer calls Nisargadatta his teacher, and cites the quotation, \\"Love says: 'I am everything'. Wisdom says: 'I am nothing'. Between the two my life flows.\\" That quotation has also been cited by several other authors in diverse fields, from wellness to cooking. Joseph Goldstein visited Nisargadatta in January 1980 after reading the book, and after several meetings said, \\"The path that Nisargadatta revealed was not a search, but a find, not a struggle, but an abiding, not a cultivation, but something intrinsic to all\\". I Am That has been translated into several languages, including Dutch, Italian and Hebrew. Background and publication history Nisargadatta Maharaj (1897 ‚Äì 1981) Nisargadatta Maharaj met his guru, Siddharameshwar Maharaj, in 1933. Siddharameshwar died two and half years later, and Nisargadatta continued to practice what his guru had taught him while running a small shop in Khetwadi locality in Girgaon, Mumbai. In 1951, after receiving an inner revelation from his guru, he began to give initiations. He allowed devotees to gather twice a day for satsang, with meditation, bhajan-singing, and the answering of questions, continuing until his death on 8 September 1981, at the age of 84. Maurice Frydman, a Jewish refugee from Warsaw, came to India in the late 1930s. Initially, he worked at the State Government Electric Factory in Bangalore. Later, influenced by Mahatma Gandhi, he worked in Aundh State (the present Satara district) on the Aundh Experiment for local self- governance.Alter, Joseph S. Gandhi's Body. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000. . p. 92. Thereafter he took sannyas (renunciation). He was associated with Sri Ramana Maharshi and J. Krishnamurti. Eventually he became a disciple of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj in the early days of Nisargadatta's spiritual work in 1965. Frydman spoke Marathi and so became a translator of Nisargadatta's talks. He recorded and compiled the sessions, leading to the publication of I Am That. Most of the conversations were in Marathi, but for the benefit of Westerners talks were often translated. Frydman: ‚Ä≥Whenever I was present the task would fall to me. Many of the questions put and answers given were so interesting and significant that a tape-recorder was brought in. While most of the tapes were of the regular Marathi-English variety, some were polyglot scrambles of several Indian and European languages. Later, each tape was deciphered and translated into English‚Ä≥ .I Am That, Translator¬¥s note All the conversations were recorded at Nisargadatta's small tenement and later transcribed and translated by Frydman while the master was still unknown to the Western public. A Marathi version of the talks, verified by Nisargadatta, was published separately. According to Nisargadatta, \\"Maurice (Frydman) told me, 'Everything that is said here is immediately lost, though it could be of a great benefit for those looking for truth. I would like to translate and publish your words so others might know them. And so, he wrote I Am That\\".Yoga en Zaragoza, Estudios tradicionales With the book's publication, Nisargadatta became very popular: hundreds of foreigners started flocking to his small tenement, and Nisargadatta once remarked: ‚Ä≥I used to have a quiet life but the book I Am That by Maurice has turned my house into a railway station platform.‚Ä≥ I Am That was initially rejected by the major publishers, so Frydman worked with a then small publisher, Chetana Publications. The book was first published in 1973 in two hardcover volumes. The revised and enlarged second edition was published in one volume in 1976. The first paperback was published in 1984. The book is now published in the USA and Canada by The Acorn Press. Structure The book comprises 101 sections, each corresponding to a particular conversation, averaging four pages each and cast in a question-and-answer format. Most deal with a single issue but some go from one subject to other, always in line with the spiritual quest. The second edition includes an epilogue, Nisarga Yoga, by Maurice Frydman. Style of teaching in I Am That Hindi edition of the book. Nisargadatta's teachings are grounded in the Advaita Vedanta interpretation of the Advaita idea Tat Tvam Asi, literally \\"That Thou Art\\", (Tat = \\"Absolute\\", Tvam = \\"You\\", Asi = \\"are\\") meaning \\"You are (actually) Absolute\\" (who think otherwise). Nisargadatta also had a strong devotion to his own guru, and suggested the path of devotion, Bhakti yoga, to some of his visitors. Nisargadatta deviated from the formal Navnath Sampradaya lineage style of teaching by giving informal discourses for the benefit of Western devotees who did not have access to Dasbodh or other texts, and who were not familiar with Indian traditions and customs. It has been said that Nisargadatta¬¥s style was direct, and even at times aggressive. He very rarely mentioned scriptures or quoted spiritual books. His teachings came from his own experience.  Nisarga Yoga  Nisargadatta taught what has been called Nisarga Yoga (Nisarga can be translated as ‚Äúthe natural state‚Äù). In I Am That, Nisarga Yoga is defined as living life with ‚Äúharmlessness,‚Äù ‚Äúfriendliness,‚Äù and ‚Äúinterest,‚Äù abiding in ‚Äúspontaneous awareness‚Äù while being ‚Äúconscious of effortless living.‚Äù The practice of this form of Yoga involves meditating on one‚Äôs sense of \\"I am\\" or \\"being\\" with the aim of reaching its ultimate source, which Nisargadatta called the Self. _The Seven Principles of Nisarga Yoga (As identified by Nic Higham, 2018)_ # Non-identification and right understanding # Interest and earnestness # Spontaneity and effortlessness # Attentiveness to being # Right action # Going within to go beyond # Awareness of Self See also *Samarth Ramdas *Advaita vedanta *Navnath Sampradaya *Siddharameshwar Maharaj References Bibliography  External links * I AM THAT - By Nisargadatta Maharaj * nisargadatta.net * Farsi Translation of the book Category:Hindu texts Category:Nondualism Category:Philosophical literature Category:1973 non- fiction books Category:Indian non-fiction books Category:20th-century Indian books Category:Hinduism studies books Category:Books about spirituality Category:Advaita Vedanta Category:English-language books ","title":"I Am That"},{"id":"37906541","title":"Phaidon Design Classics"},{"id":"37906551","text":"The Punch Festival (in Slovene phonetically also Panƒç festival) is the most visited stand up comedy festival held in Ljubljana, Slovenia.

Therefore, men extract the earth, which is then cleaned, cut, watered, kneaded, trampled and mixed ‚Äì transforming it into red clay that potters form in a special finger technique requiring concentration, strength and agility. Each potter has his own technique of shaping, but each respects the sequence of the process. The women decorate the shaped ceramics before firing with special techniques and tools in order to draw traditional motifs. Their skills in combining decoration and color determines the personality and uniqueness of these pieces. Colors are bright shades of brown, red, green, blue and so called \\"Horezu ivory\\". Horezu potters use many traditional tools like a mixer for cleaning the earth, a pottery wheel and comb for shaping, a hollowed-out bull's horn and a fine wire-tipped stick for decoration, and a wood-burning stove for firing. This ancient craft is preserved in the ancestral hearth, now known as Olari Street of Horezu, where artisans shape the clay into the same painstaking process as their ancestors did.

It is dedicated to St John the Evangelist, and with St Andrew's, Short Street, forms a united benefice. Location The church is located in Waterloo, opposite the London IMAX, close to Waterloo station and the Waterloo campus of King's College London. In 1818, when the country was settling down into a period of peace after the Napoleonic Wars and the population was beginning to expand rapidly, Parliament decided to allocate a sum not exceeding a million pounds for the building of additional churches in populous parishes and ‚Äúmore particularly in the Metropolis and its Vicinity.‚Äù Of this sum, the Commissioners for Building New Churches appropriated ¬£64,000 in 1822 for the needs of the parish of Lambeth. It was decided that a new church should be built on the Waterloo Bridge approach, with a piece of ground on the east side of the road to be purchased from the Archbishop of Canterbury and his lessee and the sub-lessee, Gilbert East and a man named Anderson. History The Church of St John was built to the designs of the architect Francis Octavius Bedford in 1824. Bedford designed three other churches for the Commissioners, St George‚Äôs, Camberwell, St Luke, West Norwood and Holy Trinity, Newington. They were all built in the same Greek style inspired by Bedford‚Äôs background as a well-respected Greek scholar and antiquarian. Bedford‚Äôs churches were fiercely criticised by contemporary critics at a time when the tide was turning away from the Greek revival towards Gothic. St John‚Äôs however gained more critical appreciation mainly because of its fine spire which used classical detail to build up a more traditional English parish church shape. The ground was very swampy, consisting in part of a pond, and the advice of John Rennie was sought as to the most suitable type of foundation. His recommendation that piling should be used under all the walls was adopted with such success that, after the lapse of 125 years, heavy damage by bombing and ten years' exposure to the weather, the walls were still strong and sound enough to be used in the renovated church. The Church was renovated by Blomfield in 1885 and altered internally by Ninian Comper in 1924. The Church was struck by a bomb in 1940, when the roof and much of the interior was destroyed. The building stood open for ten years until it was restored and remodelled internally by Thomas Ford in 1950. In 1951 the Church was rededicated as the Festival of Britain Church. Thomas Ford removed the galleries and a new decorative scheme was installed using Greek ornamental motifs, gilt and light pastel shades. A mural by Hans Feibusch was commissioned and replaced the damaged Victorian reredos. The overall effect is vastly different from the essentially Victorian interior that previously existed. The highlights of decorative detail and colour are typical of a tradition evolved by Thomas Ford through the 1930s and into the 1950s. During the construction of the Jubilee line, the structural stability of the church was closely monitored as the soil underneath the church began to dry out as a result of the building of the new London Underground line. Still supported by the piles driven into the marshy soil in 1824, millions of gallons of water had to be pumped into the foundations of the church to prevent its collapse as a result. Today The church that exists today is a thriving multicultural congregation that has developed strong links with the local community. Every June it hosts the popular Waterloo Festival. It is also home to The Bridge at Waterloo and a large and thriving Churchyard garden. There is a choir under the musical direction of Euchar Gravina. The church also hosts the Okusinza Church, which is a Luganda language church with a mainly Ugandan congregation. The church also holds a very strong link to Fairtrade products with stalls outside the Church selling items from Monday ‚Äì Friday every week, in tandem with a Food Court.

The film was produced by Shyam Devabhaktuni and Krishna Vijay jointly, and stars Nara Rohit and Priya Banerjee in the lead roles. This film received a positive reception and was declared a box office hit. Plot Dharma Teja (Nara Rohit) is a jailor in Rajahmundry Central Jail who is strict and sincere but also sensitive and kindhearted. In his department, the people call him a demon because of his anger and strictness. His aim is to become a poet, which he is working on in his free time. Dharma has different thoughts on reformation of prisoners and doesn't mind breaking law to good to others, so he became a question mark to his higher officials. One day, Chandrashekar aka Charlie (Ravi Varma), a former diamond merchant, was sentenced to death on charges of killing his stepmother's siblings for the sake of their property. His mercy petition was canceled by the president In jail, Charlie meets a thief called Pandu. Pandu is vengeful against Charlie because once he tried to steal diamonds from Charlie, and when Charlie caught him, he made him handicapped and sent him to jail. After hearing the news through his girlfriend Saira, Charlie decides to escape from jail. Then he makes a deal with Pandu to give half the diamonds which once he had tried to steal two diamonds from him for escaping of him from jail, which was worthy of 50 crores. Then Pandu forgets his enmity with Charlie and accepts his offer. Then Charlie arranges bail to Pandu. He meets gangsters Muthyammanna (Madhusudhan Rao) and his brother Daya (Satyadev Kancharana) and tells his offer to help, then they make a plan to escape Charlie from prison. Meanwhile, Charlie was survived temporarily from hanging through a drug and fell asleep. In the investigation, Dharma knows that Saira supplied the drug through a sweets box in the visiting hours. He arrests Saira and threatened her to tell Charlie's further plans. Saira tells everything she knows to Dharma, then they tried to implement the death punishment again to Charlie. Meanwhile, Daya and his gang kidnap a magistrate's son who is approving Charlie's death, the mother of the hangman who executes Charlie, and Dharma's girlfriend Harika (Priya Banerjee). They call unknown to each other and blackmail them to help in Charlie's escape. Dharma takes it as a challenge to save his girlfriend and execute Charlie. Meanwhile, in the execution room, the hangman saves Charlie, creating a technical problem in the executing mission, then the higher officials take a severe action against Dharma. In the investigation, he came to know the meeting of Charlie and Pandu. In the searching of Pandu, he successfully went to his hideout. In a rough chase, Daya kills Pandu and was transferred to the commissioner's office on charges of duty negligence. The commissioner takes it as a challenge and transfers Charlie to the special jail for hanging under his control. Taking it as an advantage, Muthyammanna and Daya attack on the police and successfully have Charlie escape. Suddenly, Dharma enters and attacks them. While in a shootout, Charlie injures Daya and escapes solely, then Dharma kills Daya. After that, the police alerts the public on Charlie's escape and announces a ransom on him. Dharma successfully protects Harika, the hangman's mother, and the magistrate's son. Then the human rights commission gives a severe charge on Dharma and suspends him on a temporary period, while the human rights investigation continues. After a few days, Dharma went to a secret hideout to meet wounded Muthyammanna and says that actually, Charlie was dead earlier after kidnapping Harika, then he came to know through the hangman and magistrate that their family members were also kidnapped. Then he makes a plan to save them from the evil clutches, so he said Charlie was alive because of a technical issue in the mission and arranges a former criminal to act as Charlie. His plan was successful when the people were attacked on the police. Dharma then tells his previous conversation with Charlie. After knowing the plans of Charlie through Saira, he meets Charlie in the meeting. Charlie confess to Dharma that anyone cannot stop him to escape. He makes a deal with Pandu for giving diamonds, then dharma asks, \\"If you may be cheated by them, then what will you do?\\" Charlie replies by saying he cannot be cheated by anyone because the diamonds were in a safe which can be opened through his fingerprint which was located in a secret place. After Charlie's death, the hangman cuts Charlie's hand. Dharma finds out the place through Saira, possesses Charlie's diamonds, and sent the diamonds secretly to Charlie's stepmother. He reveals the entire story and keeps it as a secret. The diamonds will be used for a good purpose, which an NGO is going to launched by Charlie's stepmother. After hearing this, Muthyammanna dies. With Harika's help, Dharma finishes his poetry work successfully; at the same time, he got a call from his higher officials to rejoining in the service as a jailor. Harika asks Dharma what he will name his book, to which Dharma decides \\"Asura\\", because his department calls him like that, so he named the book with an inspiration of that nature.

Glue dots are globules of adhesive, which allow attachments to float above a page. They provide a clean and instant bond and are often a more suitable solution than hot or liquid glues or adhesive tapes. Glue dots leave much less mess, residue, and odor which help present a product in the best way, whilst increasing productivity and reducing costs. Removable glue dots also allow you to create a bond which can be removed when needed.  Types of glue dots  Glue dots are supplied in different tack levels: * High Tack Glue Dots: for removable or temporary fixing such as sticking credit cards to letterheads * Low Tack Glue Dots: still removable, but create much stronger adhesion for heavier items, such as sticking CDs to magazines. * High Shear Tack: semi- permanent glue dots with vertical hold ability that will create a strong bond between most surfaces * Super High Tack: permanent glue dots which will create a strong, permanent bond between most surfaces. The strength of the bond is dependent on the materials being bonded. It is recommended to carry out adequate testing to determine the correct tack level needed.  Benefits  Glue dots create bonds instantly, leave no mess, cause less waste, and avoid harmful burns which some people may experience when using a hot glue gun.  Uses of glue dots  * Point of purchase display assembly * Adhering matting in picture frames * Sealing and resealing food & beverage cartons * Building (gluing) pocket/presentation Folders * Make a non-adhesive product, adhesive * Assembling sample books * Securing items prior to shrink wrapping * Sign and display manufacturing * Securing items within clamshells * Joining sheeting, films, liners, papers, etc. * Mounting lightweight trims, boards * Scrapbooking * Card making * School crafts  Glue dot dispensers  While glue dots can be applied manually in most cases, for commercial uses ease of application and productivity can be increased by using a glue dot dispenser.

The station has a free Park and Ride lot with over 550 parking spaces available. Although a large retail development is located to the north, just across I-15 from the station, there is no direct pedestrian access to the shopping center and there are currently no other commercial developments in close proximity either although residential developments are in the process of being constructed. The station is located within the Quiet Zone, so trains do not routinely sound their horns when approaching public crossings within this corridor. The station opened, along with the rest of the FrontRunner South, on December 10, 2012 and is operated by Utah Transit Authority. All of UTA's TRAX and FrontRunner trains and stations, as well as all fixed route buses, are compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act and are therefore accessible to those with disabilities.

He was Rector of Stirling High School from 1760 to 1800. Doig is also believed to have been the inventor of the tartan pattern now associated with Burberry. David Doig, silhouette Memorial to David Doig, Church of the Holy Rude, Stirling Life David was born 14 Feb 1719 at Mill of Melgund, Aberlemno, Angus, son of David Doig and Ann Sturrock. His father, who was a small farmer, died while he was an infant, and his mother married again. He was successful in a Latin competition for a bursary at the University of St. Andrews. Having finished the classical and philosophical course and proceeded B.A., he began the study of divinity, but scruples regarding the Westminster Confession of Faith prevented him from entering the ministry of the Church of Scotland. Doig taught from 1749 in the parochial schools of Monifieth, Kennoway and Falkland, Fifeshire. His reputation then gained for him the rectorship of the grammar school of Stirling, a post he filled for over 40 years. In addition to Greek and Latin Doig had mastered Hebrew and Arabic. The University of Glasgow conferred on him the honorary degree of LL.D., and on the same day he received from St. Andrews his diploma as M.A. He was also elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. Doig was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1798. His proposers were Dr James Gregory, Andrew Dalzell, and John Playfair. Doig died in Stirling on 16 March 1800, aged 81. He is buried in the Holy Rude Cemetery next to Stirling Castle. A mural tablet, with an inscription in commemoration of his virtues and learning, was raised by his friend John Ramsay of Ochtertyre. The town of Stirling also erected a marble monument to his memory, with a Latin epitaph written by himself. Family Doig was married to Isabella Janet Bower (1727-1762) in Monifieth on 17 November 1749. They had children: Isabella, Ann, Jean, David, George, and Patrick. Their daughter Isabella (1751-1819) married Dr. John Aird (c.1740-1790) with sons William, David, and John. The next four children died young. Patrick Doig (1762-1833) married Jane Austin (1781-1849)with a son David (1812-1819); Patrick later became a medical doctor in Antigua. Works Doig's first known appearance in print was some twenty pages of annotation on the Gaberlunzie-man, in an edition of that and another old Scottish poem, Christ's Kirk on the Green, published in 1782 by his friend and neighbour John Callander of Craigforth. Two Letters on the Savage State, addressed to the late Lord Kaims (London, 1792) attacked the views of Lord Kames in Sketches of the History of Man (1774). The first of the letters, from 1775, had been sent to Kames, who was passing the Christmas vacation a few miles from Stirling, and who invited Doig to dinner next day. Doig's next publication was Extracts from a Poem on the Prospect from Stirling Castle (Stirling, 1796). He contributed to vol. iii. of the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh a dissertation \\"On the Ancient Hellenes\\". He also wrote in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica third edition the articles on \\"Mythology\\", \\"Mysteries\\", and \\"Philology\\". They brought Doig correspondence with William Vincent and Jacob Bryant. Besides Latin and English poems Doig left some treatises in manuscript.

Early life, education and military service Born in Rocky Mount in Franklin County, Virginia, Hopkins graduated from Washington and Lee University a semester early in 1942 so he could join the United States Marine Corps. He served in the South Pacific with the 3rd Marine Division during World War II as part of the Marine's island-hopping operations, including at Guadalcanal and Bougainville. Returning to Virginia, Hopkins remained in the Marine Corps Reserve, and used his G.I. Bill to earn a law degree in 1949 from the University of Virginia Law School. He began practicing law in Roanoke, but was recalled to active duty in 1950 as the Korean War began. Hopkins commanded H & S Company, 1st Battalion, 1st Marine Division in the fall and winter of 1950. He led troops at the Chosin Reservoir and participated in the Chosin breakout when the Marines and United Nations forces were surrounded by tens of thousands of Chinese troops in minus 35-degree weather. Severely wounded in January 1951, Hopkins spent a year recovering at Portsmouth Naval Hospital in Portsmouth, Virginia. He returned to his Roanoke law practice, Martin, Hopkins & Lemon, in April 1952. Political career Hopkins was a lifelong Democrat. For several years, he was chairman of the Roanoke City Democratic Committee. In the July 1959 Democratic primary, he defeated segregationist Earl A. Fitzpatrick during the Commonwealth's Massive Resistance crisis.http://search.lib.virginia.edu/catalog/uva-lib:2220432 Elected to the Virginia State Senate that November, Hopkins served in that part-time position for 18 years, from January 1960 until he was defeated for re-election by Republican Ray L. Garland in 1979. Hopkins ran for U.S. Congress in 1964, but was defeated by Republican Richard H. Poff. He ran unopposed for his state senate seat in 1965, 1967, 1971 and 1975.http://historical.elections.virginia.gov/candidates/view/William-B- Hopkins He later commented on the political division that racial segregation caused‚Äîas he entered the Senate, 19 Democrats were willing to close the public schools to prevent racial integration, and he was among the 19 Democrats classified as \\"liberal\\" because they wanted to keep the public schools open, as did the Senate's two Republicans (James Turk of Radford and Floyd Landreth of Carroll County).http://www.ncsl.org/documents/lrl/PointsofPersonalPrivilege- VASenate2013.pdf Initially, Hopkins fought to repeal the poll tax, which had prevented many African Americans, as well as poor whites, from voting. Also, the Byrd Organization's focus on low taxes had resulted in few social services and problem roads. Slowly, taxes were levied: first on cigarettes, whisky and beer, as well as two cents per gallon of gas during the Almond administration. Governor Albertis Harrison managed to pass the first income tax. As the Byrd Organization crumbled, Hopkins helped Governor Mills E. Godwin Jr.(1966-1970) make Virginia's social service infrastructure competitive with other states. The Virginia Community College System was established so Virginians would not have to travel more than 50 miles to receive higher education. To achieve this parity, Virginia enacted a sales tax, as well as improved roads by increased licensing fees. Hopkins also led Virginia's delegation to the 1968 Democratic National Convention, and won re-election despite the Republican landslide in 1969. Fellow Democratic Senators elected Hopkins as their majority leader from 1972-1976, when Republican Linwood Holton was Governor. From 1973-1978 Hopkins served as chairman of the Commission on State Government Management and Reorganization, known as the \\"Hopkins Commission,\\" which modernized the state's government, with the assistance of Senator Elmon T. Gray of Richmond. In 1995, a University of Virginia newsletter lauded that Commission as the \\"most effective and comprehensive study of the 20th century.\\"http://www.ncsl.org/documents/lrl/PointsofPersonalPrivilege- VASenate2013.pdf at p. 21 For years Hopkins served as chairman of the State Senate's Committee on Counties, Cities and Towns, and was a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee. He also helped found and fund Roanoke's Center on the Square. Hopkins remained active in Democratic politics even after his retirement, working to elect Tim Kaine governor and later U.S. Senator, as well as to elect Barack Obama President in 2008 and 2012. Hopkins also served as commander of his local American Legion post, and was active in the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Later, death and legacy He continued to practice law until 2009, retiring at age 87. He survived Virginia, his wife of 62 years.

Naphthalene diimides Symmetrical naphthalene diimides are synthesized by the condensation reaction of primary amines and the dianhydride. Unsymmetrical derivatives, i.e. those derived from two different amines, are obtained by hydrolysis of one of the two anhydride groups prior to the condensation with the first amine. These diimides are members of a broader class of compounds called rylenes, oligomers of naphthalene with bonds between the 1 and 1' and 8 and 8' positions. The resulting materials have rigidly planar, highly conjugated cores. They exhibit good processing characteristics for fabrication of soft electronic devices. Aside from the NDIs, other members include the diimide derivatives of perylene-3,4:9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride and terrylene-3,4:11,12-tetracarboxylic dianhydride. Synthesis of symmetric and unsymmetric NDIs Naphthalene diimides (NDIs) are often fluorescent, although the intensity is sensitive to substituents. NDIs are also redox-active, forming stable radical anions near -1.10 V vs. Fc/Fc+. Their ability to accept electrons reflects the presence of an extended conjugated ring system and the electron withdrawing groups (carbonyl centers). NDIs are used ins supramolecular chemistry due to their tendency to form charge-transfer complexes with crown ethers, e.g. to give rotaxanes and catenanes. As another consequence of their planar structure and electron-acceptor properties, NDIs intercalate into DNA. Because a range of amines can be condensed with the dianhydride. For example, two useful pigments of the perinone class are generated by condensation with phenylenediamine. A variety of ligands with NDI backbones have also been prepared.

These waist measurements are 32 inches for women and 37 inches for men based on guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) for a healthy waist size.https://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/obesity/WHO_TRS_894/en/ The campaign used both online and offline media including, TV and radio and outdoor advertising and public relations encouraging members of the public to pick up a free measuring tape from participating pharmacies and check their waist measurements. Stop the Spread represented the first integrated use of social and digital media by Safefood in a public health awareness campaign. To raise further awareness of the campaign with the public, an 8-week weight management programme with MLA's in the Northern Ireland Assembly was carried out. In total, 32 MLAs participated including the Chair and Deputy Chair of the Health Committee.http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/health/northern- ireland-mlas-shed-pounds-in-safefood- initiative-16078676.html..http://www.4ie.ie/northern_ireland_news.asp?id=135255http://www.nigoodfood.com/news_article_name/politicians- join-forces-to-stop-the-spread.aspx  Post-campaign evaluation  Safefood's post campaign research demonstrated that it had successfully achieved its objectives. * Increase in public awareness of the issue of overweightness and obesity with a 5% increase among adults on the island of Ireland who now consider themselves to be overweight. * There was also an increased recognition of the scale of the problem which had shifted from 30% (benchmark) to 50% in December 2011 with 1 in 5 claiming to have measured their waist during the campaign. * 40% reporting that the campaign had motivated them to start losing weight. * Support of the campaign was secured from over 75% of pharmacies from across the island of Ireland. * Over 400,000 free measuring tapes were distributed.

He currently wrestles as a freelancer in the Japanese independent circuit and as a regular in Secret Base. Professional wrestling career Toryumon (2003-2004) A √öltimo Drag√≥n Gym graduate, Fukuda started his career in Mexico under his real name, being the only heavyweight in his school class term. Shortly after his debut, Fukuda turned heel and joined forces with Takeshi Minamino and Pineapple Hanai to form the Los Salseros Japoneses stable, changing his name to Mango Fukuda and his attire to a salsa music outfit. The trio moved to Toryumon X and gained a major success by feuding with Sailor Boys (Taiji Ishimori, Kei Sato and Shu Sato). After the Toryumon X closing, his unit was transferred to Michinoku Pro Wrestling. Michinoku Pro Wrestling (2004-2006) Upon reaching M-Pro, Mango and Pineapple won the Futaritabi Tag Team League 2004 after beating Kazuya Yuasa & Kesen Numajiro. The trio became the main heel stable in the promotion, and they captured the UWA World Trios Championship defeating Solar, Ultraman and Ultraman, Jr. in a Toryumon Mexico show. Their reign lasted until May 2006, when they lost the titles to STONED (Maguro Ooma, Kei Sato and Shu Sato) after a misaimed attack from Minamino. Thereafter, the stable was dissolved when Hanai turned on Minamino, and Fukuda left the promotion in order to join El Dorado Wrestling. Hustle (2005-2006) Fukuda worked in HUSTLE from 2005 to 2006 as HUSTLE Kamen Yellow, with a comedic face role. He was a part of HUSTLE Kamen Rangers along HUSTLE Kamen Red and HUSTLE Kamen Blue, and helped the team in their feud against the Monster Army. Yellow stood among his partners for his large size, and was known for his surprising agility. In 2006, he was brainwashed by the Monster Army and turned on his former fellows, becoming Monster Kamen Yellow, but he was brought back to the HUSTLE Army in HUSTLEMANIA 2006. Kamen Rangers disappeared from HUSTLE after the show. El Dorado Wrestling (2006-2008) In 2006, while working in Michinoku Pro, Mango asked to appear on the first El Dorado Wrestling show. After becoming full-time in El Dorado upon his second appearance for the promotion, he changed his ring name to Bear Fukuda and adopted a street fighter gimmick. He became the man of choice when a big name outside wrestler came to El Dorado, wrestling Shinjiro Otani and Akira Taue, among others. In 2007, Fukuda joined Toru Owashi and his stable Animal Planets. He also appeared in Dramatic Dream Team as an El Dorado representative. When El Dorado folded, Fukuda and others founded Secret Base. All Japan Pro Wrestling (2007, 2014) Through 2007, Fukuda wrestled in All Japan Pro Wrestling under a yellow full body suit as Mastadon, Ahii's enemy. On April 23, 2014, during All Japan Pro Wrestling Champion Carnival tour Fukuda made his return to AJPW. He joined the Dark Kingdom group along with Kenichiro Arai, Mitsuya Nagai, Takeshi Minamino and Kengo Mashimo. The group's leader Kenso announced that this was the \\"true beginning\\" of DK.

To reach the station, head west from I-15 on Timpanogos Highway (which becomes Clubhouse Drive), then turn left (south) onto Ashton Boulevard. The station has a Park and Ride lot with over 735 free parking spaces available. Since the Union Pacific (UP) railroad tracks separate the passenger platform from the parking lot and bus stops, there is a pedestrian underpass that allows passengers to cross under the UP tracks. There is also another pedestrian underpass for Garden Drive that connects with the Jordan River Parkway Trail. While there are many professional office buildings nearby the station in the business park, there are currently very limited retail options in close proximity. The station is located within the Quiet Zone, so trains do not routinely sound their horns when approaching public crossings within this corridor. The station opened, along with the rest of FrontRunner South, on December 10, 2012 and is operated by Utah Transit Authority. FrontRunner On weekdays the FrontRunner has about twenty-three round trips between Ogden and Provo (through Salt Lake City) and about five more round trips between Ogden and Downtown Salt Lake City.

The station opened, along with the rest of the FrontRunner South, on December 10, 2012 and is operated by Utah Transit Authority. The Orem FrontRunner Station is the main part of the Orem Intermodal Center. UTA refers to it as an intermodal center because it operates the northern terminus of UVX bus rapid transit (BRT) line that connects the station to Provo Central Station. Originally there were plans to construction an actual station building (similar to the Ogden Intermodal Transit Center), however, as of August 2013, there is no indication that any work on the anticipated building will begin anytime in the near future. Future plans Phase 1 of the Orem Intermodal Center which includes the FrontRunner station, the local and intra-county bus stops, and the Park and Ride lot. Phase 2 which was completed fully by January 2019, included accommodations for UVX including four bays for articulated buses as well as mixed-use, transit oriented development (TOD). In June 2018, ground was broken for a pedestrian bridge from the station to UVU. Physical construction did not begin until November 2019 following a cost-cutting redesign and Union Pacific approval. The bridge will open in 2021 and will run from the south end of the station platform to the parking lot in between the UCCU Center and the Hal Wing Track and Field complex.

Located between Zhongshan Bridge and Dazhi Bridge in Zhongshan District, Dajia Riverside Park is a metropolis-type greening park developed and constructed by the government. With a large area, it is a large expanse of vast grassland that enters the park. People can also look out at the Miramar Ferris wheel. There is a large fountain with a diameter of 125 meters and central water column as high as 75 meters, and 80 sets of colorful underwater lights. It uses the visual changes of the water level to show its rhythmic characteristics. The fountain sprays water for half an hour at the hour. Near the entrance of No. 8 Water Gate, there is a square image with the shape of the Keelung River curved and straightened, lined with the rolling background of mountains and a floor inlaid with sculptures of different fishes, which symbolizes the renovation hardships of the Keelung River Bank. The northern bank of the Keelung River completed the greening landscape improvement project in February 2010. There are also sports parks, sports facilities such as basketball, five tennis courts, badminton courts, and cricket grounds, as well as several kilometers of bicycle paths around the park to roam along the Keelung River (bicycle rental is available at the entrance to the park). There were plenty of parking lots nearby to facilitate tourists driving by themselves. Due to the wide space, parking, and environment, Dajia Riverside Park regularly holds various large-scale activities in addition to many sporting events during the holiday seasons. On May 28, 2009, the Summer Deaflympics Carnival was held locally. Starting from March 18, 2010, Dajia Riverside Park was temporarily closed for large-scale renovation work as one of the venues of the Taipei International Flower Expo 2010. It was completed on the eve of the Flower Expo on September 20, 2010 and large fireworks were held. The New Year‚Äôs Eve Party for the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China was also held here on the evening of December 31, 2010. History The park is part of the greening project around the area. A water playground was opened at the park in June‚ÄìSeptember 2017. In the 1990s, after completing the Keelung River curve-cutting and straightening project, the Taipei City Government rebuilt the park on the south bank of the Keelung River in the Dajia section, covering an area of about 420,000 square meters (106,600 ping), and connecting with Yingfeng Riverside Park to the east of the Dazhi Bridge. In addition to providing a large number of hydrophilic spaces for residents in Taipei, it also has the function of beautifying the water area. Three water gates at base 8, base 9, base 10 outside Binjiang Street are connected to the urban area. Geology The park is located along the Keelung River. It features a fountain.

It is a Grade II listed building. History The firm was established by Francis Wilkinson (1846-1897) in the 1870s in Beeston. The original mill buildings were destroyed by a fire on 29 April 1886. The falling walls of the mill destroyed several cottages and the damage was estimated at ¬£300,000 (). Six years later, on 30 April 1892, another fire broke out which destroyed the mill. The damage this time was estimated at ¬£100,000 (). The current building was erected on Wollaton Road, Beeston in 1892. The architect was James Huckerby of The City, Beeston. In 1893, as a consequence of the strike by coal miners at Wollaton, Trowell Moor and Clifton, the mill owners were forced to reduce their operating hours to eight per day to conserve stocks of coal which consequently reduced the wages paid to 1,000 workers. On the death of Francis Wilkinson in 1897, the business was taken over by his older brother George Wilkinson until 1909 when the factory was sold to the owners of the nearby Swiss Mills. The new owners, the Pollard family, let lace machine standings and a cotton store to Parkes & TomlinPollard, E.

The chief objective of this concept is to facilitate the conceptualisation and understanding of the simulation model by non-specialist. In practice, the concept can be implemented in different contexts, mainly in the construction industry;AL-Tabbaa, O. and Rustom, R. (2011), ‚ÄòGeneral framework for designing multi-use simulation modules for estimating project durations‚Äô, Construction Innovation: Information, Process, Management, Vol. 11, Iss: 3, pp.321 ‚Äì 337. as those who work in the development of a simulation project are interested in the efficiency and effectiveness of their simulation model rather than its underpinning mathematical complexity. The development of multi-use simulation models has been addressed by several studies during the last two decades. The first significant trial to make general-purpose simulation was presented by Hajjar and AbouRizk, 1997. They developed a general purpose simulation model to be used in estimating and planning of earth moving operation depending on reusable templates. Other research was to use reusable templates in preparing draft scheduling for the construction of similar projects. The templates were made to encode much of the knowledge dealing with activity scoping and sequencing and the use of special activity in planning structures.MARTINEZ, J. & IOANNOU, P. 1999.

Plot summary The play follows Roland, a beekeeper, and Marianne, a cosmologist through their romantic relationship. Marianne often waxes poetic about cosmology, quantum mechanics, string theory and the belief that there are multiple universes that pull people's lives in various directions. This is reflected in the play's structure as brief scenes are repeated, often with different outcomes. Roland and Marianne meet at a barbecue and become romantically involved. After they've moved in together, a confession of infidelity causes them to break up. After some time, they run in to each other at a ballroom dancing class, resume their relationship, and eventually marry. Marianne begins to forget words and has trouble typing. She is told by her doctor that she has a tumor in her frontal lobe and has less than a year to live. She eventually seeks assisted suicide abroad with Roland's support. The play ends with a flashback to the scene where Roland and Marianne rekindle their relationship in the dance class.

Its mission is to provide immediate medical intervention during the critical window between the onset of an emergency and the arrival of traditional ambulance assistance. It is one of many Hatzalah organizations in various parts of the world. United Hatzalah of Israel was founded in 2006 with the merger of several small local hatzalah organizations. It has grown to become the largest independent, non-profit, fully volunteer EMS organization in the world, with over 6,000 volunteer medics nationwide. The organization provides free services to all citizens regardless of race, religion, or national origin. With the help of its Uber-like GPS dispatch system and fleet of rapid response ambucycles, United Hatzalah has achieved an average response time of less than 3 minutes nationwide and 90 seconds in metropolitan areas. United Hatzalah's national command center in Jerusalem uses an advanced GPS- based dispatch technology to identify the closest and most qualified volunteers and routes them to the scene of an emergency through a mobile device application. Approximately 1,000 volunteers are outfitted with medically equipped motorcycles ‚Äúambucycles‚Äù capable of navigating around traffic jams to reach victims in as few as 90 seconds. The organization is funded exclusively through private charitable support. ‚ÄúAmbucycle‚Äù of the United Hatzalah of Israel Within Israel, individuals may contact United Hatzalah through its direct emergency number, 1221; however, some dispatch information is received directly from national ambulance services. United Hatzalah in turn alerts and coordinates with local ambulances, Search and Rescue (SAR), fire, and police services, and the IDF, when necessary. United Hatzalah of Israel Helicopter Rescue  History  As a young EMT in Jerusalem, Eli Beer recognized that heavy urban traffic and narrow streets often prevented ambulances from arriving in time to save a victim. Initially, volunteers responded to less than 200 calls per day by monitoring two-way emergency radio scanners. As cellular technology evolved, volunteers migrated to a managed push-to-talk network, which enabled two-way communications between dispatchers and volunteer medics. After the Second Lebanon War (Hebrew: ◊û◊ú◊ó◊û◊™ ◊ú◊ë◊†◊ï◊ü ◊î◊©◊†◊ô◊ô◊î, Milhemet Levanon HaShniya) in 2006, Beer brought together more than 50 independent Hatzalah organizations to form United Hatzalah of Israel. In 2008 United Hatzalah developed the LifeCompass GPS dispatch technology and mobile app medley capable of tracking the location of volunteers in real time, assessing the unique capabilities, mobility and equipment of the closest volunteers, and routing the most appropriate medics to any given emergency. Today, all volunteers receive a standard-issue smartphone linked to the second generation LifeCompass 2.0 command-and-control system.  Results and Demographics  United Hatzalah currently responds to approximately 1800 calls per day and as many as 2,500 calls during large-scale emergencies such as the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza Conflict. In 2019, the organization answered more than 650,000 calls, with a volunteer corps of 6,000 medics, and a fleet of 1,000 ambucycles. United Hatzalah‚Äôs lifesaving model has reduced average first-response time to three minutes. Sudden cardiac arrest calls are the best measure of emergency medical performance. Since United Hatzalah‚Äôs inception, the rate of cardiac-arrest deaths has decreased by 50%, according to the Israel Heart Society. At 46.4 deaths per 100,000 people, the World Health Organization reported in 2011 that Israel ranks 12th best out of 192 countries in terms of coronary-related mortality. United Hatzalah's volunteer base in 2018 is approximately 60% Jewish Religious, 30% Jewish Secular and 10% Minorities (Muslim, Christian and Druze). Awards and recognition In recognition of his dedication to save lives and efforts to create a multicultural, apolitical EMS organization, Eli Beer, on behalf of United Hatzalah, has received numerous international accolades, including the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship Social Entrepreneur Award (2010), the Israeli Presidential Award for Volunteerism (2011), the World Economic Forum (WEF) Young Global Leader award (2012), the Institute of International Education‚Äôs Victor J. Goldberg Prize (2013), the OMETZ Social Responsibility Award (2015), the World Values Network Champion of Human Life Award (2016) and the Conference of European Rabbis Internet Entrepreneur Prize (2017). In April 2013, Eli Beer presented a TedMed talk titled, \\"The fastest ambulance? A motorcycle,\\" in which he describes the circumstances that led to him to re- imagine first-response medicine by training volunteer EMTs to respond to local emergencies and stabilize victims until official help arrives. The video has been viewed more than a million times to date. During the March 2015 American- Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) Policy Conference in Washington DC, United Hatzalah was honored as a featured innovator in AIPAC‚Äôs Innovation Showcase, serving to highlight emerging technology developed in Israel but with worldwide impact.

It is found in the western Atlantic Ocean. The lantern bass is found in the aquarium trade. Description Serranus baldwini has a cylindrical and elongated body, which is laterally compressed to a moderate extent and has a snout which has a length which is shorter than the diameter of the eye. There are 3 well- developed spines on the gill cover, with the middle spine being the largest and straightest. The preopercle has a regularly serrated edge. The dorsal fin contains 10 spines and 11-13 soft rays, while the anal fin has 3 spines and 7 soft rays. The caudal fin is slightly concave. The body is white broken by lines of dark to orange oblong-shaped blotches and spot. There is a noticeable row of dark, oblong blotches along the lower flank. There is a further row of 4 black spots on the caudal peduncle. Fish from deeper water have a red, orange or yellower hue compared to the paler fish from shallower water. This species attains a maximum total length of . Distribution Serranus baldwini is found in the western Atlantic Ocean where it ranges from Jacksonville, Florida southwards along the Florida coast and around the Bahamas. Its range extneds into the Gulf of Mexico including the Florida Keys and northwards. It is also found along the Mexican coast from Campeche and on the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula and from northwestern Cuba throughout the Caribbean, and along the coast of Central America and South America as far south as Sao Paulo in Brazil. Habitat and biology Serranus baldwini is a marine reef- associated species, living in rocky and weedy areas at a depth of 1 ‚Äì 80 m. It shows a strong association with beds of turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum), althpugh juveniles use the empty shells of conches to hide in. It is a territorial species which feeds on shrimps and smaller fishes. It is synchronously hermaphroditic, i.e. fish can be either male or female when spawning but the social structure involves a territorial fish which is the largest of the group functionally male and a harem of hermaphrodites. The male fish is the most successful at producing offspring by mating as a male with the hermaphrodites but the hermaphrodites also mate with each other but do not have the quantity of progeny that the male fish is able to father. Taxonomy Serranus baldwini was first formally described as Prionodes baldwini by the American ichthyologists Barton Warren Evermann (1853-1932) and Millard Caleb Marsh (1872-1936) with the type locality given as Culebra, Puerto Rico. The specific name honours the artist on the expedition of December 1898 aboard the United States Fish Commission steamer Fish Hawk to Puerto Rico which collected the type, Albertus Hutchinson Baldwin (1865-1935). Utilisation Serranus baldwini is used within the aquarium trade. Bibliography * Eschmeyer, William N., ed. 1998. Catalog of Fishes.

The film running for 2 hours, 3 minutes and 30 seconds was shot on a single camera without any cuts and therefore awarded the Guinness World Record for being the longest uncut film, beating the record held by Russian Ark directed by Alexander Sokurov, which used a single 96-minute Steadicam sequence shot. A director registered with the union (L. Suresh of Eththan fame), a notary public and a government teacher were present during the shoot, while a team followed Isaak and the cinematographer E.J. Nauzad Khan and filmed the entire making of the film in order to send the video to the Guinness Record jury. The camera used was a Sony NEX-FS100. Director Issack gave up his software job to \\"make a film that is different, yet entertaining\\" and said that he wanted his first film to make an impact. He spent over a year on the script and stated that he was inspired by Russian Ark. Ten people were involved in the making of the film, the director, the cameraman, and 8 actors, who were all newcomers.

An in- vehicle parking meter (IVPM) (also known as in-vehicle personal meter, in-car parking meter, or personal parking meter) is a handheld electronic device, roughly the size of a pocket calculator, that drivers display in their car windows either as a parking permit or as proof of parking payment.Parking Today IVPM was first implemented in the late 1980s in Arlington, VA,Electronic iPark Devices Available Again  ARLnow.com and is spreading to campuses and municipalities worldwide as a centralized method of parking management, revenue collection, and compliance enforcement. History Implementation of IVPM began in the late 1980s in Arlington, VA, and is spreading to campuses and municipalities worldwide as a centralized method of parking management, revenue collection, and compliance enforcement. There have since been similar adaptations including the Comet and SmartPark by Ganis Systems,Comet Personal Parking Meter EasyPark by Parx (a subsidiary of On Track Innovations),OTI  Easy Park ParkMagic by ParkMagic Ireland, iPark by Epark, and AutoParq by Duncan Industries. Uses Management Parking managers who implement IVPM are able to combine all permit and pay-for-parking needs into one centralized system, which tracks data on where and for how long drivers are parking in specific locations. IVPMs can be customized based on a parking department's needs for what level of authority is parking, where they park, when they park, how long they park, and how much they are charged. Payment Depending on the entity where IVPM is implemented, drivers either use their debit cards to load funds onto their IVPMs through their computers at home or parking offices distribute the IVPMs to drivers with preloaded permit restrictions. The IVPM only charges drivers for the amount of time they have the device turned on, as opposed to traditional meters that drivers put coins into and return with extra time leftover.Pay For Just The Parking You Use With This New Device  KUT News This feature eliminates \\"meter anxiety,\\" a term coined by Professor Donald Shoup of the University of California that refers to a driver's mental stress of having to return to his or her vehicle before the meter expires. This also ensures drivers who overpay will not overstay, meaning the IVPM is only deducting funds for as long as the driver is outside the vehicle, as opposed to conventional meters that a driver may deposit too much funding into and stay longer than needed. Another IVPM payment method is pay by phone parking, which allows drivers to add parking time through their smartphones. A driver hangs his in-vehicle parking meter in the window for enforcement officers to see. Enforcement Parking enforcers see visually on each IVPM whether a driver has sufficient funds or is parked in a restricted zone. Each distributed IVPM has a personal identification number specific to the registered driver to prevent parking fraud. Most IVPMs are equipped with near field communication to open gates and for parking enforcers to make sure a driver has turned on the device in the event that the window is covered by snow. Sustainability IVPMs typically have an 8-to-10-year lifespan and do not require the use of disposable paper receipts or plastic permits and decals that are associated with conventional parking management methods. Unlike traditional parking meters that require attendants to periodically withdraw funds, there is no infrastructure required to collect IVPM funds and no need for regular maintenance.

Aylwin was best known for creating character roles in successful Edwardian musical comedies early in the 20th century. She turned to roles in non-musical plays by World War I, continued to act into the 1920s and was later a radio broadcaster. Her divorce in 1924 from a colonel in the Intelligence Corps involved allegations of infidelity. Early life and career Aylwin was born in Hawick and was educated at George Watsons College, Edinburgh.Gillan, Don. Jean Aylwin at the Stage Beauty website, accessed 13 December 2012 She began her professional stage career in 1904 with a touring company playing character roles in smaller towns in the British provinces in such melodramas as The Red Coat and No Cross, No Crown. She later toured with a company managed by George Dance as a shop assistant in the Edwardian musical comedy The Girl from Kays, and next was engaged at the Gaiety Theatre, in the chorus. She soon became an understudy there\\"Miss Jean Aylwin\\", The Daily Mail, 29 December 1906 and made her London principal debut in the same theatre, as Sylvana in the long-running musical comedy The Spring Chicken in 1906. George Grossmith, Jr. also appeared in the piece, and over the next four years, Aylwin would play in a series of successful musicals co- written by, and starring, Grossmith. Later the same year, she played Jennie, a maid in the original cast of the first of these, The New Aladdin. A reviewer from The Daily Mail wrote that if she fulfilled her early promise, she \\"has a future before her as character actress that can best be described as a particularly bright one.\\" In 1907, she took the role of Minna in the original run of the hit musical The Girls of Gottenberg. The following year, she performed as Anita in Havana, and in 1909 appeared in Our Miss Gibbs. When Our Miss Gibbs transferred to the Knickerbocker Theatre, New York, in 1910, Aylwin went with it, joining a mostly American cast. By 1912, she was back in England starring in A Scrape O' the Pen, by Graham Moffat, at the Comedy Theatre. One reviewer opined, \\"Jean Aylwin has joined the company, and she was far more at home in the part of Jean Lowther than in a musical comedy role.\\"Playgoer and Society Illustrated, Vol. VII, No. 37, 4 September 1912 The following year, she starred in Who's the Lady at the Garrick Theatre. A reviewer commented: \\"Jean Aylwin, who was altogether charming as Gobette, had no difficulty in showing what an accomplished actress this most outrageous of flirts was. Her delicate art, indeed, all but transmuted base metal into pure gold.\\"\\"Very French Farce at the Garrick ‚Äì Too Much Undressing\\", The Daily Mail, 24 November 1913 The show's success was later described by another critic as \\"in no small degree due to the brilliant acting of Miss Jean Aylwin\\". In 1913‚Äì14, she appeared in Scotland and northern England as the title character in a show with a Scottish theme, A Careless Lassie. The Dundee Courier praised the story of a girl from a rigidly righteous (unco guid) family, who runs away to the music hall stage and then returns, but the Manchester Couriers review lamented that the show's own music hall format gave limited scope to 'clever players' from the 'legitimate' theatre, such as Aylwin. In 1914 she received press coverage for inspiring a style of dress \\"in crepe and lace\\". In 1915, she starred in a second Scottish-themed show, All Scotch. The show was described as a \\"tartan revue\\" and culminated in a sequence in which Aylwin appeared as Bonnie Prince Charlie. The Manchester Courier described the revue as \\"probably one of the best which has been to Manchester\\" and commended the wit and humour, observing that Aylwin \\"sings and dances charmingly\\". Later that year, she supported the comedian Dan Rolyat in his revue She's a Daisy, at the Manchester Hippodrome, and performed in benefit concerts to support the war effort. In February 1916, All Scotch was revived at Her Majesty's Theatre, Dundee, where Aylwin's part was again praised as \\"charming\\" by the press. Later years In 1918, Aylwin appeared in the silent film The Greatest Wish in the World as the Mother Superior. In the same year, she starred in a sketch called Something to his Advantage, written for her by Dion Titheradge, at the Euston Theatre and the Coventry Hippodrome. A reviewer remarked that \\"There may not be much of a 'plot', but there is sufficient to bring out the remarkably fine qualities of Miss Aylwin\\". In 1920, she appeared in Just Like a Woman at the Glasgow Empire. In 1923 she returned to the stage in one of two competing London versions of Polly at the Chelsea Theatre, London. Her role as a Scottish maid was newly introduced for the Chelsea production and does not appear in the original. At the end of that year she announced her permanent retirement from the stage. She stated that she intended to travel to India and other parts of the East, to work with the Wesleyan Missionary Society to improve conditions in leper settlements. She subsequently returned to England, and in 1926 was an early radio broadcaster on the BBC with a programme of \\"Scotch Tales and Songs\\". Personal life On 13 December 1913, Aylwin married Lieutenant-Colonel Alfred Rawlinson, son of Sir Henry Rawlinson, the famed Assyriologist. They were divorced in 1924; the composer Hubert Bath was named as co-respondent in the case. The court heard that while she had been appearing in Polly, she had asked her husband to rent a flat for her opposite the theatre. When he went to visit her there, he encountered Mr Bath. On learning that his wife was too ill to come out, Rawlinson invited Bath out to lunch, who declined, claiming a prior engagement. Rawlinson returned to the flat later, where he again met Bath. When Bath went to ask Aylwin if she was well enough to receive her husband, Rawlinson heard her ask \\"Has he gone?\\" which aroused his suspicions about Bath's presence. Aylwin wrote to her husband afterwards, saying he was \\"quite wrong\\", and that Bath had been \\"a good friend\\". However, the housekeeper testified that Aylwin and Bath had often been alone together at the flat. The court found for Colonel Rawlinson and granted the divorce.

He retired from the Australian National University in 1991. Background Harold Brookfield was born in 1926 and grew up in North London, England. He attended Minchenden Grammar School from 1937‚Äì1943. He joined the RAF in 1943 and trained as ground crew. In 1946 the government offered university scholarships to qualified servicemen, so he took a BSc degree in geography, graduating in 1949 from the London School of Economics and Political Science, University of London at age 19 or 20. His PhD followed in 1950, a study of post-eighteenth century urban development in coastal Sussex. However interests soon shifted to rural issues in developing nations. His academic positions were: * Assistant lecturer in Geography at Birkbeck College at the University of London, from 1948‚Äì1952. * Lecturer and head, Department of Geography at the University of Natal in Durban, South Africa, 1952‚Äì1955. * University of New England Australia 1955‚Äì1957. * Fellow, Australian National University (ANU), 1957‚Äì1969 * Professor at Pennsylvania State University 1969‚Äì1971 (he resigned.\\"The one that finally did tempt me to accept included a proposal that I play a leading role in a new African studies center at Pennsylvania State, but on arrival I quickly found this was at that time nothing but a front, and that it seemed to be assumed I would become a cultural ecologist of the United States. My actual teaching role seemed to me to resemble that of an assembly-line operative in a huge education factory. All this was discouraging, but the worst part of the experience was that Pennsylvania State University was located deep in 'middle America', and I had gone there in 1969 at the height of the Nixon period in American history. I quickly developed contacts in Canada, and on the day Nixon invaded Cambodia in 1970 I happily resigned my tenured post to go to what was initially a very temporary position at McGill.\\" Brookfield, H.C. 2004: American Geography and one non-American geographer.

Also project Director and researcher with PLEC until the early 2000s. He was also an Honorary Fellow at the Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex in the 1970s, and led the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme in Fiji. Contributions Brookfield's research was primarily dedicated to the study of rural societies and the environment in developing nations. He emphasises field studies at the microlevel, drawing on understandings from a range of disciplines. He developed close comparative research methods, identified with cultural ecology to understand rural societies and particularly food-getting activities and farming systems. Brookfield wrote that his abiding concern was the ‚Äò‚Ä¶ adaptation of the use and management of land to variability and change in society, economy and natural environment'; this he called the 'soul' of geography (Brookfield, 2004, 40).Brookfield, H.C. 2004: American Geography and one non-American geographer. GeoJournal 59, 39‚Äì41. He was always ‚Äò... drawn back to the practice and oftentimes humbling experience of fieldwork in distant farmlands, forests, islands and mountains of the developing world' (Connell and Waddell, 2005, 130). Particularly while working at the ANU, beginning in Papua New Guinea, he worked on the 'how' and the 'why' of land use, agrarian systems, and rural development. This came to be known as the 'Brookfield school' of analysis. Brookfield's book 'Interdependent Development', written in 1975 was lauded as a classic (Corbridge, 1996; O‚ÄôConnor, 1996). It started a ‚Äò... theoretical backlash against the irrelevance of several geographical traditions', and argued for a more historical and green/environmental perspective, based on empirical research (Connell and Rugendyke, 2005, 58). His collaboration with Piers Blaikie produced one of the key political ecology texts, 'Land Degradation and Society' in 1987. The United Nations University's Project on People, Land, Management and Environmental Change (PLEC) was a major comparative initiative begun by Brookfield and others, looking at different land use trajectories and how farming actually creates positive biodiversity in the tropics. It promoted farmers as experts. It started in 1992 and was latterly funded by the Global Environmental Facility until 2002. It has resulted in many substantial works.

All coaches are built using the Prevost commercial bus chassis. Millennium has designed custom coaches for business owners, celebrities and pro athletes which have retailed for over $2,000,000. Millennium Luxury Coaches facility sign  History  Millennium is an individual owned company in the marine, aviation and luxury coach building industry. After many years of service in the luxury motorhome market, Nelson Figueroa founded Millennium Luxury Coaches in 2000. He launched Millennium Luxury Coaches in Sanford, Florida during the 2001 recession but built the bus conversion company into a leader in the field with more than 80 employees.  Products and services  Millennium builds Prevost XLII, X3 and H3-45 luxury coach conversions, available in multiple slide and bay configurations. In addition to new coach manufacturing, Millennium offers consignment services as well as an extensive second-hand inventory. The Interior Design Center is run by people who decorate and design custom, one-of-a-kind coaches, as well as offering full interior remodels and updates. In 2013 Millennium started using a Savant systems custom interface, that when paired with an iPhone or iPad, allows Millennium owners to control virtually every aspect of their coach including the lights, awnings, entertainment options, and security system, and even flush the toilets from across the county. Millennium is a Prevost authorized service center equipped to provide professional collision, fiberglass and dent repair. They also provide awning installation, de-lamination, window replacement and full detailing. Additional services that can be found at Millennium are free insurance estimates, secured coach parking and RV storage.  Achievements  Facility interior In January 2011 Millennium was a recipient of the inaugural 2011 Florida Companies to Watch Award, as selected by the Edward Lowe Foundation. July 2012, Millennium gained approval to be added to Transport Canada's List of Vehicles Admissible from the United States, after confirming compliance with all applicable Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (CMVSS), and the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Act (MVSA). In December 2012, Millennium Luxury Coaches announced they had successfully relocated the diesel exhaust fluid inlet to the driver's side of the coach. It had previously been located on the passenger's side, which presented a problem at filling stations because of the pump being located on the driver's side. This stirred controversy as skeptics noted it brought warranty concerns with Prevost. Prevost engineers and management visited Millennium's facility to view the modifications, giving the modifications a thumbs up and eliminating warranty concerns. In May 2013, Millennium received the Association for Corporate Growth's (ACG) SMART Award for the field of Distribution and Transportation. In August 2013, Millennium was awarded the Ultimate Newcomer title, as part of the 2013 Golden 100 Awards.  Events and TV appearances  In January 2012, Millennium was selected to be featured on the TV show Ultimate Travel for their \\"Tricked Out Trailers\\" episode, appearing on the Travel Channel.

Overview The concept was introduced to scholarly circles in 1961 by Rabbi Samuel Sandmel (1911‚Äì1979) of the Hebrew Union College in a paper of the same title, where he stated that he had first encountered the termin French: \\"parall√©lomanie\\" in a French book of 1830, but did not recall the author or the title.Samuel Sandmel, 1961 \\"Parallelomania\\", The Presidential Address Given Before the Society of Biblical Literature, 27 December 1961, reprinted in Presidential Voices: The Society of Biblical Literature in the Twentieth Century (Biblical Scholarship in North America) edited by Harold W. Attridge, Harold, W. Attridge and James (15 November 2006) pages 107-118 Sandmel stated that the simple observations of similarity between historical events are often less than valid, but at times lead to a phenomenon where an author first notices a supposed similarity, overdoses on analogy, and then \\"proceeds to describe source and derivation as if implying a literary connection flowing in an inevitable or predetermined direction\\". Martin McNamara, MSC (Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy) stated that Sandmel's initial paper has proven to be \\"highly influential\\".A Continuum: Targums and Formation of Late Second Temple Judaism by Martin McNamara in Studies on the Text and Versions of the Hebrew Bible in Honour of Robert Gordon by Geoffrey Khan and Diana Lipton (Oct 2011) page 279 Christian and Jewish scholars have used the concept in a number of cases and areas. Thomas Schreiner (Southern Baptist Theological Seminary) applies it to over-generalization of the simple use of the verb \\"see\\" used as a participle to refer to a casual act of observation, to extending its meaning to have deeper spiritual contexts in order to construct parallels.The New American Commentary: 1, 2 Peter, Jude (New American Commentary, 37) by Thomas R. Schreiner (1 September 2003) page 122 Jewish scholar Jacob Neusner has stated that some portrayals of Aphrahat as someone who cherry picked from Rabbinical literature are based on weak parallels which fall within Sandmel's characterization of parallelomania.Aphrahat and Judaism by Jacob Neusner 1971 E.J. Brill pages 188-189 Joseph Fitzmyer, a priest of the Society of Jesus (SJ), states the analyses of the Pauline epistles have at times suffered from parallelomania through the construction of unwarranted analogies with prior traditions.According to Paul: Studies in the Theology of the Apostle by Joseph Fitzmyer (1 January 2003) page 32 Gerald O'Collins, SJ states that most scholars are now aware of the pitfalls of parallelomania which exaggerate the importance of trifling resemblances.Gerald O'Collins, \\"The Hidden Story of Jesus\\" New Blackfriars Volume 89, Issue 1024, pages 710‚Äì714, November 2008 See also * Apophenia * Correspondence (theology) * Hyperdiffusionism in archaeology * Panbabylonism * Pareidolia * Typology (theology) References Category:Biblical criticism ","title":"Parallelomania"},{"id":"37907963","text":"Northwood Hills may refer to: * Northwood Hills, Northwood, London **Northwood Hills tube station * Northwood Hills, Dallas, Texas ","title":"Northwood Hills (disambiguation)"},{"id":"37907968","text":"Amaxia apyga is a moth of the family Erebidae.

She won the bronze medal for the long jump at the 2009 Summer Universiade in Belgrade, Serbia, with an astonishing mark of 6.44 metres. Abdulai, a native of Accra, Ghana, attended on a track and field scholarship at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia. In early 2008, she adopted a Canadian nationality in order to compete internationally for the long jump. She set a national record of 6.72 metres at the Azusa Pacific Invitational in California, and had won long jumps at numerous indoor and outdoor national collegiate championships. Abdulai failed to reach an Olympic standard of 6.70 metres at the Harry Jerome International Track Classic in Vancouver, after attaining her best mark at 6.49 metres. However, she was given another shot for the Olympics by claiming her first-ever national title in the long jump at the Canadian Track and Field Championships in Windsor, Ontario. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Abdulai competed for the women's long jump, along with her teammate Tabia Charles. She jumped outside her personal best of 6.41 metres in the qualifying rounds, placing twenty-sixth in the overall rankings. She was eventually elevated to a single higher position, when Ukraine's Lyudmila Blonska stripped of her silver medal after being tested positive for methyltestosterone. At the 2009 Summer Universiade in Belgrade, Serbia, Abdulai won the bronze medal in the long jump, with her best possible mark of 6.44 metres. In 2010, Abdulai turned her attention to heptathlon by surprisingly winning her first international-level attempt at Mount Sac Relays in California, with a solid score of 6,086 points. The following year, she upset Jessica Zelinka by eighteen points at the national trials, with an A-standard score of 6,150. Abdulai made her official debut for the women's heptathlon at the 2011 IAAF World Championships in Daegu, South Korea, along with her teammate Zelinka, who finished behind her at the national trials. She scored personal bests in the 100 m hurdles (13.60 seconds), shot put (11.72 m), and 800 metres (2:15.29), and a single seasonal best in the high jump (1.80 m), for an outstanding total of 6,212 points, finishing well in thirteenth place.

The Influence of Intellectual Capital on the Types of Innovative Capabilities. Academy of Management Journal, 48(3), 450‚Äì463. Overview Relational capital is defined as all relationships - market relationships, power relationships and cooperation - established between firms, institutions and people, which stem from a strong sense of belonging and a highly developed capacity of cooperation typical of culturally similar people and institutions. Relational dependency may be vertical or horizontal, either up or downstream, shaping different types of cooperative, collaborative or coopetitive mechanisms in different ecosystem.Khavand Kar, Jalil & Khavandkar, Ehsan (2013), \\"Intellectual Capital: Management, Development and Measurement Models\\", 3rd edition, Ministry of Science, Research and Technology Press. There are major conceptual differences between industrial and regional economists in their views towards relational capital. There have been research studies applying quantitative, empirical, and econometric techniques in an effort to verify the existence of relational capital and its importance to the innovation activity in firms. Proxies are found to represent the channels through which knowledge develops at the local level and therefore indirectly of relational capital.

Usually, these phenomena are noticed when they affect blockbuster products‚Äîa blockbuster product in the pharmaceutical industry, for example, is defined as a product with sales exceeding US$1 billion per year. When a product‚Äôs patent expiration comes after 20 years there is a sudden diminish or decrease in a particular company‚Äôs annual income. After the expiration date the combatants then can start selling that particular drug in the market. This was a Patent Cliff. The abrupt drop in sales expected after the date of patent expiration can be estimated with the following formula: Sales = {A}*{Y^B} where A is the peak sales value before the patent expiration and Y the years after the peak sales year (the peak sales year is considered year 0), and B is an exponent with value -1.032. The formula above could be simplified for practical calculations to: Sales = \\\\frac{A}{Y}  Pharmaceutical industry  For example, Plavix, Singulair, Diovan and Lipitor are all chemical blockbuster drugs discovered in the early 1990s, with patent expiration date falling between 2011 and 2015; and Rituxan, Humira, Novolog and Avastin are biologic blockbuster drugs discovered in the late 1990s, with patent expiration date between 2014 and 2019. Thus, the revenue obtained through the sales of these products is at risk of falling drastically within the years of the patent cliff, which is often seen as an opportunity for other companies to generate revenue from selling generic or similar products. Pharmaceutical companies expend significant resources in seeking routes to patent extensions. For instance, one method is to develop a new delivery method for the therapeutic.

It is an annual virtual stock selection competition in which players of novice and professional experience pay a nominal entry-fee to choose a five-stock, long-term portfolio. The contestants with the top-performing portfolios over a 12-month period will direct the sum total of the collected entry-fees to the charitable cause of their choice; and have the opportunity of a meeting with one of the professional hedge fund managers. Mission Portfolios with Purpose is working to achieve universal investment literacy through its new online program, the PwP Academy. Completely free for student users the PwP Academy brings together expert investors from the PwP community with high school and university students from around the world to teach the fundamentals of investment finance in a whole new way. Anchored by PwP‚Äôs annual Student Challenge contest, students are taught core investing principles and encouraged to try out what they‚Äôve learned in a fun, risk-free environment. The PwP Academy introduces students to stock market fundamentals, teaches them how to invest confidently and responsibly, and gives them the tools necessary to begin investing in their own future. Besides gaining critical investment knowledge students will also be encouraged to choose a charity to support throughout the program, establishing the value of giving back early in their professional journey. We believe investment literacy is a critical component for long term financial health and as such, investment education should be universally accessible to students of any background or field of study. Thanks to the support of PwP‚Äôs sponsors, we are happy to offer this education free of charge, and we work continuously with our mission partners to make sure our program is available to those who may benefit from it the most‚Äîespecially young female students or students of color who historically have lacked access to a financial education. By equipping a generation of students with the tools required for personal financial wellbeing we hope to improve outcomes in financial literacy. Operations Portfolios with Purpose is an all-volunteer, non- profit organization overseen by a board of directors. Competitor stock portfolios are tracked, and progress is calculated daily. The contest's financial audits are prepared by Deloitte, and player's entry-fees are held in escrow at JPMorgan Chase. 100% of entry-fees net of credit card service charges are donated to top three competitor's, chosen charitable causes. Senior Management Brett Waikart is the Executive Director and President. Media Coverage After a year-long trial period, the public announcement of Portfolios with Purpose was conducted on June 20, 2012. On September 6, 2012 Portfolios with Purpose announced the start of public registration, and the participation of several major hedge fund players: David Einhorn, Dan Loeb, Leon Cooperman, and Karen Finerman on the CNBC Fast Money Halftime Report. Asher's professional background and the history of the formation of Portfolios with Purpose is detailed along with other notable public figures in Forbes Magazine on December 1, 2012. On December 19, 2013 Portfolios with Purpose announced the official launch of the 2014 Contest Year with several participating philanthropists. The Giving Pledge signatory Leon Cooperman, and Robin Hood Foundation board member David Einhorn both founding Portfolios with Purpose members announced their return to the contest. As well as James Dinan, Marc Lasry, Rich Pzena, and Doug Silverman. History Portfolios with Purpose hosted its first stock picking contest for charity in 2013. 50 friends and family came together to play this year-long contest with each contestant building a fantasy stock portfolio and selecting a charity to represent. Players ‚Äúbought-in‚Äù to the contest with an entry donation and competed to win the combined donation pool for the charity of their choice. As with every contest PwP manages, 100% of all entry donations were passed on to the winning charities. We had no idea this first contest would spark the philanthropic spirit of an entire industry. Fast forward to 2020 and our annual contests regularly draw thousands of professional and amateur investors who compete on behalf of their favorite charities.

Founded in 1978, the Baldy Center is housed within UB‚Äôs School of Law but serves faculty with law and policy interests throughout the university. The Center was endowed by a bequest from Christopher Baldy, a prominent Buffalo attorney and UB School of Law graduate who died in 1959.  Activities  The Baldy Center sponsors interdisciplinary research focusing on the intersection of law and social policy, awarding research grants annually to scholars across the university, especially in law, the humanities and social sciences. It also hosts and sponsors conferences that bring together researchers from across the world to discuss their Law and Society-related research. A list of grants awarded for research and conferences and their recipients is available at the Center's website. The Center‚Äôs intensive book manuscript workshops are organized around drafts of books about law, legal institutions or social policy by UB-affiliated scholars. The interdisciplinary discussions are designed to provide feedback to the authors from interested faculty and outside specialists. The Baldy Center maintains cooperative ties to other interdisciplinary research centers and cosponsors a regional network of sociolegal scholars in New York and Canada. The Center additionally hosts distinguished scholars from around the world as visitors, speakers, consultants and conference participants. The Center offers postdoctoral fellowships to budding scholars hoping to join the academy at American and global universities, along with research fellowships and senior fellowships. Research fellowships link law-and-policy scholars into the Baldy community and its resources, while senior fellowships are geared toward accomplished academics from other universities whose projects are closely related to the Baldy Center‚Äôs mission. Through the Buffalo Legal Studies Research Paper Series, hosted and distributed by the Social Science Research Network, the Center provides an international audience for faculty and visiting scholars.  History  Christopher Baldy graduated from the Buffalo School of Law in 1910, in the days when UB was a private school. He died a bachelor and left most of his estate, initially valued at $1.4 million, to his three brothers, stipulating that when they died, the remainder would be a gift to UB. A surrogate judge in 1973 approved using the Baldy funding to start a new program in law and social policy, a subject area favored by UB‚Äôs law dean, Red Schwartz, a sociologist and the first-ever non-interim dean of an American law school who was not a lawyer. Schwartz was a key figure in the Law and Society movement that emerged in the 1960s and sought to explore how the law actually interacted with society, as opposed to the more formalistic, theoretical and academic approach that permeated legal scholarship for much of the 20th century. Five years later, under then-Dean Thomas Headrick, the program in law and social policy was formalized into the Baldy Center. From 1981 to 2009, the Center hosted the peer-reviewed academic journal Law & Policy. For much of its history, the Baldy Center‚Äôs activities were organized around working groups focused on specific research areas. The number of groups fluctuated over time and during the 1990s were concentrated into more formal Baldy Programs such as Environmental Law and Policy; Children, Families and the Law; Community and Difference; Law, Gender and Social Policy; Human Rights Law and Policy; and Regulation and Public Policy. After 2010, the Center retired the working groups model and instituted its fellowship program while continuing to focus on conferences, book manuscript workshops and supporting research.  Directors  Directors of the Baldy Center have included Barry B. Boyer (co-director 1978-81; director 1981-92), Jim Brady (co-director 1978-81), David M. Engel (1992-2001), Lynn Mather (2002-08), Rebecca French (2008-10) and Errol Meidinger (interim director 2001-02; director 2010-present).

Works career In 2002, Honda announced that it would return to the BTCC after a year's absence, with its works program being run by Arena Motorsport. Andy Priaulx and Alan Morrison were announced as the two drivers who would drive in 2002, and, after a fairly slow start, Priaulx achieved the cars first ever podium, with a second place at the Croft feature race, and then a victory at Knockhill, with Morrison also winning his first race, at the last event of the season. Honda would finish 3rd in the Constructor's championship at the end of the season, with Priaulx finishing a fine 5th in the Driver's championship. 2003 would see an even stronger performance, with Honda Racing expanding to a 3-car team, with Matt Neal and Tom Chilton being entered, along with the retained Morrison. In addition to this, James Kaye drove an ex-works Civic Type-R for his independent Synchro Motorsport team, having previously taken the Production Class championship in a Production-spec Civic Type-R. Neal finished 3rd in the Driver's championship, and Honda would finish 2nd in the Constructor's championship, with 6 wins - moving ahead of MG. James Kaye also finished runner-up in the Independent's championship. For 2004, however, Honda Racing had slimmed down to just a single-car team, driven by Chilton. Team Dynamics replaced its Vauxhall Astra Coupe with a pair of 2003-spec Civics, with Matt Neal and Dan Eaves joining the team (Eaves bringing sponsorship from Halfords, with the team being renamed to Team Halfords to reflect this), whilst James Kaye continued with his Synchro Motorsport Civic. Honda once again finished second in the Constructors championship, with 6 wins being shared between Team Halfords and Honda Racing. Dan Eaves and Matt Neal finished a close 3rd and 4th respectively in the Independents championship, although Neal was the highest placed of the drivers in the main standings - finishing 5th. Later career In 2005, Honda withdrew their works support altogether, and Team Halfords replaced the 2003-spec Civics with a trio of BTC-T Honda Integra Type Rs, designed and built in-house. Arena Motorsport continued to enter Chilton, and James Kaye also continued to drive his Civic, but the cars proved to be much less successful - Chilton's 5th in the championship being a reflection of a smaller grid, although he did achieve 4 wins in the season. 2006 saw Arena Motorsport withdraw, with Mark Proctor's Fast-Tec Motorsport team replacing the Astra of the previous season with a Civic, and Kaye once more entering a Civic. Kaye's 6th in the Independent's championship was the best result out of the two drivers, achieving a solitary podium. Neither driver returned for the 2007 season, and the Civics were thus retired.

With about 15,000 copies sold, the de-Dion-Bouton motor tricycle scored the first breakthrough for the distribution of motor vehicles. In particular the fast-running de Dion-Bouton engine set new standards for vehicular motors, and is regarded as the precursor of all motorcycle engines. Development Jules-Albert de Dion, the engineer of Georges Bouton and his brother-in-law Charles-Armand Tr√©pardoux, founded a workshop in 1882 near Paris. The first project was the production of steam boilers, then a fairly successful steam-powered tricycle from 1887, which should have already reached a speed of 65 km/h. Tr√©pardoux, who wished to continue the further development of steam engines, resigned from the company in 1893; De Dion and Bouton opted for the development of gasoline engines after they viewed Daimler's engines at the Paris Exposition of 1889. Motor In 1895, the first four-stroke engine was ready for production. The 138 cc (bore 50 mm, stroke 70 mm) single- cylinder engine with a surface carburettor produced 0.5 HP at an engine speed of 1500 RPM, a remarkably high speed for the time. For comparison, Hildebrand & Wolfm√ºller reached 240 RPM, and the Daimler Reitwagen motor ran at a maximum of 750 RPM. Bouton discovered that the glowplug ignition was the obstacle to higher speeds, and developed a high-voltage ignition system for the motor with circuit breaker. The dry battery for the ignition is under the upper frame tube (in the case of a motor tricycle); ignition timing could be adjusted with a small lever. Side valves were driven via a gear-driven camshaft, with automatic snifting valve activation. The advantage of the design should have been very early (0‚Äì5 degrees before top dead centre) opening inlet valve. The cylinder head was removable and bolted with four bolts on the crank case. The weight of the existing cast-iron engine including all auxiliary units amounted to less than 20 kg. \\"The benefits of this engine were simplicity and ease.\\" Before its public production in 1897, Jules-Albert de Dion had experimented with a vertical bar contraption that would allow for a greater seat flexibility. After a production model was produced, Jules-Albert de Dion personally tested this model, and production was halted temporarily in favor of a redesign after he sustained serious damage to his Rectum and recuperated from a shattered Coccyx due to an engineering error. Motor tricycle The De Dion-Bouton motor tricycle went into production in 1897 weighing just under 80 kg, with an output of 1.5 HP at 1,800 RPM from its 211 cc motor, although the engine had already been established in a prototype tricycle in 1895. The tricycle with track width of 92 cm was chosen, because according to Dion and Bouton \\"a bike appeared too fragile for this purpose.\\" The drive was achieved via a pair of gears from the motor directly to the rear axle. A differential balanced the different curve radii. The relatively high purchase price amounted to 1000 to 1500 gold marks. The motor tricycle remained in continuous production for almost ten years. The last model (1904) increased the engine capacity and performance with a 955 cc displacement engine (bore 100 mm, stroke 120 mm) producing 8 HP at 1,800 RPM. On April 13, 1902, the French racer Georges Osmont set a speed record of 109.1 km/h in Nice with a De Dion- Bouton motor tricycle. Licensees and copies After the start of series production of the motor in 1895, and with the production of the motor tricycle in 1897, numerous manufacturers built engines or complete tricycles either under license or copied with slight changes: *Belgium: Antoine (Kelecom), Minerva *Germany: Adler, Beckmann, Cudell, Express (with Aster engines), Fafnir, Opel, Stoewer *England: Excelsior, Humber, M.M.C. *France: Aster, Henriod, Peugeot, Werner Motors (model 1901) *Switzerland: Motosacoche, Z√©del *United States: Thomas Auto-Bi, Orient (with Aster engines) See also *List of motorcycles of 1900 to 1909 *List of motorized trikes Notes References External links * Category:Steam tricycles Category:Motorcycles introduced in the 1890s ","title":"De Dion-Bouton tricycle"},{"id":"37908512","text":"Concrete Night () is a 2013 drama film directed by Finnish filmmaker Pirjo Honkasalo. The film is based on a novel with the same name, written by Pirkko Saisio and published in 1981, though adapted to modern times. The story has also been adapted to theatre and has been played in Finland and in Venezuela. Concrete Night had its world premiere at Toronto International Film Festival in the Masters Series in September 2013. The film was shot in the Helsinki area in Finland in September and October 2012.Article about Concerte Night on Screen Daily Produced by Misha Jaari and Mark Lwoff from production company Bufo and co-produced by Swedish Plattform Produktion and Danish Magic Hour Film, the film was funded by Finnish Film Foundation, Yle, Nordisk Film & TV Fond, Swedish Film Institute, Danish Film Institute and Danske Radio. The film was nominated for the 2014 Nordic Council Film Prize. It was selected as the Finnish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 87th Academy Awards, but was not nominated. Plot Concrete Night tells about a 14-year-old boy named Simo (Johannes Brotherus) who still lacks his own sense of self and the ability to protect himself from his surroundings. Simo and his big brother Ilkka are the sons of a helpless and unpredictable single mother. Their chaotic home is located deep in the heart of a concrete jungle in Helsinki. Ilkka has one day of freedom left before starting his prison sentence. The mother persuades Simo to spend the last night with his brother. Events heighten throughout the one day and night in Helsinki and the brothers witness incidents they would rather not see. Simo, who has no ability to distort what he sees or delude himself, sees things accurately as they are. When unfiltered, the world seems unbearable. Finally a casual encounter with a photographer, whose intentions Simo misreads, launches him into blind fear, which explodes in panic stricken violence.

The 2003 Sin Piedad was the fourth event under that name that CMLL promoted as their last major show of the year, always held in December. In the main event Universo 2000 risked his mask and Pierroth, Jr. risked his hair on the outcome of their Lucha de Apuestas (bet match). The undercard featured an additional Luchas de Apuestas match where both √Ångel Azteca and Arkangel de la Muerte put their mask on the line, guaranteeing that one of them would be forced to unmask after the match.

One of the driving storylines in Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) in 2004 was the formation of the group called La Furia del Norte (\\"The Northern Fury\\"). La Furia del Norte was directly or indirectly involved in the top three matches on the show including both the main event and the semi-main event. The group was created in mid-2004 when the rudo trio of Pierroth, Vampiro Canadiense and Tarzan Boy working against the tecnico team of Negro Casas, Shocker and Perro Aguayo Jr. The two groups were involved in the 2004 Infierno en el Ring steel cage match. The match came down to Aguayo Jr. and Negro Casas who had been the young Aguayo's mentor up until then. The match saw Aguayo Jr. trick his mentor and escape the cage, forcing Negro Casas to have his hair shaved off as a result. Following the match Perro Aguayo Jr. turned rudo and aligned himself with Pierroth Jr., Vampiro and Tarzan Boy to form the group La Furia del Norte, which later added H√©ctor Garza and El Terrible to its ranks as well. The trio of Garza, Terrible and Tarzan defeated the team of Black Warrior, Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and El Canek to win the CMLL World Trios Championship in November, 2004. In the early part of 2004 Perro Aguayo Jr. had been involved in a heated storyline with Los Hermanos Dinamita (Cien Caras, Universo 2000 and M√°scara A√±o 2000), the continuation of Los Hermanos feud with Aguayo Jr.'s father Perro Aguayo. The simmering tension between the two rudo teams came to a head in late 2004 with Perro Aguayo Jr. targeting Universo 2000 while Furia members Pierroth and Vampiro worked with Cien Caras and M√°scara A√±o 2000. At the 2003 Sin Piedad Pierroth Jr. has lost a Luchas de Apuesta to Universo 2000 and was looking to even the score against Universo's brothers. Event The opening match of the show featured CMLL's Mini-Estrella division in a tag team match. The tecnico team of Tzuki and √öltimo Drag√≥ncito wrestled against two of the most experienced Mini-Estrellas, the rudo team of Espectrito and Pierrothito in a \\"best two-out-of-three\\" falls match. The tecnico team won the third and final fall to claim the overall victory. In the second match the Mexican National Trios Champions, El Felino, Safari and Volador Jr., defended their championship against the Pandilla Guerrera (\\"Gang of Warriors\\") group that consisted of Doctor X, Hooligan and Nitro. The champions successfully retained their titles, winning the best two out of three falls six-man tag team match. In the third match of the night, new addition to the Los Guerreros del Infierno (\\"The Infernal Warriors\\") group Ol√≠mpico teamed up with founders Rey Bucanero and √öltimo Guerrero to defeat the tecnico trio of Atlantis, Dos Caras Jr. and Shocker, two falls to one. While El Terrible, H√©ctor Garza and Tarzan Boy held the CMLL World Trios Championship at the time it was not on the line in the fourth match as La Furia del Norte took on the team of El Hijo del Santo, Negro Casas and M√≠stico. M√≠stico had yet to establish himself as a top player in CMLL, but had been taken under the wing of Hijo del Santo and Negro Casas, two of the top tecnicos of the time. La Furia lost both the second and the third fall of the match. The fifth match of the night was more of a brawl than a wrestling match, with Perro Aguayo Jr. and Universo 2000 both wrestling a very aggressive match that saw both wrestlers fight outside the ring for extended periods of time. At one point Universo 2000 even pushed Perro Aguayo, Sr. who was at ringside. Near the end of the match Universo 2000 tried to apply the \\"Black Hammer\\", his signature move. Universo's \\"Black Hammer\\" was the storyline reason for why Aguayo, Sr, had to retire and the prospect of Universo 2000 doing the same to his son caused Perro Agauayo to jump in the ring and attack Universo 2000 before he could execute the move. The attack caused his son to be disqualified but the Aguayos did not care as they ran Universo 2000 out of the ring. The main event tag team match saw all four wrestlers brawl throughout the arena, something which was unusual for CMLL matches at the time, but really help convey the intensity of the storyline between the four men. At one point Pierroth's aide La Comandante came to the ring to help out, but was stopped before she could get to the ring. In the end Los Hermanos Dinamita defeated both Pierroth and Vampiro, forcing them both to be shaved bald as a result of the match. Aftermath The storyline between the Aguayos and Los Hermanos Dinamita drew Perro Aguayo out of retirement for one last match. The Aguayos clashed with Cien Caras and M√°scara A√±o 2000 in the main event of the 2005 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (\\"Homage to Two Legends\\") show the following match. The Aguayos were successful and both Dinamitas were shaved bald following their loss. La Furia del Norte later became known as Los Perros del Mal (\\"The Bad Dogs\\") as the group expanded with even more members.

It is intended to be a small extension over C++11, featuring mainly bug fixes and small improvements. Its approval was announced on August 18, 2014. C++14 was released on December 15, 2014. Because earlier C++ standard revisions were noticeably late, the name \\"C++1y\\" was sometimes used instead until its approval, similarly to how the C++11 standard used to be termed \\"C++0x\\" with the expectation of its release before 2010 (although in fact it slipped into 2010 and finally 2011).  New language features  These are the features added to the core language of C++14.  Function return type deduction  C++11 allowed lambda functions to deduce the return type based on the type of the expression given to the return statement. C++14 provides this ability to all functions. It also extends these facilities to lambda functions, allowing return type deduction for functions that are not of the form \`return expression;\`. In order to induce return type deduction, the function must be declared with \`auto\` as the return type, but without the trailing return type specifier in C++11: auto DeduceReturnType(); // Return type to be determined. If multiple return expressions are used in the function's implementation, then they must all deduce the same type. Functions that deduce their return types can be forward declared, but they cannot be used until they have been defined. Their definitions must be available to the translation unit that uses them. Recursion can be used with a function of this type, but the recursive call must happen after at least one return statement in the definition of the function: auto Correct(int i) { if (i  1) return i; // return type deduced as int return Correct(i-1)+i; // ok to call it now } auto Wrong(int i) { if (i != 1) return Wrong(i-1)+i; // Too soon to call this. No prior return statement. return i; // return type deduced as int }  Alternate type deduction on declarationhttp://thbecker.net/articles/auto_and_decltype/section_10.html  In C++11, two methods of type deduction were added. \`auto\` was a way to create a variable of the appropriate type, based on a given expression. \`decltype\` was a way to compute the type of a given expression. However, \`decltype\` and \`auto\` deduce types in different ways. In particular, \`auto\` always deduces a non-reference type, as though by using \`std::decay\`, while \`auto&&\` always deduces a reference type. However, \`decltype\` can be prodded into deducing a reference or non-reference type, based on the value category of the expression and the nature of the expression it is deducing: int i; int&& f(); auto x3a = i; // decltype(x3a) is int decltype(i) x3d = i; // decltype(x3d) is int auto x4a = (i); // decltype(x4a) is int decltype((i)) x4d = (i); // decltype(x4d) is int& auto x5a = f(); // decltype(x5a) is int decltype(f()) x5d = f(); // decltype(x5d) is int&& C++14 adds the \`decltype(auto)\` syntax. This allows \`auto\` declarations to use the \`decltype\` rules on the given expression. The \`decltype(auto)\` syntax can also be used with return type deduction, by using \`decltype(auto)\` syntax instead of \`auto\` for the function's return type deduction.  Relaxed constexpr restrictions  C++11 introduced the concept of a constexpr-declared function; a function which could be executed at compile time. Their return values could be consumed by operations that require constant expressions, such as an integer template argument. However, C++11 constexpr functions could only contain a single expression that is returned (as well as \`static_assert\`s and a small number of other declarations). C++14 relaxes these restrictions. Constexpr-declared functions may now contain the following: * Any declarations except: ** \`static\` or \`thread_local\` variables. ** Variable declarations without initializers. * The conditional branching statements \`if\` and \`switch\`. * Any looping statement, including range-based \`for\`. * Expressions which change the value of an object if the lifetime of that object began within the constant expression function. This includes calls to any non-\`const\` \`constexpr\`-declared non-static member functions. \`goto\` statements are forbidden in C++14 relaxed constexpr-declared functions. Also, C++11 stated that all non-static member functions that were declared \`constexpr\` were also implicitly declared \`const\`, with respect to \`this\`. That has since been removed; non-static member functions may be non-\`const\`. However, per the restrictions above, a non-\`const\` \`constexpr\` member function can only modify a class member if that object's lifetime began within the constant expression evaluation.  Variable templates  In prior versions of C++, only functions, classes or type aliases could be templated. C++14 allows the creation of variables that are templated. An example given in the proposal is a variable \`pi\` that can be read to get the value of pi for various types (e.g., \`3\` when read as an integral type; the closest value possible with \`float\`, \`double\` or \`long double\` precision when read as \`float\`, \`double\` or \`long double\`, respectively; etc.). The usual rules of templates apply to such declarations and definitions, including specialization. template constexpr T pi = T(3.141592653589793238462643383); // Usual specialization rules apply: template<> constexpr const char* pi = \\"pi\\";  Aggregate member initialization  C++11 added member initializers, expressions to be applied to members at class scope if a constructor did not initialize the member itself. The definition of aggregates was changed to explicitly exclude any class with member initializers; therefore, they are not allowed to use aggregate initialization. C++14 relaxes this restriction, allowing aggregate initialization on such types. If the braced init list does not provide a value for that argument, the member initializer takes care of it.  Binary literals  Numeric literals in C++14 can be specified in binary form. The syntax uses the prefixes \`0b\` or \`0B\`. The syntax is also used in other languages e.g. Java, C#, Swift, Go, Scala, Ruby, Python, OCaml, and as an unofficial extension in some C compilers since at least 2007. https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=23479#c29  Digit separators  In C++14, the single-quote character may be used arbitrarily as a digit separator in numeric literals, both integer literals and floating point literals. This can make it easier for human readers to parse large numbers through subitizing. auto integer_literal = 1'000'000; auto floating_point_literal = 0.000'015'3; auto binary_literal = 0b0100'1100'0110; auto a_dozen_crores = 12'00'00'000; auto silly_example = 1'0'0'000'00;  Generic lambdas  In C++11, lambda function parameters need to be declared with concrete types. C++14 relaxes this requirement, allowing lambda function parameters to be declared with the \`auto\` type specifier. auto lambda = [](auto x, auto y) {return x + y;}; Concerning \`auto\` type deduction, generic lambdas follow the rules of template argument deduction (which are similar, but not identical in all respects). The code above is equivalent to this: struct { template auto operator()(T x, U y) const {return x + y;} } lambda{}; Generic lambdas are essentially templated functor lambdas.  Lambda capture expressions  C++11 lambda functions capture variables declared in their outer scope by value-copy or by reference. This means that value members of a lambda cannot be move-only types. C++14 allows captured members to be initialized with arbitrary expressions. This allows both capture by value-move and declaring arbitrary members of the lambda, without having a correspondingly named variable in an outer scope. This is done via the use of an initializer expression: auto lambda = [value = 1] {return value;}; The lambda function \`lambda\` returns 1, which is what \`value\` was initialized with. The declared capture deduces the type from the initializer expression as if by \`auto\`. This can be used to capture by move, via the use of the standard \`std::move\` function: std::unique_ptr ptr(new int(10)); auto lambda = [value = std::move(ptr)] {return *value;}; The attribute \`deprecated\` The \`deprecated\` attribute allows marking an entity deprecated, which makes it still legal to use but puts users on notice that use is discouraged and may cause a warning message to be printed during compilation. An optional string literal can appear as the argument of \`deprecated\`, to explain the rationale for deprecation and/or to suggest a replacement. deprecated int f(); deprecated(\\"g() is thread-unsafe. Use h() instead\\") void g( int& x ); void h( int& x ); void test() { int a = f(); // warning: 'f' is deprecated g(a); // warning: 'g' is deprecated: g() is thread-unsafe. Use h() instead }  New standard library features   Shared mutexes and locking  C++14 adds a shared timed mutex and a companion shared lock type.  Heterogeneous lookup in associative containers  The C++ Standard Library defines four associative container classes. These classes allow the user to look up a value based on a value of that type. The map containers allow the user to specify a key and a value, where lookup is done by key and returns a value. However, the lookup is always done by the specific key type, whether it is the key as in maps or the value itself as in sets. C++14 allows the lookup to be done via an arbitrary type, so long as the comparison operator can compare that type with the actual key type. This would allow a map from \`std::string\` to some value to compare against a \`const char*\` or any other type for which an \`operator< \` overload is available. It is also useful for indexing composite objects in a \`std::set\` by the value of a single member without forcing the user of \`find\` to create a dummy object (for example creating an entire \`struct Person\` to find a person by name). To preserve backwards compatibility, heterogeneous lookup is only allowed when the comparator given to the associative container allows it. The standard library classes \`std::less<>\` and \`std::greater<>\` are augmented to allow heterogeneous lookup.  Standard user-defined literals  C++11 defined the syntax for user-defined literal suffixes, but the standard library did not use any of them. C++14 adds the following standard literals: * \\"s\\", for creating the various \`std::basic_string\` types. * \\"h\\", \\"min\\", \\"s\\", \\"ms\\", \\"us\\", \\"ns\\", for creating the corresponding \`std::chrono::duration\` time intervals. * \\"if\\", \\"i\\", \\"il\\", for creating the corresponding \`std::complex\`, \`std::complex\` and \`std::complex\` imaginary numbers. auto str = \\"hello world\\"s; // auto deduces string auto dur = 60s; // auto deduces chrono::seconds auto z = 1i; // auto deduces complex The two \\"s\\" literals do not interact, as the string one only operates on string literals, and the one for seconds operates only on numbers.  Tuple addressing via type  The \`std::tuple\` type introduced in C++11 allows an aggregate of typed values to be indexed by a compile-time constant integer. C++14 extends this to allow fetching from a tuple by type instead of by index. If the tuple has more than one element of the type, a compile-time error results: tuple t(\\"foo\\", \\"bar\\", 7); int i = get(t); // i  7 int j = get<2>(t); // Same as before: j  7 string s = get(t); // Compile-time error due to ambiguity  Smaller library features  \`std::make_unique\` can be used like \`std::make_shared\` for \`std::unique_ptr\` objects. \`std::integral_constant\` gained an \`operator()\` overload to return the constant value. The class template \`std::integer_sequence\` and related alias templates were added for representing compile-time integer sequences, such as the indices of elements in a parameter pack. The global \`std::begin\`/\`std::end\` functions were augmented with \`std::cbegin\`/\`std::cend\` functions, which return constant iterators, and \`std::rbegin\`/\`std::rend\` and \`std::crbegin\`/\`std::crend\` which return reverse iterators. The \`std::exchange\` function template assigns a new value to a variable and returns the old value. New overloads of \`std::equal\`, \`std::mismatch\`, and \`std::is_permutation\` take a pair of iterators for the second range, so that the caller does not need to separately check that the two ranges are of the same length. The \`std::is_final\` type trait detects if a class is marked \`final\`. The \`std::quoted\` stream I/O manipulator allows inserting and extracting strings with embedded spaces, by placing delimiters (defaulting to double-quotes) on output and stripping them on input, and escaping any embedded delimiters. Compiler support Clang finished support for C++14 in 3.4 though under the standard name c++1y, and made C++14 the default C++ standard in Clang 6. GCC finished support for C++14 in GCC 5, and made C++14 the default C++ standard in GCC 6. Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 has implemented \\"almost all\\" C++14 features.

It belongs to a class of Kondo insulators. At temperatures above 50 K its properties are typical of a Kondo metal, with metallic electrical conductivity characterized by strong electron scattering, whereas at low temperatures, it behaves as a non-magnetic insulator with a narrow band gap of about 4‚Äì14 meV. The cooling-induced metal- insulator transition in SmB6 is accompanied by a sharp increase in thermal conductivity, peaking at about 15 K. The reason for this increase is that electrons do not contribute to thermal conductivity at low temperatures, which is instead dominated by phonons. The decrease in electron concentration reduced the rate of electron-phonon scattering. Some research claims that it may be a topological insulator. Other researchers found no evidence of topological surface states. The increasing electrical resistance with a reduction in temperature indicates that the material behaves as an insulator; however, recent measurements reveal a Fermi surface (an abstract boundary of electrons in momentum space) characteristic of a good metal, indicating a more exotic dual metal-insulating ground state. The electrical resistivity at temperatures below 4K displays a distinct plateau, which is thought to be the coexistence of an insulating state (bulk) and a conducting state (surface). At temperatures approaching absolute zero, the quantum oscillations of the material grow as the temperature declines, a behavior that contradicts both the Fermi analysis and the rules that govern conventional metals. While it has been argued that quantum oscillations on samples grown from aluminium flux may arise from aluminum inclusions, such an explanation is excluded for samples grown by the image furnace method rather than by the flux growth method.

Ranade was a vocalist trained in traditional Hindustani Art music. He was a composer constantly experimenting with new uncharted vistas. A pioneer of Cultural Musicology in India, Dr Ranade was a missionary who contributed in enriching India‚Äôs cultural life in the 21st century.  Education  Ranade was trained under Pt. Gajananrao Joshi of Gwalior, Jaipur, Agra Gharana (training period ‚Äì 1948‚Äì58), Pt. Pralhad Ganu of Agra Gharana (training period ‚Äì 1958‚Äì62), Pt. Laxmanrao Bodas of Gwalior Gharana (training period ‚Äì 1962‚Äì66) and Prof. B. R. Deodher of Gwalior Gharana (training period ‚Äì 1970‚Äì74). He also got lessons & insight for \\"Voice Culture\\" from Prof B R Deodhar. Besides this musical training, Ranade had a strong academic background. He did LL.B. (University of Bombay, 1960), M.A. (Marathi, 1962 & English, 1964 ‚Äì both from University of Bombay). He was awarded with title \\"Sangeetacharya\\" by Akhil Bharatiya Gandharva Mahavidyalaya Mandal, Bombay in 1976.  Career  He was Founder Director of University Music Center, Bombay (now, Department of Music, University of Mumbai) and served during 1968 to 1983. He was instrumental in foundation of Archives and Research Center for Ethnomusicology for American Institute of Indian Studies at Pune and worked as Associate Director from 1983 to 1984. Later he was appointed as Deputy Director (Research, Theatre Development and Publications) at National Center for the Performing Arts from 1984 to 93.  Academic work  He was one of the pioneer of ethnomusicology in India. His books in English and Marathi are considered to be most authentic and thoughtful sources of cultural musicology. His books Indology and Ethnomusicology: Contours of Early Indo-British Relationship (Promilla and Co., New Delhi, 1992), Essays in Indian Ethnomusicology (Munshiram Manoharlal, New Delhi, 1998), Perspectives on Music: Ideas and Theories (Promilla and Co. Publishers, New Delhi and Chicago, 20080 and Reflections on Musicology and History ‚Äì With reference to Hindustani Music (Indian Musicological Society, Mumbai-Baroda, 2001) give insights in Indian ethnomusicology. In Keywords and Concepts in Hindustani Music and Music-Contexts: A Concise Dictionary of Hindustani Music, he has meticulously explained many terms and concepts in Hindustani Art music with etymology and cultural connotations. Two of his books, Stage Music of Maharashtra and Maharashtra: Art music shed light on the musical theatre and art music in Maharashtra, giving a wider perspective about region based cultural musicology. In Some Hindustani Musicians: They lit the way! (Promilla Publishers, New Delhi, 2011), Dr Ranade's observations and interpretations about various maestros in Hindustani Music give us an analytical perspective along with the aesthetic experience of the musician‚Äôs music. He contributed a lot in developing the \\"Aesthetics of Indian Music\\" through his book Sangeetache Saundarya Shastra (‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó‡•Ä‡§§‡§æ‡§ö‡•á ‡§∏‡•å‡§Ç‡§¶‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø‡§∂‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞). He also introduced the aesthetics of Western music to Indian readers through his book, Stravinsky che Sangeetik Saundarya Shastra. \\"The theory of six categories of music\\" is considered to be the most important and well accepted theory proposed by Ranade which structures Musical categories as 1.Primitive, 2.Folk, 3.Art, 4.Devotional, 5.Popular and 6.Confluence. He was pioneer in theorizing the unexplored areas such as Folk Music in India in his book Lok Sangeet Shastra (‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§∂‡§æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞), Hindi Film Song: Music Beyond Boundaries and Popular music in the book Sangeet Sangati (‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó‡•Ä‡§§ ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§ó‡§§‡•Ä). He also contributed in Theatre theory with the book Music and Drama (Sri Ram Center for Art and Culture, New Delhi, 19910. His books Bhashan Rang (‡§≠‡§æ‡§∑‡§£‡§∞‡§Ç‡§ó) is used as a handbook of Voice culture for theatre. He had penned down his musicings on theatre in Bhashan Ani Natya Vishayak Vichar (‡§≠‡§æ‡§∑‡§£ ‡§µ ‡§®‡§æ‡§ü‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡§Ø‡§ï ‡§µ‡§ø‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞).  Compositions  Ashok Da. Ranade composed many Bandishes, with pen- name \\"Rasik Rang\\", in many common and rare Ragas and Talas. He has also re- interpreted many traditional compositions with his unique aesthetic vision. He also composed more than 60 Marathi 'Baithakichi Lavani' compositions.  Teaching  He contributed as an educationist in the field of music with giving basic insights for making courses & syllabuses at many Indian and foreign Universities. As a guru he trained many in Hindustani Art Music such as Milind Malshe, Kedar Bodas, Suresh Bapat, Kalyani Salunke, Shuchita Athalekar, Manjusha Patil, Vidya Dengle, Madhao Imartey, Sameer Dublay, Chaitanya Kunte etc. Many renowned singers such as Shruti Sadolikar, Faiyaz, Rajashri Pathak, Ranjana Joglekar,Prachi Dublay, etc. also got guidance from him during the thematic concerts.

He described Xenopus laevis, the African clawed frog, for the first time in his doctoral thesis. Near the end of the 1940s, he discovered that birds can use the sun as a compass. Career In 1933 Kramer did a study on Xenopus laevis in Berlin. At the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research, under Ludolf von Krehl, he worked on the metabolism of warm-blooded animals. After that, he worked as an assistant at German-Italian Institute of Marine Biology in Rovinj, Croatia. In 1941, he relocated to Naples to conduct a study on lizards, especially the Adriatic lizard. He studied the comparative morphological and genetic differences between mainland and island forms to draw conclusions about the lizard's speciation. In 1948 Kramer headed a department of the Max Planck Institute for Marine Biology in Wilhelmshaven. There he conducted research on how birds are able to orient themselves over long distances. He constructed an apparatus that allowed him to test how animals react to the position of the sun by tricking the animals into thinking the sun was in a different position. With this experiment, he demonstrated that the direction of flight is dependent on the position of the sun in the sky. Because this ability requires an inner clock to measure the time of day, Kramer sought cooperation with J√ºrgen Aschoff. From 1 April 1958, Kramer worked with the emerging Aschoff Max Planck near T√ºbingen. Death On 19 April 1959, while trying to remove young rock pigeons from their nests in the mountains of Calabria, he fell and was killed instantly. His two sons secured his body from the high-running mountain river Raganello. The obituary written by Konrad Lorenz in the Journal of Ornithology stated: \\"his authorized worldwide fame as the initiator of experimental analytical orientation research\\" should not be forgotten.Konrad Lorenz: Gustav Kramer ‚Ä†.

High school career At the conclusion of his senior year, Smith was a unanimous All-State pick while playing for Alton High School. He was named Co-News-Gazette Player of the Year with former University of Illinois great Nick Anderson. Smith was also named MVP in the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association All-Star game. Smith was also named a Street and Smith All- American at the conclusion of his senior year at Alton. During his high school playing time, Smith averaged 24.4 points, 4.9 rebounds, 8.0 assists and 4.1 steals per game in his senior season. College career 1986-87 season As a freshman, Smith appeared in 20 games while averaging 5.4 minutes. He totaled 38 points and dished out 16 assists. 1987-88 season During Smith's sophomore season, his playing time jumped to nearly 13 minutes per game, including five starts out of the 20 games he played. Amazingly, Smith played only 18 minutes against Chicago State, but scored 16 points on 6 of 8 shooting. Finally, he was third on the team with 80 assists. 1988-89 season Smith was an instrumental force in the 1988‚Äì89 Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team's drive to the Final Four. He started nine games during that season and played in all 36. Smith led the Fighting Illini in assists, dishing out 157 (4.4 per game) during that same season. His aggressive play off the bench sparked the Fighting Illini's running game while helping Illinois to a team average 86.4 points per game, its highest since 1966. Smith quarterbacked the Illinois offense in the stretch run, despite not being a starter. It was Smith who scored 12 points consecutively against Purdue and Ohio State, as Illinois kicked off a 10-game winning streak that included Big Ten wins over Indiana, Iowa and Michigan and five consecutive NCAA victories. 1990-91 season Smith experienced a redshirt season in 1989-90 which moved his fourth year of eligibility to the 1990-91 season. During that season, Smith was named a co-captain and started 29 of 31 games. He scored 394 total points while averaging 13.6 points per game. Smith made 24 of 63 three-point field goals and 90 of 129 free throws.

She won the bronze medal for the 400 metres, and ultimately, led her national team to claim the sprint relay title at the 2009 Summer Universiade in Belgrade, Serbia. She is also a three- time junior national champion, a two-time silver medalist at the Canadian Track and Field Championships. Muir made her international debut at the 2005 Pan American Junior Championships in Windsor, Ontario, where she captured the silver medal for the 400 metres, with an impressive time of 52.38 seconds. She also achieved a top-ten finish for the relay team at the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and had won two individual silver medals at the national trials. In 2008, Muir set her personal best, and attained a B-standard time of 51.77 seconds at the Harry Jerome International Track Classic in Burnaby, British Columbia, which earned her a qualifying spot for the Olympics. Muir became the youngest track and field athlete to represent Canada at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where she competed for the women's 400 metres. She ran in the second heat against six other athletes, including Italy's Libania Grenot and Botswana's promising track star Amantle Montsho. She finished the race in third place by one hundredth of a second ahead of Cuba's Indira Terrero, with her personal best time of 51.55 seconds. Muir advanced into the next round of the competition, as she secured the final mandatory qualifying slot in the second heat. Muir, however, fell short in her bid for the final, as she placed seventh in the semifinal rounds, with her slowest possible time of 52.37 seconds. At the 2009 Summer Universiade in Belgrade, Serbia, Muir captured the bronze medal in the women's 400 metres, finishing behind her teammate Esther Akinsulie by thirty-seven hundredths of a second (0.37), with a time of 52.07 seconds. She also displayed a spectacular performance by pacing the women's 4√ó400-metre relay team to a gold medal triumph. At the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India, Muir missed out of the medal podium, as she placed sixth in the final by more than two seconds behind her former rival Montsho in the 400 metres. She initially finished fourth for her national team in the women's 4 √ó 400 m relay; however, they were immediately upgraded into the bronze medal position, following the disqualification of the Nigerian team. Muir later emerged as a strong favorite to qualify for her second Olympics in London; however, she missed out of her contention with a third-place finish behind Jenna Martin, who attained a B-standard time of 51.55 seconds, at the Canadian Track and Field Championships in Calgary, Alberta. Muir currently resides in Toronto, Ontario. Between 2012 and 2014 she trained in Florida before moving back to Toronto to train and the Athletics Canada East Hub, where she helped the Canadian 4 √ó 400 m Women's Relay team finish 6th giving automatic qualifying for the 2015 World Championships and Rio Olympics 2016. In 2016 Muir moved to UK based coach Nick Dakin where, along with winning a number European races she broke her 8 year old Personal Best, running 51.05 in Madrid. After winning the Canadian National Championships 400m she was officially named to Canada's Olympic team in the individual Women's 400m and then as part of the 4 √ó 400 m Women's relay for the second time.

Parker, which was first staged in 1911. The play was commissioned by the actor George Arliss who saw a portrayal of the Victorian British statesman Benjamin Disraeli as an ideal vehicle for his stage career.Fells p.25-26 It was written in London during 1910. Parker suffered from writer's block at one point and received some assistance from Arliss. Parker included a subplot lifted from the 1839 play Richelieu by Edward Bulwer-Lytton which was later the subject of some controversy. He added a number of fictitious characters to add excitement and drama to the story. The real role of Lionel de Rothschild in the purchase was changed to that of the fictional banker Meyers.Fells p.28 The play premi√®red at Wallack's Theatre in New York City on 18 September 1911. The play was a popular success for Arliss, and developed a loyal following. It became Arliss' signature role and he was strongly identified with it in popular culture. Synopsis In 1875, the British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli attempts to gain control of the Suez Canal and secure Britain's route to India. He manages to secure a loan from a London financier Meyers, but has to thwart the machinations of a network of Russian spies operating in Britain who attempt to wreck the purchase. He also has to face down fierce opposition in the House of Commons led by William Gladstone. Both Disraeli and Meyers have to contend with a degree of prejudice from their contemporaries because of their Jewish heritage. Film adaptations The play was adapted for the screen on three occasions. The first was a 1916 British film, Disraeli, starring the stage actor Dennis Eadie. Arliss then managed to acquire the film rights to the work for $3,000 and in 1921 he appeared in the silent film version, Disraeli. In 1929, following the sound revolution, Arliss made a sound remake, Disraeli, for Warner Brothers. The film was a major critical and popular success and Arliss won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance. References Bibliography * Fells, Robert M.

Tate spaces were introduced by , who named them after John Tate. Introduction A typical example of a Tate vector space over a field k are the Laurent power series :V = k((t)). \\\\, It has two characteristic features: * as n grows, V is the union of its submodules t^{-n} kt, where kt denotes the power series ring. These submodules are referred to as lattices. * Even though each lattice is an infinite-dimensional vector space, the quotients of any individual lattices, :: t^{-n} kt / t^{-m} kt, \\\\ n \\\\ge m :are finite-dimensional k-vector spaces. Tate modules Tate modules were introduced by to serve as a notion of infinite-dimensional vector bundles. For any ring R, Drinfeld defined elementary Tate modules to be topological R-modules of the form :P \\\\oplus Q^* where P and Q are projective R-modules (of possibly infinite rank) and * denotes the dual. For a field, Tate vector spaces in this sense are equivalent to locally linearly compact vector spaces, a concept going back to Lefschetz. These are characterized by the property that they have a base of the topology consisting of commensurable sub-vector spaces. Tate objects Tate objects can be defined in the context of any exact category C., Briefly, an exact category is way to axiomatize certain features of short exact sequences. For example, the category of finite-dimensional k-vector spaces, or the category of finitely generated projective R-modules, for some ring R, is an exact category, with its usual notion of short exact sequences. The extension of the above example k((t)) to a more general situation is based on the following observation: there is an exact sequence :0 \\\\to kt \\\\to k((t)) \\\\to t^{-1} k[t^{-1}] \\\\to 0 whose outer terms are an inverse limit and a direct limit, respectively, of finite-dimensional k-vector spaces :kt = \\\\lim_n k[t]/t^n :t^{-1} k[t^{-1}] = \\\\operatorname{colim}_m \\\\bigoplus_{i=-1}^{-m} t^i \\\\cdot k. In general, for an exact category C, there is the category Pro(C) of pro- objects and the category Ind(C) of ind-objects. This construction can be iterated and yields an exact category Ind(Pro(C)). The category of elementary Tate objects : \\\\operatorname{Tate}^\\\\text{el}(C) is defined to be the smallest subcategory of those Ind-Pro objects V such that there is a short exact sequence :0 \\\\to L \\\\to V \\\\to L' \\\\to 0 where L is a pro-object and L' is an ind- object. It can be shown that this condition on V is equivalent to that requiring for an ind-presentation :V: I \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Pro}(C) the quotients V_j / V_i are in C (as opposed to Pro(C)). The category Tate(C) of Tate objects is defined to be the closure under retracts (idempotent completion) of elementary Tate objects. showed that Tate objects (for C the category of finitely generated projective R-modules, and subject to the condition that the indexing families of the Ind-Pro objects are countable) are equivalent to countably generated Tate R-modules in the sense of Drinfeld mentioned above. Related notions and applications A Tate Lie algebra is a Tate vector space with an additional Lie algebra structure. An example of a Tate Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of formal power series over a finite- dimensional Lie algebra. The category of Tate objects is an exact category, as well, as can be shown. The construction can therefore be iterated, which is relevant to applications in higher-dimensional class field theory, which studies higher local fields such as : \\\\mathbf F_p((t_1))\\\\cdots((t_n)). has introduced the so-called determinant torsor for Tate vector spaces, which extends the usual linear algebra notions of determinants and traces etc. to automorphisms f of Tate vector spaces V. The essential idea is that, even though a lattice L in V is infinite-dimensional, the lattices L and f(L) are commensurable, so that the in the finite-dimensional sense can be uniquely extended to all lattices, provided that the determinant of one lattice is fixed. has applied this torsor to simultaneously prove the Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem, Weil reciprocity and the sum of residues formula. The latter formula was already proved by by similar means.

The line links the Riffelalp Resort to Riffelalp station, on the Gornergrat railway, and via that line to Zermatt and beyond. The Riffelalp tram is the highest tram line in Europe. History The Riffelalp Grand Hotel, the predecessor of today's Riffelalp Resort, was opened by Alexander Seiler in 1884. In 1898, the Gornergrat railway was opened, linking Zermatt to the summit of the Gornergrat. The line included a station called Riffelalp, but this was situated some distance from the resort. In order to provide better access to the station, the hotel built the Riffelalp tram. The line opened on 13 July 1899, one year after the opening of the Gornergrat railway. The original track was long and electrified, using a twin overhead line carrying a three-phase ac supply at 550 volts. The tram operated in the summer months only. During the night of 14 February 1961, the Riffelalp Grand Hotel was destroyed in a fire. The original tram vehicles survived the fire, but without traffic from the hotel, tram service was suspended, it had last run on September 30, 1960. The vehicles were taken to Zermatt for storage, and the line remained closed for the next 40 years. In 1998, work started on the construction of the new Riffelalp Resort on the site of the old grand hotel. As part of this reconstruction, the tram line was relayed on its original route. The wooden bodies of the original cars had deteriorated in storage, whilst modern safety standards precluded the reintroduction of the original three-phase supply. The original cars were therefore rebuilt with replacement bodies and using battery power. The new line was opened on 15 June 2001. Operation The tram line follows the footpath that links the Riffelalp station, at above sea level, with the Riffelalp Resort, at above sea level. The line has a length of and comprises a single track of 800 mm gauge ( gauge). At the station end of the line, the tram shares the building of the station and is linked to its cargo ramp. There is no direct connection to the Gornergrat railway, which is of gauge. At the resort end of the line, there is a terminal loop and a depot for the trams, with a battery station. There are two trams in use, along with a goods trailer. Both trams are powered by a battery (80 V, 400 Ah) and two d.c. motors each delivering 10 kW, and a maximum speed of . The battery is partially recharged during the electric braking operation. The service operates during the resort's summer season, which runs from June to September. It is the access route recommended for its guests by the Riffelalp Resort, who provide porter assistance at both Zermatt and Riffelalp stations. During the resort's winter season, from December to April, a snowmobile service is provided in place of the tram.

On 16 October 1946 Kemball sailed on the Queen Elizabeth from Southampton to New York.UK and Ireland, Outward Passenger Lists, 1890-1960 This was the first voyage of the newly-converted liner after her serving as a troop ship during WWII. Kemball was the recipient of a Commonwealth Fund Scholarship, on his way to Princeton, to work with Professor H S Taylor, a leading expert on heterogeneous catalysis. Princeton was at the forefront of research on catalysis, and \\"the 'Princeton experience' was the key to the distinguished that career Charles was to have in the field of heterogeneous catalysis\\". Kemball sailed on the same ship back to England in September 1947, and joined the Department of Colloid Science at Cambridge to take up his Research Fellowship at Trinity. In the summer of 1949 Kemball moved to the Department of Physical Chemistry. Having reassembled his newly- introduced mass spectrometer system, he started on an extensive period of research on the exchange reactions of hydrocarbons with deuterium by using evaporated metal films as catalysts; this was a significant a development of his work with Taylor at Princeton. In 1951 he was a recipient of the Meldola Medal from the Chemical Society, which is awarded to the most promising British chemist under the age of 32. He was Professor of Physical & Inorganic Chemistry at Queen's University Belfast (1954‚Äì66) and Professor of Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh (1966‚Äì87). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1965 and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1967. His proposers for the latter were Sir Edmund Hirst, Neil Campbell, Duncan Taylor and James Pickering Kendall. He twice served as Vice President to the Society: 1971 to 1974 and 1982 to 1985. He served as President 1988 to 1991. He won the Society's Gunning Victoria Jubilee Prize 1976-1980. Kemball received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 1980. He was appointed CBE in the 1991 New Year Honours. He died at home in Tyninghame in East Lothian on 4 September 1998. Appointments, awards and honours Family In 1956 he married Kathleen (Kay) Purvis Lynd. They had one son, Alan Kemball, and two daughters, Mary and Heather. Each of his three children had three children and he was survived by nine grandchildren.

He has written several books including Absolute Brightness and Virgin Territory, and is also active in the entertainment industry as an actor and producer.  Screenwriting career  Lecesne wrote the 1995 short film Trevor, which won the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. He based the screenplay for Trevor on a character from his one-man show Word of Mouth. Also in 1995, Word of Mouth won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show. Word of Mouth was directed by Eve Ensler.  The Trevor Project  In 1998, on the night Ellen DeGeneres hosted the television debut of Trevor on HBO, Lecesne co-founded and launched The Trevor Project as the first nationwide 24-hour crisis intervention lifeline for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning youth, including phone, in-person and online life-affirming resources such as Trevor Lifeline, TrevorChat, TrevorSpace, Ask Trevor and Trevor Education Workshops. The Trevor Project has been supported by a wide variety of celebrities, including Daniel Radcliffe, Neil Patrick Harris, James Marsden, Kim Kardashian, George Takei, and Anderson Cooper. Lecesne and Ryan Amador are the co-founders of The Future Project, a program to for LGBTQ high school students to share stories and express themselves in performances, musical compositions, and original writing.  Publishing career  In 1993, Lecesne published My First Car, an illustrated collection of reminiscences in which dozens of celebrities recall the loss of their \\"auto-virginity.\\" The book, released by Crown Trade Paperback, contained more than 100 stories and was illustrated with pictures of celebrities and their cars. In 2008, the HarperCollins imprint HarperTeen published Lecesnes's young adult novel Absolute Brightness, the story of \\"a luminous force of nature, a boy named Leonard Pelkey, who encounters evil and whose magic isn't truly felt until he disappears.\\" In 2010, Lecesne's book Virgin Territory was published by EgmontUSA, and marketed to teenagers grades 9 and up. The Denver Public Library Review stated: \\"Teenager Dylan Flack, since the death of his mother, has left New York City for Jupiter, FL, trying to reinvent his life. Eclectic in spirit, exploring sexual desire, pondering the mysterious connections between people, there's nothing religious here, despite the title. Nor is virginity the topic, although Dylan loses his. It's just Lecesne gently laying bare both the humor and pain that accompany love and loss.\\" In 2013, Lecesne updated his Oscar-winning short film, Trevor, turning it into a novella. Publishers Weekly stated: \\"It's the story of 13-year-old Trevor, a boy who stages a re-enactment of Jacques-Louis David‚Äôs La Mort de Marat in his bathtub and plans to dress up as his idol, Lady Gaga, for Halloween. (In the film Trevor, the teenager was a diehard Diana Ross fan.) While Trevor isn‚Äôt ready to declare himself gay, he doesn‚Äôt want anyone else doing so on his behalf, either (‚ÄúSome of us prefer to remain a mystery‚Äîeven to ourselves‚Äù). Trevor's interests (Lady Gaga, theater, his baseball-playing buddy Pinky) make him a target, however, culminating in the word 'faggot' being scrawled on his locker and a subsequent suicide attempt. Given the story's long history, it's no surprise that Lecesne nails Trevor's personality and voice, a combination of self-assuredness, sharp humor, and enthusiasm.\\" Lecesne also contributed pencil drawings to the book, which was published by Triangle Square Publishing.  Theatrical career  Lecesne, an off-Broadway veteran, made his Broadway debut in 2012 performing the role of Dick Jensen in Gore Vidal's political drama The Best Man, which also starred James Earl Jones, Angela Lansbury, Cybill Shepherd, and Eric McCormack. In February 2015, Lecesne's play \\"The Absolute Brightness of Leonard Pelkey,\\" a solo show he adapted from his 2008 young adult novel, opened at Dixon Place in New York City with high praise from theater critics. The production is directed by Tony Speciale, with music by Duncan Sheik. In July 2015, the show opened at the off-Broadway Westside Theatre where it completed a successful run in November 2015. The New York Times theater review stated: \\"A show about the brutal murder of a 14-year-old boy should not, logically speaking, leave you beaming with joy. And yet that‚Äôs the paradoxical effect of ‚ÄúThe Absolute Brightness of Leonard Pelkey,‚Äù a superlative solo show written and performed by James Lecesne, himself a pretty darn dazzling beacon of theatrical talent.\\" In January 2016, \\"The Absolute Brightness of Leonard Pelkey\\" opened in Los Angeles at the Kirk Douglas Theatre. The play was presented by The Philadelphia Theatre Company in May and June 2017.  Private life  Lecesne practices Nichiren Buddhism and is a member of the global Buddhist association Soka Gakkai International. As part of his spiritual practice, Lecesne has stated that he recites the Buddhist chant Namu My≈çh≈ç Renge Ky≈ç each day.

The film deals with the life of the Nobel Prize-winning Soviet scientist Lev Landau. The premiere in Paris on 25 January 2019 was in the form of a dozen feature films screened inside an extensive around-the-clock immersive installation. The film is one of Russia's largest and most controversial cinematic projects. An eventual conventional cinematic release of a single feature film is also planned, as are documentaries and a television series.  Cast  Teodor Currentzis, a Greek classical conductor, plays the title role of Dau while Radmila Shchegoleva, the only professional actor in the major cast, plays his wife. Alexei Blinov, technical development lead for the feature film, also acts in it as Prof. Blinov. The cast also included: Gerard Depardieu, Anatoly Vasiliev, Dmitry Chernyakov, Olga Shkabarnya, Peter Sellars, Romeo Castellucci, Adin Steinsaltz, Carsten H√∂ller, Marina Abramoviƒá, David Gross, Shing-Tung Yau, Nikita Nekrasov, Carlo Rovelli, James Fallon, Willem Dafoe, Charlotte Rampling, and others.  Production  Filming in KharkivThe preparation for the shooting for the film began in 2006, whereas the actual shooting started in 2008 and went on for three years. In 2017, The Daily Telegraph reported that the film was still being edited and the production company was quoted as saying, The Institute setThe film was shot at various sites in Azerbaijan, Russia, Ukraine, Germany, United Kingdom and Denmark. Most of the film was shot on a specially constructed set called \\"The Institute\\" in Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine. The Institute was the largest film set in Europe, the area totalling 12,000 m2. The set was a dynamic creative reconstruction of a Soviet restricted-access Institute in 1938-1968, located in Moscow. The filming included performances by multiple personalities, including Russian neo-Nazi leader Maxim Martsinkevich. Some actors lived in The Institute in character 24 hours a day. The destruction of the set became an integral part of the story and was shot on 8 November 2011.  Release  The world premi√®re of the film was intended to take place at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival but the film was not completed yet. The release was scheduled for October 2018 in Berlin (with similar happenings following in Paris and London) as a month-long, full time operating, immersive art installation, featuring a replica of the Berlin Wall. The city ultimately did not approve the plans, as there was too little time for authorities to check for safety for an event of these proportions, with the production company having submitted the plans less than a month prior to the event. The project finally premiered in Paris on 25 January 2019 in the form of 12 separate feature films screened inside an installation evoking The Institute and spanning the Centre Pompidou and two municipal theaters, the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet and the Th√©√¢tre de la Ville. Instead of tickets entry is by \\"visas\\" of 6 hours, 24 hours or an unlimited duration. In the latter two cases, the visit is personalized according to a psychometric questionnaire which the visitor is requested to fill on registration. Audiences walk into an intermediary space, halfway between ruins and a theater set that is both contemporary and Soviet. From dusk to dawn, the three sites are linked in the sky by the Red Triangle, a light sculpture inspired by the Russian avant-garde of the early 20th century. Additional presentations are planned in London and Berlin. In April 2020, the first two films in the series were released for paid online viewing, with an additional twelve films listed on the official website. Tablet magazine critic Vladislav Davidzon wrote that with the massive immersive theater project \\"Khrzhanovsky has built a testament to a great film that will never be‚Äîand could never be. DAU is a massive success as a feat of will, but a massive failure of artistry and craftsmanship.\\" See also * DAU (project) * DAU.

Biography Mary Moffat was the first of ten children born to Robert Moffat, a Scottish missionary and his wife Mary (n√©e Smith 1795‚Äì1870). Mary was born in Griquatown, about 93 miles north of Kimberley. She spent her early life at Kuruman. From 1839 to 1843 she lived in Britain with her parents. When the family returned to South Africa, she taught in the school at Kuruman where she met David Livingstone. She married Livingstone in January 1845, despite her mother's disapproval. The couple lived initially in Mabotsa before moving to Chonuane and then onto Kolobeng, North West Province. She accompanied Livingstone on his two journeys across the Kalahari desert in 1849 and 1850. Her fourth child was born shortly after returning from the first of these journeys and died only weeks later. Her fifth child was born on their second journey, delivered by her husband. She did not go on Livingstone's first expedition to the Zambezi, 1853‚Äì1856, because she lived in Britain for four years for the sake of the children's education and safety - travelling across a desert with small children, not enough water, no fruit or vegetables and sickness due to malaria was unsustainable. In 1852 Mary returned to Scotland with her 4 children but staying with relatives proved difficult. After several moves she eventually moved to Kendal where she lived with Charles and Susanna Braithwaite who were evangelical Quakers and supporters of the London Missionary Society. Dr Livingstone and Mary's parents were missionaries of this society. When Livingstone returned to England a national hero he stayed with the Braithwaites on a number of occasions. Livingstone joined her in Britain from 1856 to 1858. In 1858 she returned to Africa to accompany Livingstone on the official \\"Zambezi Expedition\\" but became pregnant again and left the expedition to go to her parents' home in Kuruman for the birth of the new child. She and the child soon returned to Britain. The gravestone of Mary Livingstone in Chupanga. The inscription reads: Here repose the mortal remains of Mary Moffat, the beloved wife of Doctor Livingstone, in humble hope of a joyful resurrection by our saviour Jesus Christ. She died in Shupanga House, 27 April 1862, aged 41 years.  Children  Mary and David had 6 children: # Robert 1845 # Agnes, born in 1847, who married Alexander Low Bruce in 1875, and died in 1912. # Thomas 1848 # Elizabeth 1850 # William Oswell, born in 1851, married Catherine Jane Anderson in 1875, and died in 1892. # Anna Mary, born in 1858, married Frank Wilson in 1881, and died in 1939. Death Returning to Africa she met Livingstone at the mouth of the Zambezi, but fell ill from malaria in the camp at Shupanga and died there 3 months later on 27 April 1862.
