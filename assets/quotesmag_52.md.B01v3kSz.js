The etymology of the name translates as \\"deep-tailed swimmer from the lake\\", in reference to its assumed aquatic habits hypothesized by its discoverers. Hypuronector was related to the arboreal Megalancosaurus. It was a small animal, estimated to be only long in life. So far dozens of specimens of Hypuronector are known, but despite this, scientists have not found any complete skeletons. This makes attempts to reconstruct Hypuronector's body or lifestyle highly speculative and controversial. Paleobiology Despite their evolutionary relationship, it has been suggested by some scientists that Hypuronector may have had a different ecological niche than other drepanosaurs. It has long been accepted that Megalancosaurus was an arboreal chameleon-like animal. Hypuronector has inversely been suggested to be aquatic due to its deep, paddle-like tail and the fact that its remains were found in an ancient lake bottom. However, several studies on its limb morphology, as well as the rather delicate tail vertebrae without evidence of extensive caudal musculature, rule out an aquatic hypothesis, and it was likely arboreal like other drepanosaurs. Perhaps more extremely, it has been suggested to be a glider or flyer, due to the limb proportions, particularly the elongated forelimbs. These are consistent with an animal with patagia, like a flying squirrel.

A charcoal biscuit is a biscuit based on a powdered willow charcoal or activated carbon mixed with ordinary flour, and made into dough with butter, sugar and eggs.  History  Charcoal biscuits were first made in England in the early 19th century as an antidote to flatulence and stomach trouble. The Retrospect of Practical Medicine and Surgery, a medical text published in 1856, recommends charcoal biscuits for gastric problems, saying each biscuit contained ten grains (648 mg) of charcoal. Vegetable Charcoal: Its Medicinal and Economic Properties with Practical Remarks on Its Use in Chronic Affections of the Stomach and Bowels, published in 1857, recommends charcoal biscuits as an excellent method of administering charcoal to children.  Contemporary forms  In modern times charcoal biscuits are made in the form of crackers to accompany cheeses. The biscuits have a slight hint of charcoal taste that is described by some as pleasing. The biscuits have also been marketed as a pet care product to control flatulence in pets, and as aids to digestion or stomach problems in humans. Cultural references In Brideshead Revisited, Evelyn Waugh writes of Charles Ryder consuming charcoal biscuits and iced coffee while cramming for exams at Oxford. Ludwig Wittgenstein is said to have eaten very little else while staying in Ireland.Ray Monk, Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius, New York, Penguin, 1990, p. 522. Several of Terry Pratchett's Discworld books mention charcoal biscuits. In Hogfather they are a restorative for the God of Indigestion. In Reaper Man, they are implicated in the explosive death of Mustrum Ridcully's uncle. In Men At Arms, they are a treat for a small dragon, and in Guards!

It can also mean a person thinking too much of oneself (often without the credentials) or feeling entitled. History Cover of sheet music for the song titled: \\"Don't Try to Knock a Chip from Riley's Shoulder.\\" (J. W. Wheeler) which alludes to the expression. An American wartime poster alluding to the expression. This custom is known in North America since the early 19th century. The New York newspaper Long Island Telegraph reported on 20 May 1830 \\"when two churlish boys were determined to fight, a chip would be placed on the shoulder of one, and the other demanded to knock it off at his peril\\". A similar notion is mentioned in the issue of the Onondaga Standard of Syracuse, New York on 8 December 1830: \\"'He waylay me', said I, 'the mean sneaking fellow‚ÄîI am only afraid that he will sue me for damages. Oh! if I only could get him to knock a chip off my shoulder, and so get round the law, I would give him one of the soundest thrashings he ever had'.\\" Some time later in 1855, the phrase \\"chip on his shoulder\\" appeared in the Weekly Oregonian, stating \\"Leland, in his last issue, struts out with a chip on his shoulder, and dares Bush to knock it off\\". In American author Mark Twain's 1898 manuscript of Schoolhouse Hill, character Tom Sawyer states his knowledge of the phrase and custom when he says, \\"[I]f you want your fuss, and can't wait till recess, which is regular, go at it right and fair; put a chip on your shoulder and dare him to knock it off.\\"William M. Gibson, ed., Mark Twain's Mysterious Stranger Manuscripts (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1969), p.177. In Canada, the custom is well described at St. Peter Claver's Indian Residential School for Ojibway boys in the town of Spanish, Ontario: The challenger might further provoke his opponent by issuing a dare for him to knock off the chip. The opponent might then display his bravery and contempt by brushing the cheek of the challenger lightly as he did so. In more formal cases, a second might take the chip and present the chip to his man who would then place it on his own shoulder. The boys would then square off and fistfight like boxers.A dictionary of slang and unconventional English, Eric Partridge, Paul Beale, p.210 In popular culture In the 1970s a commercial for a household battery used Robert Conrad, who dared the viewer to knock an Eveready battery off his shoulder.

He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Ramsey, Huntingdonshire and Birmingham Handsworth from 1910 to 1945 as a Conservative. He was the brother of Godfrey Locker-Lampson MP and cousin of the diplomat Miles Lampson. Birth and education He was the younger son of the poet Frederick Locker, and his second wife, Hannah Jane Lampson (daughter of Sir Curtis Lampson, Bt. Frederick Locker took the name Locker-Lampson as a condition of his father-in-law's will). His ancestors included Captain William Locker, Edward Hawke Locker, Benjamin Stillingfleet and Jonathan Boucher. Oliver was educated at Cheam School, Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge where he gained an Honours Tripos Degree in History and Modern Languages. While at Cambridge, he was co-editor of Granta with Edwin Montagu and President of the Amateur Dramatic Club.Obituary in The Times 9 October 1954 After Cambridge he studied law at the Inner Temple and was called to the Bar in 1907 but never practised. Instead he worked as a journalist for several years and was also a founding director of a Norwich-based motorcar vendor, Duff, Morgan and Vermont. As an MP, he did not wish his name to appear in the company name, so he used the home state of his mother, Vermont. In 1911 he was the victim of a practical joke by an old school friend, Horace de Vere Cole. Cole challenged Locker-Lampson to a footrace on a London street, and allowed him to pull ahead. Then he shouted \\"Stop thief! He's got my watch!\\" - having previously slipped his gold watch into Locker-Lampson's pocket.Downer, Martyn. The Sultan of Zanzibar. The bizarre world of Horace de Vere Cole. London: Black Spring Press, 2010  Parliamentary career  Locker-Lampson was elected to the House of Commons at the January 1910 general election as the member for the Ramsey Division in Huntingdonshire, defeating the Liberal incumbent. He stood as a Conservative Unionist on a Tariff Reform ticket. He was re-elected in the December 1910 general election. With the outbreak of the First World War, there were no elections held until 1918, and he continued as an MP throughout this period although absent on active service abroad for much of 1915 to 1918. Before the 1918 general election, constituencies were redrawn and the Ramsey Division was abolished. A new all Huntingdonshire seat was created, and Locker-Lampson stood for this instead, and was elected. He was Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer Austen Chamberlain from 1919 to 1921, and accompanied Chamberlain to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. In the 1922 election he moved to Birmingham Handsworth and was elected there. He held Birmingham Handsworth from 1922 until the 1945 general election, when he was de-selected by the constituency party. Political activity before the First World War Locker-Lampson's early political career was taken up with a number of causes. He was appointed by the Conservative and Unionist Party to raise money for the Unionist Working Men's Candidates Fund. He was also involved in a secret plan by Arthur Steel-Maitland and Conservative Central Office to gain control of the Daily Express, but was outmanoeuvred by the future Lord Beaverbrook. However, his main political preoccupation before 1914 was harrying Asquith's Liberal government over the selling of honours and the Marconi scandal. He also opposed Irish Home Rule, and raised funds for Edward Carson's Pro-Unionist Ulster Volunteer Force. Great War service In December 1914 Locker-Lampson received a commission in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve with the rank of Lieutenant Commander. This was largely on the basis of an understanding with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, that he would personally fund the establishment of an armoured car squadron for the Royal Naval Air Service's Armoured Car Division. After training at Whale Island, Hampshire and in north Norfolk near his family home, Newhaven Court, Cromer, Locker-Lampson's No. 15 Squadron was sent to France, then operated in the unoccupied portion of Belgium on attachment to the Belgian Army during much of 1915. By the end of 1915, trench warfare meant there was no scope for armoured cars on the Western Front and most of the RNAS's armoured car squadrons were disbanded by the Admiralty. However, three squadrons of RNAS armoured cars were assembled and sent by ship to Archangel as the Armoured Car Expeditionary Force (ACEF), also known as the Russian Armoured Car Division,Bartholemew, E. (1988). Early Armoured Cars, Shire Publications. p21. with Locker-Lampson in command in order to show support for Britain's Russian ally. Sea ice prevented the Division from reaching Archangel and men and armoured cars were landed at the small town of Alexandrovsk.Stibbons, B.. The Baker Brothers: Diaries from the East Front 1914-1919. Lowestoft: Poppyland Publishing, 2018. The ACEF operated with the Russian Army in several areas, including Galicia, Romania, and the Caucasus.Perrett, Bryan; Lord, Anthony. The Czar‚Äôs British Squadron. London: William Kimber, 1981; and Fletcher, David. War Cars: British Armoured Cars in the First World War. London: HMSO, 1987 Locker-Lampson became somewhat entangled in Russian politics at this time. He said later that he had been asked to participate in the 1916 assassination of Rasputin,Napley, Sir David. Rasputin in Hollywood. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1990 and that he had a secret plan to get Tsar Nicholas II out of Russia after his abdication in March 1917. It is also alleged that in September 1917 he was involved in Kornilov's attempted coup against the provisional government of Kerensky.Ullman, Richard. Intervention and the War. Princeton University Press, 1961. pp. 11-13; and Kettle, Michael. The Allies and the Russian Collapse. March 1917-March 1918. Andre Deutsch, London: 1981 After the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917, the ACEF was withdrawn from Russia. In 1918 selected personnel and armoured cars transferred to the Machine Gun Corps and served as 'Duncars' within Dunsterforce in Persia and Turkey, though without Commander Locker-Lampson, who in 1918 became the Ministry of Information's Russian Representative. Post-First World War career Partly because of his experiences in Russia, Locker-Lampson became fiercely anti- Communist and suspicious of covert Bolshevik influence in Britain's economy, society and politics. In the 1920s he organised several mass rallies under the banner 'Rout the Reds', many of which were stewarded by members of Rotha Lintorn-Orman's British Fascisti.Pugh, Martin, Hurrah for the Blackshirts!: Fascists and Fascism in Britain between the Wars (London: Pimlico, 2006) p. 61. He also expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler in the Daily Mirror, touting the future leader of Nazi Germany as \\"a legendary hero\\" and \\"the most masterly expounder and contriver in the length and breadth of the Reich\\".The Daily Mirror, 30 Sept. 1930, p. 7. In 1931, he founded the \\"Sentinels of Empire\\", also known as the Blue Shirts, a quasi-paramilitary organisation \\"to peacefully fight Bolshevism and clear out the Reds!\\" Their motto was his family motto \\"Fear God! Fear Naught!\\" Their anthem, \\"March On\\", with words written by Locker-Lampson, music originally from the film High Treason, was sold as sheet music and as a 78-rpm record. A phonograph record of the anthem was sent to Mussolini, along with silver and blue-enamelled cufflinks and badge, as a gift from the Blue Shirts.Berkeley Daily Gazette, 8 March 1932, p. 6. Time - Volume 18 - 1931 \\"This lyric was personally composed by Commander Locker-Lampson, son of English poet Frederick Locker, maternal ... The music for Commander Locker-Lampson's patriotic song March On! is from the British Gaumont talking film High Treason... Although Locker-Lampson claimed that the organisation had 100,000 members, the Blue Shirts were short-lived and appeared to make little impact. Nevertheless, they did attract the praise of the Nazi philosopher Alfred Rosenberg, who in 1931 had lunch with Locker- Lampson at the Savoy during a visit to London. This was organised by the MI6 spy F. W. Winterbotham who was investigating the Nazis at the time, posing as an admirer who could help the Nazis make links with prominent figures in Britain. Locker-Lampson‚Äôs Blue Shirts apparently \\"delighted Rosenberg, and when he heard that their objective was to counter Communist propaganda he was even more enthusiastic\\", and Rosenberg later sent him a gold cigarette case as a \\"token of his esteem\\". Locker-Lampson returned the gift with some embarrassment.Winterbotham, F. W. The Nazi Connection (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1978) pp. 34-5. The meeting is further verified in a report in the Daily Express, 5 May 1933, p. 19. From 1933 onwards, Locker-Lampson redirected his political ire against fascism both in Britain and in continental Europe. In July 1933 he introduced a Private member's bill to extend British citizenship to Jewish refugees from Nazi persecution, though it failed to become law. In September, he provided Albert Einstein with refuge at a camp on Roughton Heath near his home in Cromer in north Norfolk, after Einstein had received death threats while living in Belgium.Clark, Ronald W., Einstein: the Life and Times. London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1973. He later worked to help other high-profile victims of fascism, including Haile Selassie and Sigmund Freud,Sigmund Freud Museum, London, U.K. Locker-Lampson proposed a parliamentary bill to confer citizenship on Freud. as well as numerous ordinary Jewish people, whom he personally sponsored in order they might escape Nazi persecution in Germany and Austria.See, for example, Lambert, Anna. Du Kannst Vor Nichts Davonlaufen. Picus, Vienna: 1992; and letter in The Times, 25 March 2010: http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article7074535.ece Some have called his efforts \\"exceptional in how he saved Jews from Germany.\\"\\"Saviour of Jews\\", The Sunday Times, U.K., 25 March 2010 In 1934 he introduced a Ten Minute Rule Bill to ban the wearing of political uniforms - aimed at Oswald Mosley's Black Shirts (British Union of Fascists). The Bill did not become law, but a similar bill sponsored by the government did become law in 1936. In 1935 he was a founding member of Focus,See Spier, Eugen. Focus. A footnote to the history of the thirties. Oswald Wolff, London: 1963 a cross-party group opposed to the prevailing policy of Appeasement of German and Italian aggression. In 1936 he was instrumental in the successful prosecution of the British fascist Arnold Leese for his publication of anti-Semitic literature. Throughout the 1930s he was one of the few Conservative MPs to continue to support Winston Churchill during his \\"wilderness years\\" of political isolation. Age and ill-health prevented him from taking a very active part in the Second World War, though he joined the Home Guard and continued to support Winston Churchill vociferously from the backbenches.James, Robert Rhodes ed. (1967) 'Chips' The Diaries of Sir Henry Channon, p.387 in Phoenix paperback edn. He retired from politics at the 1945 General Election. Personal life The Locker-Lampson family's principal home was Rowfant in West Sussex. Following his mother's death in 1915 Oliver's older brother Godfrey inherited Rowfant while Oliver inherited the family's summer home, Newhaven Court in Cromer, Norfolk. He was married twice. His first wife, Bianca Jacqueline Paget, whom he married in 1923, died in 1929. He married his second wife, Barbara Goodall, in 1935. They had two sons, Jonathan and Stephen.

Turkish tobacco plants usually have a greater number and smaller size leaves. These differences can be attributed to climate, soil, cultivation and treatment methods. Historically, it was cultivated primarily in Thrace and Macedonia, now divided among Bulgaria, Greece, North Macedonia and Turkey, but it is now also grown on the Black Sea coast of Turkey, in Egypt, in South Africa and elsewhere. The name \\"Turkish\\" refers to the Ottoman Empire, which ruled the historic production areas until the late 19th/early 20th century.  History  Stacks of dried oriental tobacco in Prilep, North Macedonia Tobacco originated in the Americas and was introduced to the Ottoman Turks by the Spanish. The Ottoman people over time developed their own method of growing and using tobacco. Many of the early brands of cigarettes were made mostly or entirely of Turkish tobacco; today, its main use is in blends of pipe and especially cigarette tobacco. Turkish tobacco is sun-cured, which makes it more aromatic and, like flue-cured tobacco, more acidic than air or smoke-cured tobacco, thus more suitable for cigarette production. Murad cigarettes by Rea Irvin in 1900 It has a much milder flavour and contains less nicotine and fewer carcinogens than other varieties.Turkish tobacco, a little history In the early 1900s, manufactures of Turkish and Egyptian cigarettes tripled their sales and became legitimate competitors to leading brands. The New York-based Greek tobacconist Soterios Anargyros produced the hand-rolled Murad cigarettes, made of pure Turkish tobacco. Murad ad by Rea Irvin in 1918 Surely one of the most gorgeously over-the-top ad campaigns for any cigarette was the long-running series for Murad brand made by Rea Irvin. Nevertheless, tastes in Europe and the United States shifted away from Turkish tobacco and towards Virginia tobacco, during and after the First World War. Cigarettes containing Turkish tobacco (which includes those varieties grown in what is now Greece) exclusively continued to be manufactured and sold as \\"Turkish cigarettes\\" in the US (brands Murad, Helmar, Fatima and others), the UK (Sullivan & Powell, Benson & Hedges, Fribourg & Treyer, Balkan Sobranie) and Germany (where the so-called \\"Orientzigaretten\\" had the major market share before the Second World War) But they are not available anymore, and many brands, like Murad, disappeared.  Turkish tobacco in American Blends  R.J. Reynolds' new \\"Turkish blend\\" cigarette Today, Turkish tobacco is a key ingredient in American blend cigarettes (Virginia, Burley, Turkish) introduced with Camels in 1913. Demand for Oriental tobacco remains high. But despite high demand, the capacity to grow oriental tobacco remains limited. Oriental tobacco is one of the most expensive types of tobacco in cigarette blends. It's the reason why most American-style cigarettes are now a blend of Virginia tobacco and White Burley tobacco.

History The creation of a military museum in the city of Porto dates back to the late 19th century, when a portuense painter, Joaquim Vitorino Ribeiro, started collecting pieces and documents related to military history. This collection was then the base of an exposition inaugurated on August 24, 1920, by President Ant√≥nio Jos√© de Almeida, marking the centenary of the Liberal Revolution of 1820. The exposition resulted in an interest by the City Council in creating a permanent military museum in the city. By 1957 the commandant-in-chief of the Military Region of Northern Portugal, based in Porto city, conducted a study in order to adapt the Castle of S√£o Jo√£o da Foz, at Foz do Douro parish, for a museum. However, the idea was definitively abandoned by 1970, due to the high cost of the adaptation of the building. A new location was identified in 1977, in a building in the Rua do Hero√≠smo, where the delegation of the former secret police PIDE/DGS used to be located between the 1940s up to 1974. In 1977, the Revolutionary Council, created after the Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974, legislated the founding of the Museu Militar do Porto. After the proper adaptation of the building and installation of all the contents, the inauguration took place on 21 March 1980 by the President of the Republic, Ramalho Eanes. Collections The material of the museum has two proveniences: particular offers and obsolete material from the Army, with historical relevance. The collection of miniature figures, displaying the evolution of soldiers since pre-history times till nowadays, is the museum's main attraction. This collection is represented by around 16,000 miniatures, proceeding from the most famous producers of European miniatures, such as Britains, CBG Mignot, Segom, Heyde, Elastolin and Lineol. The museum also holds a room dedicated to the Revolution of January 31, 1891, the first attempt to establish a Republic in Portugal. The museum collection also includes several artillery pieces and combat vehicles, from the 15th to the 20th centuries, located in the Park of Heavy Weapons and the Pavilion of Weapons. In this last space, it can also be observed the evolution of the cutting weapons and some collections of firearms. Moreover, the museum possesses a small thematic library available to the public. Building The building where the Military Museum of Porto is installed, located in the nr. 329 of the Rua do Hero√≠smo, at Bonfim parish, was initially destined to the habitation of D. Maria Coimbra, and was built by the end of the 19th century. It is a characteristic construction of that period. During the Spanish Civil War, it lodged Spanish nuns, and, by 1948, the building was bought by the Portuguese State by 450,000 escudos (equivalent to approx. 2,250 euros) to install the secret police in Porto, the PIDE.

The series ran in 1984, where the character was played by actor Devin Stanfield. Kay is of an unspecified age, and the book follows his adventures one Christmas Holiday alongside his contemporaries who are staying for the holidays. Kay with Cole Hawlings on the UK DVD 'Box of Delights' cover  Kay Harker in The Box of Delights  Kay Harker plays a key role in The Box of Delights, in which he leads the way in the hunt for the infamous Abner Brown. Despite a complete lack of aid from the local police, Kay manages to discover the location of Abner Brown, who seeks to capture the famed Box of Delights. The abduction of Cole Hawlings, owner of the box, marks a turning point in the story, as Kay and friends (namely Maria, Susan, Jemima and Peter Jones) go in search of his abductor with the assistance of Herne the Hunter and various others. Kay eventually manages to thwart the plans of Abner Brown by rescuing Cole Hawlings (and the choirboys) from Brown's subterranean dungeon. The story concludes with great festivities on Christmas Eve as the abducted make their way back home in time for the Christmas Service. The story concludes with Kay's re-awakening on the train home for the start of the Christmas holidays, with the realisation that the story was nothing more than a dream.  Kay Harker and the Jones family children  In the book and the BBC series, these characters play the most important role in the rescue of Cole Hawlings and the downfall of Abner Brown. Peter Jones is arguably Kay's lieutenant, who lends help and company to his friend when it is most needed, notably their dawn expedition onto the downs, where they observe the abduction of Cole Hawlings. Peter is also important in the evasive maneuvres taken to escape Abner and his henchmen, as \\"casts off\\" the miniature boat used by the children in their escape. Maria Jones plays an important part in the reconnaissance work carried out prior to the rescue of Cole Hawlings, as her previous abduction gives Kay an important insight into the minds of Abner Brown and his accomplices. Maria is a hardy young girl, and states in Episode 1 that her idea of fun would be a \\"gunfight\\" with \\"bandits\\", and proclaims that she is a \\"dead shot with both hands\\" when firing her airgun. Sisters Jemima and Susan Jones play a minor role in the series, and feature briefly in Episode 1 and elsewhere as stock family members.

The geometric median of a discrete set of sample points in a Euclidean space is the point minimizing the sum of distances to the sample points. This generalizes the median, which has the property of minimizing the sum of distances for one-dimensional data, and provides a central tendency in higher dimensions. It is also known as the 1-median,The more general k-median problem asks for the location of k cluster centers minimizing the sum of distances from each sample point to its nearest center. spatial median, Euclidean minisum point, or Torricelli point. The geometric median is an important estimator of location in statistics, where it is also known as the L1 estimator. It is also a standard problem in facility location, where it models the problem of locating a facility to minimize the cost of transportation. The special case of the problem for three points in the plane (that is, m = 3 and n = 2 in the definition below) is sometimes also known as Fermat's problem; it arises in the construction of minimal Steiner trees, and was originally posed as a problem by Pierre de Fermat and solved by Evangelista Torricelli. Its solution is now known as the Fermat point of the triangle formed by the three sample points. The geometric median may in turn be generalized to the problem of minimizing the sum of weighted distances, known as the Weber problem after Alfred Weber's discussion of the problem in his 1909 book on facility location. Some sources instead call Weber's problem the Fermat‚ÄìWeber problem, but others use this name for the unweighted geometric median problem. provides a survey of the geometric median problem. See for generalizations of the problem to non-discrete point sets. Definition Formally, for a given set of m points x_1, x_2, \\\\dots, x_m\\\\, with each x_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n, the geometric median is defined as :\\\\underset{y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n}{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,min}} \\\\sum_{i=1}^m \\\\left \\\\ x_i-y \\\\right \\\\_2 Here, arg min means the value of the argument y which minimizes the sum. In this case, it is the point y from where the sum of all Euclidean distances to the x_i's is minimum. Properties * For the 1-dimensional case, the geometric median coincides with the median. This is because the univariate median also minimizes the sum of distances from the points. * The geometric median is unique whenever the points are not collinear. * The geometric median is equivariant for Euclidean similarity transformations, including translation and rotation. This means that one would get the same result either by transforming the geometric median, or by applying the same transformation to the sample data and finding the geometric median of the transformed data. This property follows from the fact that the geometric median is defined only from pairwise distances, and doesn't depend on the system of orthogonal Cartesian coordinates by which the sample data is represented. In contrast, the component-wise median for a multivariate data set is not in general rotation invariant, nor is it independent of the choice of coordinates. * The geometric median has a breakdown point of 0.5. That is, up to half of the sample data may be arbitrarily corrupted, and the median of the samples will still provide a robust estimator for the location of the uncorrupted data. Special cases *For 3 (non-collinear) points, if any angle of the triangle formed by those points is 120¬∞ or more, then the geometric median is the point at the vertex of that angle. If all the angles are less than 120¬∞, the geometric median is the point inside the triangle which subtends an angle of 120¬∞ to each three pairs of triangle vertices. This is also known as the Fermat point of the triangle formed by the three vertices. (If the three points are collinear then the geometric median is the point between the two other points, as is the case with a one-dimensional median.) *For 4 coplanar points, if one of the four points is inside the triangle formed by the other three points, then the geometric median is that point. Otherwise, the four points form a convex quadrilateral and the geometric median is the crossing point of the diagonals of the quadrilateral. The geometric median of four coplanar points is the same as the unique Radon point of the four points., p. 6; . The convex case was originally proven by Giovanni Fagnano. Computation Despite the geometric median's being an easy-to-understand concept, computing it poses a challenge. The centroid or center of mass, defined similarly to the geometric median as minimizing the sum of the squares of the distances to each point, can be found by a simple formula ‚Äî its coordinates are the averages of the coordinates of the points ‚Äî but it has been shown that no explicit formula, nor an exact algorithm involving only arithmetic operations and kth roots, can exist in general for the geometric median. Therefore, only numerical or symbolic approximations to the solution of this problem are possible under this model of computation.; . Earlier, proved that the Steiner point for 5 points in the plane cannot be constructed with ruler and compass However, it is straightforward to calculate an approximation to the geometric median using an iterative procedure in which each step produces a more accurate approximation. Procedures of this type can be derived from the fact that the sum of distances to the sample points is a convex function, since the distance to each sample point is convex and the sum of convex functions remains convex. Therefore, procedures that decrease the sum of distances at each step cannot get trapped in a local optimum. One common approach of this type, called Weiszfeld's algorithm after the work of Endre Weiszfeld,; ; . is a form of iteratively re-weighted least squares. This algorithm defines a set of weights that are inversely proportional to the distances from the current estimate to the sample points, and creates a new estimate that is the weighted average of the sample according to these weights. That is, :\\\\left. y_{i+1}=\\\\left( \\\\sum_{j=1}^m \\\\frac{x_j}{\\\\ x_j - y_i \\\\} \\\\right) \\\\right/ \\\\left( \\\\sum_{j=1}^m \\\\frac{1}{\\\\ x_j - y_i \\\\} \\\\right). This method converges for almost all initial positions, but may fail to converge when one of its estimates falls on one of the given points. It can be modified to handle these cases so that it converges for all initial points. describe more sophisticated geometric optimization procedures for finding approximately optimal solutions to this problem. As show, the problem can also be represented as a semidefinite program. show how to compute the geometric median to arbitrary precision in nearly linear time. Characterization of the geometric median If y is distinct from all the given points, xj, then y is the geometric median if and only if it satisfies: :0 = \\\\sum_{j=1}^m \\\\frac {x_j - y} {\\\\left \\\\ x_j - y \\\\right \\\\}. This is equivalent to: :\\\\left. y = \\\\left( \\\\sum_{j=1}^m \\\\frac{x_j}{\\\\ x_j - y \\\\} \\\\right) \\\\right/ \\\\left( \\\\sum_{j=1}^m \\\\frac{1}{\\\\ x_j - y \\\\} \\\\right), which is closely related to Weiszfeld's algorithm. In general, y is the geometric median if and only if there are vectors uj such that: :0 = \\\\sum_{j=1}^m u_j where for xj ‚â† y, :u_j = \\\\frac {x_j - y} {\\\\left \\\\ x_j - y \\\\right \\\\} and for xj = y, :\\\\ u_j \\\\ \\\\leq 1 . An equivalent formulation of this condition is :\\\\sum _{1\\\\le j\\\\le m, x_j e y} \\\\frac {x_j - y} {\\\\left \\\\ x_j - y \\\\right \\\\} \\\\le \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\,j\\\\mid 1\\\\le j\\\\le m, x_j= y\\\\,\\\\\\\\}\\\\right. It can be seen as a generalization of the median property, in the sense that any partition of the points, in particular as induced by any hyperplane through y, has the same and opposite sum of positive directions from y on each side. In the one dimensional case, the hyperplane is the point y itself, and the sum of directions simplifies to the (directed) counting measure.  Generalizations  The geometric median can be generalized from Euclidean spaces to general Riemannian manifolds (and even metric spaces) using the same idea which is used to define the Fr√©chet mean on a Riemannian manifold. Let M be a Riemannian manifold with corresponding distance function d(\\\\cdot, \\\\cdot), let w_1, \\\\ldots, w_n be n weights summing to 1, and let x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n be n observations from M. Then we define the weighted geometric median m (or weighted Fr√©chet median) of the data points as : m = \\\\underset{x \\\\in M}{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,min}} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i d(x,x_i) . If all the weights are equal, we say simply that m is the geometric median.  See also  * Medoid * Geometric median absolute deviation  Notes  References   *.

In FY2011, Sanderson experienced a 59% growth in passengers, exceeding Thurmond, West Virginia in passenger volume. However, Sanderson still averages fewer than one passenger per day. History The stop was formerly the site of a Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railroad (GH&SA;) depot, later owned by Southern Pacific and Union Pacific. A large prefabricated clapboard wooden depot was assembled at the site in 1882 and expanded in 1910. After Southern Pacific abandoned the depot in 1995, the building began to rapidly deteriorate. An effort to save the depot was made by the Sanderson Depot Association, although the group was unable to secure funding to move the depot. The depot was demolished in October 2012.

It is part of the Drepanosauridae, a group of diapsid reptiles known for their prehensile tails. Only one adult Drepanosaurus specimen and two immature specimens have ever been found and all lacked a head and neck. Drepanosaurus was probably an insectivore, and lived in a coastal environment in what is now modern day Italy, as well as in a streamside environment in the midwestern United States. Description Restoration In general, drepanosaurs can be characterized as having long, gracile necks with a lightly built triangular skull that superficially resembles those of birds. They also have heavy bodies, with fused vertebrae up into a ridge over their shoulders. Their limbs can be described as chameleon-like with grasping hands and feet. Their long tails are tall and narrow with the possibility of containing a tail tip that has been modified into a claw. Drepanosaurus is known to have a huge claw on the index finger of each hand along with the tail claw. The skull of Drepanosaurus has never been found and is still unknown, however, the skulls of other drepanosaurs like Megalancosaurus give us an idea of what the skull of Drepanosaurus might look like. Looking at Megalancosaurus's skull shows that the claws of each index finger were probably the size of the entire head of Drepanosaurus and a bird like jaw and head shape. The forelimb of Drepanosaurus is highly modified compared to other vertebrates and very robust. Its ulna was altered from being a forearm bone into an odd crescent shaped site for muscle attachment. The role played by the ulna in most tetrapods is replaced by an elongated carpal bone. Additional musculature would be attached to the high withers that characterized Drepanosaurus and its close relatives. Drepanosaurus unguicaudatus tail A clue to the purpose of these large muscles can be found on its hand. The animal's \\"index finger\\" bore a large claw reminiscent of those born by dinosaurs such as Noasaurus and Baryonyx. However it is more likely that Drepanosaurus used its claw like the modern pygmy anteater, tearing through bark and insect nests to find invertebrate prey. Some researchers have forwarded the more far-fetched proposal that the claw was used to excavate burrows, but this is not unanimously agreed upon. The dorsal neural spine humps of Drepanosaurus are much taller along all succeeding spines reaching down to the sacrum. Sacral and anterior caudal neural spines are very low if present at all and neural spines are elongated showing expanded dorsal margins after those areas. The scapula was robust with a 70 degree bend. The humerus and radius were short while the ulna was replaced by an ulnare and shifted to the elbow taking a disc-like form. This skeletal configuration change is thought to have been from the large claw on digit II requiring a large muscle in order to operate. The pelvis was large with the pubis forming the majority of the ventral portion. The hind limbs of Drepanosaurus were much larger than the forelimbs with the tibia and fibula being broadly separated. Discovery and classification Discovered in northern Italy in 1979, Drepanosaurus was named by Giovanni Pinna, a Professor in Paleontology and museologist. Drepanosaurus is a rare fossil and the one adult specimen found is incomplete. Another partial specimen of Drepanosaurus was found in New Mexico's Chinle Formation in 2016. Drepanosaurus is part of the clade Drepanosauridae, which is nested in the larger clade Drepanosauromorpha. Drepanosauromorphs are sometimes considered part of the group Protorosauria which may or may not be a natural group (i.e., monophyletic). In any case, it is clear that drepanosaurs are diapsid reptiles. The species name is Drepanosaurus unguicaudatus. Its name is Greek for \\"sickle lizard\\". Paleobiology Vallesaurus, a relative of Drepanosaurus with the skull preservedDrepanosaurus is hypothesized to have been an insectivore, using those large claws on the second digits to lift bark and dig into crevices and grooves on trees to find insects. It is considered that Drepanosaurus was also a digging animal and could use the tail as a tool for unearthing insects. Concerns about whether Drepanosaurus's tail was flexible enough to be used for digging are still brought up today, especially since many characteristics point to Drepanosaurus being primarily a tree- dwelling animal. Paleoecology Being only 45 to 50 cm in length, Drepanosaurus spent its time in trees using its gripping chameleon-like hands and feet to climb from branch to branch as well as its long tail to help wrap around branches. This hypothesized behavioral characteristic brings the notion of \\"monkey-like\\" to Drepanosaurus. The tail also provided extra support along with the claw at the tip to help grip branches. Drepanosaurus would be found in wooded environments and ecosystems in what is now Northern Italy. Relatives have been found in other parts of Italy and New Mexico and New Jersey as well, in similar woodlands. Drepanosaurus is much larger than its relatives, more than double the length of Megalancosaurus. All drepanosaurs are thought to be tree-dwelling insectivores with similar body structures to Drepanosaurus, except for minor differences usually dealing with forelimb configuration and head shape disparities.

Sutton is known for the prosecution of United States Border Patrol agents Jose Compean and Ignacio Ramos. He is currently a partner with the law firm Ashcroft Sutton Reyes, LLC in Austin, Texas. Background and education Sutton grew up in Houston, Texas. He is the grandson of World Series-winning St. Louis Cardinals manager Johnny Keane. Sutton is a fluent speaker of Spanish. Sutton graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a bachelor's degree in International Business in 1983 and then earned a Juris Doctor degree at the University of Texas School of Law in 1987. Longhorns baseball Sutton attended UT on a baseball scholarship and played for the Texas Longhorns, where he was a two-year letterman under coach Cliff Gustafson. His teammates at UT included future Major League pitchers Roger Clemens and Calvin Schiraldi. Sutton spent three years as a backup second baseman, with just 50 at-bats in his career prior to the 1983 playoffs. On a hunch, Gustafson put Sutton in the post-season line-up as a left fielder; Sutton hit .454 in the six-game tournament and was named regional MVP as the Longhorns went on to win the College World Series. The 1983 team finished with a 66-14 record. In various interviews, Gustafson has named Sutton his all-time favorite player. \\"He sparked us to a regional win and continued to spark us through the national championship,\\" Gustafson said in 1994. \\"Clemens and Schiraldi got all the hype, but Sutton was the key to the national championship run.\\" Recently, Kirk Bohls of the Austin American-Statesman, when asked who is most underrated University of Texas athlete ever, responded, \\"I would say A.J. Abrams in hoops, Robert Brewer maybe in football, Johnny Sutton in baseball.\\" Public service=Harris County= From 1988 to 1995 Sutton served as a criminal trial prosecutor in the Harris County District Attorney's Office in Houston, where he tried more than 60 first chair felony jury trials. In 1994, Sutton obtained the death penalty against Raul Villareal in the rape and murder of two teenage girls, Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Pena. Four other death penalty verdicts were rendered in the case. =Bush administration= In 1995, Sutton accepted a position as criminal justice policy director for then- Governor George W. Bush, providing analysis and recommendations for proposed criminal justice laws for Bush to support or veto. Upon Bush's election as president in 2000, Sutton became coordinator for the Bush-Cheney transition team assigned to the Department of Justice where he served as Associate Deputy Attorney General, initially advising on U.S.-Mexico border issues. United States Attorney On October 25, 2001, Bush nominated Sutton for U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas, one of the nation's busiest criminal dockets, known for its high percentage of drug and immigration crimes and covering 68 counties including Austin, San Antonio, El Paso and 660 miles of border. Sutton returned to Austin, where he oversaw a staff of 140 lawyers and a changing mission. Traditionally focused on border-related crimes, the U.S. Attorney's office increasingly focused on fighting terrorism. As U.S. attorney, Sutton prosecuted more than 400 prison gang members, including 19 members of the Texas Syndicate in 2004, and more than 100 public officials, including former Texas Attorney General Dan Morales in 2003 on mail and tax fraud charges. Sutton also supported the buildup of federal resources, from 9,000 to 20,000 border patrol agents, on the Mexico border, and pushed for prosecution of illegal immigrants previously deported, instead of just those who had committed a serious felony. Sutton was appointed vice chair of the Attorney General's Advisory Committee of United States Attorneys on May 27, 2005. On March 28, 2006, Gonzales elevated Sutton to chair of the committee. In this role, Sutton frequently traveled to Washington to advise the Department of Justice on border-related issues and testify before Congress. =Prosecution of Compean and Ramos= Sutton is perhaps best known for his prosecution of former Border Patrol agents Jose Compean and Ignacio Ramos for misconduct following the shooting and wounding of Osvaldo Aldrete-Davila, a narcotics smuggler who had illegally crossed the Mexico border near Fabens, Texas. Compean and Ramos were convicted of assault with serious bodily injury, assault with a deadly weapon, discharge of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence and a civil rights charge, in addition to obstruction of justice charges. In October 2006 they were sentenced to twelve years and eleven years and one day, respectively. Sutton drew criticism from some politicians and anti-illegal-immigration activists, especially on talk radio and the Internet. CNN anchor Lou Dobbs devoted more than one hundred broadcast segments to the case. Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty, asked in 2007 whether Sutton's job was in danger over controversy associated with the case, said \\"No.\\" Sutton told the Texas Monthly, \\"All people have heard is that two American heroes are in prison for doing their job and that a drug dealer has been set free. If those were the facts, I'd be furious too. But the evidence is overwhelming that these guys committed a very serious crime.\\" On January 19, 2009, President Bush commuted the sentences of both Compean and Ramos, effectively ending their prison term on March 20, 2009. =\\"House of Death\\" case= According to The Observer (UK), in August 2003 the U.S. Department of Justice was informed that a paid informant for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had participated in murders carried out by a drug cartel in Juarez, Mexico, operating out of a condo in Juarez where a dozen people were tortured, killed, and buried in the backyard. The informant was, at the time, cooperating in an ongoing cigarette-smuggling investigation. As Sutton was U.S. Attorney for West Texas, this information passed through his office to Deputy Assistant Attorney General John G. Malcolm. The DoJ decided to allow ICE to continue working with the informant rather than act on the information about the murders. Eventually, Mexican police uncovered and raided the house, and exhumed the bodies. This was not the first narco-cemetery to be discovered in Mexico, but due to the number of bodies (and the controversy surrounding ICE knowledge of cartel operations), the event became publicized and known as the \\"House of Death\\" case. Sutton later filed an indictment against a cartel lieutenant, Heriberto Santillan-Tabares, for drug trafficking and five murders, though the murder charges were later cancelled by Sutton in a plea bargain.http://narcosphere.narconews.com/node/624 Sutton was criticized afterward by some observers, including University of Texas-El Paso law professor Bill Weaver, for not taking action to shut down the operation earlier and recommending the DoJ refrain from commenting to the media about the case. On April 19, 2006, Sutton announced a plea bargain arrangement with Santillan including a 25-year jail sentence, with no murder charge or plea included. Furthermore, Sutton was criticized by former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney for approaching journalist Bill Conroy in an alleged attempt to dissuade him from covering the story: McKinney admonished Sutton for \\"an attempt ... to intimidate a journalist who has reported facts that are embarrassing to him\\". =Other casework= In addition to Morales, Sutton's notable cases included prosecution of two San Antonio city council members and two lawyers on charges involved in a bribery scheme related to a city contract, obtaining convictions in 2005. Other widely covered prosecutions included an El Paso counterfeiting ring, a Permian Basin heroin and cocaine operation, the leader of an Austin-based illegal immigrant smuggling organization, and Kickapoo tribal leaders accused of embezzling $900,000 in casino and health-care revenues for personal and political use. On October 8, 2018, the University of Texas at Austin confirmed the university had hired Sutton to investigate claims that Texas State Senator Charles Schwertner sent lewd messages and pictures to a graduate student at the university. The Ashcroft Firm Sutton resigned as the U.S. Attorney effective April 19, 2009. He announced on April 24, 2009 that he had joined The Ashcroft Firm, chaired by former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, to be known in Texas as Ashcroft Sutton Ratcliffe, LLC. Sutton's focus at The Ashcroft Group is corporate representation and compliance, strategic planning and risk management.

This ran until 10 July 1963, and following a few weeks of revivals (Quo Vadis and Gigi) MGM closed the theatre on 3 August. The lease was taken over by the Cinerama Corporation and the theatre was then equipped for screening three-strip Cinerama films becoming London's third Cinerama theatre (the others being the Casino Cinerama and the Coliseum Cinerama). The first presentation was The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm which transferred from the Coliseum on 27 November 1963. A compilation film entitled The Best of Cinerama ran for eleven weeks from 22 March 1964, after which the theatre was converted to 70mm single lens Cinerama to take over the run of It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World from the Coliseum on 16 July.

This ended on 29 June 1966 to be followed by a revival of Mediterranean Holiday until 7 August when Cinerama pulled out and the theatre closed. The lease was picked up by Gala Film Distributors and the Royalty reopened on 1 December with the X-rated Swedish film Night Games. Gala continued with a combination of foreign films and mainstream revivals until 19 December 1969 when the theatre closed as a cinema for the last time and returned to live theatre use. The Royalty Theatre's only successes were a run of the hit Oh! Calcutta! and a hit production of Bubbling Brown Sugar in the late 1970s. It was also the venue for the first and last concerts on what turned out to be the final tour of the English folk-rock singer Sandy Denny with her band in November 1977, and the venue features on the 1998 posthumous release Gold Dust which was produced over 20 years later from the original tapes. Spectacular 'follies' style shows and 'drag' shows didn't find an audience, and the theatre became used as a TV studio for This is Your Life, but was later bought by the London School of Economics and renamed the Peacock Theatre. When Sadler's Wells determined to build its new theatre in 1996, the company moved to the Peacock Theatre. After the new Sadler's Wells Theatre opened in 1998, the Peacock became a dance venue for the company. The Rat Pack played at the theatre in 2002, and Doldrum Bay premi√®red here in 2003. The house is now shared between the London School of Economics (during the day) and Sadler's Wells evening dance productions. The Peacock Theatre is most noted as the home of one of the West End's most unusual ghosts, a dolphin commonly known as 'Flipper'. An urban myth has grown up that, during one of Paul Raymond's revues at the theatre in the 1970s, a dolphin was kept in a tank beneath the stage, where it lived permanently and later died from neglect. In fact, this is not true. Two dolphins called 'Pennie' and 'Pixie' were indeed kept in a tank at the theatre for three months for a show called 'The Royalty Folies', which was later renamed 'The Great International Nude Show'. However, neither of these animals died while at the theatre and at the close of the show the animals were moved to a dolphinarium in the East Asia. The remnants of the tank and its lifting equipment still remain below the stage and numerous visitors to the theatre claim to have heard in the vicinity a spectral squeaking, not unlike a crying baby. One possible explanation is that the London Underground Piccadilly line Aldwych spur used to pass very close to the sub-stage areas of the theatre and it is noise from the tunnels that created the sound.

This collection of factories on the bank of the East River of Pictou has witnessed a large variety of industrial operations, ranging from steel making (the first steel plant in Canada), rolling mills, forging, shipbuilding, munitions manufacturing, rivets and bolts, and most recently (and longest lasting) rail cars. The extensive plant was converted to manufacture wind turbine components for South Korean industrial conglomerate Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering in its first foray into North America; this was made possible through corresponding investments by both the Government of Nova Scotia and the Government of Canada. History=Predecessor companies (1872‚Äì1962)= The Hope Iron Works was founded at Trenton by blacksmiths Graham Fraser and Forrest MacKay in 1872 to produce iron forgings such as anchors for use in wooden sailing ships with the business expanding in 1876 to produce railway car axles. In 1878 the Nova Scotia Forge Company was constructed on a site occupying the east bank of the East River of Pictou in Trenton, replacing the Hope Iron Works. The new plant sought markets in producing forgings for the booming railway industry, creating an intense demand for raw steel and iron. The Nova Scotia Steel Company was established in 1882 on the same site to supply raw material to the Nova Scotia Forge Company and produced the first steel in Canada at its Trenton plant using the Siemens process in an open-hearth furnace in 1883. Both companies soon merged to form the Nova Scotia Steel and Forge Company. Initially the steel mill at Trenton was fed by scrap metal and pig iron imported from Scotland however shortages in scrap saw the New Glasgow Iron, Coal and Railway Company construct an oxygen blast furnace at Ferrona in the upper reaches of the East River valley that would be supplied with iron ore mined at Eureka and Londonderry. Coke was supplied by local coal mines in Stellarton, Westville and Thorburn. These sources of iron ore were soon found to be high in manganese, thus higher quality iron ore was soon discovered at Wabana on Bell Island, Newfoundland which was then shipped to the Ferrona blast furnaces. In 1895, the New Glasgow Iron, Coal and Railway Company purchased rights to some of the Wabana ore deposit for a long-term supply. That year also saw the New Glasgow Iron, Coal and Railway Company merge with the Nova Scotia Steel and Forge Company to form the Nova Scotia Steel Company, revamping a name used in the previous decade. To maintain production, the company found that coal from the Pictou Coal Field was of poor quality for making coking fuel, thus it purchased the remaining assets of the General Mining Association which were concentrated on the north side of Sydney Harbour on Cape Breton Island ‚Äì these being mines in the Sydney Mines, Florence and Alder Point areas of northeastern Cape Breton County. With iron ore being shipped from Newfoundland and coal now being sourced in Cape Breton Island, the company was faced with high transportation costs, thus it was decided to construct a new integrated steel mill at Sydney Mines which opened in 1899. The steel mill and coal mines in Cape Breton, along with the iron ore mine in Newfoundland and the steel mill and forge in Trenton and the blast furnaces in Ferrona were all merged into a new entity in 1900 called the Nova Scotia Steel and Coal Company, which used the acronym SCOTIA. SCOTIA immediately sought economies of scale and reductions in unprofitable parts of the company. In 1904 the Ferrona blast furnaces were closed and the last steel poured. By the end of the decade, the last railway boom in Canada was underway with the simultaneous transcontinental railway expansions of the Canadian Northern Railway, Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and the National Transcontinental Railway. SCOTIA made significant investments in its properties over a 3-year period, beginning with the Trenton steel mill which saw 2 rolling mills added to the plant in 1910. This was followed in 1911 when the Trenton plant saw a massive investment in equipment to manufacture and machine heavy forgings. In 1912 SCOTIA established the Eastern Car Company and opened a massive factory to build railway cars on the Trenton site adjacent to the steel mill and forge operations, reputedly the largest factory under one roof in the Dominion of Canada. The Eastern Car Company produced its first boxcar for the Grand Trunk Railway in August 1913, with GTR #105000 being the first of a 2,000 car order. SCOTIA also established the Dominion Wheel Foundry in 1913 on an adjacent site to Eastern Car Company and the steel mill and forge operation. Dominion Wheel Foundry created cast iron railway wheels in support of its sister operation at the Eastern Car Company. Finally, 1913 also saw SCOTIA establish a bolt and rivet factory to the entire complex. The arrival of World War I saw railway investment cease in Canada and those industries spiralled toward bankruptcy which resulted in the federal government nationalizing several insolvent companies to which it had lent financial support, resulting in the creation of the Canadian National Railways in 1918. Although a large part of SCOTIA's customer base was lost, the war had other opportunities and SCOTIA established a shipyard on part of its Trenton property fronting the East River of Pictou, constructing 6 steam-powered cargo ships as part of the war effort, totalling 10,395 tons. The factories were re-tooled and soon began producing artillery and naval shells. With the war entering a stalemate as the Central Powers were increasingly contained by the Allies in a brutal trench warfare on the Western Front, demand for steel began to decrease. SCOTIA was taken over by new investors from the United States in 1917 and the steel mill in Sydney Mines was closed and iron ore production in Newfoundland was transferred to its rival Dominion Steel Corporation of Sydney. SCOTIA was reduced to operating its coal mines in Cape Breton Island and Pictou County, along with its extensive steel and manufacturing operations in Trenton. The fall-out from World War I and the collapse of new railway construction in Canada saw a syndicate of British investors led by Montreal, Quebec industrialist Roy M. Wolvin negotiate a takeover of SCOTIA's rival Dominion Steel Corporation in 1919. These investors proposed a $500 million merger of Dominion Steel Corporation, along with various British steel and shipbuilding interests. The plan came to fruition in 1921 when SCOTIA was merged with Dominion Steel Corporation to form part of the conglomerate known as the British Empire Steel Corporation (BESCO). BESCO faced tremendous financial and organized labour problems through the 1920s as industrial and consumer markets changed. By 1928 the company had dissolved and its assets were transferred to a new holding company named the Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (DOSCO). DOSCO management and marketing practices halted the decline under BESCO and the company was stabilized. DOSCO's manufacturing complex at Trenton continued much as before, producing railway cars and wheels, as well as various steel products; the complex was consolidated under the name Trenton Industries Ltd. at some point. During World War II, management of the complex was taken over by the federal government for producing naval gun mounts as well as artillery and naval shells, just as it had done during World War I. Following the war, DOSCO closed the steel rolling mills and bolt and rivet factory at Trenton, focusing its steel production at the much larger plant at Sydney. Declines in the coal and steel industries during the 1950s saw the DOSCO conglomerate, once the largest private employer in the country, lose much of its previous financial clout. DOSCO was purchased in 1957 by A.V. Roe Canada Co. Ltd. and made a subsidiary. =Hawker Siddeley ownership (1962‚Äì1988)= The Dominion Wheel Foundry was closed in 1961 and A.V. Roe was subsequently folded into Hawker Siddeley Canada in 1962 and the Trenton railcar plant and forge were paired with other Hawker Siddeley railcar plants acquired through its subsidiary Canada Car and Foundry in Hamilton and Thunder Bay, Ontario. Hawker Siddeley sought to reduce losses at its DOSCO subsidiary acquired through the takeover of A.V. Roe. By the mid-1960s, it identified the coal mines and steel mill on Cape Breton Island for closure; these operations were nationalized by the federal and provincial governments under the Cape Breton Development Corporation (DEVCO) and Sydney Steel Corporation (SYSCO) respectively in 1968. Hawker Siddeley shares in what was left of DOSCO were purchased that year by Sidbec, a provincial Crown corporation in Quebec, which sought to nationalize DOSCO operations in that province. A new holding company named Hawker Industries Ltd. was then formed to acquire certain DOSCO operating units from Sidbec that were not located in Quebec, one of which was the Trenton railcar plant and forge operation. Hawker Industries Ltd. was merged into Hawker Siddeley Canada in 1979. =Lavalin ownership (1988‚Äì1992)= In 1987 Hawker Siddeley Canada sought to consolidate its railcar manufacturing business, selling its Thunder Bay plant to Bombardier and offering its Hamilton and Trenton plants for sale or closure. On April 1, 1988 the Trenton railcar plant and forge operation were sold to Lavalin Industries, a subsidiary of Lavalin Group from Montreal, Quebec which organized the plant and forge under the name Trenton Works Lavalin Inc.; Trenton Works Lavalin Inc. being grouped with other Lavalin Group factories in Ontario under the name UTDC Inc. =Government of Nova Scotia ownership (1992‚Äì1995)= The demise of Lavalin Group/Groupe in December 1991 saw Trenton Works Lavalin Inc. and other operating units facing an uncertain future. Faced with the politically unpalatable option of one of the largest employers in Pictou County being closed, local MLA and Premier of Nova Scotia Donald Cameron opted to have the provincial government purchase the plant and operate it as an independent railcar manufacturer from January 1992 until February 1995 under the name Trenton Works Inc. while the government sought a new owner. =Greenbrier ownership (1995‚Äì2007)= The new administration of Premier John Savage sought to improve the province's fiscal management and reduce liabilities such as Trenton Works and SYSCO, among others. A buyer was found in early 1995 and a joint partnership of Canadian and American business interests purchased the plant on March 9, 1995 with the majority interest being held by Greenbrier Corporation of Lake Oswego, Oregon. The plant was renamed TrentonWorks Ltd. and is a member of The Greenbrier Companies. Under Greenbrier's ownership, the Trenton railcar plant and forge were operated much as before, however railcar manufacturing at Trenton increased dramatically during the late 1990s and early 2000s as the North American freight car fleet underwent significant expansion and replacement; Canada's record low exchange rates made Trenton a very profitable and low-cost production facility for Greenbrier during this time. Canada's rising exchange rate and decreasing demand for new railcars by the mid-2000s saw Greenbrier consolidate its operations. The TrentonWorks Forge (a separate operation from the railcar plant) was sold to Forged Metal Products Inc. of Houston, Texas in 2004, which renamed the operation to Nova Forge Corporation. The forge has ceased to operate and an auction of equipment was held in June 2014. To date the property has produced more than 63,500 freight cars since it opened in 1913. The plant occupies 69,000 m2 (17 acres) of heated floor space under one roof; the main building consisting of four bays, each wide and 1,100‚Äì1,300 feet long. The plant property occupies 650,000 m2 (160 acres) of land. There are of railway track in the facility which is served by its own railway locomotives (several GE 45 ton industrial switchers); the plant interchanges with the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway in Trenton. TrentonWorks has produced virtually every type of railway freight car imaginable, ranging from box cars to reefers, flat cars, tank cars, to modern-day high-capacity covered hoppers, auto racks, centre- partition flat cars for lumber, as well as deep well intermodal cars. Peak production output is approximately 50 cars per week. The TrentonWorks plant is currently operating below capacity due to decreased demand for new railcars with currently employment levels at 200 workers, however peak employment has ranged beyond 1,100 workers in recent years. Greenbrier had previously purchased two railcar manufacturing plants in Mexico, which had substantially lower operating costs in terms of taxation and employee salaries and benefits. Rumours about the long-term viability of TrentonWorks began to circulate in late 2006 and early 2007 as the union began discussing the possibility of strike action to drain the union local's strike pay accounts, in advance of a possible long-term layoff or permanent closure. The union instead offered generous concessions which were followed on April 3, 2007 by a generous offer of financial assistance from the provincial and federal governments, which would subsidize the cost per railcar at Greenbrier's TrentonWorks plant. All offers of assistance from the union and governments were rejected by Greenbrier on April 4, 2007 when the company announced that its TrentonWorks plant would close permanently later in the year once current orders are completed.Nova Scotia News ‚Äì TheChronicleHerald.ca The last shift ended at TrentonWorks Ltd. at 1600h ADT on May 4, 2007, one month following the closure announcement. =DSME ownership (2010 ‚Äì present)= Following the closure of Greenbrier's railcar manufacturing operation at the facility in 2007, the provincial and federal governments began looking for a buyer to return industrial activity to the site. On March 5, 2010 the provincial government announced an agreement had been reached with Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) to reopen the plant and re-tool it to manufacture components for wind turbines. This is reportedly the first foray into North America by DSME and it is contingent upon a $20 million investment by the company, as well as a $60 million investment by the provincial government and a $10 million investment by the federal government. In addition to global export potential of wind turbine components, there is a strong local demand growing for these products; Nova Scotia Power has been recently mandated by the Government of Nova Scotia to increase its green energy sources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and is predicted to be a major customer of the DSME wind turbines produced at TrentonWorks.N.S. announces wind turbine plant The venture operated at the site using the logo DSTN and manufacturing towers for wind turbines, subsea structures for tidal power facilities, and pressure vessels for the oil and gas sector. The company was put in receivership in the spring of 2016, owing the Nova Scotia government $56 Million. the receivers were still looking for a buyer, with the commitment of $150,000 per month from the government to maintain the property expiring at the end of the fiscal year.

It is known for the Eisstadion Inzell, an outdoor artificial ice rink that has been used for many international speed skating championships. It is now an indoor oval. Geography Inzell lies in a wide valley floor in the Chiemgau Alps, framed by the mountains of Rauschberg, Zinnkopf, Teisenberg and the massif of Staufen. In the municipality, the confluence of the Gro√üwaldbach and Falkenseebach rivers forms the Rote Traun river. Inzell is also known as the gateway to Berchtesgaden National Park due to the Zwing, a mountain passage between Inzell and Wei√übach, which separates the Chiemgau from Berchtesgaden. History The independent municipality of Inzell was created in 1818 as a result of administrative reform in Bavaria. The mining and smelting of ores was an important source of income in the village, as can still be seen in the coat of arms (above right). Transport From Inzell runs the Federal Highway 306 and as part of the German Alpine Road, the Federal Highway 305. The nearest motorway is Federal Highway 8 near Siegsdorf. Economy and infrastructure In 2009 there were, according to official statistics, 872 social insurance employed persons, including 268 in the manufacturing sector, 308 in trade and transport, and 296 in other economic sectors (agriculture and services). In the manufacturing sector, there were 13 construction companies. In addition, in 2007 there were 71 farms with an agricultural area of at least . =Sports= The new indoor speed skating arena, Eisstadion Inzell Inzell's former outdoor ice rink () In the winter of 1959/1960 an ice- and speed- skating competition was held on the Frillensee lake in Inzell. From 1963 to 1965 the Ludwig Schwabl Stadium was built.In 1974, the world skating championships were held in Inzell, won by Norwegian Sten Stensen. In 1986 and 1996, the world skating championships were again held in Inzell. In May 2009, after a long debate with the German Speed Skating Association, the Bavarian government and the municipality of Inzell, it was decided to build a roof over the ice rink. The work was started in 2009 and completed in 2010. The covering was important to continue accommodating large skating events, such as the ISU Speed Skating World Cup in March 2011 and other national and international competitions. After the roof was finished, the Ludwig Schwabl Stadion was renamed the Max Aicher Arena.

Parry, Science & Society, vol. 12 no. 4 (Fall 1948), pp.418-444] It defines a situation in which the existence or identity of a thing (or situation) depends on the co-existence of at least two conditions which are opposite to each other, yet dependent on each other and presupposing each other, within a field of tension. Ancient philosophy First suggested by Heraclitus (c. 535 ‚Äì c. 475 BC), a pre- Socratic Greek thinker, philosophers had for some time been contemplating the notion of opposites. Anaximander posited that every element was an opposite, or connected to an opposite (water is cold, fire is hot). Thus, the material world was composed by some indefinite, boundless apeiron from which arose the elements (earth, air, fire, water) and pairs of opposites (hot/cold, wet/dry). There was, according to Anaximander, a continual war of opposites. Anaximenes of Miletus, a student and successor of Anaximander, replaced this indefinite, boundless arche with air, a known element with neutral properties. According to Anaximenes, there was not so much a war of opposites, as a continuum of change. Heraclitus, however, did not accept the milesian monism and replaced their underlying material arche with a single, divine law of the universe, which he called Logos. The universe of Heraclitus is in constant change, but also remaining the same. That is to say, an object moves from point A to point B, thus creating a change, but the underlying law remains the same. Thus, a unity of opposites is present in the universe as difference and sameness. This is a rather broad example though. For a more detailed example we may turn to an aphorism of Heraclitus: > The road up and the road down are the same thing. (Hippolytus, Refutations > 9.10.3) This is an example of a compresent unity of opposites. For, at the same time, this slanted road has the opposite qualities of ascent and descent. According to Heraclitus, everything is in constant flux, and every changing object co- instantiates at least one pair of opposites (though not necessarily simultaneously) and every pair of opposites is co-instantiated in at least one object. Heraclitus also uses the succession of opposites as a base for change: > Cold things grow hot, a hot thing cold, a moist thing withers, a parched > thing is wetted. (DK B126) As a single object persists through opposite properties, this object undergoes change. Modern philosophy Dialecticians claim that unity or identity of opposites can exist in reality or in thought. If the opposites were completely balanced, the result would be stasis, but often it is implied that one of the pairs of opposites is larger, stronger or more powerful than the other, such that over time, one of the opposed conditions prevails over the other. Yet rather than 'stasis' the identity of opposites, there being unity within their duality, is taken to be the instance of their very manifestation, the unity between them being the essential principle of making any particular opposite in question extant as either opposing force. For example 'upward' cannot exist unless there is a 'downward', they are opposites but they co-substantiate one another, their unity is that either one exists because the opposite is necessary for the existence of the other, one manifests immediately with the other. Hot would not be hot without cold, due to there being no contrast by which to define it as 'hot' relative to any other condition, it would not and could not have identity whatsoever if not for its very opposite that makes the necessary prerequisite existence for the opposing condition to be. This is the oneness, unity, principle to the very existence of any opposite. Either one's identity is the contra-posing principle itself, necessitating the other. The criteria for what is opposite is therefore something a priori. In his criticism of Immanuel Kant, the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel tried to systematise dialectical understandings and thus wrote: In his philosophy, Hegel ventured to describe quite a few cases of \\"unity of opposites\\", including the concepts of Finite and Infinite, Force and Matter, Identity and Difference, Positive and Negative, Form and Content, Chance and Necessity, Cause and effect, Freedom and Necessity, Subjectivity and Objectivity, Means and Ends, Subject and Object, and Abstract and Concrete. It is also considered to be integral to Marxist philosophy of nature and is discussed in Friedrich Engels' Dialectics of Nature. Coincidentia oppositorum Coincidentia oppositorum is a Latin phrase meaning coincidence of opposites. It is a neoplatonic term attributed to 15th century German polymath Nicholas of Cusa in his essay, De Docta Ignorantia (1440). Mircea Eliade, a 20th-century historian of religion, used the term extensively in his essays about myth and ritual, describing the coincidentia oppositorum as \\"the mythical pattern\\". Psychiatrist Carl Jung, the philosopher and Islamic Studies professor Henry Corbin as well as Jewish philosophers Gershom Scholem and Abraham Joshua Heschel also used the term. In alchemy, coincidentia oppositorum is a synonym for coniunctio. For example, Michael Maier stresses that the union of opposites is the aim of the alchemical work. Or, according to Paracelsus' pupil, Gerhard Dorn, the highest grade of the alchemical coniunctio consisted in the union of the total man with the unus mundus (\\"one world\\"). The term is also used in describing a revelation of the oneness of things previously believed to be different. Such insight into the unity of things is a kind of immanence, and is found in various non-dualist and dualist traditions. The idea occurs in the traditions of Tantric Hinduism and Buddhism, in German mysticism, Taoism, Zen and Sufism, among others.

They were associated with punk rock, yet straddled the musical territory in between punk, power pop and hard rock, with noticeable influences from psychedelia. The Only Ones reformed in 2007 after their biggest hit \\"Another Girl, Another Planet\\" experienced a resurgence of public interest. The band completed a comeback UK tour in June 2007, and continued touring throughout 2008 and 2009. New material was recorded in 2009 and played live, but was never released. History The Only Ones were originally formed in August 1976 in South London by Peter Perrett. Perrett had been recording demos since 1972, and in late 1975 he was looking for a bass player. He was introduced to John Perry as a possible candidate, but Perry wanted to concentrate on playing guitar instead. By August 1976, Perry and Perrett had found drummer Mike Kellie (ex-Spooky Tooth) and bass guitarist Alan Mair, who previously had huge success with the Scottish band The Beatstalkers. Their first single, \\"Lovers of Today\\", self-released on the Vengeance record label, was immediately made \\"record of the week\\" by three of the four main music papers. A year later they signed to CBS. Their next single \\"Another Girl, Another Planet\\" became a popular and influential song, and remains the band's best-known song. It is often featured on various musical box-sets featuring a punk rock or new wave theme. After its inclusion on the 1991 compilation album The Sound of the Suburbs, it was re-released as a single and reached no. 57 in the UK singles chart. The band released their debut studio album The Only Ones in 1978, which was well received by both reviewers and fans. The band's follow-up album, Even Serpents Shine, was released the following year. A year later, they released their final studio album, Baby's Got a Gun. In the summer of 1980, they supported the Who on their tour of the United States, and in 1982 the band officially disbanded. In subsequent years, the Only Ones retained a following and their posthumously released records ‚Äì live performances, BBC Television and radio shows, and compilation albums ‚Äì now outnumber their studio albums. Unusually, The Only Ones' discs were never deleted from the CBS catalogue and remain in-print. Reunions In an interview published in the 10 November 2006 issue of the tabloid newspaper, The Daily Record, Alan Mair commented that he was set to reform The Only Ones after \\"Another Girl, Another Planet\\" was used in a Vodafone ad campaign in 2006, and picked up as the introduction theme to Irish DJ Dave Fanning's radio show. On 21 February 2007, Perry confirmed via his MySpace page that the band would reform for a five-date UK tour in June. Besides these dates, they played a number of festivals, debuting at All Tomorrow's Parties festival in Minehead, England, on 27 April. During the summer, they also played at the two-part Wireless Festival in Hyde Park, London, Harewood House, (near Leeds), and the Connect Music Festival at Inveraray Castle in Scotland on 1 September. News of the tour prompted coverage in several UK national newspapers and the dates were met with positive reviews. During these gigs, the band played a new song called \\"Dreamt She Could Fly\\". The press also reported that three of the band were keen to record a new studio album following the tour, but that Perrett seemed hesitant. In April 2008, the band were seen on Later... with Jools Holland performing their song, \\"Another Girl, Another Planet\\", and a new song entitled \\"Black Operations\\". The band also played other new songs including \\"Is This How Much You Care\\" and \\"Magic Tablet\\" live on a Canal+ TV special in Paris and an acoustic/unplugged session for Radio 6 Queens of Noize. A live DVD of the Shepherds Bush Empire show was released in March 2008. Other rumoured releases included DVDs from a show on the band's last US tour, and a re-release of Faster Than Lightning, which was released on VHS in 1991 and on DVD in 2012. All three CBS studio albums, remastered by Alan Mair, were re-released with bonus tracks in February 2009. \\"Another Girl, Another Planet\\" was used in the film D.E.B.S. (2004), as well as in the 2010 hit film Paul. Sony BMG announced a January 2012 release date for an Only Ones box set in the \\"Original Album Classics\\" series. The set comprised the three remastered studio albums, plus various B-sides and out-takes. The Only Ones topped the bill at the 2012 Rebellion Festival in Blackpool on 4 August of that year. In late 2014, the Only Ones (minus Mike Kellie) played some gigs in Tokyo, co-headlining with the Flamin' Groovies. In August 2014, Perrett began playing solo shows (Felipop festival, Spain) using his sons' band Strangefruit, followed by more dates in 2015 (Hebden Bridge, Bristol, London etc.) with the same formation. The band ceased activity after the death of drummer Mike Kellie, but Perrett, Mair and Perry reunited to play a three-song set in summer 2019 Influence The band members' musical proficiency distinguished them from most of their peers. Their dominant drug-related lyrical themes on songs such as \\"Another Girl, Another Planet,\\" and \\"The Big Sleep,\\" also fit in with the Zeitgeist of the era on both sides of the Atlantic. Perrett and Kellie caught the eye of Johnny Thunders, founding member of the New York Dolls and the Heartbreakers, and worked as sidemen on Thunders' solo debut album, So Alone, notably appearing together on the classic \\"You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory\\". However, drug addiction, particularly heroin use, derailed their career, and singer/guitarist/songwriter Perrett has only sporadically been heard from since the band split in 1982. He briefly resurfaced in the mid 1990s with the album, Woke Up Sticky, and released his debut solo album, How The West Was Won in 2017. Lead guitarist Perry went on to play as a session guitarist for artists including The Sisters of Mercy, Evan Dando and Marianne Faithfull. More recently, he has written several well received music biographies on the Who's seminal hits compilation Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy, the Rolling Stones' double album Exile on Main Street and in 2004, Jimi Hendrix's Electric Ladyland. During 2005‚Äì2006, he played and recorded with singer-songwriter Freddie Stevenson. The Only Ones have been influential on the indie rock and alternative rock scenes ever since their initial success, on bands such as The Replacements, Blur, Nirvana, and more recently The Libertines. Several bands have covered their song \\"Another Girl, Another Planet\\", including The Libertines (at London Forum with Perrett guesting), The Replacements and Blink 182. Their song \\"The Whole of the Law\\" was covered by Yo La Tengo on their album, Painful.

Water Supply Paper 494. In the absence of irregular, prolonged, or extreme drought, a perennial stream is a watercourse, or segment, element, or emerging body of water which continually delivers groundwater. For example, an artificial disruption of stream, variability in flow or stream selection associated with the activity in hydropower installations, shall not affect the measurement. Perennial streams do not consist of stagnant water for the wetlands, reservoirs, and ponds that occur all the period. All other streams, or portions thereof, should be considered seasonal rivers or lakes. The stream can cycle from broken to perpetual through multiple iterations, to intermittent through its mechanism. Definition of Perennial Stream  Stream = Definition = Kings River Falls at low flow in Madison County of northern Arkansas The basic concept means flowing bodies of water. In hydrology, the stream usually refers to water flowing through natural passages separated from canals. The flow is the main component of the drainage of surface water through the bed of the river and the bank of the river. The flows are regulated by three aspects: surface water, subsurface flow, and groundwater. During the rainy seasons, surface and subsurface water differ greatly. Groundwater is reasonably stable and regulated by trends of long-term precipitation. The patterns include surface, subsurface, and groundwater. And these factors flow into geological, geomorphological, hydrological, and biological controls. = Classification = The following can be listed as streams in natural channels : According to the time: * Perennial: The one which flows continuously. * Intermittent or seasonal: it occurs only in a certain time of the year when it receives ample water from springs or other ground source in mountainous areas, such as mountain snow melting. * Ephemeral: One that only flows in direct reaction to rainfall, and whose channel is always above the water table. According to space: * Continuous: One which has no spatial interruptions. * Interrupted: The one with alternative arrivals. They are sporadic, permanent, or low. According to the water underneath: * Gaining: A stream or path to receive water from groundwater. * Losing: A stream or reach of a stream which shows a net loss of water to groundwater or evaporation. * Isolated: The water flow or channel shall not supply or remove water from the saturated region. * Perched: refers to the loss or isolation flow separated from the groundwater in the air zone.Classification = Importance = Streams, headwaters, and streams flowing only part of the year provide many benefits upstream and downstream. They defend against floods, remove contaminants, recycle nutrients that are potentially dangerous as well as provide food and habitat for many forms of fish. Such streams also play a vital role in preserving our drinking water quality and supply, ensuring a steady flow of water to surface waters and helping to restore deep aquifers. :1.Clean drinking water :2.Flood and erosion protection :3.Groundwater recharge :4.Pollution reduction :5.Wildlife habitat :6.Economic importance in fishing, hunting, manufacting and agriculture.  Etymology  The word \\"perennial\\" from the 1640s, meaning \\"evergreen,\\" is established in Latin perennis, keeping the meaning as \\"everlasting all year round,\\" per \\"over\\" plus annus \\"year.\\" This has been proved since the 1670s by the \\"living years\\" in the sense of botany. The metaphorical sense of \\"enduring, eternal\\" originates from 1750. They are related to \\"perennial.\\" See biennial for shifts in vowels.  Difference between perennial stream and intermittent stream = Characteristics = Perennial streams have one or more of these characteristics: # Direct observation or compelling evidence suggests that there is no interruption in the flow at ground. # The existence of one or more specific features of the perennial streams, including: #* Riverbed forms, for example, riffles, pools, runs, gravel bars, other depositional characteristics, bed armor layer. #* Riverbank erosion and/or polishment. #* Indications of waterborne debris and sediment transport. #* Defined river or stream bed and banks. # The catchment area exceeds . # USGS regression on the VHD data layer-oriented application on the probability of intermittent flow. # The existence of aquatic organisms that require uninterrupted circulation. # As shown by bank leakage, spring, or other indicators, grass-roots flow mainly supports groundwater recharge. # There are high channels of permeability, especially stratospheric, boundary conditions; while stratospheric groundwater also decreases on occasion. # Existence of native aquatic organisms which require undisturbed survival flow. # The surrounding topography exhibits features of being formed by fluvial processes. Absence of such characteristics supports classifying a stream as intermittent, \\"showing interruptions in time or space\\". Characteristic of perennial stream  Sources The streams typically derive most of their water from rain and snow precipitation. Most of this water re-enters the atmosphere either by evaporating from soil and water bodies, or by plant evapotranspiration. By infiltration some of the water sinks into the earth and becomes groundwater, much of which eventually enters streams. Most precipitated water is partially bottled up by evaporation or freezing in snow fields and glaciers. The majority of the water flows as a runoff off the ground, the proportion of which varies depending on several factors, such as climate, temperature, vegetation, types of rock, and relief. This runoff begins as a thin layer called sheet wash, combined with a network of tiny rills, which together form the sheet runoff; when this water is focused in a channel, a stream is born. Some rivers and streams may begin from lakes or ponds. Freshwater's primary sources are precipitation, and mountain snowmelt. However, rivers typically originate in the highlands, and are slowly created by the erosion of mountain snowmelt into lakes or rivers. Rivers usually flow from their source topographically, and erode as they pass until they reach the base stage of erosion. The scientists have offered a way based on data to define the origin of the lake. A classified sample was the one measured by the Chinese researchers from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. As an essential symbol of the river formation environment, the river source needs an objective and straightforward and effective method of judging. A calculation model of river source catchment area based on critical support flow (CSD) proposed, and the relationship between CSA and CSD with a minimum catchment area established. Using the model for comparison in two basins in Tibet (Helongqu and Niyang River White Water) in Tibet, the results show that the critical support flow (Qc) of the is 0.002 8 m3/s. At the same time, the white water curvature is 0.008 5 m3/s. Besides, the critical support flow can vary with hydrologic climate conditions, and the vital support flow Qc in wet areas (white water) is larger than in semi-arid regions (heap slot). The proposed critical support flow (CSD) concept and model method can be used to determine the hydrographic indicators of river sources in complex geographical areas, and it can also reflect the impact of hydrologic climate change on river recharge in different regions. The river's source is the river's point of origin. It can consist of lakes, swamps, springs, or glaciers. It is here that the stream starts. A typical river consists of several tributaries, and each arm may be made up of several other smaller tributaries, so that together this stream and all its tributaries are called a drainage network. Although the current and each branch has its source, international practice is to take the source farthest from the end as the source of the entire river system, from which the most extended length of the river measured as the starting point is taken as the length of the whole river system. Generally speaking, the source of a river system will be at the beginning of the current or its upper reaches, where the river length is synonymous with the size of the river system unless otherwise specified. For example, the origin of the Nile River is the confluence of the White Nile and the Blue Nile, and the source of the whole river system is in its upper reaches. If there is no specific designation, \\"Nile length\\" refers to \\"river length of the Nile system,\\" rather than to the length of the Nile river.The Nile's source is often known as Lake Victoria, but the lake has significant feeder rivers. The Kagera River, which flows into Lake Victoria near Bukoba's Tanzanian town, is the longest feeder, though sources do not cooperate on which is the Kagera 's longest tributary and therefore the Nile's most remote source itself.  Benthic macroinvertebrates  \\"Macroinvertebrate\\" refers to easily seen invertebrates, larger than 0.5 mm, found in stream and river bottoms. Macroinvertebrates are larval stages of most aquatic insects and their presence is a good indicator the stream is perennial. Larvae of caddisflies, mayflies, stoneflies, and damselflies require a continuous aquatic habitat until they reach maturity. Crayfish and other crustaceans, snails, bivalves (clams), and aquatic worms also indicate the stream is perennial. These require a persistent aquatic environment for survival.  Vertebrates  Fish and amphibians are secondary indicators when it comes to assessing for a perennial stream because some fish and amphibians can inhabit areas without persistent water regime. When assessing for fish, all available habitat should be assessed; from pools, riffles, root clumps and other obstructions. Fish will seek cover if alerted to human presence but should be easily observed in perennial streams. Amphibians also indicate a perennial stream and range from tadpoles, frogs, salamanders, and newts. These amphibians can be found in stream channels, along streambanks, and even under rocks. Frogs and tadpoles usually inhabit shallow and slow moving waters near the sides of stream banks. Frogs will typically jump into water when alerted to human presence.  Geological indicators  Well defined river beds composed of riffles, pools, runs, gravel bars, a bed armor layer, and other depositional features, plus well defined banks due to bank erosion are good identifiers when assessing for perennial streams. Particle size will help identify a perennial stream. Perennial streams cut through the soil profile which removes fine and small particles. By assessing areas for relatively coarse material left behind in the stream bed and finer sediments along the side of the stream or within the floodplain will be a good indicator of persistent water regime.  Hydrological indicators  A perennial stream can be identified 48 hours after a storm. Direct storm runoff usually has ceased at this point. If a stream is still flowing and contributing inflow is not observed above the channel, the observed water is likely baseflow. Another perennial stream indication is an abundance of red rust material in a slow-moving wetted channel or stagnant area. This is evidence that iron-oxidizing bacteria are present, indicating persistent expression of oxygen-depleted ground water. In a forested area, leaf and needle litter in the stream channel is an additional indicator. Accumulation of leaf litter does not occur in perennial streams since such material is continuously flushed. In the adjacent overbank of a perennial stream, fine sediment may cling to riparian plant stems and tree trunks. Organic debris drift lines or piles may be found within the active overbank area after recent high flow.

See) is a municipality in the district of Traunstein in Bavaria, Germany. The town, classified as a climatic spa, is located at the Waginger See, the warmest lake in Upper Bavaria, with temperatures up to 27 ¬∞C. The lake promenade Geography Waging is located west of the Waginger See. The name \\"am See\\" (\\"on the lake\\") is somewhat misleading: due to the lowering of the Tiroler Achen river, which originates from the southern end of the lake near the town of Petting, the water level declined about in 1867, which led to Waging being located away from the waterside. History Waging am See was already mentioned in a deed in 740. Due to the so-called lower saline road, which led from Reichenhall to Wasserburg am Inn through Waging, the village was a prosperous place already in medieval ages. Back then Waging belonged to the Salzburg prince-bishopric. In the 14th century it was granted the right to hold markets. In 1685, Waging became the domicile of a Salzburgian court of law, became Austrian in 1805 for a short time, and belongs to Bavaria since 1810. Since then, Waging developed into a prominent leisure and vacation spot. After 1945, many expellees settled in Waging. After the German local government reform in 1972, Waging became part of the Traunstein district. The localities Gaden, Otting, Freimann, and Tettenhausen were suburbanized. The election of Sepp Daxenberger as mayor in 1996 caused a stir, since he was the first mayor of the Green party in Bavaria. Politics After the local elections in 2008, the new mayor is Herbert H√§usl of the Free Voters party; he was elected with 62.4 per cent of the votes. Currently, the municipal council consists of the following parties: * Free Voters - 8 seats * Alliance '90/The Greens - 5 seats * CSU - 5 seats * √ñdp - 2 seats Places of interest * Bajuwarenmuseum (museum about ancient Bavarians) Sports and Leisure The Waginger See, which is in length and 1.1 in breadth, boasts several camping areas such as the Strandcamp (\\"Beach Camp\\"), the Schwanenplatz (\\"Swan Spot\\") and Camping Gut Horn. In the surroundings are several opportunities for many kinds of leisure activities: hiking, alp and mountain tours, fishing, boating, golf, winter sports, mini golf, sailing and surfing, rowing, skating, traditional natural gymnastics, facilities for hydropathic treatment, tennis hall and court, beach volleyball, and soccer.

It is the seat of the Fuggers, a merchant family from Augsburg which played an important role during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.  History  Fugger Castle and Sankt Andreas Church overlooking Babenhausen Babenhausen was first mentioned in a document related to a boundary conflict in 1237. Municipal rights can be traced back to 1315, and in 1337, Emperor Ludwig IV awarded the city with the town charter of Ulm. Babenhausen finally lost its municipal rights after the Rottweiler verdict in 1466. The castle and its lordship were purchased by Anton Fugger in 1539. Babenhausen became an Imperial Principality in 1803. As an effect of the Rheinbund act, the city was integrated into the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1806. The castle is still in the Fugger family and owned by the current Prince Fugger of Babenhausen (F√ºrst Fugger von Babenhausen). Babenhausen was connected to the railway in 1894 (Illertalbahn), but local public transportation on this route was discontinued in 1964. The railway embankment now provides a bicycle path.

In 1877 he was made director of the Bavarian royal theatres; from 1887 to 1892 toured the United States, Germany, Russia, and The Netherlands; in 1895 to 1905 was general director of the Bayerische Hoftheater; and in 1901 opened the Prinzregententheater (Prince Regent's Theatre). In 1897, in return for Possart assisting him in gaining an orchestral post in Munich, Richard Strauss wrote a recitation for narrator and piano. They performed Enoch Arden in a number of cities. On February 15, 1878, Henrik Ibsen wrote him a personal letter commending him on his \\"genius\\" performance as \\"Konsul Bernick\\" in Ibsens play \\"Pillars of society\\" which had its opening date in K√∂nigliches Residenz-Theater, Munich 10 days earlier. In the private royal theatre (the Residenz) he produced several of Mozart's operas. Among his own roles were Nathan, Gessler, Mephisto, Iago, and Shylock. He edited German versions of King Lear (1875), The Merchant of Venice (1880), and Coriolanus; wrote the plays Der Deutschfranz√∂sische Krieg (1871), Recht des Herzens (1898), and Im Aussichtswagen (1898); and published Aufgabe der Schauspielkunst (1895), Lehrgang des Schauspielers (1901), and descriptions of many of his own productions. In 1868 Possart married opera singer Anna Deinet. In 1875 their daughter Ernestine von Possart (1875-1946) was born. Ernestine was married to operatic tenor Robert Hutt and also had a highly successful career as an operatic soprano, using the stage name Ernesta Delsarta.

The column ran in the Features section and quickly became popular among Las Vegas based readers. The idea The idea for the Fear and Loafing column came to Levitan after an awkward journalistic experience Levitan had while writing for the Daily Breeze newspaper in Torrance, California. Levitan had been assigned to cover a nearby nudist camp, but found that none of the members were interested in talking to anyone wearing clothes. Levitan said about the experience: \\"I was completely awkward and out of my element.\\" After the success of that story, Levitan thought that he could repeat the success of that story in future stories by also placing himself inside his writing in a manner that would provide humor to the reader. Levitan also says that writer George Plimpton‚Äôs attempt to join the Detroit Lions and the writing Plimpton did about his experience affected his idea for the column.

Accordingly, NSE had developed and launched the NSE Mumbai Inter-bank Bid Rate (MIBID) and NSE Mumbai Inter-bank Offer Rate (MIBOR) for the overnight money market on June 15, 1998. The success of the Overnight NSE MIBID MIBOR encouraged the Exchange to develop a benchmark rate for the term money market. NSE launched the 14-day NSE MIBID MIBOR on November 10, 1998 and the longer term money market benchmark rates for 1 month and 3 months on December 1, 1998. Further, the exchange introduced a 3 Day FIMMDA-NSE MIBID-MIBOR on all Fridays with effect from June 6, 2008 in addition to existing overnight rate. The MIBID/MIBOR rate is used as a bench mark rate for majority of deals struck for Interest Rate Swaps, Forward Rate Agreements, Floating Rate Debentures and Term Deposits. Fixed Income Money Market and Derivative Association of India (FIMMDA) has been in the forefront for creation of benchmarks that can be used by the market participants to bring uniformity in the market place. To take the process of development further, FIMMDA and NSEIL have taken the initiative to co-brand the dissemination of reference rates for the Overnight Call and Term Money Market using the current methodology behind NSE ‚Äì MIBID/MIBOR. The product was rechristened as 'FIMMDA-NSE MIBID/MIBOR'. The 'FIMMDA-NSE MIBID/MIBOR' is now jointly disseminated by FIMMDA as well as NSEIL through their websites and other means and simultaneous dissemination of the information would be as per international practice.

The event became international as the final song of the event was broadcast live all over the world through satellites, the entire concert was broadcast Live on London's 104.9 XFM, support came from Patrick Jones, Shack, Feeder and Super Furry Animals though amongst fan sites at the time Mansun had been strongly rumoured to play but did not. The year changes between 'Motorcycle Emptiness' and the cover of 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You', the latter song (and the one after it) performed solo by James Dean Bradfield with an acoustic guitar. In-between some of the tracks there are interview clips where the band discusses their history and the songs. During the concert and radio broadcast just before The Masses Against the Classes was played Nicky Wire ranted and told the crowd to go out and buy the single when it was released so it would be No.1 in the charts so we would not have to have another shit No.1 and further said \\"So Knock The F*ckers Off The Top Eh\\" this was omitted from the VHS or DVD release.

It was founded in 1987 by Friedhelm Haas and J√∂rg Reichstein. It was originally based in Kirchhain, but moved to Rauschenberg in 1998. The company folded in 2000. During the early part of its life the company produced MIDI master keyboards, and later the Quasimidi Styledrive, which could store and replay MIDI sequence and system exclusive control codes. The company also produced an upgrade kit to expand the capabilities of the popular Roland E-20 keyboard, as well as several ROM cards for the E-20 offering additional accompaniment styles. Subsequently, they became notable for their range of synthesisers, which were aimed at the dance music market. Their first popular product was the Quasimidi Quasar, a rack-mounted digital synthesiser module which was released in 1993. The presets and drum sounds eschewed the typical General Midi specification, which was in vogue at the time, in favour of electronic and trance techno styles. The Quasar included an arpeggiator, which was an unusual feature in 1993. Whereas the Quasar was a two-unit rackmounted box, Quasimidi's subsequent equipment was visually adventurous. Quasimidi was one of the first modern synthesizer companies to re-introduce knobs, lit buttons, and dials to synthesizer control interfaces, notably with the Quasimidi Rave-O-Lution 309 of 1997. This was a module which combined a pattern-based sequencer with a drum section and a synthesiser section. It competed in the \\"groovebox\\" market segment against Roland's popular MC-303. Quasimidi released a keyboard version of the Rave-O-Lution, as the Quasimidi Sirius, which included a built-in vocoder. Quasimidi also built the Raven, which also was based on the dance market genre of the time, making use of a very logical sequencer which was very good for live usage, using the keys to mute or unmute elements of the tracks, and also an octave of keys allowing the sequence to be transposed in real time based on the root chord note, it also featured real and step time recording in the style of Roland type TR drum machine type step input, many Raven models were fitted with the \\"MAXX\\" expansion board which took the internal PCM data from 6 mb to 14mb, whilst the Standard Raven is quite a large palette of sounds, the MAXX version is the Raven model to own, the Raven is also similar in use to the Roland JX-305. Quasimidi Raven Quasimidi also built a master keyboard, namely the Cyber 6 which shared the same casing as the Raven, albeit a couple of cosmetic differences, most notably the striking red Livery. The Cyber 6 was a 61-note Master keyboard with aftertouch, which allowed control of 32 independent MIDI channels thanks to its two midi out sockets located on the rear, part of the advantage of this is that the keyboard can be split into zones, or layers, with each zone being able to transmit on its own MIDI channel, and can also be transposed individually in the zone, so it is possible to create large timbres using separate sound sources or synthesizers, for large thick layering on the same key zones. It also had an 8-track sequencer, in the same guise as the Raven but went beyond the realms of the traditional arpeggiator types of grooves, which became known as \\"Motivators\\", of which it featured two within the Engine of the sadly the Cyber 6 does not have any internal sounds. The Cyber 6 along with the Raven have become increasingly popular in the last few years, despite a lack of appreciation in the past or perhaps thanks to the dire manuals which were poorly translated from German to English. Quasimidi's final product was the Polymorph, a successor of the Rave-O-Lution. Although the company's products were popular, Quasimidi went out of business in 2000.

The off-Broadway production by Playwrights Horizons began previews at the Duke Theatre on 42nd Street on September 7, 2001, and concluded its scheduled run on October 14, 2001. It won the Richard Rodgers Production Award, administered by the American Academy of Arts and Letters. The musical depicts the journey of a young woman just released from prison, who decides to start her life anew in a rural town in Wisconsin. She participates in a journey within the town toward its own tenuous reawakening.  History  Authors James Valcq and Fred Alley had been friends since high-school music camp in 1980, but they did not collaborate until 1994 on The Passage for Alley's American Folklore Theatre in Wisconsin. New York-based Valcq was seeking a follow-up project for the pair after his Zombies from the Beyond closed off-Broadway in 1995. They wanted to create a piece of populist theatre with elements of myth and folktale. Upon seeing the film The Spitfire Grill, they had found their vehicle. Actual writing of the musical commenced in October 1999. A demonstration tape of a few songs from the score found its way to David Saint, artistic director of the George Street Playhouse in New Jersey. The theatre presented a workshop of the show in June, 2000, featuring Helen Gallagher as Hannah, and produced the world premiere production in November 2000, featuring Beth Fowler as Hannah. Throughout the process, Arthur Laurents mentored the creative team, encouraging them to find their own emotional truth in the material. The ending of the musical is entirely different from the ending of the film. Ira Weitzman, associate producer of musicals at Playwrights Horizons, and Tim Sanford, the artistic director, saw the George Street production and announced that The Spitfire Grill would open the 2000-2001 season at Playwrights Horizons after a May workshop. One week before the workshop, Alley suffered a fatal heart attack at the age of 38 while jogging in the woods near his Wisconsin home. Two weeks later, The Spitfire Grill was presented with the Richard Rodgers Production Award . Stephen Sondheim chairs the committee that chose The Spitfire Grill as the winner. The remainder of the group comprised Lynn Ahrens, Jack Beeson, John Guare, Sheldon Harnick, R.W.B. Lewis, Richard Maltby, Jr., and Robert Ward. The off-Broadway production featured Phyllis Somerville as Hannah, Garrett Long as Percy, Liz Callaway as Shelby, and Steven Pasquale as Joe. It was directed by David Saint. The show received Best Musical nominations from the Outer Critics Circle and Drama League, as well as Drama Desk nominations for Garrett Long as Outstanding Actress in a Musical and Liz Callaway as Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical. Since the Playwrights Horizons production, The Spitfire Grill has been produced over 700 times worldwide in regional theatres, festivals, stock, community, and school productions. Foreign-language versions have been produced in Germany in 2005; in South Korea in 2007, 2012, and 2015; in Japan in 2009; and in The Netherlands in 2018. Notable American versions include a co-production by American Folklore Theatre (co-founded by Fred Alley) and Skylight Opera Theatre (2002), which featured Phyllis Somerville as Hannah, the West Coast premiere at Laguna Playhouse (2002), which won the OC Award for Best Musical, and the Idaho Shakespeare Festival production in 2006, which was conducted by James Valcq. The musical had its UK premiere at the 2008 Edinburgh Festival Fringe in a production by the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama and its Australian premiere in July 2010 by the Margaret River Theatre Group. In 2011, American Folklore Theatre produced a 10th-anniversary production that was directed by the composer. The show premiered in Singapore at the Creative Cube in September 2012. The musical was performed by LASALLE College of the Arts with direction by Tony Knight and musical direction by Ben Kiley. The cast consisted of Erin Clare (Percy Talbott), Alison Eaton (Hannah Ferguson), Timothy Langan (Joe Sutter), Kelly White (Shelby), Emma Etherington (Effy), Vanessa Powell (Caleb) and Brett Khaou (Eli).http://www.lasalle.edu.sg/Events/EventDetail.aspx/The-Spitfire-Grill-1 The show received its London Premiere at the Union Theatre, Southwark, in a production starring Belinda Wollaston as Percy Talbott and directed by Alastair Knights in July 2015. This production was acclaimed as a Top 10 Critic's Choice musical by BritishTheatre.com and was awarded Best New Production of a Musical (Fringe/Regions) in the Broadway World UK Awards. In 2018, The Spitfire Grill premiered in the Netherlands at the Fontys School of Fine and Performing Arts for a limited run, with direction by Yannick Plugers and musical direction by Rick van den Belt.  Synopsis  ;Act I Rural Wisconsin. February. A young woman, Percy Talbott, gazes out the window of her prison cell, from which she is about to be released. In her pocket is a photograph clipped from a travel book with a caption that states ‚ÄúAutumn colors along Copper Creek near Gilead, Wisconsin‚Äù (\\"A Ring Around the Moon\\"). Arriving in Gilead, Percy reports to the local sheriff, Joe Sutter. He leads her through the deserted streets to a ramshackle diner called the Spitfire Grill, run by a crusty old widow, Hannah Ferguson, who has a bad hip and sharp tongue. Joe persuades Hannah to take Percy on board and give her work as a waitress. Percy sets to work in a swirl of small-town suspicions led by Effy, the postmistress and village busybody (\\"Something‚Äôs Cooking at the Spitfire Grill\\"). In the face of all the gossip and Hannah's constant haranguing, Percy begins to wonder whether she made a mistake in coming to Gilead (\\"Coffee Cups and Gossip\\"). Her thoughts are interrupted by a cry from Hannah, who has tripped on the stairs and broken her leg. Over the protests of her fiercely protective nephew, Caleb, Hannah has Percy take over the Spitfire. When it comes to cooking, though, Percy is clueless (\\"Into the Frying Pan\\"). That night, without explaining why, Hannah reluctantly asks Percy to wrap a towel around a loaf of bread and to leave it near the old stump out back of the grill. Percy is joined at the Spitfire by Caleb's wife Shelby, an excellent cook. In the heat of the kitchen, the two women are drawn together. Shelby tells Percy about Hannah and Gilead's past, the day her childhood hero went off to war and her hometown changed forever (\\"When Hope Goes\\"). Wanting to escape painful memories, Hannah has had the Grill on the real estate market for 10 years with no takers. In a moment of inspiration, Percy proposes a way for Hannah to get rid of the Spitfire and make some money at the same time: a raffle. For a $100 and an essay about why they might want the Grill, anyone can enter. At first, Hannah resists, but slowly, something about the craziness of the idea convinces her that it just might work. As the rest of the town watches, the long Wisconsin winter stubbornly give way to spring (\\"Ice and Snow\\"), the women at the Spitfire plan the details of the contest. Percy and Shelby share a vision of life as they wish it were, while writing the advertisement for the raffle (\\"The Colors of Paradise\\"). Caleb spots the contest ads as they begin to appear in out-of-town papers. Without a decent job since the local quarry closed, Caleb has been left trying to sell real estate that no one wants. His frustration turns against a world where being a hard-working man is no longer enough (\\"Digging Stone\\"). During a parole session with Sheriff Joe Sutter, Percy tells something of her bleak past growing up in the West Virginia coal mines. Joe, in turn, spills out his dissatisfaction with life in Gilead (\\"This Wide Woods\\"). As summer approaches, the first raffle entry arrives in the mail, complete with $100 and a rather depressing essay, which stirs up some of Hannah's old wounds (\\"Forgotten Lullaby\\"). That night, while placing the usual loaf of bread out back, Percy encounters a silent visitor. She attempts to make conversation, but the mysterious man merely takes the bread and flees. Weeks go by, and essays begin to pour into the grill from far and wide (\\"Shoot the Moon\\"). ;Act II Hannah, Percy, and Shelby sit in the Spitfire Grill after hours, reading essays and drinking from a jug of Hannah's infamous applejack. As they read the letters, some funny, some sad, Hannah expresses her appreciation for what Percy and Shelby have done (\\"Come Alive Again\\"). Before long, it seems everyone in town is helping Hannah to sift through the letters, and a magical shift occurs, not only at the Spitfire, but throughout Gilead, as well. Late one October night on the back porch, Joe tells Percy that he no longer wants to leave Gilead. He plans to build a house on a plot of land his father has given to him (\\"Forest for the Trees\\"). Deeply troubled, Percy abruptly rejects Joe's proposal of marriage and confides to Shelby the harsh details of her life. Impregnated by her stepfather when she was 16, Percy suffered untold abuse resulting in the loss of her unborn child. While on the run, she killed her stepfather with his own straight razor. Shelby comforts Percy and gently sings her to sleep (\\"Wild Bird\\"). When Percy awakens, she sees the mysterious visitor and at last realizes he is none other than Eli, Hannah's own son. Eli leads Percy deep into the forest and then to a clearing atop a hill. The leaves have turned to autumn colors and as the sun rises, they burn like flame (\\"Shine\\"). Transformed by her hilltop vision, Percy leads Eli back to the Grill to reunite him with Hannah after so many years. In a painful confrontation, Shelby and Caleb recognize Eli and react with such shock at his battered appearance and broken demeanor that Eli flees. Hannah finally admits that Eli had been a deserter in the Vietnam war. The shame of it killed her husband, and though Hannah has taken care of Eli's basic needs, she has kept his presence in the woods a secret from the entire town. Percy pleads with Hannah to express her forgiveness to Eli. Day passes into night and Hannah calls out to her son (\\"Way Back Home\\"). Out of the shadows, Eli appears in the grill once more. Hannah reaches out her hand to welcome him home. On the last day of the contest, everybody reads their favorite essays. Finally, Hannah reads the words that have touched her the most - the ad describing the grill, written by Percy and Shelby. In gratitude for their role in reuniting mother and son, while admitting she is not offering much in return, Hannah turns over the Grill to Percy and Shelby. They celebrate with some saucy pizza (\\"Finale\\").  Critical reception  In New York magazine, John Simon wrote ‚ÄúIt is not often that material moves me to tears, but this was one of those occasions. The Spitfire Grill has the heart and soul that your Producers and Full Montys cannot begin to approach. What even in normal times would be a joy is, in these troubled ones, sheer nourishment.‚Äù He later included the show in his Best of 2001 list. Other critics also commented on the show's poignancy after the September 11, 2001 attacks. ‚ÄúIf after the events of recent weeks you need any reason at all to embrace life again, the musical you've been waiting for has arrived. The Spitfire Grill is one of the most heartfelt musicals of recent years, its homespun charms as inviting as a warm winter blanket‚Äù, wrote Matthew Murray reviewing the show for Talkin‚Äô Broadway . The Wall Street Journal‚Äôs Amy Gamerman wrote ‚ÄúThe Spitfire Grill feels as if it has been transplanted to Times Square directly from an obscure patch of the American heartland. The longing for a place like Gilead, well removed from the big, troublesome world, is real enough ‚Äì perhaps now more than ever. The show's creators tap into that longing with unembarrassed directness. At a time when cynicism seems downright unpatriotic, sophisticates may find themselves powerless to resist. Well before the show reaches its conclusion, many of the New York city slickers in the audience may be ready to enter Percy's raffle themselves.‚Äù Elysa Gardner in USA Today wrote that the score offered ‚Äúsome of the most engaging and instantly infectious melodies I‚Äôve heard in a musical in some time. Valcq‚Äôs resonant, folk-based orchestrations make the fetching tunes even more accessible and poignant. Open your heart and visit the Spitfire Grill.‚Äù Victor Gluck of the Associated Press described it as ‚Äúa lovely new musical in the Rodgers and Hammerstein tradition.‚Äù In Show Business Weekly, David Hurst wrote, ‚ÄúThe score by James Valcq is a mixture of country, bluegrass, and Broadway-styled pop ballads that is always stirring and pure Americana in sound with heartfelt lyrics by the late Fred Alley.‚Äù According to Billboard, ‚ÄúIn a genre known for being big and brassy, it's always a pleasure to come across a musical that revels in its quiet moments. That's why The Spitfire Grill is like a breath of fresh country air.‚Äù Jonathan Frank wrote in Sound Advice, ‚ÄúThe Spitfire Grill has a simplicity and emotional resonance that has become all too rare in musical theater. This is a show that succeeds by not trying: it simply is.‚Äù He described the score as ‚Äúsimply astonishing, due no small part to Valcq's stunning arrangements, which consist of folk instruments and instrumentations, acting as a character unto themselves.‚Äù Variety's Joel Hirschhorn wrote that \\"Valcq's numbers are consistently exciting, aided by carefully devised orchestrations. More than most musicals, the underscoring feels like an extra character, brimming with creative cello, violin, mandolin, guitar, and keyboard solos. Fred Alley wrote lyrics that contain the ring of plain-spoken, believable truth.\\" In The New York Times, Ben Brantley wrote ‚Äúthe songs are shiny with tunefulness, hope, and all- American inflections of country and folk. Mr. Valcq‚Äôs score has a gentle American vernacular charm. Mr. Alley‚Äôs lyrics have a matching ease and simplicity.‚Äù Also in The New York Times, Alvin Klein declared the show ‚Äúa soul-satisfying new musical. The Spitfire Grill is a complete work of theatrical resourcefulness. A compelling story that flows with grace and carries the rush of anticipation. The warm, indigenous American folk sound of Mr. Valcq‚Äôs score is, harmonically and melodically, as theatrical as it is grass roots. Mr. Alley‚Äôs lyrics accomplish the considerable feat of poetically offering inspiration while holding the syrup. The musical is freeing. It is penetrated by honesty and it glows.‚Äù Of the London production, Stephen Collins in British Theatre wrote ‚ÄúThe Spitfire Grill is a musical treat. James Valcq‚Äôs score is richly rewarding and creates a genuinely engaging musical atmosphere, which helps shape and drive the narrative. He creates a true musical world for the characters and, within that world, each character has tunes and phrases which assist in illuminating them and their part in the story. There are plenty of thrilling musical passages, some gentle and heartbreaking ones, as well as joyful and colourful (and tuneful) numbers. It‚Äôs the kind of score which engulfs you with its charm and spirit and, at the end, you just want to listen to it again.‚Äù In his article \\"The Best of 2015\\" for Live Theatre UK, Collins singled out ‚ÄúUnion Theatre‚Äôs magical enlivening of The Spitfire Grill, a heart-warming but difficult American tale of redemption and fortitude which deserves a further, extensive life in the West End.‚Äù In The Stage, Mark Shenton found the show ‚Äúa chamber musical that mines surprising depths in its portrait of the healing qualities of small-town community life. Set to a haunting score, the cast of seven gives it a gritty heart, aching with longing and regret but also hope.‚Äù In Harpers Bazaar, Lucy Halfhead stated ‚Äúthe songs all hit their emotional marks - whether rousing or heartbreaking - and propel the action along. It‚Äôs thrilling that The Spitfire Grill‚Äôs raft of great tunes has been uncovered for a UK audience.‚Äù Genni Trickett of London Theatre 1 called the show ‚Äúheart-warming, sincere, thought-provoking, and a jolly good story. Not to mention the original, toe-tapping tunes, which get into your head and refuse to be dislodged, no matter how hard you try.‚Äù The British Theatre Guide‚Äôs Howard Loxton wrote of the score: ‚ÄúThe songs are part of the storytelling smoothly integrated with a gentle folk influence and an almost operatic treatment in the way they colour in the narrative and elaborate phrases. From individual arias to a complex sextet involving all the characters except a silent outsider, they are beautifully crafted.‚Äù Awards and nominations *The New York/Off-Broadway Production received an Outer Critics Circle Award nomination for Best Off Broadway Musical. *The New York/Off-Broadway Production received a Drama League Award nomination for Best Off Broadway Musical. *The New York/Off-Broadway Production was nominated for two Drama Desk Awards: Outstanding Actress in a Musical (Garrett Long) and Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical (Liz Callaway). *The London production received Best New Production of a Musical (Fringe/Regions) in the Broadway World UK Awards. *The Washington DC production received 2 Helen Hayes Award nominations. *The Los Angeles production received a Dramalogue Award nomination for Best Musical. *The Laguna production won the OC Award for Best Musical.

Leeper first conceived of the ACA in 1977 as a Florida artist-in-residence program in which artists of all disciplines could work with current prominent artists in a supportive and creative environment. Leeper saw the potential for an artist‚Äôs residency as a place for ideas to be created, shared, and come into fruition. Leeper soon persuaded friends and community members to join in her vision. In 1979, she convinced the Rockefeller Foundation to provide a challenge grant that soon was matched. This $25,000 in seed money was the unofficial inception of the ACA. When a prime piece of property became available on the shores of Turnbull Bay, a tidal estuary west of New Smyrna Beach, Leeper raised the $50,000 necessary to buy the ten-acre plot. Three years later, five main buildings were completed. Over the years, five more buildings were constructed and an additional 59 acres were purchased as preserve land. In 1997, the Leeper Studio Complex, designed by Thompson and Rose Architects,http://www.charlesrosearchitects.com/projects/aca-leeper/ was completed.  Facilities = Pabst Visitor Center & Gallery = The Pabst Visitor Center is part of the ACA headquarters at 1414 Art Center Avenue, in New Smyrna Beach. The Visitor Center includes several public art galleries. The Jean G. Harris History Gallery features a permanent exhibit about the history and work of the Atlantic Center for the Arts. The Master Artist Gallery features changing exhibits by ACA Master Artists and other themed shows. The Jack Mitchell Portrait Gallery displays photographic portraits of ACA Master Artists from 1982‚Äì2004. The Visitor Center also features a gift shop, and a 500-foot public art and nature trail. = Leeper Studio Complex = Comprising six buildings connected to existing structures by raised wooden walkways, the Leeper Studio Complex includes a library and studios for painting, sculpture, dance, music/recording, and theater. The studio complex added 12,000 sq. ft. of artists' working space to the existing campus and also provides additional facilities for public programs and partnerships. = Harris House Gallery = The ACA also operates the Harris House Gallery at the Community Arts Center at Harris House, 214 South Riverside Drive, New Smyrna Beach, Florida  Programs = Master Artists-in-Residence Program = The ACA Master Artists-in-Residence Program was designed to bring together internationally acclaimed master artists from different disciplines with talented artists who are selected by the masters. Since 1982, over 155 three- week-long interdisciplinary residencies have taken place at the Atlantic Center, featuring over 430 Master Artists and over 3,500 Associate Artists from around the world. (The first residency, in 1982, was with author James Dickey, sculptor Duane Hanson and composer David Del Tredici.) The pine and palmetto wooded environment includes a resource library, painting studio, sculpture studio, music studio, dance studio, black box theater, writer's studio, and digital computer lab. Each residency session includes three master artists of different disciplines. The master artists each personally select a group of associates ‚Äî talented, emerging artists ‚Äî through an application process administered by ACA. During the residency, artists participate in informal sessions with their group, collaborate on projects, and work independently on their own projects. The relaxed atmosphere and unstructured program provide considerable time for artistic regeneration and creation. Atlantic Center for the Arts provides housing (private room/bath with work desk), weekday meals (provided by ACA chef), and 24-hour access to shared studio space. Other past master artists include Edward Albee, Allen Ginsberg, and John Ashbery. = Community Art Programs = In 1991, Atlantic Center for the Arts at Harris House opened and the community arts program had its beginning. Located in the heart of a revitalized downtown, an historic home was converted to a cultural community center that since its inception has assumed a leadership role in providing arts education programs for children and cultural enrichment for adults. ACA at Harris House has exhibition space devoted solely to Florida artists.

The Theatre was built by F. H. Fowler and Hill with a seating capacity of 1,200. It was rebuilt in 1907 and still retains its original substage machinery. Its current seating capacity is 786. History=Early years= Built by Sefton Henry Parry as the Royal Avenue Theatre, it opened on 11 March 1882 with 1200 seats. The first production at the theatre was Jacques Offenbach's Madame Favart. In its early seasons, the theatre hosted comic operas, burlesques and farces for several years. For much of this time, the low comedian Arthur Roberts, a popular star of the music halls, starred at the theatre. By the 1890s, the theatre was presenting drama, and in 1894 Annie Horniman, the tea heiress, anonymously sponsored the actress Florence Farr in a season of plays at the theatre. Farr's first production was unsuccessful, and so she prevailed upon her friend, George Bernard Shaw, to hurry and make his West End d√©but at the theatre with Arms and the Man in 1894. It was successful enough to allow him to discontinue music criticism to focus full-time on play writing. The actress Gladys Cooper managed the theatre for some years. The theatre was rebuilt in 1905 to the designs of Blow and Billerey. During the work, part of the roof of the adjacent Charing Cross railway station collapsed. The roof and girders fell across the train lines but part of the station's western wall also fell and crashed through the roof and wall of the theatre. This resulted in the deaths of three people in the station, and three workmen on the theatre site and injuries to many more. The theatre was repaired and re-opened as The Playhouse on 28 January 1907 with a one-act play called The Drums of Oudh and a play called Toddles, by Tristan Bernard and Andre Godferneaux. Shaw wrote a sketch entitled The Interlude at the Playhouse for the occasion. The new theatre had a smaller seating capacity of 679. W. Somerset Maugham's Home and Beauty premi√®red at the Playhouse on 30 August 1919, running for 235 performances, and Henry Daniell appeared here in February 1926 as the Prince of Karaslavia in Mr. Abdulla. Nigel Bruce appeared in February 1927 as Robert Crosbie in Somerset Maugham's The Letter, and again in May 1930 as Robert Brennan in Dishonoured Lady. Alec Guinness made his stage d√©but here in Ward Dorane's play Libel! on 2 April 1934. Daniell returned in November that year as Paul Miller in Hurricane. =BBC studio= In 1951 it was taken over by the BBC as a recording studio for live performances. The Goon Show and the radio versions of Hancock's Half Hour and Steptoe and Son were recorded here, although at least the first two shows were also recorded at other venues during their runs. The stage also hosted live performances by KISS, Queen, Led Zeppelin, The Who, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. On 3 April 1967, a live Pink Floyd concert was broadcast from the theatre.Pink Floyd timeline accessed 27 March 2007 When the BBC left around 1976, the theatre went dark and was in danger of demolition. =Other Uses= In 1986, Rock band Queen used the Playhouse Theatre as the set for their A Kind Of Magic music video =1987 return to theatre usage= The theatre was restored to its 1907 design by impresario Robin Gonshaw, opening again in October 1987 with the musical Girlfriends. A commercial building, Aria House, was erected above the theatre. In 1988, novelist and politician Jeffrey Archer bought the Playhouse for just over ¬£1 million. The following year, the theatre was offered commercial sponsorship by a financial services' company, and for a while it was known as the MI Group Playhouse. In 1991, the Playhouse became home to the Peter Hall Company, and a number of critically and commercially successful plays were performed there, including Tennessee Williams' The Rose Tattoo (1991), starring Julie Walters and Moliere's Tartuffe (1991), starring Paul Eddington and Felicity Kendal. Around this time the basement bar area of the theatre was converted into a private restaurant, Shaws, but the enterprise was unsuccessful and the space was later converted back into a bar/cafe. In 1992, Archer sold the Playhouse to the writer and impresario Ray Cooney for just over ¬£2 million. That year Cooney staged the West End premiere of his latest farce It Runs in the Family at the Playhouse. This was followed by Jane Eyre (1993), adapted by Fay Weldon and starring Tim Pigott-Smith; Frederick Lonsdale's On Approval, (1994), starring Simon Ward, Martin Jarvis and Anna Carteret; and Ray Cooney's Funny Money in 1995. In 1996, Cooney sold the Playhouse to American investment banker Patrick Sulaiman Cole, whose first production was a critically acclaimed revival of Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House in 1996, directed by Anthony Page and starring Janet McTeer. Later that year, the theatre was closed for complete refurbishment under the direction of English Heritage, with the auditorium luxuriously decorated, with grandiose murals, caryatids, golden pillars, carved balustrades, and shining gold decoration. It reopened in 1997 with Sulaiman Cole's production and the West End premi√®re of Anton Chekhov's The Wood Demon. This was followed by Sulaiman Cole's production of a first ever West End Snoo Wilson premiere, \\"HRH\\", directed by Simon Callow, about the British Royal Family's Duke and Duchess of Windsor, which opened the day after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. The play was harshly reviewed as anti-Royal. The theatre returned to life as a commercial receiving house with several seasons of Almeida Theatre and Cheek by Jowl productions, including the popular but critically panned premiere of David Hare's The Judas Kiss. Interior of the theatreSuccesses at the Playhouse since the late 1990s have included Naked (1998); J. B. Priestley's An Inspector Calls (2001) and Journey's End, directed by David Grindley. American theatrical producers Ted and Norman Tulchin's Maidstone Productions purchased the theatre at the end of 2002,thisistheatre Playhouse theatre history accessed 28 March 2007 with the venue managed by the Ambassador Theatre Group. The Playhouse hosted Richard Eyre's 2003 Olivier Award-winning production of Vincent in Brixton, starring Clare Higgins; Eyre's 2005 production of Hedda Gabler, starring Eve Best; and Megan Dodds in a transfer of My Name Is Rachel Corrie by Alan Rickman and Katharine Viner in 2006. More recent successes include the musical Dancing in the Streets, The Adventures of Tintin based on the famous comic-book detective, The Harder They Come, and La Cage Aux Folles.

The turbines were rated at a total of for a speed of . They had a range of at .Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 153 The main armament of the Tachibana sub-class consisted of three Type 89 dual- purpose guns in one twin-gun mount aft and one single mount forward of the superstructure. The single mount was partially protected against spray by a gun shield. They carried a total of 25 Type 96 anti-aircraft guns in 4 triple and 13 single mounts. The accuracy of the Type 89 guns was severely reduced against aircraft because no high-angle gunnery director was fitted. The Tachibanas were equipped with Type 13 early-warning and Type 22 surface-search radars.Stille, p. 41 The ships were also armed with a single rotating quadruple mount amidships for torpedos. They could deliver their 60 depth charges via two stern racks and two throwers. Construction and career Nashi was launched by Kawasaki, Kobe, on 17 January 1945 and completed on 15 March. She was assigned to Desron 11, Combined Fleet, for training on 15 March 1945. In May 1945 she was assigned to Destroyer Division 52, Cruiser-Destroyer Squadron 31. Nashi escaped an attack on Kure harbour by B-29's on 22 June 1945, but on 28 July 1945 was sunk at Mitajirizaki, Kure () by aircraft from Halsey's Task Force 38. Commander Takeda and most of the crew survived. On 15 September 1945, Nashi was officially struck from the Navy list. The ship was refloated in 1954, and after repair at Kure recommissioned in the JMSDF as Wakaba on 31 May 1956. She was refitted in 1958 for use as a radar trials ship, and sonar was added in 1960. As such she was the only ship of the Imperial Japanese Navy to become part of the post-war Japan Maritime Self- Defense Force, and for some time was the biggest ship in the JMSDF. Wakaba was struck on 31 March 1971, and scrapped in 1972‚Äì73. 'Nashi' is a type of pear. 'Wakaba' means \\"Young Leaves\\" in Japanese, suggesting the \\"green shoots\\" of recovery, a symbol of a new start after the war. Additionally, while the name 'Nashi' in the logographic Japanese Kanji script unmistakably means: 'pear' (Ê¢®), in the phonetic Japanese script of Hiragana, 'Nashi(„Å™„Åó)' can mean \\"Not exist\\". Therefore to avoid misunderstanding the term: \\"Not exist\\" (over radio or other communication) she was renamed.

It stands in the London Borough of Croydon, and is located near Ashburton Park. The learning village includes Ashburton Library, Oasis Academy Shirley Park, Croydon Music Service and a CALAT training centre. The complex was built after the old Ashburton Library was closed down. The nearest Tramlink stop is Woodside. The centre is earmarked as Croydon's Flagship Learning Village.

Photovoltaic cells integrated into clerestory glazing will cast dappled shadows along a three-storey central concourse running through the heart of the building. An overhanging roof canopy will provide shelter to the main public entrance.NLA - New London Architecture - Ashburton Learning Village Former energy minister Malcolm Wicks praised the new development in Croydon, for its innovative design and energy-efficient features. The then MP for Croydon North said The south-facing building, designed by architects Penoyre & Prasad and built by Norwest Holst, includes many environmentally friendly features which includes: Special features * The largest solar panels to be installed in a building in the UK * A rain water tank to feed toilets and service sinks * Movement-sensitive automatic lights * Sun tubes for rooms without windows in the form of polished chrome cylinders that are fitted in the ceiling and protrude from the roof and, with the help of micro prism glass, magnify the light coming into the room and thus reduce the need for electric lights * Floor-to-ceiling windows and sky lights in the library, which again reduce the need for electric lights * A brise soleil - a permanent blind that stops glare from the sun but allows maximum daylight into rooms - installed on the outside of the library windows * Air-pressure tests to ensure the buildings heat insulation reaches the required standard * School computer equipment locked into desks and only activated by a main key, reducing the possibility of theft and damage, while allowing full use to users. As well as Croydon Music Service and CETS having access to these amenities, the entire community will benefit as they are available for use after school hours, at weekends and during school holidays. In particular, members of the public can use the gym areas and changing rooms daily. School safety was also high on the design brief and all areas have been made secure with the use of card keys. Everyone entering the building must do so through the main reception. Locked areas are automatically deactivated if the fire alarm should go off. In March, the former Secretary of State for Education Ruth Kelly MP visited the learning village, and marked the end of the construction period with a foundation stone taken from the original school, which opened in 1950. She said Work on Ashburton Learning Village, Shirley Road, Croydon, started in June 2004 but plans to redevelop the school had been in the pipeline since 2001, when Croydon Council secured government backing from the then Department for Education and Employment through the Private Finance Initiative (PFI). Additional PFI credits were granted by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department of Trade and Industry, enabling Ashburton Library to move from its current home in Ashburton Park and allowing the more ambitious plans to create a learning village for the whole community to be developed. As part of the project, 100 new homes will be built on the surplus land. Once the school has moved into its new accommodation, the old buildings will be demolished. A special needs learning hub and community space will be opened at the old Ashburton library site in the summer of 2017. Under the PFI agreement, Jarvis plc is responsible for the maintenance of the building for the next 30 years. Ashburton Community School was replaced by Oasis Academy: Shirley Park in 2009.  Oasis Academy Shirley Park  Oasis Academy Shirley Park (formerly Ashburton Community School) is an academic school located in the centre of the learning village. = Notable alumni = *Alex Wynter, footballer with Crystal Palace, attended 2005‚Äì2010. *Louis John, footballer with Crystal Palace, attended 2005‚Äì2010. *Harry Osborne, footballer with Crystal Palace, attended 2005‚Äì2010. *Jerome Williams, footballer with Crystal Palace, attended 2004‚Äì2010. *Ibra Sekajja, footballer with Barnet (on loan from Crystal Palace), attended 2004‚Äì2009. *Sean Scannell, footballer with Huddersfield Town, attended 2002‚Äì2007. *Damian Scannell, footballer with Eastleigh, attended 1996‚Äì2001. *Neal Ardley, manager of Notts County and former footballer with Wimbledon F.C. *Dean Leacock, footballer with Notts County. Ashburton Library Ashburton Library is a Public Library located in the learning village. It is owned by Croydon Council and is part of the Croydon Libraries arm of the council . The library, unlike many other Croydon Libraries, is based on only one floor. Croydon has said that it would like to redo all of its libraries so they could all be accessible by users who are disabled. The library moved in when it finished building in March, 2006. Like all Croydon libraries it includes free access to PCs which includes the internet. Books, CDs, DVDs, videos for reference and loan. Here's a list of other things which the library includes: *Children's library *Enquiry service *Local history material *Black and white photocopier *Books in community languages *Newspapers and periodicals *Community information *Reading groups The library is closed on Wednesdays and Sundays.

The exact exchange energy functional is expressed in terms of the Kohn‚ÄìSham orbitals rather than the density, so is termed an implicit density functional. One of the most commonly used versions is B3LYP, which stands for \\"Becke, 3-parameter, Lee‚ÄìYang‚ÄìParr\\". Origin The hybrid approach to constructing density functional approximations was introduced by Axel Becke in 1993. Hybridization with Hartree‚ÄìFock (HF) exchange (also called exact exchange) provides a simple scheme for improving the calculation of many molecular properties, such as atomization energies, bond lengths and vibration frequencies, which tend to be poorly described with simple \\"ab initio\\" functionals. Method A hybrid exchange‚Äìcorrelation functional is usually constructed as a linear combination of the Hartree‚ÄìFock exact exchange functional : E_\\\\text{x}^\\\\text{HF} = -\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{i,j} \\\\iint \\\\psi_i^*(\\\\mathbf r_1) \\\\psi_j^*(\\\\mathbf r_2) \\\\frac{1}{r_{12}} \\\\psi_j(\\\\mathbf r_1) \\\\psi_i(\\\\mathbf r_2) \\\\,d\\\\mathbf r_1 \\\\,d\\\\mathbf r_2 and any number of exchange and correlation explicit density functionals. The parameters determining the weight of each individual functional are typically specified by fitting the functional's predictions to experimental or accurately calculated thermochemical data, although in the case of the \\"adiabatic connection functionals\\" the weights can be set a priori. = B3LYP = For example, the popular B3LYP (Becke, 3-parameter, Lee‚ÄìYang‚ÄìParr) exchange- correlation functional is : E_\\\\text{xc}^\\\\text{B3LYP} = E_\\\\text{x}^\\\\text{LDA} + a_0 (E_\\\\text{x}^\\\\text{HF} - E_\\\\text{x}^\\\\text{LDA}) + a_\\\\text{x} (E_\\\\text{x}^\\\\text{GGA} - E_\\\\text{x}^\\\\text{LDA}) + E_\\\\text{c}^\\\\text{LDA} + a_\\\\text{c} (E_\\\\text{c}^\\\\text{GGA} - E_\\\\text{c}^\\\\text{LDA}), where a_0 = 0.20, a_\\\\text{x} = 0.72, and a_\\\\text{c} = 0.81. E_\\\\text{x}^\\\\text{GGA} and E_\\\\text{c}^\\\\text{GGA} are generalized gradient approximations: the Becke 88 exchange functional and the correlation functional of Lee, Yang and Parr for B3LYP, and E_\\\\text{c}^\\\\text{LDA} is the VWN local-density approximation to the correlation functional. The three parameters defining B3LYP have been taken without modification from Becke's original fitting of the analogous B3PW91 functional to a set of atomization energies, ionization potentials, proton affinities, and total atomic energies. = PBE0 = The PBE0 functional mixes the Perdew‚ÄìBurke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange energy and Hartree‚ÄìFock exchange energy in a set 3:1 ratio, along with the full PBE correlation energy: : E_\\\\text{xc}^\\\\text{PBE0} = \\\\frac{1}{4} E_\\\\text{x}^\\\\text{HF} + \\\\frac{3}{4} E_\\\\text{x}^\\\\text{PBE} + E_\\\\text{c}^\\\\text{PBE}, where E_\\\\text{x}^\\\\text{HF} is the Hartree‚ÄìFock exact exchange functional, E_\\\\text{x}^\\\\text{PBE} is the PBE exchange functional, and E_\\\\text{c}^\\\\text{PBE} is the PBE correlation functional. = HSE = The HSE (Heyd‚ÄìScuseria‚ÄìErnzerhof) exchange‚Äìcorrelation functional uses an error-function-screened Coulomb potential to calculate the exchange portion of the energy in order to improve computational efficiency, especially for metallic systems: : E_\\\\text{xc}^{\\\\omega\\\\text{PBEh}} = a E_\\\\text{x}^\\\\text{HF,SR}(\\\\omega) + (1 - a) E_\\\\text{x}^\\\\text{PBE,SR}(\\\\omega) + E_\\\\text{x}^\\\\text{PBE,LR}(\\\\omega) + E_\\\\text{c}^\\\\text{PBE}, where a is the mixing parameter, and \\\\omega is an adjustable parameter controlling the short- rangeness of the interaction. Standard values of a = 1/4 and \\\\omega = 0.2 (usually referred to as HSE06) have been shown to give good results for most systems. The HSE exchange‚Äìcorrelation functional degenerates to the PBE0 hybrid functional for \\\\omega = 0. E_\\\\text{x}^\\\\text{HF,SR}(\\\\omega) is the short-range Hartree‚ÄìFock exact exchange functional, E_\\\\text{x}^\\\\text{PBE,SR}(\\\\omega) and E_\\\\text{x}^\\\\text{PBE,LR}(\\\\omega) are the short- and long-range components of the PBE exchange functional, and E_\\\\text{c}^\\\\text{PBE}(\\\\omega) is the PBE correlation functional. = Meta- hybrid GGA = The M06 suite of functionals is a set of four meta-hybrid GGA and meta-GGA DFT functionals. These functionals are constructed by empirically fitting their parameters, while being constrained to a uniform electron gas. The family includes the functionals M06-L, M06, M06-2X and M06-HF, with a different amount of exact exchange for each one. M06-L is fully local without HF exchange (thus it cannot be considered hybrid), M06 has 27% HF exchange, M06-2X 54% and M06-HF 100%. The advantages and usefulness of each functional are * M06-L: Fast, good for transition metals, inorganic and organometallics. * M06: For main group, organometallics, kinetics and non-covalent bonds. * M06-2X: Main group, kinetics. * M06-HF: Charge-transfer TD-DFT, systems where self-interaction is pathological. The suite gives good results for systems containing dispersion forces, one of the biggest deficiencies of standard DFT methods. The s6 scaling factors on Grimme's long-range dispersion correction are 0.20, 0.25 and 0.06 for M06-L, M06 and M06-2X respectively.

Landscape-scale conservation is a holistic approach to landscape management, aiming to reconcile the competing objectives of nature conservation and economic activities across a given landscape. Landscape-scale conservation may sometimes be attempted because of climate change. It can be seen as an alternative to site based conservation. Many global problems such as poverty, food security, climate change, water scarcity, deforestation and biodiversity loss are connected. For example, lifting people out of poverty can increase consumption and drive climate change. Expanding agriculture can exacerbate water scarcity and drive habitat loss. Proponents of landscape management argue that as these problems are interconnected, coordinated approaches are needed to address them, by focussing on how landscapes can generate multiple benefits. For example, a river basin can supply water for towns and agriculture, timber and food crops for people and industry, and habitat for biodiversity; and each one of these users can have impacts on the others. Landscapes in general have been recognised as important units for conservation by intergovernmental bodies, government initiatives, and research institutes. Problems with this approach include difficulties in monitoring, and the proliferation of definitions and terms relating to it.  Definitions  Bureau of Land Management using fire to maintain a landscape in Western Oregon There are many overlapping terms and definitions, but many terms have similar meanings. A sustainable landscape, for example, meets \\"the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\\" Approaching conservation by means of landscapes can be seen as \\"a conceptual framework whereby stakeholders in a landscape aim to reconcile competing social, economic and environmental objectives\\". Instead of focussing on a single use of the land it aims to ensure that the interests of different stakeholders are met. The starting point for all landscape-scale conservation schemes must be an understanding of the character of the landscape. Landscape character goes beyond aesthetic. It involves understanding how the landscape functions to support communities, cultural heritage and development, the economy, as well as the wildlife and natural resources of the area. Landscape character requires careful assessment according to accepted methodologies. Landscape character assessment will contribute to the determination of what scale is appropriate in which landscape. \\"Landscape scale\\" does not merely mean acting at a bigger scale: it means conservation is carried out at the correct scale and that it takes into account the human elements of the landscape, both past and present.  History  Highland cow helping to maintain the landscape near Hilversum in the Netherlands The word 'landscape' in English is a loanword from Dutch landschap introduced in the 1660s and originally meant a painting. The meaning a \\"tract of land with its distinguishing characteristics\\" was derived from that in 1886. This was then used as a verb as of 1916. The German geographer Carl Troll coined the German term Landschafts√∂kologie‚Äìthus 'landscape ecology' in 1939.Troll, C. 1939. Luftbildplan und √∂kologische Bodenforschung (Aerial photography and ecological studies of the earth). Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft f√ºr Erdkunde, Berlin: 241-298. He developed this terminology and many early concepts of landscape ecology as part of this work, which consisted of applying aerial photograph interpretation to studies of interactions between environment, agriculture and vegetation. In the UK conservation of landscapes can be said to have begun in 1945 with the publication of the Report to the Government on National Parks in England and Wales. The National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 introduced the legislation for the creation Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Northern Ireland has the same system after adoption of the Amenity Lands (NI) Act 1965.Northern Ireland Environment Agency The first of these AONB were defined in 1956, with the last being created in 1995. The Permanent European Conference for the Study of the Rural Landscape was established in 1957.Baker, Alan R.H. (1988) Historical Geography and the Study of the European Rural Landscape. Geografiska Annaler 70B (1) 5-16.Helmfrid, Staffan (2004) The Permanent European Conference and the Study of the Rural Landscape. In Palang, Hannes (red.) (2004). European rural landscapes: persistence and change in a globalising environment. Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, p. 467 - The European Landscape Convention was initiated by the Congress of Regional and Local Authorities of the Council of Europe (CLRAE) in 1994, was adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in 2000,Explanatory Report, Art. 4. and came into force in 2004. The conservation community began to take notice of the science of landscape ecology in the 1980s. Efforts to develop concepts of landscape management that integrate international social and economic development with biodiversity conservation began in 1992. Landscape management now exists in multiple iterations and alongside other concepts such as watershed management, landscape ecology and cultural landscapes.UNESCO (2012) Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention . UNESCO World Heritage Centre. Paris. Page 14. International The UN Environment Programme stated in 2015 that the landscape approach embodies ecosystem management. UNEP uses the approach with the Ecosystem Management of Productive Landscapes project. The scientific committee of the Convention on Biological Diversity also considers the perspective of a landscape the most important scale for improving sustainable use of biodiversity. There are global fora on landscapes. During the Livelihoods and Landscapes Strategies programme the International Union for Conservation of Nature applied this approach to locations worldwide, in 27 landscapes in 23 different countries. Examples of landscape approaches can be globalLandscapes for People Food and nature case studies http://peoplefoodandnature.org/analysis/all-publications/case-studies/ or continental, for example in Africa, Oceania and Latin America. The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development plays an important part in funding landscape conservation in Europe.Deutscher Verband f√ºr Landschaftspflege (DVL) e. V. (2008): Natur als Motor l√§ndlicher Entwicklung, DVL Schriftenreihe ‚ÄûLandschaft als Lebensraum‚Äú, Heft 14 = Relevance to international commitments = Some argue landscape management can address the Sustainable Development Goals.Reed J, van Vianen J, Sunderland T. 2015. From global complexity to local reality: Aligning implementation pathways for the Sustainable Development Goals and landscape approaches. Infobrief No. 129. Bogor, Indonesia: Center for International Forestry Research. Many of these goals have potential synergies or trade-offs: some therefore argue that addressing these goals individually may not be effective, and landscape approaches provide a potential framework to manage them. For example, increasing areas of irrigated agricultural land to end hunger could have adverse impacts on terrestrial ecosystems or sustainable water management.Reed J, van Vianen J, Sunderland T. 2015. From global complexity to local reality: Aligning implementation pathways for the Sustainable Development Goals and landscape approaches. Infobrief No. 129. Bogor, Indonesia: Center for International Forestry Research. Landscape approaches intend to include different sectors, and thus achieve the multiple objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals ‚Äì for example, working within catchment area of a river to enhance agricultural productivity, flood defence, biodiversity and carbon storage. Climate change and agriculture are intertwinedBeddington J, Asaduzzaman M, Fernandez A, Clark M, Guillou M, Jahn M, Erda L, Mamo T, Van Bo N, Nobre CA, Scholes R, Sharma R, Wakhungu J. 2011.

The agricultural sector accounts for around 24% of anthropogenic emissions. Unlike other sectors that emit greenhouse gases, agriculture and forestry have the potential to mitigate climate change by reducing or removing greenhouse gas emissions, for example by reforestation and landscape restoration.Smith P., M. Bustamante, H. Ahammad, H. Clark, H. Dong, E. A. Elsiddig, H. Haberl, R. Harper, J. House, M. Jafari, O. Masera, C. Mbow, N. H. Ravindranath, C. W. Rice, C. Robledo Abad, A. Romanovskaya, F.

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA. Advocates of landscape management argue that 'climate-smart agriculture' and REDD+ can draw on landscape management. The marketing of products from specific landscapes can assist conservation. This is apple juice from Tukuche village in the Kali Gandaki Gorge, Nepal Regional=Germany= Because a large proportion of the biodiversity of Germany was able to invade from the south and east after human activities altered the landscape, maintaining such artificial landscapes is an integral part of nature conservation. The full name of the main nature conservation law in Germany, the Bundesnaturschutzgesetzes, is thus titled in its entirety Gesetz √ºber Naturschutz und Landschaftspflege, where Landschaftspflege translates literally to \\"landscape maintenance\\" (see reference for more). Related concepts are Landschaftsschutz, \\"landscape protection/conservation\\", and Landschaftsschutzgebiet, a \\"nature preserve\\", or literally a (legally) \\"protected landscape area\\". The Deutscher Verband f√ºr Landschaftspflege is the main organisation which protects landscapes in Germany. It is an umbrella organisation which coordinates the regional landscape protection organisations of the different German states. Classically, there are four methods which can be done in order to conserve landscapes:Jedicke et al. (1996): Praktische Landschaftspflege ‚Äì Grundlagen und Ma√ünahmen. Eugen Ulmer, Hohenheim maintenance, improvement, protectionBaals, C.(2010): Qualit√§tsmanagement in der aktiven Landschaftspflege ‚Äì unter Ber√ºcksichtigung ihrer Entwicklung im Freistaat Bayern. Herbert Utz Verlag ‚Äì Wissenschaft, M√ºnchen and redevelopment. The marketing of products such as meat from alpine meadows or apple juice from traditional Streuobstwiese can also be an important factor in conservation. Landscapes are maintained by three methods: biological - such as grazing by livestock, manually (although this is rare due to the high cost of labour) and commonly mechanically. =The Netherlands= Staatsbosbeheer, the Dutch governmental forest service, considers landscape management an important part of managing their lands. Landschapsbeheer Nederland is an umbrella organisation which promotes and helps fund the interests of the different provincial landscape management organisations, which between them include 75,000 volunteers and 110,000 hectares of protected nature reserves. Sustainable landscape management is being researched in the Netherlands. =Peru= An example of a producer movement managing a multi-functional landscape is the Potato Park in P√≠sac, Peru, where local communities protect the ecological and cultural diversity of the 12,000ha landscape. A variety of Peruvian potatoes from the Andes =Sweden= In Sweden, the Swedish National Heritage Board, or Riksantikvarie√§mbetet, is responsible for landscape conservation. Landscape conservation can be studied at the Department of Cultural Conservation (at Dacapo Mariestad) of the University of Gothenburg, in both Swedish and English. =Thailand= An example of cooperation between very different actors is from the Doi Mae Salong watershed in northwest Thailand, a Military Reserved Area under the control of the Royal Thai Armed Forces. Reforestation activities led to tension with local hill tribes. In response, an agreement was reached with them on land rights and use of different parts of the reserve. =United Kingdom= Among the leading exponents of UK landscape scale conservation are the Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). There are 49 AONB in the UK. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has categorised these regions as \\"category 5 protected areas\\" and in 2005 claimed the AONB are administered using what the IUCN coined the \\"protected landscape approach\\".\\"Protected Areas in the United Kingdom\\" by Phillips, A. and Partington, R. in \\"The Protected Landscape Approach: Linking Nature, Culture and Community\\" Brown, J, Mitchell, N & Beresford, M (Eds) (2005) IUCN, Gland, Switzerland. pp 119-130. In Scotland there is a similar system of national scenic areas. The UK Biodiversity Action Plan protects semi-natural grasslands, among other habitats, which constitute landscapes maintained by low-intensity grazing. Agricultural environment schemes reward farmers and land managers financially for maintaining these habitats on registered agricultural land. Each of the four countries in the UK has its own individual scheme. Studies have been carried out across the UK looking at much wider range of habitats. In Wales the Pumlumon Large Area Conservation Project focusses on upland conservation in areas of marginal agriculture and forestry.http://www.montwt.co.uk/pumlumon.html The North Somerset Levels and Moors Project addresses wetlands. =Other= The landscape to the left is known as satoyama; a traditional human-influenced secondary forest bordering agricultural fields in Japan. The satoyama conservation movement spread in the 1980s in Japan and by 2001 there were more than 500 environmental groups involved.Takeuchi Kazuhiko, Wahitani Izumi and Tsunekawa Atsushi (2001). Satoyama: The Traditional Rural Landscape of Japan. University Tokyo Press 133‚Äì135 Landscape approaches have been taken up by governments in for example the Greater Mekong Subregion project and in Indonesia's climate change commitments, and by international research bodies such as the Center for International Forestry Research, which convenes the Global Landscapes Forum. The Mount Kailash region is where the Indus River, the Karnali River (a major tributary of the Ganges River), the Brahmaputra River and the Sutlej river systems originate. With assistance from the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, the three surrounding countries (China, India and Nepal) developed an integrated management approach to the different conservation and development issues within this landscape. Six countries in West Africa in the Volta River basin using the ‚ÄòMapping Ecosystems Services to Human well-being‚Äô toolkit, use landscape modelling of alternative scenarios for the riparian buffer to make land-use decisions such as conserving hydrological ecosystem services and meeting national SDG commitments. Variations=Ecoagriculture= In a 2001 article, soon expanded into a book, Scherr and McNeely introduced the term \\"ecoagriculture\\" to describe their vision of rural development while advancing the environment, claim that agriculture is the dominant influence on wild species and habitats, and point to a number of recent and potential future developments they identified as beneficial examples of land use. They incorporated the non-profit EcoAgriculture Partners in 2004 to promote this vision, with Scherr as President and CEO, and McNeely as an independent governing board member. Scherr and McNeely edited a second book in 2007. Ecoagriculture had three elements in 2003. =Integrated landscape management= In 2012 Scherr invented a new term, integrated landscape management, to describe her ideas for developing entire regions, not at just a farm or plot level. Integrated landscape management is a way of managing sustainable landscapes by bringing together multiple stakeholders with different land use objectives. The integrated approach claims to go beyond other approaches which focus on users of the land independently of each other, despite needing some of the same resources. It is promoted by the conservation NGOs Worldwide Fund for Nature, Global Canopy Programme, The Nature Conservancy, The Sustainable Trade Initiative, and EcoAgriculture Partners. Promoters claim that integrated landscape management will maximise collaboration in planning, policy development and action regarding the interdependent Sustainable Development Goals. It was defined by four elements in 2013: # Large scale: It plans land uses at the landscape scale. Wildlife population dynamics and watershed functions can only be understood at the landscape scale. Assuming short-term trade-offs may lead to long-term synergies, conducting analyses over long time periods is advocated. # Emphasis on synergies: It tries to exploit \\"synergies\\" among conservation, agricultural production, and rural livelihoods. # Emphasis on collaboration: It can not be achieved by individuals. The management of landscapes require different land managers with different environmental and socio-economic goals to achieve conservation, production, and livelihood goals at a landscape scale. # Importance of both conservation and agricultural production: bringing conservation into the agricultural and rural development discourse by highlighting the importance of ecosystem services in supporting agricultural production. It supports conservationists to more effectively conserve nature within and outside protected areas by working with the agricultural community by developing conservation-friendly livelihoods for rural land users. By 2016 it had five elements, namely: # stakeholders come together for cooperative dialogue and action; # they exchange information systematically and discuss perspectives to achieve a shared understanding of the landscape conditions, challenges and opportunities; # collaborative planning to develop an agreed action plan; # implementation of the plan; # monitoring and dialogue to adapt management. =Ecosystem approach= The ecosystem approach, promoted by the Convention on Biological Diversity, is a strategy for the integrated management of land, water and living resources for conservation and sustainability. =Ten Principles= This approach includes continual learning and adaptive management: including monitoring, the expectation that actions take place at multiple scales and that landscapes are multifunctional (e.g. supplying both goods, such as timber and food, and services, such as water and biodiversity protection). There are multiple stakeholders, and it assumes they have a common concern about the landscape, negotiate change with each other, and their rights and responsibilities are clear or will become clear. Criticisms A literature review identified five main barriers, as follows: # Terminology confusion: the variety of definitions creates confusion and resistance to engage. This resistance has emerged, often independently, from different fields. As stated by Scherr et al.: ‚ÄúPeople are talking about the same thing ... This can lead to fragmentation of knowledge, unnecessary re- invention of ideas and practices, and inability to mobilize action at scale. ... this rich diversity is often simply overwhelming: they receive confusing messages‚Äù This problem is not unique to landscape approaches: since the 1970s it has been recognised that the constant emergence of new terminology can be harmful if they promote rhetoric at the expense of action. Because landscapes approaches develop from, and aim to integrate, a wide variety of sectors, makes it vulnerable to overlapping definitions and parallel concepts. Like other approaches to conservation, it may be a fad. # Time lags: substantial time and resources are invested in developing and planning, while resources are inadequate for implementation. # Operating silos: Each sector pursues its goals without giving consideration to the others. This may arise because of a lack in established objectives, operating norms and funding that effectively bridge different sectors. Working across sectors at the landscape scale requires a range of skills, different from those traditionally used by conservation organisations. # Engagement: Stakeholders may not desire to be engaged in the process, engagement may be trivial or inaccessible, and the discussions may hinder efficient decision-making. # Monitoring: There is lack of monitoring to check whether the objectives have been achieved.

He was both prominent among the Fante people and influential among Europeans concerned with the transatlantic slave trade. Ansah was born c. 1736 in Annamaboe, the then largest slave-trading port on the Gold Coast (modern-day Ghana). His father, John Corrente, was the head of Annamaboe's government, and chief caboceer (one of the local officials responsible for supplying African slaves to European traders), and an important ally for anyone living or trading in the city. Accordingly, Ansah and his family were of interest to the many European polities competing for access to Annamaboe's abundant trade. After sending Ansah's brother to France, John Corrente sent Ansah to England to gain an education, curry favour with the English, and serve as his eyes and ears in Europe. The ship captain entrusted with Ansah's transport, however, dishonorably sold him into slavery in Barbados before reaching England. Years later, a free Fante trader discovered Ansah in Barbados and quickly alerted John Corrente of his son's fate. Corrente petitioned the British to free Ansah, and the Royal African Company, the English joint-stock company operating the slave trade, liberated Ansah and transported him to England. In England, Ansah was received as a prince and gained the respect of London's high society. Most notably, he watched a live performance of Oroonoko, and, much to the audience's surprise, fled the theatre in tears. The play depicted a wrongly enslaved African prince who likely reminded Ansah much of himself. Upon returning to Annamaboe, Ansah took up work as a writer at Cape Coast Castle, the primary British fortification on the Gold Coast. After leaving Cape Coast on bad terms, Ansah worked as a slave trader. The details of his death are unknown. Early life in Annamaboe This is a map created in 1736 by Europeans. It depicts many major trading ports. A sketch of Fort William in Annamaboe Ansah was born in Annamaboe, modern-day Anomabu, Ghana c. 1736. His father, John Corrente, was the head of the local government and an influential man. Annamaboe represented a major interest for European traders including the Dutch, Portuguese, Swedish, Danish, English, and French on the West African coast. In fact, Annamaboe was the largest slave trading port on the Gold Coast of Africa. By Ansah's birth, however, the primary competitors for trade with the people of Annamaboe were the French and English. While other commodities were traded in Annmaboe, the primary trade was in slaves. Still, the Fante people of Annamaboe rarely sold each other into slavery; the vast majority of slaves sold in Annamaboe were acquired by the Fante people from the African interior. It was governed by a small group of wise men known as caboceers, one of whom was deemed Braffo or chief caboceer, the role John Corrente filled. While the Europeans in Annamaboe were largely respected, the power undeniably rested in the hands of the African caboceers. Still, the English exercised some control over the locals through their Fort William, and the French through their naval warships. John Corrente sent one of Ansah's brothers to France in the early 1740s, and that brother returned to Annamaboe with a European education and extensive knowledge of France. Corrente's strengthening relationship with France, however, worried the English traders in Annamaboe. In turn, the England's Royal African Company offered to host another of Corrente's sons. Corrente, eager to play England and France off of each other for Annamaboe's benefit, quickly agreed to send Ansah. As a child, Ansah had spent extensive time in Fort William and, in the process, gained fluency in English and an appreciation for the nation's culture and traditions. Accordingly, Corrente chose to send him to England as soon as possible with Captain David Bruce Crichton aboard the Lady Carolina. Enslavement Captain David Bruce Crichton, however, betrayed Ansah's trust and sold him into slavery in Bridgetown, Barbados. John Corrente and the Fante people fell out of contact with Ansah and presumed him dead.Barker, Anthony J. The African Link: British Attitudes to the Negro in the Era of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1550‚Äì1807. London, UK: Frank Cass and Company, 1978. In William Dodd's popular \\"The African Prince, Now in England, to Zara at his Father's Court,\\" Ansah claimed \\"The shouted prince is now a slave unknown.\\"Dodd, William. \\"The African prince, now in England, to Zara at his father's court\\", The Gentleman's Magazine, July 1749, 323‚Äì25. Accessed 7 December 2015. Ansah claimed that \\"in groans, not sleep, [he] pass'd the weary night, and rose to labour with morning light.\\" Still, as John Corrente's son, Ansah was well known by the Fante people, and he was discovered by a Fante trader doing business in Barbados. Once the trader relayed news of Ansah's enslavement to Corrente, Corrente insisted that the British free Ansah and carry him the rest of the way to England. English trade had, during Ansah's enslavement, been suffering in Annamaboe as Corrente blamed the nation for his son's presumed death. Not surprisingly then, the English were quick to jump on the opportunity to return to Corrente's good graces. They liberated Ansah from slavery and transported him to England where he was received as a \\"The Prince of Annamaboe\\" Time in England Ansah was received in England in 1748 as Prince William Ansah Sessarakoo or The Royal African. Under the protection of George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax, President of the Board of Trade, Ansah \\"received privileged treatment in Britain... for political and economic reasons.\\"Barker, Anthony J. The African Link: British Attitudes to the Negro in the Era of the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1550‚Äì1807. London, UK: Frank Cass and Company, 1978. In fact, there exist many reports of his \\"frequent appearances in London society.\\" Most notably, he attended a showing of Oroonoko, a play depicting the wrongful enslavement of an African prince and his wife by Europeans.Brown, Laura. Fables of Modernity: Literature and Culture in the English Eighteenth Century. Ithaca, NY: Cornell Press, 2001. Digital file. The African prince, Oronooko, and his wife, Imoinda, are sold into slavery and transported to the West Indies where they are forced to work long hours alongside lowly slaves. When Imoinda becomes pregnant, Oroonoko stages a slave rebellion. The rebellion ends poorly, however, and Oroonoko is forced to kill Imoinda and is himself publicly executed. Given his kidnapping, Ansah likely related to Oroonoko on a very basic level. In William Dodd's \\"The African Prince, Now in England, to Zara at his Father's Court,\\" Ansah claims: \\"I can't recall the scene, 'tis pain too great\\" when referring to Oroonoko. Regardless, Ansah succeeded in garnering respect for himself and his people as civilized individuals; many were impressed by his manners and graciousness. Ansah's visit to England was never meant to be permanent, so he returned home to his father and the Fante people in 1750. He returned \\"elaborately dressed in the latest style befitting his station\\" with an English education and immense understanding of English culture. Furthermore, in \\"Zara, at the Court of Annamaboe, to the African Prince, When in England,\\" Dodd's accompanying poem, Ansah's lover repeatedly refers to London as \\"Britain's happy shore\\" and thereby suggests that the Fante people and especially Ansah viewed England positively, especially after Ansah's sojourn there. Later life in Annamaboe Cape Coast Slave Castle When Ansah left England, he also left the fairytale life of a European prince. In Annamaboe, the elite certainly had many privileges, but the extravagance found in Europe was simply not present. After only a year back in Africa, he began work as a writer at Cape Coast Castle, the seat of British power on the Gold Coast some ten miles Southwest of Annamaboe. Employing both his position at Cape Coast Castle and powerful connections in London, Ansah worked with his father, John Corrente, to play the British and French off each other in Annamaboe. By pledging allegiance to neither of the two powers, Annamaboe forced both Britain and France to offer competitive trade offers and regular tributes to remain in good standing. Additionally, Ansah is known to have personally accepted lavish gifts of whiskey from the British that were meant for the greater Fante people. In 1761, however, Ansah became infuriated that William Mutter, governor of Cape Coast Castle, had paid him in watered down whiskey. When he confronted Mutter, the argument developed into a physical altercation, and Ansah was banned from Cape Coast Castle. Mutter went on to claim Ansah was \\"not a person of Consequence in [Annamaboe].\\" Indeed, while Ansah was John Corrente's son, he was not Corrente's heir. No longer in good favour with the British, Ansah spent the rest of his life in Annamaboe. Records exist of him acting as a slave trader during this time, but his activities are relatively unknown. He lived his final days and passed away in relative anonymity, at least from the European perspective that is. As such, the date of his death is unknown. It can none the less be estimated based upon the date of his dismissal from Cape Coast Castle and later trade records that he died c.1770. Impacts on European perceptions of Africans Ansah serves as an important precursor to the mainstream 18th century abolitionist movement in Britain. His time in England as \\"The Royal African\\" set precedence that some Africans were above slavery and comparable to British nobility. Furthermore, his visit forced London society to acknowledge the complex government and society in place in Annamaboe and presumably many other African cities. In Ansah‚Äôs memoirs, the author wrote ‚Äúgood sense is the companion of all Complexions,‚Äù and thereby suggested an inherent equality among those of various races. By establishing this, Ansah‚Äôs presence in England contradicted the principle of race-based slavery. Instead, justifications for slavery then rested on the alleged crimes committed by slaves that had led to their enslavement. Ansah himself, as a man economically and politically invested in the slave trade, did not challenge the morality of the slave trade, but his very existence in London subverted the idea Africans could be enslaved for no reason. In fact, he is said to have had \\"a proper Oroonoko-like contempt for the rabble of ordinary slaves\\".Sypher, Wylie. Guinea's Captive Kings: British Anti-Slavery Literature of the XVIIIth Century. New York, NY: Octagon Books, 1969. Additionally, his lover, in Dodd‚Äôs poem, refers to the slave populace as \\"a barb‚Äôrous jest\\".Dodd, William. \\"ZARA, at the Court of Annamaboe, to the African Prince, now in England.\\" The Gentleman's Magazine, August 1749, 372‚Äì73. Accessed 7 December 2015. Clearly, he was no ally to those already enslaved. While Ansah, as a slave trader himself, did not campaign against the slave trade, his presence in England served to break down the idea that Africans were inherently lesser than Europeans. Additionally, while Ansah‚Äôs contribution to this change in thought was significant, he was just one of \\"Several African princes... educated in England\\" who all contributed.

He is capable of playing at both defensive midfield, and winger. Previous clubs include Blackburn Rovers, Bolton, Carlisle and Gretna over a 10-year professional career. Career Ryan Baldacchino began his footballing career at Blackburn Rovers in 1996 as a promising winger capable of playing on either wing. With Blackburn, he went on to win the U17 Premier League and reach the FA Youth Cup final, playing in front of a 25,000-strong crowd against an Everton team featuring future Premiership footballers Leon Osman, Francis Jeffers, Richard Dunne and Michael Ball. Baldacchino went on to become a reserve team regular in forthcoming seasons and was rewarded with a four-year professional contract, but was transferred to Blackburn's local rivals Bolton Wanderers in March 2000 as comparisons to his former Blackburn teammates Damien Duff and David Dunn were made by his new manager Sam Allardyce and assistant manager Phil Brown. He was awarded squad number 33. With pace to burn and accurate crossing ability Baldacchino soon showed his potential in Bolton's reserve side and in pre-season games for the first team. However, the signings of Jay- Jay Okocha and Youri Djorkaeff hindered his chances of making a first-team breakthrough and he left Bolton after only 18 months, signing with Carlisle United on a three-year deal. Baldacchino was an instant hit with the club with an outstanding display of pace and trickery to help defeat Southend United away in his first match. Baldacchino was a regular for Carlisle before being prised away by Brooks Mileson and the spending power of Scottish club Gretna. Gretna, with their newfound wealth, won Scottish Third, Second and First Division titles in consecutive seasons, with Baldacchino one of the club's star players; he and Gretna teammates Kenny Deuchar, Gavin Skelton and Chris Innes gained the prestigious accolade of being the only four players in 100 years of Scottish football history to play in all Scottish football divisions with the same team. Baldacchino's time with Gretna saw him win countless man of the match award, the goal of the season award and even score a goal in the UEFA Cup. An impressive display against Dunfermline Athletic in the Scottish Cup in front of then-Celtic manager Gordon Strachan earned Baldacchino rave reviews, Hibs, Motherwell and Celtic all had regular checks on Baldacchino. Brooks Mileson once again showed his spending power and ambition by keeping hold of Baldacchino and he signed a new improved four-year deal in December 2005 making him one of the club's top earners. Gretna arrived in style to the SPL breaking all records on their way and many players staying loyal to Gretna turning away potential big money moves on the way. The season 2007‚Äì08 was to be Gretna's last year as a club as they bowed out at the top when owner Brooks Mileson took ill in late February. Baldacchino was given squad number 7 and played against Rangers and Celtic that season as Gretna struggled to cope with life in the top flight. They were relegated at the end of the season. Baldacchino transferred to VPL club Altona Magic in May 2008 and one year later he signed for New South Wales Premier League outfit Bonnyrigg White Eagles. Before moving to Forest Hill Milford United on a free transfer, and Hume City also a free transfer. He claims that he currently wants to play in the Maltese Premier League and wants to represent Malta.

The bishop of Frascati is a Cardinal Bishop; from the Latin name of the area, the bishop has also been called Bishop of Tusculum. Tusculum was destroyed in 1191. The bishopric moved from Tusculum to Frascati, a nearby town which is first mentioned in the pontificate of Pope Leo IV.L. Duchesne, Le Liber Pontificalis Vol. II, part 1, p. 136, note 36. Until 1962, the Cardinal-Bishop was concurrently the diocesan bishop of the see in addition to any curial duties he possessed. Pope John XXIII removed the Cardinal Bishops from any actual responsibility in their suburbicarian dioceses, and made the title purely honorific. Relationships during the 17th century Like other dioceses close to Rome, Frascati became a bishopric of choice for Cardinals of powerful papal families during the 17th century; a period known for its unabashed nepotism.

He was the leading photographer during five major wars, and was the driving force behind Collier's becoming a large circulation magazine. Among other conflicts he covered, he photographed the Mexican Revolution (1910-20).Debroise, Olivier. Mexican Suite: A History of Photography in Mexico. Austin: University of Texas Press 2001, pp. 177-78.  Early life  Hare was born in London to George Hare, who, after a successful cabinet making business, becomes a successful camera manufacturer. Hare attended St. John's College in London. He voluntarily left after one year and became an apprentice in his fathers camera shop. In 1879, Hare and his father have a disagreement when he told his father that they should begin making smaller hand-held cameras, which were just becoming technologically feasible. Hare left his father's business to work for another London firm. On 2 August that year Hare married Ellen Crapper with whom he had five children.  Career  During the early 1880s Hare began to lose interest in camera manufacturing. He took up free-lance photography as a hobby and sold his work to various London journals. In 1889, Hare became a technical adviser for E.& H.T. Anthony & Co., moving from London to Brooklyn, New York, where he lived for the rest of his life. He worked for a while as a free-lance photographer and in 1895, he became a full-time photographer for Illustrated American magazine. On 15 February 1898, one month after a fire destroyed the Illustrated American headquarters, Hare presented himself at the office of Collier's Weekly proposing to photograph the wreckage of the battleship Maine, and life in Spanish Cuba. This was his first major job. He then captured images of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (1898), which Collier's used to build support up for the controversial conflict. His intimate wartime photography was often cited as the reason Collier's circulation increased momentously. Other reporters with whom he worked at this time included Sylvester Scovel, Stephen Crane, and Richard Harding Davis. After the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Hare photographed four more wars: the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 and 1905, the Mexican Revolution in 1911 and 1914, the First Balkan War in 1912 and 1913, and World War I. He became known as the man who made the Russo-Japanese conflict famous, and was adored by his peers and contemporaries. In 1914, he learned that Collier's, his longtime employer, would not be sending him to Europe to cover World War I, so he contacted Leslie's Weekly to offer his services. He was hired by them and sent to England. Writers and photographers were often limited in their access to war fronts and had their writings and photos censored, but Hare was nevertheless a tirelessly tenacious photographer. During World War I he documented American, British, Canadian, and Italian soldiers, St Dunstan's home for blind soldiers, the Greek harbour town of Thessaloniki, the military hospital at the Hall of Mechanics at the Grand Palais in Paris, people fleeing Antwerp, funerals of the dead from the RMS Lusitania, and the American Ambulance Hospital at Neuilly-sur-Seine, among other subjects. Other than photographing war, he took many notable photographs of aircraft evolution and early aviators, including the first photo by a journalist of an aircraft in flight in the US‚Äîthe Wright Flyer III at the Kill Devil Hills in North Carolina in May 1908. (The Wright brothers had flown in 1903 but were wary of flying in front of spectators and reporters and Alberto Santos-Dumont had flown in public in 1906 in France.) He also documented American presidents, Boy Scouts, Haiti and other Latin American locations, and religious and archaeological sites in the Middle East. Hare was profiled by The American Magazine in 1913 among its \\"interesting people\\", citing \\"the ability to catch the dramatic elements in the event he is picturing.\\" After 1922 Hare did little photography but lectured regularly. In 1929, Hare retired. In 1939, he was made the honorary president of the Overseas Press Club. On 24 June 1946, he died while staying with one of his daughters in Teaneck, New Jersey. Hare's collection of negatives, prints, and lantern slides are at the Harry Ransom Center, at the University of Texas at Austin.

He was High Sheriff of Essex and of Hertfordshire in the years 1265‚Äì67, and as such became involved in the Second Barons' War (1264‚Äì1267). Southchurch has earned a special place in the historiography of the period due to an episode during the war where he allegedly planned to attack London with incendiary cocks.  Biography  The position of Southend- on-Sea ‚Äì with Southchurch ‚Äì in England. Little is known of Southchurch's background, but his family came from the manor of Southchurch, now part of Southend-on-Sea. Richard de Southchurch held this manor of the Prior and Convent of Christ's Church, Canterbury. He also held other land in the county of Essex, including Prittlewell, which he held in fee of the king. He served as sheriff of the combined shrievalties of Essex and Hertfordshire from 27 October 1265 to 12 June 1267. In 1279, he received a pardon and was acquitted of a fine of 100 shilling for being present at the theft of a hart at the king's forest of Chelmsford. In 1289 he was also acquitted of the great sum of 1000 pounds for perjury, in return for releasing the manor of Hatfield Peverel to the king. Southchurch was dead by 2 April 1294, when the escheator was ordered to deliver his lands to his son and heir, Peter de Southchurch.  Involvement in Barons' War  In the mid-1260s, England found herself in a state of civil war between king Henry III and members of his aristocracy, a conflict known as the Second Barons' War. In April 1267, Gilbert de Clare entered London with the baronial forces. The city welcomed him, and king Henry III had to set up camp at Stratford, besieging the capital. Orders were sent out to the sheriffs of Kent and Essex to procure supplies for the royal army.Cam (1930), p. 101; Powicke, p. 543. It was in this situation that Southchurch, in his capacity as sheriff, levied requisitions on Chafford Hundred of; > ...oats and wheat, of bacon, beef, cheese and pease, 'pur sustenir le ost au > Rey'; of chickens to feed the wounded and tow and eggs to make dressings for > their wounds and linen for bandages, of chord to make ropes for the > catapults, of picks and calthrops and spades to lay low the walls of London, > and finally of cocks, forty and more, to whose feet he declared he would tie > fire, and send them flying into London to burn it down.Cam, (1921), p. 175. > In the original Latin: \\"XL gallos ad portendum ingnem ad incendendum > civitatem Londomarium\\", Cam (1916), p. 98. The story survives through the Hundred Rolls, the great survey of the English hundreds made by Edward I, in 1274-5, on returning to his new kingdom from crusade. The scheme, impractical as it might seem, was supposedly based on contemporary sagas of Viking heroes. But the complaints of the local community were based on the fact that Southchurch had taken all the supplies home to his own manor of Southchurch, received 200 marks from the exchequer, yet never paid out any of what the owners of the goods were entitled to.Cam, (1930), p. 102. Historical transmission The account of Southchurch's provisioning was first made available to a wider audience through the writings of the English historian Helen Cam. Cam was responsible for groundbreaking work on the Hundred Rolls, and their relevance to English local government, through her Studies in the Hundred Rolls (1921) and The Hundred and the Hundred Rolls (1930).Cam, (1921; 1930). In both of these she made mention of what she calls '...the most picturesque series of extortions recorded in the Essex returns.' It was, however, in a paper published in the English Historical Review as early as 1916 that she gave the most detailed account of Southchurch's plot. Here she traced the dissemination of the Viking legend through Geoffrey of Monmouth, and speculated that Southchurch could have been acquainted with a later version by Gaimar, Wace or Layamon, or through a local, popular legend.Cam, (1916). Cam here also points out that, while the original legends featured sparrows, cocks would probably lack the homing instinct necessary for the plan to work. The story was later retold by Sir Maurice Powicke in his King Henry III and the Lord Edward (1947).Powicke, p. 544. Yet even though both Cam and Powicke had included the tale as a humorous anecdote, it was not until Michael Prestwich wrote his monograph of Edward I in 1988 that anyone considered the possibility that the story of the incendiary roosters was simply a 'confidence trick' on Southchurch's part.Prestwich, p. 58. Powicke, in Prestwich's words; 'is to be counted among those who fell for the sheriff's ruse.'Prestwich, p. 59; see also ibid., p. 95.

As of February 2013, it had grown to be the \\"second-largest baking company in the United States\\". Flowers Foods has two operating segments: The Direct Store Delivery (DSD) and the Warehouse. The DSD Segment handles fresh bread, buns, rolls, and snack cakes that are sold regionally through a network of independent distributors. The company is continually expanding its market reach through acquisitions and by stretching its current territory.

History Main bakery in Thomasville, Georgia In 1919, brothers William Howard and Joseph Hampton Flowers opened Flowers Baking Company in Thomasville, Georgia. They made their first acquisition, of Tally Maid bakery, in 1937, and in 1942, became the sixth bakery in the U.S. to franchise Quality Bakers of America‚Äôs Sunbeam brand and Little Miss Sunbeam for its white bread. After acquiring bakeries in Florida, Alabama, and Georgia in the mid-to-late 1960s, the company in 1968 made an initial public offering, changed its name to Flowers Industries and began trading over-the-counter. Less than a year later, Flowers was listed on the American Stock Exchange. In 1982, the company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FLO, and the following year was listed for the first time on the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S. Industrial corporations, at number 470. In 1996, Flowers acquired both the Keebler Company and Mrs. Smith's Pies. In 2001, Flowers sold its investment in Keebler to the Kellogg Company; its remaining business units, Flowers Bakeries and Mrs. Smith's Bakeries, were then spun off into a new company called Flowers Foods. Acquisitions As Flowers Foods, the company has continued acquiring bakeries and other food companies. even as it sold some others. In late 2002, it purchased Ideal Baking Company, and bought Bishop Baking Company from Kellogg Company, giving the company a presence in north Arkansas, southern Missouri, and parts of Tennessee including Memphis. In 2003, Flowers sold its Mrs. Smith's frozen dessert business to the Schwan Food Company. Royal Cake Company was purchased in September 2005, and Flowers continued to operate the bakery in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. In February 2006, Flowers acquired Derst Baking Co. of Savannah, Georgia, though it continued to operate under its name as part of Flowers Foods Bakeries Group. In 2008, Flowers acquired both ButterKrust Bakery in Lakeland, Florida, and Holsum Bakery in Phoenix. The following year, the company purchased Leo's Foods, which makes tortillas. Acquisitions continued in the second decade of the 21st century. Philadelphia-based snack cake baker Tastykake was acquired in 2011, expanding the company's markets into the mid-Atlantic region, and in 2012 it purchased Lepage Bakeries in Maine and acquired assets and licenses from Bimbo Bakeries for Sara Lee and Earthgrains brands in California and Oklahoma City. The company purchased most of the bread brands of Hostess Brands, including Wonder Bread, plus 20 closed Hostess bakeries, in 2013. Three further bread acquisitions were made In 2015. Flowers Foods purchased Dave's Killer Bread of Milwaukie, Oregon, for $275 million in cash; bought Alpine Valley Bread Co., an organic bakery in Mesa, Arizona; and purchased the North American rights to the Roman Meal trademark for bread, buns, and rolls. At the end of 2018, Flowers Foods bought Canyon Bakehouse, a privately held gluten-free bread company based in Johnstown, Colorado. Including the Canyon Bakehouse purchase, at that point the company had acquired 16 companies since 2003.

It is performed by having the patient (or a colleague) push their hands down on the midline of the abdomen. The examiner then taps one flank, while feeling on the other flank for the tap. The pressure on the midline prevents vibrations through the abdominal wall while the fluid allows the tap to be felt on the other side.

Sir Michael Herbert (1857‚Äì1903), the British Ambassador to the United States from 1902 to 1903 during the presidency of Theodore Roosevelt.

(ARTC) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to preserving, promoting, performing, and educating people about the art of audio theatre (radio drama). Activities ARTC performs live audio drama at a wide variety of events, often with a very specific focus on Science Fiction, Horror or Fantasy. They have been performing roughly 24 years, and have performed at such notable venues as DragonCon, Mythic Journeys, Stone Mountain, and the World Fantasy Convention. Some of their more noteworthy adaptations include several works by H. P. Lovecraft including The Call of Cthulhu, The Dunwich Horror, and At the Mountains of Madness. They have also performed adaptations of works by H. G. Wells including The Invisible Man, The Island of Dr. Moreau, and The Time Machine. However, several authors who do not have work in the public domain have also given permission either personally or through their estate, including Robert A. Heinlein for adaptations of All You Zombies, The Man Who Traveled in Elephants and The Menace From Earth; Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman for an adaptation of Lord Durndrun's Party; Henry Lee Forest's Special Order and James P. Hogan's Zap Thy Neighbor. Over the years, various members of ARTC have participated in or taught classes for various workshops, including the MidWest Radio Theatre Workshop and its successor organization National Audio Theatre Festival, The Himan Brown Workshop at the University of Georgia, and in Macon and Cartersville, Georgia. Their writers continue to teach radio drama writing at science fiction conventions around the country. History A brief overview of the history of the Atlanta Radio Theatre Company. =Founding (1984-1992)= ARTC was founded in 1984 by radio personality William L. Brown and actor/director Patrick Stansbury. They procured underwriting from a local bank to sponsor a weekly, one-hour program on WGST-AM. The first shows were produced in Brown's home studio. Atlanta playwright Thomas E. Fuller was enlisted as principal writer, and numerous actors from the local theatrical community were cast in the productions. Soon Henry Howard, owner of Audio Craft, made his facility available to ARTC and came on board as a producer. ARTC produced a full 13-week schedule for WGST in summer of 1984. That fall ARTC moved to WABE-FM, the local Public Radio station, and ran a full season of thirteen shows. Then the next year they produced the SouthernAire Workshop for Peach State Public Radio (now Georgia Public Broadcasting. Most of the shows were performed \\"live\\" or \\"live-on-tape\\" in-studio. In the summer of 1987 ARTC began performing live at science fiction conventions. Their first live performance was at the first DragonCon. The play was H. P. Lovecraft's \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" as adapted by Gerald W. Page. Also in 1987 ARTC introduced the Centauri Express Audio Magazine‚Äîthe first audio magazine. It ran for five issues and contained plays, reviews of other audio products, and news of interest to the SF audience. Centauri Express was funded with a grant from the 1986 World Science Fiction Convention, ConFederation, held in Atlanta. =Explosion (1992-2002)= Under Fuller's leadership, ARTC established a troupe of professional and semi-professional actors, writers, directors, and technicians, to create live and in-studio productions of audio drama. In 1993 and 1994, they began performing monthly at a coffee house in the Little Five Points district in Atlanta. This theater experience allowed for the development of new writers, gave the actors more radio experience, and allowed for experimentation with new formats and styles. These coffee house shows created many new stand-alone plays as well as radio series in the style of the programs from the golden age of radio. After the coffee house closed, the live performance troupe continued to find venues for live audio theatre. They performed at a few live music venues, the Decatur Arts Festival, Callanwolde, and several libraries and bookstores. They also expanded the number of science fiction conventions at which they performed. Even during this period ARTC continued to create in-studio audio drama on cassette tape and eventually CDs. Their 1996 production of H.G. Wells' The Island of Doctor Moreau won a silver Mark Time award for excellence in science fiction audio drama. It was the first of several awards from the Mark-Time award committee to the Atlanta Radio Theatre Company. In 1995, ARTC's first web page was posted. For several years during this period ARTC performed live every Halloween night on Peach State Public Radio - performing and broadcasting from one of the Georgia Public Television studios. Starting in 1996 with permission from Mrs. Virginia Heinlein to adapt her husband's The Menace from Earth into an audio play, the company has continued to negotiate with contemporary writers for permission to create adaptations of their work. Among the writers whose work has been adapted by ARTC are: Robert A. Heinlein, James P. Hogan, Brad Linaweaver, Gerald W. Page, John Ringo, Brad Strickland, and Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. =Post-Fuller (2002-present)= In November 2002 Fuller died from a heart attack. The Atlanta Radio Theatre Company had lost its leader, its head writer, and its voice. ARTC attracted new writers, new actors, and new leaders. It continued to expand the number of places where it performed and new productions. ARTC continued to perform at many science fiction conventions. Additionally it began searching for a permanent stage home for regular performances. From 2002 through 2003 it mounted several productions at Stone Mountain Park. Then in 2006 it began a full theatrical season at Stage Door Players in Dunwoody, Georgia. In 2009 it moved its theatrical home to the Academy Theatre in Avondale Estates, Georgia. In August 2006, ARTC began to podcast programming gathered from previous live performances. The podcasts include new material, old fan favorites, and rare performances.

He is known for his science writingshttp://www.jeffhawkeclub.com/cv_pubwork.pdf as well as for his work on the Sighthill stone circle. His 1970s report of a possible space probe orbiting around the Moon sent by the inhabitants of a planet orbiting Epsilon Bo√∂tis\\"Spaceprobe from Epsilon Bootes\\" by Duncan Lunan, in \\"Spaceflight\\" (British Interplanetary Society), 1973 brought him to international notice. Background Lunan, who grew up in Troon, claims descent from an illegitimate son of King Robert II of Scotland, Alexander Stuart, who owned the \\"Lands of Lunaine\\" near Aberdeen, and, more distantly, from the astronomers of ancient Chaldea \\"who invented the calendar, hence making agriculture and civilisation possible\\". On his mother's side, he traces his ancestry back to the Mitochondrial Eve. In June 1959 he traveled to South Uist in the Hebrides to witness the test launch of an American MGM-5 Corporal, which the British Army had purchased as the nation's first nuclear missile. The 13-year-old student watched the launch with senior NATO military leaders, but at home he was interrogated by the Scottish Office, MI5, Army Intelligence, and the CIA to attempt to determine how he had entered the secret launch site, which the Soviets had put under surveillance. Lunan was a founder of ASTRA. He is a 1968 bachelor's degree alumnus of the University of Glasgow, is an M.A. with Honours in English and Philosophy and has a postgraduate Diploma in Education. He was the Manager of the Glasgow Parks Department's Astronomy Project responsible for building the Sighthill stone circle, the first astronomically aligned megalith built in Britain in 3,000 years.Geoff Holder, \\"The Guide to Mysterious Glasgow\\" ‚Äì The History Press Ltd.,, published 2 February 2009) Lunan was also a founder and is still a member of the Glasgow Science Fiction Writers' Circle. He has also served with committee activities on the Argyle Local Housing Association, which is linked to the GHA, including serving as chairman from 2002 to 2006. Despite his 1970s report of a possible space probe of extraterrestrial origins orbiting around the Moon, he insists that he \\"doesn't believe in UFOs\\". His interests include \\"ancient and mediaeval history, jazz, folk music and hillwalking\\". Alien message In a 1973 article in Spaceflight, a magazine published by the British Interplanetary Society (BIS), he said he had identified and deciphered a hidden radio message sent by an alien space probe that had been caught but overlooked in the late 1920s by a collaboration of Norwegian and Dutch researchers who were studying the long delayed echo effect. Published along with an accompanying editorial disclaimer, Lunan maintained that the putative message came from an object at the L5 point in the same orbit as the Moon, sent by the inhabitants of a planet orbiting Epsilon Bo√∂tis. He came to the conclusion that the message was, \\"Start here. Our home is Upsilon Bootes, which is a double star. We live on the sixth planet of seven, coming from the sun, which is the larger of the two. Our sixth planet has one moon. Our fourth planet has three. Our first and third planets each have one. Our probe is in the position of Arcturus, known in our maps.\\"Sabrina P. Ramet. UFOs over Russia and Eastern Europe The claim was reported in Time and the CBS Evening News. It was included in Rod Serling's 1975 TV documentary In Search of Ancient Mysteries and, many years later, on George Noory's Coast to Coast AM radio show. The alleged message has been refuted and in 1976 Lunan withdrew the theory, presenting proofs against it and clarifying what had led him to formulate it.Journal of the Society of Electronic and Radio Technicians, v10 No. 8, September 1976: \\"Long-Delayed Echoes and the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis\\" However, in 1998 he re-interpreted part of it, claiming support from positional astronomy.Analog Science Fiction and Fact, v118 No. 3, March 1998; \\"Epsilon Bo√∂tis Revisited\\" by Duncan Lunan The theory was part of the inspiration of Mark Brandis' 1974 novel Raumsonde Epsilon (in English Spaceprobe Epsilon). Professional associations=Astronomy= He joined the Scottish branch of the BIS (British Interplanetary Society) in 1962. He was on the committee which drew up the Constitution of ASTRA (Association in Scotland to Research into Astronautics) as an independent society in 1963, and redrafted it as the \\"Memorandum and Articles of a Company Limited by Guarantee\\" in 1974. He has been a Council member since December 1963 with only two short breaks, and has been Treasurer, President, Vice-President, Treasurer, President, Secretary, President, Treasurer and Secretary again during that time. He was re-elected Vice President in May 2010. He has been exhibition organiser and on the publications committee since 1970, editing ASTRA's publications in 1982 and between 1992 and 1996. Among many ASTRA conferences he organised one on archaeoastronomy at the Third Eye Centre in 1978 and \\"Heresies in Archaeoastronomy\\" at the Edinburgh International Science Festival in 1996. Lunan and ASTRA have been at the forefront of the proposal of using a waverider for re-entry of spacecraft in the Earth's atmosphere. In 1978‚Äì79 he was Manager of the Glasgow Parks Department's Astronomy Project. He was Acting Curator of Airdrie Public Observatory in 1979‚Äì80 and was Assistant Curator between 1987 and 1997, becoming a curator again in 2002 and continuing to 2008. ASTRA ceased to run the Observatory for North Lanarkshire District Council in May 2009, ceding the running of the Observatory to the Airdrie Astronomical Association (A.A.A). In 2006 and 2007 Lunan ran astronomy education projects funded by the National Lottery's \\"Awards for All\\", with outreach to schools and community groups, followed by a larger project funded by Heritage Lottery for 2007‚Äì2008. His monthly astronomy column \\"The Sky above You\\" has appeared in various newspapers and magazines. He resigned from ASTRA in 2011. He is also an honorary member of the Clydesdale Astronomical Society. He has been a Director of the Space Settlers' Society, a space-politics society founded by Andy Nimmo in 1980. Along with his wife Linda, Duncan Lunan is running the \\"Astronomers of the Future\\" club for beginners who are keen to find out more about astronomy and space, for which he holds regular talks. Duncan and Linda Lunan are in discussions about the possibility of helping create a public observatory on the Falkland Islands, with support from the British Antarctic Survey. =Teaching and tutoring= In 1986, he contributed to the launch of the Glasgow Science Fiction Writers Circle by agreeing to run the first of six science fiction and fantasy short story competitions for the Glasgow Herald and to teach the first of six science fiction writing classes at the Glasgow University's Extra-Mural Department, later the Department of Adult and Continuing Education. He is still an active member of the Circle and took part to its spin-off spoken word project Word Dogs. Sighthill stone circle As Manager of the Glasgow Parks Department's Astronomy Project in 1978‚Äì79, Duncan Lunan supervised the building of the first astronomically aligned stone circle in Britain in 3,000 years in Sighthill Park. The conceptual inspiration for the circle came from Lunan's interest in the works of Professor Alexander Thom and his son Dr. Archie Thom, who promoted the understanding of megalithic astronomy, and the subsequent expansion of their work by Dr. Ewan McKie and Professor Archie Roy. The location of the stone circle, on a low hilltop between tower blocks, the M8 motorway and an incinerator, at a first sight seems hardly ideal. However, Lunan has written that the clear sightline to the sky and a fine view of the city center met the project's objectives. Lunan has written that \\"In later research, I found that summer solstice fairs had been held on the Summerhill, from which the midsummer Sun rises over the true Sighthill, until they were stopped by the church in the 17th century\\". Once he had identified the best location, Lunan organised the transportation of the stones by a helicopter from HMS Gannet. The Moon Stones, being too heavy, had to be transported by specially adapted lorries. The project was not completed due to criticism by the incoming Thatcher government in 1979,Peter Ross: 'Going Full Circle', Scotland on Sunday 13 June 2010 and four stones ‚Äì two of which were intended to mark equinoctial sunrise and sunset, East and West ‚Äì are still lying under a bush in Sighthill park. Lunan is at present campaigning to have the circle renovated and completed, including plans for wheelchair access. The first initiative undertaken to draw attention to the megalith was a summer solstice gathering organised at the site on the evening of 21 June 2010 preceded by a presentation on the circle given by Lunan. Lunan reported \\"positive discussions with Heritage Lottery chiefs in relation to funding for the project, estimated at around 30,000 GBP\\". Lunan presented plans to make the stone circle a key feature of a citywide astronomy map, including the entire Solar System represented on the correct scale within the city limits as first proposed by Gavin Roberts, who was the Arts and Photographic Supervisor on the original Project. If the stone circle represented the Sun, Lunan said, Saturn would be by the River Clyde near the Glasgow Science Centre, Jupiter in the campus of the University of Strathclyde, Uranus on Maryhill Road and Neptune and the dwarf planet Pluto at Cathkin Braes, south of Castlemilk. The history of the stone circle was featured in the BBC Radio Scotland show Out of Doors in January 2011. In 2011, Duncan Lunan and his wife Linda founded the Friends of the Sighthill Stone Circle association.

He also claimed that he can trace the Green Girl's descendants to the present. Taking a lead from Robert Burton's The Anatomy of Melancholy, he suggests that the children were accidentally returned from a settlement of humans established by extraterrestrials on an earthlike world with a trapped synchronous orbit rotation with unusual genetically modified vegetation, which would allegedly explain their unusual skin color. He presented his theory on 9 November 2011 episode of Ground Zero Live conducted by Clyde Lewis. In 2012 Lunan published Children from the Sky, a study of the green children and the documentation related to them, illustrated by Sydney Jordan.

During her modelling career, she was featured in magazines such as Fast Car, Fit For Men, and Nuts and tabloid newspapers such as The Sun, Daily Star, and the Daily Sport. Early life Frampton competed in beauty pageants as a child, winning her first competition at the age of 10 months and going on to win Miss Wyre bathing beauty in Fleetwood at the age of two. She attended a modelling school run by Roz Tranfield in the Aldelphi Hotel, Liverpool and won over 200 trophies, including Miss Llandudno and Junior Miss Wyre when she was 12. She was also triple winner of the Miss Welsh Resort's trophy as well as Miss Millenium 2000. Frampton's aim was to compete for Miss Wales, but at 5 ft 2ins she considered herself too short and stopped entering competitions aged 14. Frampton attended Elfed High School in Buckley.https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/local-news/ex-model-campaigns-help- poor-families-2837173 She passed all her exams and was considering a future in hair and beauty. Modeling career When Frampton was 15, her mother, Corinne Limbert, was working at a sex shop called Private Shop, in Chester. Limbert met glamour models there and thought it might suit her daughter. She showed some of the models photos of Cherry six months before her 16th birthday and they encouraged her to try glamour modeling. Frampton was initially sceptical, calling it \\"seedy\\", but her mother persisted; \\"every day, I bought newspapers featuring topless models. 'They're only boobs,' I said, 'and the girls look amazing.'\\" Eventually, Cherry relented, saying \\"All you do is stand in your knickers and smile\\".https://www.questia.com/article/1G1-118933091/truelife-my- daughter-is-the-next-jordan-corrinne However, Frampton's father cut off contact with her over her choice of career. On the advice of the models her mother knew, Cherry sent some Bikini Shots into the Daily Sport. Shortly after her 16th birthday, she had her first topless shoot in Bolton with photographer Anthony Farnworth. While still 15, Cherry appeared in the Daily Sport, wearing a bikini and posing suggestively with a milkshake, in a countdown to her 16th birthday, when readers would be able to see her topless. She made her topless debut in the Daily Sport tabloid newspaper on 10 August 2003, two months after turning 16.https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/topless-models-life- change-2066093 At the time, she was employed by Buckley Town F.C. soccer club as its team mascot, but club directors dismissed her from the role when her topless pictures started to appear in the national tabloids. The club's chairman said that the club had no problem with Cherry posing in the club's kit, but when Cherry posed topless for a national tabloid and mentioned a connection with the club, and then appeared topless with players in a TV documentary, questions were raised by the Football Association of Wales, which wanted to know how a \\"minor\\" was connected to the club. Gwynn Williams documented the beginning of Frampton's glamour career for an On the Edge documentary that was first broadcast on HTV Wales on 8 January 2004. On 1 May 2004, the Sexual Offences Act 2003 came into effect, which raised the legal permissible age for photography considered indecent in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland from 16 to 18. Frampton was forced to put her topless modelling career on hiatus until she turned 18, as newspapers and magazines decided on legal advice that glamour images could be seen as indecent. She also took the precaution of removing from her website all topless photographs taken before her 18th birthday. As she approached her birthday and prepared to relaunch her glamour career, the media reported that she had insured her breasts for ¬£1 million. After winning the Sunday Sport competition aged 20, Cherry's profile grew and she was soon featured in lads mags such as Fit For Men, and tabloids including The Sun, Daily Star and The Daily Sport. In February 2007, she was named Miss Sunday Sport 2007. On March 18th, a topless Cherry took part in a live web chat.http://bgafd.co.uk/forum/read.php?f=2&i;=106030&t;=106030 In May, the Sunday sport released a perfume based on her smell, Frampton saying \\"Superstars like J Lo, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Jade Goody have all launched their own perfume so I feel honoured that the Sunday Sport has given me a fragrance of my own. I never thought I'd be so lucky as to be the face of perfume...I just hope that everyone enjoys having a sniff of Cherry.\\"https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/sunday-sport-creates-scent- woman/653775 Retirement from modelling In August 2007, at the age of 20, Frampton announced her retirement from glamour modeling, stating that she intended to devote her time to charity work in Africa. In a December 2009 interview, Frampton additionally revealed that she left glamour modeling because she felt pressured to take drugs and to pose for increasingly explicit photographs. She moved home to Wales and attended a hairdressing course at Deeside College before going to work at Aston Hall nursing home, caring for the elderly.

He remains the only Ghanaian Supreme Court judge to have served in the first three Ghanaian republics. Early life Apaloo was born at Woe, a village near Keta in the Volta Region of Ghana, then the Gold Coast. He lost his father when he was 7 years old so an uncle who was a Kadjebi merchant cared for him through school. His secondary education was at Accra Academy in Accra which he completed in 1942. He subsequently read law at the University College, Hull Judicial career Apaloo was called to the English bar in 1950 by the Middle Temple. He later returned to practise law in Ghana. He defended those involved in the Anloga riots following widespread protests against the imposition of taxes by the British colonial administration. After Ghana attained its independence from British colonial rule, he was appointed a High Court Judge in 1960. In 1964, he presided over the treason trials of five persons including three close associates of President Kwame Nkrumah. They were Tawia Adamafio, information minister, Ebenezer Ako-Adjei, foreign minister and Hugh Horatio Cofie Crabbe, secretary of the ruling Convention People's Party. One of the other judges was Edward Akufo-Addo who also later became Chief Justice in 1966 and ceremonial President of Ghana in 1970. The acquittal led to the then president, Nkrumah trying to purge the judiciary. He was appointed to the Court of Appeal in 1966 and to the Supreme Court of Ghana in 1971. Chief Justice of Ghana He was appointed Ghana's Chief Justice in 1977. He was the sixth person to hold this position since Ghana became an independent nation. This was during the era of the military Supreme Military Council of Ghana. On resumption of democratic rule under Hilla Limann in September 1979, the People's National Party government attempted to replace him as incumbent Chief Justice by insisting he be vetted for the office he already occupied. A Ghanaian citizen, Amoako Tuffuor, took the issue to the Supreme Court and the presiding judge, Justice E. N. P. Sowah, who succeeded him on his (Apaloo's) retirement, ruled that Apaloo became Chief Justice in the Third Republic as soon as the 1979 Ghanaian constitution came into force. He served through the third republic of Ghana and continued after the overthrow of the Limann government on 31 December 1981. Due to his independence, the new military government, the Provisional National Defence Council led by Jerry Rawlings also tried to remove him as Nkrumah had tried before but failed in 1983. He retired at the age of 65 years in 1986. Chief Justice of Kenya Kenya had a vacancy for Chief Justice in 1993 with no obvious candidate to fill it so he was appointed as the Chief Justice of Kenya in March 1993. He was noted to be against the death penalty while he was in Kenya. He remained Chief Justice until 1995 when he was succeeded by Abdul Majid Cockar. Other positions He also served on the World Bank Administrative Tribunal from 1990 till 1995. Personal life Apaloo married Georgina Kumasenu in 1953. They had two sons and three daughters.

The University of Sheffield Arts Tower can be seen in the background Terracotta pillars and park gates Statue of Ebenezer Elliot in Weston Park (28 March 2007) Weston Park is a public park with an area of just over 5 hectares in the City of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. It lies immediately west of the City Centre, alongside the Weston Park Museum. It is situated next to the University of Sheffield Library, Geography and Firth Court buildings, and across the road from Sheffield Children's Hospital. Along with Crookes Valley Park and The Ponderosa it is one of the three Crookesmoor parks. History Weston Park was the first municipal park in the city and was developed from the grounds of Weston Hall, which the Sheffield Corporation purchased for ¬£15,750 following the death of its owners, Eliza and Anne Harrison. The hall itself was converted into the Sheffield City Museum.Weston Hall and the Mappin Art Gallery, from Picture Sheffield dot com. Robert Marnock was commissioned to design the park in 1873. New terra cotta pillared entrances were established at Winter Street and Western Bank using designs by Godfrey Sykes. The original lake from Weston Hall was extended and redesigned and the Ebenezer Elliott memorial statue was moved to the park from its original place in Market Place. A memorial to Godfrey Sykes was also erected in 1875 during the construction of the park, consisting of an terra cotta column designed by James Gamble, one of Sykes's pupils. It depicts youth, maturity and old age.Sheffield Hallam University Public Art Archive: Details of Godfrey Sykes memorial. The park was opened to the public on Monday 6 September 1875 with the following day's Sheffield Daily Telegraph reporting: \\"The weather was fine. The Park looked in its gayest Summer dress. The walks were freshly gravelled, the flower beds were trim and well ordered.\\" In 1882 the Weston Park Weather Station was erected privately by the curator of the adjacent museum; it is the official climatological station for Sheffield and since 1937 it has been run by the museum's staff. It is one of the oldest weather stations in the country and all records are freely available via computer database or printed media.Museums Sheffield website: Details of weather station. In 1895 the South West gates were erected on Western Bank close to the newly constructed Mappin Art Gallery. This became the park's main entrance and was built primarily so affluent visitors could drive their carriages right up to the gallery's door. The bandstand was added around 1900. It was designed by the Sheffield architects Flockton and Gibbs and constructed at a foundry in Glasgow. It was one of a pair, the other being placed in Hillsborough Park, but this has since been demolished. The bandstand was in use until the mid-1970s and many well-known bands have played there, including the Black Dyke Band and the Coldstream Guards Band; it has also staged several rock concerts there. The restored bandstand is now an approved Civil Wedding venue.Sheffield City Council website: Details of bandstand. In 1905 the park was visited by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra during a visit to Sheffield in which they also opened the nearby University of Sheffield. A war memorial to the York and Lancaster Regiment was erected in the park in 1923 to commemorate the 8,814 of the regiment who died in the First World War. In the 1950s, Sheffield Corporation agreed to the demolition of the Winter Street Gate, along with its lodge and outbuildings to allow for the construction of the University Library (now the Western Bank Library) In July 2016, to mark the 100th anniversary of the battle of the Somme, Weston Park was dedicated as a Fields in Trust Centenary Field by Sheffield City Council because of its local heritage and significance. The York & Lancaster Memorial within the park commemorates the loss of more than 8,800 soldiers during the First World War, including the Sheffield Pals brigade. Weston Park Restoration Project The restored bandstand with the Godfrey Sykes memorial in the background to the right. In March 2006 it was announced that the Heritage Lottery Fund was awarding over ¬£2,000,000 to help with the restoration of Weston Park. The work took two years to complete and consisted of the following work: *Resurfacing all paths and replacing modern railings and gates with more appropriate designs. *Refurbishing all seven of the Grade II listed monuments and memorials, which powerfully commemorate the valour and craftsmanship of the people of Sheffield and their efforts to promote social reform. *Recreating the original vision for the lake as a striking reflective sheet of water crossed by two beautiful wooden bridges, using the original 1874 Marnock designs discovered in the city archives. *Restoring the bandstand, which is a nationally rare example of a fully glazed structure, to create a unique cultural venue and outdoor classroom. *Replacing the stolen south east gates, the theft of which in 1995 came to symbolise the lowest point in the fortunes of the park. *Planting new trees and shrubs in Marnock's style to increase the all-year-round interest and sensory value. *Installing new benches and creating quiet, sheltered seating areas. *Remodelling and refurbishing two of the existing tennis courts. *Providing improved facilities for the park staff. *Installing lighting and CCTV along one of the principal routes through the park. *Improving access to ensure all areas of the park are wheelchair accessible. *Installing new signage and interpretation boards. *Developing a range of activities and events to encourage new users from across the city and beyond.Museums Sheffield website: Details of restoration project. The park was formally reopened on Sunday 1 June 2008 by the Lord Mayor of Sheffield.Sheffield City Council website: Details of reopening of park.

Unexpectedly, 69 Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members of the Diet from the Fukuda Takeo, Miki Takeo and Hidenao Nakagawa factions abstained from voting on the motion.

It invests objects or actions with an inner meaning expressing Christian ideas. The symbolism of the early Church was characterized by being understood by initiates only, while after the legalization of Christianity in the Roman Empire during the 4th-century more recognizable symbols entered in use. Christianity has borrowed from the common stock of significant symbols known to most periods and to all regions of the world. Only a minority of Christian denominations have practiced Aniconism, or the avoidance or prohibition of types of images. These include early Jewish Christians sects, as well as some modern denominations that prefer to some extent not to use figures in their symbols due to the Decalogue's prohibition of idolatry. Early Christian symbols=Cross and crucifix 20px 20px= The Crucifix, a cross with corpus, a symbol used in the Catholic Church, Lutheranism, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and Anglicanism, in contrast with some other Protestant denominations and the Armenian Apostolic Church, which use only a bare cross. Early use of a globus cruciger on a solidus minted by Leontios (r. 695‚Äì698); on the obverse, a stepped cross in the shape of an Iota Eta monogram. The shape of the cross, as represented by the letter T, came to be used as a \\"seal\\" or symbol of Early Christianity by the 2nd century.\\"The cross as a Christian symbol or 'seal' came into use at least as early as the second century (see \\"Apost. Const.\\" iii. 17; Epistle of Barnabas, xi.-xii.; Justin, \\"Apologia,\\" i. 55‚Äì60; \\"Dial. cum Tryph.\\" 85‚Äì97); and the marking of a cross upon the forehead and the chest was regarded as a talisman against the powers of demons (Tertullian, \\"De Corona,\\" iii.; Cyprian, \\"Testimonies,\\" xi. 21‚Äì22; Lactantius, \\"Divin√¶ Institutiones,\\" iv. 27, and elsewhere). The Christian Fathers had to defend themselves, as early as the second century, against the charge of being worshipers of the cross, as may be learned from Tertullian, \\"Apologia,\\" xii., xvii., and Minucius Felix, \\"Octavius,\\" xxix. Christians used to swear by the power of the cross. CROSS:, Jewish Encyclopaedia. At the end of the 2nd century, it is mentioned in the Octavius of Minucius Felix, rejecting the claim by detractors that Christians worship the cross.\\"Crosses, moreover, we neither worship nor wish for.1815 You, indeed, who consecrate gods of wood, adore wooden crosses perhaps as parts of your gods. For your very standards, as well as your banners; and flags of your camp, what else are they but crosses glided and adorned? Your victorious trophies not only imitate the appearance of a simple cross, but also that of a man affixed to it. We assuredly see the sign of a cross,1816 naturally, in the ship when it is carried along with swelling sails, when it glides forward with expanded oars; and when the military yoke is lifted up, it is the sign of a cross; and when a man adores God with a pure mind, with hands outstretched. Thus the sign of the cross either is sustained by a natural reason, or your own religion is formed with respect to it.\\" Cruces etiam nec colimus, nec optamus. Vos plane qui ligneos deos consecratis, cruces ligneas, ut deorum vestrorum partes, forsitan adoratis. (0332B) Nam et signa ipsa et cantabra et vexilla castrorum, quid aliud quam inauratae cruces sunt et ornatae? Tropaea vestra victricia, non tantum simplicis crucis faciem, verum et affixi hominis imitantur. Signum sane crucis naturaliter visimus in navi, quum velis tumentibus vehitur, quum expansis palmulis labitur; et quum erigitur iugum, crucis signum est, et quum homo, porrectis manibus, Deum pura mente veneratur. Ita signo crucis aut ratio naturalis innititur, aut vestra religio formatur. (Octavius of Minucius Felix, chapter 29) The cross (crucifix, Greek stauros) in this period was represented by the letter T. Clement of Alexandria in the early 3rd century calls it (\\"the Lord's sign\\") he repeats the idea, current as early as the Epistle of Barnabas, that the number 318 (in Greek numerals, Œ§ŒôŒó) in was a foreshadowing (a \\"type\\") of the cross (T, an upright with crossbar, standing for 300) and of Jesus (ŒôŒó, the first two letters of his name ŒôŒóŒ£ŒüŒ•Œ£, standing for 18).Stromata, book VI, chapter XI Clement's contemporary Tertullian also rejects the accusation that Christians are crucis religiosi (i.e. \\"adorers of the gibbet\\"), and returns the accusation by likening the worship of pagan idols to the worship of poles or stakes.Apology., chapter xvi. Tertullian uses crux \\"cross\\", palus \\"pole\\" and stipes \\"stake\\" interchangeably for rhetoric effect: \\"Then, if any of you think we render superstitious adoration to the cross, in that adoration he is sharer with us. If you offer homage to a piece of wood at all, it matters little what it is like when the substance is the same: it is of no consequence the form, if you have the very body of the god. And yet how far does the Athenian Pallas differ from the stock of the cross, or the Pharian Ceres as she is put up uncarved to sale, a mere rough stake and piece of shapeless wood? Every stake fixed in an upright position is a portion of the cross; we render our adoration, if you will have it so, to a god entire and complete. We have shown before that your deities are derived from shapes modelled from the cross.\\" Sed et qui crucis nos religiosos putat, consecraneus noster erit. Cum lignum aliquod propitiatur, viderit habitus, dum materiae qualitas eadem sit; viderit forma, dum id ipsum dei corpus sit. Et tamen quanto distinguitur a crucis stipite Pallas Attica, et Ceres Pharia, quae sine effigie rudi palo et informi ligno prostat? Pars crucis est omne robur, quod erecta statione defigitur; nos, si forte, integrum et totum deum colimus. Diximus originem deorum vestrorum a plastis de cruce induci. In his book De Corona, written in 204, Tertullian tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace repeatedly on their foreheads the sign of the cross.\\"At every forward step and movement, at every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and shoes, when we bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on couch, on seat, in all the ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the sign\\" (De Corona, chapter 3) While early Christians used the T-shape to represent the cross in writing and gesture, the use of the Greek cross and Latin cross, i.e. crosses with intersecting beams, appears in Christian art towards the end of Late Antiquity. An early example of the cruciform halo, used to identify Christ in paintings, is found in the Miracles of the Loaves and Fishes mosaic of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo, Ravenna (dated c. 504).20th‚Äì21st century Celtic cross with inscribed symbolism Instances of the St Thomas cross, a Greek cross with clover leaf edges, popular in southern India,see: \\"Granite Objects in Kerala Churches\\", in Glimpses of Nazraney Heritage, George Menachery, SARAS, 2005; and \\"Thomas Christian Architecture\\", in George Menachery, ed. The St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India, Vol. 2, 1973 date to about the 6th century. The Patriarchal cross, a Latin cross with an additional horizontal bar, first appears in the 10th century. The Celtic cross, now often characterized by the presence of the outline of a circle upon which a cross, stylized in a pre-Medieval Celtic fashion, appears superimposed. The Celtic cross bears strong resemblance to the Christian cross; however, the Celtic cross motif predates Christianity by at least 3,000 years. It appears in the form of heavily sculpted, vertically oriented, ancient monoliths which survive in the present day, in various locations on the island of Ireland. A few of the ancient monuments were evidently relocated to stand in some of Ireland's earliest churchyards, probably between 400 CE and 600 CE, as Christianity was popularized throughout much of the island. The heavily-worn stone sculptures likely owe their continued survival to their sheer size and solid rock construction, which coordinate in scale, and in composition, with Ireland's ancient megalith arrangements. Unlike the Christian cross iconography associated with the shape of a crucifix (commonly used for torture and execution of criminals and captured enemy prisoners-of-war, by the pre- Christian Roman Empire), the Celtic cross' design origins are not clear. The Celtic cross has nevertheless been repeated in statuary, as a dominant feature of the anthropogenic Irish landscape, for at least 5,000 years. The Celtic cross and the Christian cross are similar enough in shape, that the former was easily adopted by Irish Catholic culture, following the Christianization of Ireland. The Celtic cross is accurately described as an ancient symbol of cultural significance in pre-Christian, Druidic Ireland. It also is used as a symbolic icon of the interpretation of Christianity, unique to Irish culture in that pre-Christian Celtic tradition and Irish Druidic iconography are hybridized with Christian traditions and iconography (much like the Shamrock; a low-growing, daintily foliaged, dense ground cover plant, which is held as a timeless symbol of Ireland itself; and, which is also symbolic on Ireland, of the Christian Holy Trinity, due to the Shamrock's typical trifoliar leaf structure). Although the cross was used as a symbol by early Christians, the crucifix, i.e. depictions of the crucifixion scene, were rare prior to the 5th century; some engraved gems thought to be 2nd or 3rd century have survived, but the subject does not appear in the art of the Catacombs of Rome.Schiller, Gertrud, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II, 1972, 89‚Äì90, fig. 321. The purported discovery of the True Cross by Constantine's mother, Helena, and the development of Golgotha as a site for pilgrimage led to a change of attitude. It was probably in Palestine that the image developed, and many of the earliest depictions are on the Monza ampullae, small metal flasks for holy oil, that were pilgrim's souvenirs from the Holy Land, as well as 5th century ivory reliefs from Italy.Schiller, Gertrud, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II, 1972, 89‚Äì90, figs. 322‚Äì326. In the early medieval period, the plain cross became depicted as the crux gemmata, covered with jewels, as many real early medieval processional crosses in goldsmith work were. The first depictions of crucifixion displaying suffering are believed to have arisen in Byzantine art,Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online where the \\"S\\"-shaped slumped body type was developed. Early Western examples include the Gero Cross and the reverse of the Cross of Lothair, both from the end of the 10th century. Marie-Madeleine Davy (1977) described in great detail Romanesque Symbolism as it developed in the Middle Ages in Western Europe.M.-M. Davy, Initiation √† la Symbolique Romane. Nouv. √©d. Paris: Flammarion, 1977. =Ichthys 20px= An Ichthys from ancient Ephesus Among the symbols employed by the early Christians, that of the fish seems to have ranked first in importance. Its popularity among Christians was due principally to the famous acrostic consisting of the initial letters of five Greek words forming the word for fish (Ichthus), which words briefly but clearly described the character of Christ and the claim to worship of believers: \\"\\", (Iƒìsous Christos Theou Huios S≈çtƒìr), meaning, Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour. This explanation is given among others by Augustine in his Civitate Dei, where he also notes that the generating sentence has 27 letters, i.e. 3 x 3 x 3, which in that age indicated power. =Alpha and Omega 20px= Jesus depicted with the alpha and omega letters in the catacombs of Rome from the 4th century The use since the earliest Christianity of the first and the last letters of the Greek alphabet, alpha (Œ± or Œë) and omega (œâ or Œ©), derives from the statement said by Jesus (or God) himself \\"I am Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End\\" (, also 1:8 and 21:6). =Staurogram 20px= Papyrus Bodmer XIV-XV, 2nd century) The Staurogram ‚≥® (from the Greek , i.e. cross), also Monogrammatic Cross or Tau-Rho symbol, is composed by a tau (Œ§) superimposed on a rho (Œ°). The Staurogram was first used to abbreviate the Greek word for cross in very early New Testament manuscripts such as P66, P45 and P75, almost like a nomen sacrum, and may visually have represented Jesus on the cross. Ephrem the Syrian in the 4th-century explained these two united letters stating that the tau refers to the cross, and the rho refers to the Greek word \\"help\\" ( [sic]; proper spelling: ) which has the numerological value in Greek of 100 as the letter rho has. In such a way the symbol expresses the idea that the Cross saves. The two letters tau and rho can also be found separately as symbols on early Christian ossuaries. The Monogrammatic Cross was later seen also as a variation of the Chi Rho symbol, and it spread over Western Europe in the 5th and 6th centuries. =Chi Rho 20px= Catacombs of San Callisto, Rome The Chi Rho is formed by superimposing the first two (capital) letters chi and rho (ŒßŒ°) of the Greek word \\"ŒßŒ°ŒôŒ£Œ§ŒüŒ£\\" =Christ in such a way to produce the monogram. Widespread in ancient Christianity, it was the symbol used by the Roman emperor Constantine I as vexillum (named Labarum). =IH Monogram 20px= The first two letters of the name of Jesus in Greek, iota (Œô) and eta (Œó), sometime superimposed one on the other, or the numeric value 18 of in Greek, was a well known and very early way to represent Christ. This symbol was already explained in the Epistle of Barnabas and by Clement of Alexandria. For other christograms such as IHS, see Article Christogram. =IX Monogram 20px= A IX Monogram from a 4th century Sarcophagus from Constantinople An early form of the monogram of Christ, found in early Christian ossuaries in Palaestina, was formed by superimposing the first (capital) letters of the Greek words for Jesus and Christ, i.e. iota Œô and chi Œß, so that this monogram means \\"Jesus Christ\\". Another more complicated explanation of this monogram was given by IrenaeusIrenaeus, Adv Haer, 1.15.2 and Pachomius: because the numeric value of iota is 10 and the chi is the initial of the word \\"Christ\\" (Greek: [sic]; proper spelling: ) which has 8 letters, these early fathers calculate 888 ((10*8)*10)+((10*8)+8) which was a number already known to represent Jesus, being the sum of the value of the letters of the name \\"Jesus\\" () (10+8+200+70+400+200).

The image of the Good Shepherd, often with a sheep on his shoulders, is the most common of the symbolic representations of Christ found in the Catacombs of Rome, and it is related to the Parable of the Lost Sheep. Initially it was also understood as a symbol like others used in Early Christian art. By about the 5th century the figure more often took on the appearance of the conventional depiction of Christ, as it had developed by this time, and was given a halo and rich robes. =Dove= Catacombs of Domitilla, Rome The dove as a Christian symbol is of very frequent occurrence in ancient ecclesiastical art. According to , during the Baptism of Jesus the Holy Spirit descended like a dove and came to rest on Jesus. For this reason the dove became a symbol of the Holy Spirit and in general it occurs frequently in connection with early representations of baptism. It signifies also the Christian soul, not the human soul as such, but as indwelt by the Holy Spirit; especially, therefore, as freed from the toils of the flesh and entered into rest and glory. The Peristerium or Eucharistic dove was often used in the past, and sometime still used in Eastern Christianity, as Church tabernacle. However the more ancient explanation of the dove as a Christian symbol refers to it as a symbol of Christ: IrenaeusIrenaeus, Adv Haer, 1.15.6 in the 2nd century explains that the number 801 is both the numerological value of the sum in Greek of the letters of the word \\"dove\\" (Greek: ) and the sum of the values of the letters Alpha and Omega, which refers to Christ. In the Bible story of Noah and the Flood, after the flood a dove returns to Noah bringing an olive branch as a sign that the water had receded, and this scene recalled to the Church Fathers Christ who brings salvation through the cross. This biblical scene led to interpreting the dove also as a symbol of peace. =Peacock= ciborium from a church in Italy Ancient Greeks believed that the flesh of peafowl did not decay after death, and so it became a symbol of immortality. This symbolism was adopted by early Christianity, and thus many early Christian paintings and mosaics show the peacock. The peacock is still used in the Easter season especially in the east.\\"Birds, symbolic.\\" Peter and Linda Murray, Oxford Dictionary of Christian Art (2004). The \\"eyes\\" in the peacock's tail feathers symbolise the all-seeing God and ‚Äì in some interpretations ‚Äì the Church. A peacock drinking from a vase is used as a symbol of a Christian believer drinking from the waters of eternal life. The peacock can also symbolise the cosmos if one interprets its tail with its many \\"eyes\\" as the vault of heaven dotted by the sun, moon, and stars. By adoption of old Persian and Babylonian symbolism, in which the peacock was associated with Paradise and the Tree of Life, the bird is again associated with immortality. In Christian iconography the peacock is often depicted next to the Tree of Life. =Pelican= vulning itself. In medieval Europe, the pelican was thought to be particularly attentive to her young, to the point of providing her own blood by wounding her own breast when no other food was available. As a result, the pelican became a symbol of the Passion of Jesus and of the Eucharist since about the 12th century. =Anchor 20px 20px= Christians adopted the anchor as a symbol of hope in future existence because the anchor was regarded in ancient times as a symbol of safety. For Christians, Christ is the unfailing hope of all who believe in him: Saint Peter, Saint Paul, and several of the early Church Fathers speak in this sense. The Epistle to the Hebrews for the first time connects the idea of hope with the symbol of the anchor. A fragment of inscription discovered in the catacomb of St. Domitilla contains the anchor, and dates from the end of the 1st century. During the 2nd and 3rd centuries the anchor occurs frequently in the epitaphs of the catacombs. The most common form of anchor found in early Christian images was that in which one extremity terminates in a ring adjoining the cross-bar while the other ends in two curved branches or an arrowhead; There are, however, many deviations from this form. In general the anchor can symbolize hope, steadfastness, calm and composure. = Shamrock 22x22px= St. Patrick depicted with shamrock in detail of stained glass window in St. Benin's Church, Wicklow, Ireland Traditionally, the shamrock is said to have been used by Saint Patrick to illustrate the Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity when Christianising Ireland in the 5th century. A common myth is that St. Patrick used the shamrock ‚Äì a small plant with compound leaves, typically composed of three (3), heart-shaped leaflets; and, a very familiar sight to the Irish ‚Äì to illustrate the tripartite form of the Christian deity. Unlike many other tripartite mythologies, such as the native Irish Morrigan mythology, Christianity is a monotheistic religion. The common triple-leaflet, compound-leaved shamrock- which exhibits only one compound- triplet leaf per stem- could easily be used to illustrate the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, described as being a single God; comparable to each of the three leaflets, which, together, form one shamrock. The Christianization, of the previously Celtic Druidic island culture, began in the 4th century, CE. Christianization continued to dramatically influence, and change, Irish cultural practices and schools of thought, through the 6th century, CE =Elemental symbols= The early Church made wide use of elemental symbols. Water has specific symbolic significance for Christians. Outside of baptism, water may represent cleansing or purity. Fire, especially in the form of a candle flame, represents both the Holy Spirit and light. These symbols derive from the Bible; for example from the tongues of fire that symbolized the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, and from Jesus' description of his followers as the light of the world; or God is a consuming fire found in .

Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, hardcover: Compare Jewish symbolism. =Lily crucifix= Lily Crucifix at Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford, SuffolkThe coat of arms of the Anglican diocese of Trinidad contains several Christian visual symbols A lily crucifix is a rare symbol of Anglican churches in England. It depicts Christ crucified on a lily, or holding such a plant. The symbolism may be from the medieval belief that the Annunciation of Christ and his crucifixion occurred on the same day of the year, March 25.The Passion in Art. Richard Harries. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004 There are few depictions of a lily crucifix in England. One of the most notable is a painting on a wall above the altar at All Saint's Church, Godshill, Isle of Wight. Other examples include: *An alabaster example on a tomb in St Mary's Church, Nottingham. *The Lady Chapel of St Helen's, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, has a wall painting. *Five examples are in glass as at Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford. *At All Saints, Great Glemham, Suffolk, the image is on the base of a font. *At St Mary, Binham, Norfolk, an image in a bench end may be a lily crucifix. *In Tong, Shropshire, St Bartholomew's Church choir stall No. 8 depicts a lily crucifix. *The Church of St John the Baptist, Wellington includes a lily crucifix in the carving of the centre mullion of the east window of the Lady chapel. Tomb paintings Christians from the very beginning adorned their catacombs with paintings of Christ, of the saints, of scenes from the Bible and allegorical groups. The catacombs are the cradle of all Christian art. Early Christians accepted the art of their time and used it, as well as a poor and persecuted community could, to express their religious ideas. The use of deep, sometimes labyrinthine, catacombs for ritual burials are a product of the poverty of early Christian communities: the unusual, multileveled, burial chambers were, at surface-level, small plots of land used as entrances to the tiered catacombs below, by early Christians unable to afford large areas of land, nor the corresponding taxes sometimes levied on real estate, by regional authorities. From the second half of the 1st century to the time of Constantine the Great they buried their dead and celebrated their rites in these underground chambers. The Christian tombs were ornamented with indifferent or symbolic designs‚Äîpalms, peacocks, with the chi- rho monogram, with bas-reliefs of Christ as the Good Shepherd, or seated between figures of saints, and sometimes with elaborate scenes from the New Testament. Other Christian symbols include the dove (symbolic of the Holy Spirit), the sacrificial lamb (symbolic of Christ's sacrifice), the vine (symbolizing the necessary connectedness of the Christian with Christ) and many others. These all derive from the writings found in the New Testament. Other decorations that were common included garlands, ribands, stars landscapes, which had symbolic meanings, as well. Symbols of Christian Churches Baptism in early Christian art. =Sacraments= Some of the oldest symbols within the Christian Church are the sacraments, the number of which vary between denominations. Always included are Eucharist and baptism. The others which may or may not be included are ordination, unction, confirmation, penance and marriage. They are together commonly described as an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace or, as in Catholic theology, \\"outward signs and media of grace.\\" The rite is seen as a symbol of the spiritual change or event that takes place. In the Eucharist, the bread and wine are symbolic of the body and shed blood of Jesus, and in Catholic theology, become the actual Body of Christ and Blood of Christ through Transubstantiation. The rite of baptism is symbolic of the cleansing of the sinner by God, and, especially where baptism is by immersion, of the spiritual death and resurrection of the baptized person. Opinion differs as to the symbolic nature of the sacraments, with some Protestant denominations considering them entirely symbolic, and Catholics, Orthodox, Lutherans, and some Reformed Christians believing that the outward rites truly do, by the power of God, act as media of grace. =Icons= The tomb paintings of the early Christians led to the development of icons. An icon is an image, picture, or representation; it is likeness that has symbolic meaning for an object by signifying or representing it, or by analogy, as in semiotics. The use of icons, however, was never without opposition. It was recorded that, \\"there is no century between the fourth and the eighth in which there is not some evidence of opposition to images even within the Church., quoted by . Nonetheless, popular favor for icons guaranteed their continued existence, while no systematic apologia for or against icons, or doctrinal authorization or condemnation of icons yet existed. Christ and Saint Menas, 6th-century Coptic icon, Louvre Though significant in the history of religious doctrine, the Byzantine controversy over images is not seen as of primary importance in Byzantine history. \\"Few historians still hold it to have been the greatest issue of the period...\\". The Byzantine Iconoclasm began when images were banned by Emperor Leo III the Isaurian sometime between 726 and 730. Under his son Constantine V, a council forbidding image veneration was held at Hieria near Constantinople in 754. Image veneration was later reinstated by the Empress Regent Irene, under whom another council was held reversing the decisions of the previous iconoclast council and taking its title as Seventh Ecumenical Council. The council anathematized all who held to iconoclasm, i.e. those who held that veneration of images constitutes idolatry. Then the ban was enforced again by Leo V in 815. And finally icon veneration was decisively restored by Empress Regent Theodora. Today icons are used particularly among Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Assyrian and Eastern Catholic Churches. =Domes= The traditional mortuary symbolism of the dome led it to be used in Christian central-type martyriums in the Syrian area, the growing popularity of which spread the form. The spread and popularity of the cult of relics also transformed the domed central-type martyriums into the domed churches of mainstream Christianity. The use of centralized buildings for the burials of heroes was common by the time the Anastasis Rotunda was built in Jerusalem, but the use of centralized domed buildings to symbolize resurrection was a Christian innovation. In Italy in the 4th century, baptisteries began to be built like domed mausoleums and martyriums, which spread in the 5th century. This reinforced the theological emphasis on baptism as a re-experience of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The octagon, which is transitional between the circle and the square, came to represent Jesus' resurrection in early Christianity and was used in the ground plans of martyriums and baptisteries for that reason. The domes themselves were sometimes octagonal, rather than circular. Nicholas Temple proposes the imperial reception hall as an additional source of influence on baptisteries, conveying the idea of reception or redemptive passage to salvation. Iconography of assembled figures and the throne of Christ would also relate to this. Portraits of Christ began to replace gold crosses at the centers of church domes beginning in the late eighth century, which Charles Stewart suggests may have been an over-correction in favor of images after the periods of Iconoclasm in the eighth and ninth centuries. One of the first was on the nave dome of Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki, and this eventually developed into the bust image known as the Pantokrator. Otto Demus writes that Middle Byzantine churches were decorated in a systematic manner and can be seen as having three zones of decoration, with the holiest at the top. This uppermost zone contained the dome, drum and apse. The dome was reserved for the Pantokrator (meaning \\"ruler of all\\"), the drum usually contained images of angels or prophets, and the apse semi-dome usually depicted the Virgin Mary, typically holding the Christ child and flanked by angels.

The fifth tropical cyclone and third named storm of the 1982 Atlantic hurricane season, Chris developed from a surface low- pressure area in the northern Gulf of Mexico on September 9\\\\. Although initially displaying subtropical characteristics, the low pressure area gradually acquired tropical characteristics, and was reclassified as Tropical Depression Four within 24 hours of development. The depression then began to intensify and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Chris on September 10\\\\. Thereafter, the storm turned north-northeastward and strengthened further. On September 11, Chris peaked as a 65 mph (100 km/h) tropical storm. Later that day, it made landfall near Sabine Pass, Port Arthur, Texas. By September 13, Chris dissipated over Arkansas. When Chris moved ashore, it caused high waves and tides along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico. Though the storm made landfall in Texas, minimal impact was recorded in that state, though a restaurant suffered significant damage. Much of the impact occurred to the east, in Louisiana. Rainfall was relatively light in that state, though a few isolated areas experienced precipitation amounts higher than . The storm caused steady rainfall in parts of the Midwestern United States. Outside of Louisiana, there were rainfall totals higher than in western Tennessee and slightly less as the storm progressed northward. Due to minor flooding, damage in Louisiana was around $1 million (1982 USD). Elsewhere, impact was limited to mostly light to moderate rainfall, though local flooding was reported in Tennessee and Kentucky. Overall, Chris caused $2 million (1982 USD) in damage and no fatalities. Meteorological history An upper-low pressure system formed in the Gulf of Mexico on September 6, with the circulation heading westward. Initially, minimal development occurred, though by September 8, the system became a surface low. It is estimated that the surface low became a subtropical depression by 0000 UTC on the following day. Over the next 24 hours, the low began acquiring tropical characteristics, mainly from developing deep convection on its north and east sides. By early on September 10, observations from oil rigs, radars, and Air Force reconnaissance flights indicated that the subtropical system had transitioned into Tropical Depression Four. However, the National Hurricane Center did not operationally issue advisories until 1900 UTC on September 10, at which time Chris was already a tropical storm. In post-season analysis, it was indicated that Tropical Depression Five strengthened into Tropical Storm Chris at 1200 UTC on September 10\\\\. Due to a large low pressure trough over the Southwestern United States, Chris immediately curved northward. Later that day, the National Hurricane Center noted that \\"even though conditions do not favor rapid strengthening...winds could approach hurricane force before the center moves inland Saturday\\". As it approached closer to the Gulf Coast of the United States, Chris curved slightly east of north. Shortly before 1200 UTC Chris made landfall near Sabine Pass, Port Arthur, Texas with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). At 1200 UTC on September 11, Chris attained its peak intensity with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a minimum pressure of . Chris weakened quickly, and was downgraded to a tropical depression by early on September 12 while centered over west-central Louisiana. The storm deteriorated further, and dissipated in Arkansas at 0000 UTC on September 13\\\\. The remnants were last noted over the Midwestern United States. Preparations As Chris approached the Gulf Coast, at least 6,500 people were evacuated from the Louisiana coast. Offshore evacuations were also completed, with many oil rig workers were taken off of rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. Along with the evacuations, multiple watches and warnings were issued in accordance with Tropical Storm Chris. The first was on September 9, when a gale warning was released for the Louisiana area east of Port Arthur, Texas. Fifteen hours afterwards, a gale warning was released for Port Arthur to Port O'Connor, Texas. The next day, the gale warnings in Texas were extended as far south as Brownsville. A hurricane watch was released at 2200 UTC on September 10 for Morgan City, Louisiana to Port O'Connor, Texas. All watches and warnings were discontinued by 2200 UTC on September 11, which was about 10 hours after Chris made landfall. Impact Rainfall summary for Tropical Storm Chris At an offshore oil rig, a wind gust up to was reported. In addition, several boats in the Gulf of Mexico sustained heavy damage. About southeast of Sabine Pass, a utility boat sunk. Minimal rainfall was reported in Texas, reaching about . Winds were light, remaining below tropical storm force in eastern Texas. However, a restaurant on Pleasure Island suffered an estimated $200,000 in damage (1982 USD). In addition, minimal damage occurred at Sea Rim State Park, totaling to only $1,000 (1982 USD). In the Port Arthur area, numerous power outages were reported. Flooded roads and power outages were reported in Beaumont, though damage was not significant in that city. Along the southwestern coast of Louisiana, tides between were reported. On land, Chris produced tropical storm force winds in a few areas and light to moderate rainfall. Throughout the state, precipitation was generally between , though peaking at more than in Delhi. Elsewhere in Louisiana, about of rainfall was reported in Lake Charles. Street flooding in Lake Charles was severe, though only a few houses suffered flood damage. To the south of Lake Charles, minor damage was reported in Cameron Parish, totaling to about $500,000 (1982 USD). However, due to high tides, damage along the coastal areas of that parish was considerable. A Cameron Parish official noted \\"There's power out all over the place, and we understand there was quite a bit of damage at Holly Beach\\". In Evangeline Parish, an F2 tornado on the Fujita Scale destroyed four buildings and damaged seven other structures. In northeastern Louisiana, wind damage was \\"spotty\\" and limited to downed trees and powerlines. As a result of heavy rainfall in that portion of the state, low-lying areas flooded, and bayous overflowed. A tornado, rated at F3, destroyed eleven houses and one church in Clayton. In addition, the tornado knocked down trees and powerlines in the area. Overall, damage in Louisiana was near $1 million (1982 USD). Throughout Louisiana and Mississippi, a combined total of nine tornadoes were reported. One of the tornadoes in Mississippi damaged several homes and businesses in Cleveland, and at least four injuries were reported. Another tornado spawned in a rural area overturned a mobile home in Eden. Two other twisters in the state caused minimal damage. In Mississippi, rains peaked at about in the northwest section of the state. The rest of state reported widespread rains of . Rainfall in Alabama peaked at in some areas, and similar amounts were observed in Georgia. In Florida, rainfall peaked at in an extremely southern part of the Panhandle. Precipitation was also recorded in Lake Okeechobee, with reported there. The northeastern section of the state reported of rain. No rain was reported in the Florida Keys. In Arkansas, only of rain was reported, which were in several portions of the state. Missouri reported a peak of of precipitation, in the southeastern portion of the state. Other rains in the state include , which was widespread. Illinois reported mainly of precipitation, with one area of , all in the southern half of the state. Very little rain was reported in Indiana, with only on the southern border of the state. In Tennessee and Kentucky, rains of were reported with locally heavy flooding. The western portions of Tennessee reported flood waters at least waist high in some city streets. In addition, schools in Milan were closed, while portions of U.S. Routes 70 and 79 were submerged into water. A few businesses in the city of Huntington suffered flood damage. Others rains include in the Carolinas, New York, Michigan, Virginia and Ohio. Overall, damage from Tropical Storm Chris was slightly less than $2 million (1982 USD), and no fatalities were reported.

The students of the school have participated in annual Model United Nations and Harvard Model Congress Europe conferences in several countries. The school also offers athletics, such as basketball, soccer, badminton, volleyball, swimming, and activities at all grade levels. Middle and high school students compete in international tournaments. In recent years, the school has developed its performing arts extracurricular offerings. It has hosted a student-run Shakespeare festival and several full- length musicals.

It was located in Chicago, Illinois at Lake Street and Market (later Wacker Drive) near the Chicago River. This site had previously been the site of the Sauganash Hotel, Chicago's first hotel. This is where supporters ushered Abraham Lincoln to the party nomination and the eventual U.S. Presidency. The location at Lake and Wacker was designated a Chicago Landmark on November 6, 2002. The name \\"Wigwam\\", although separate structures, was later associated with host locations for both the 1864 Democratic National Convention and the 1892 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The building The two-story Wigwam was built by Chicago business leaders to attract the 1860 Convention. It was a temporary structure, built entirely of wood in little more than a month, and it could accommodate 10‚Äì12,000 people. The building was used for political and patriotic meetings during the Convention and the American Civil War. It also served as a retail space until its demolition, some time between 1867 and 1871.Photograph by alt=Following the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, another \\"Wigwam\\" building at Washington (one city block south of Lake) and Market served as the temporary home of the Chicago Board of Trade.

The newly formed Town of Chicago elected its first town trustees in 1833 in the hotel. The building briefly served as Chicago's first theater, and it hosted the first Chicago Theatre company in 1837 in an abandoned dining room.Adler, Tony, Theater, pp. 815-6, Eds.

The 1860 Republican National Convention (the second Republican National Convention) was held at the Wigwam. The 1864 Democratic National Convention was hosted in a different \\"Wigwam\\" built for the convention as a semicircular roofed amphitheater. These were the first Chicago visits for each party's national convention. Baltimore has hosted 10 and Philadelphia has hosted 9. The 1868 Republican National Convention returned to Chicago, but it was located at the Crosby Opera House. The 1892 Democratic National Convention convened in a temporary \\"Wigwam\\" in Lake Park for Grover Cleveland's third nomination. 1860 Republican National Convention The 1860 Republican National Convention was eventful for its nomination of Abraham Lincoln, who went on to a Presidency notably marked by the onset of the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery. During the convention, backroom dealing and political scheming played a role in the outcome. Nevertheless, Lincoln, who had stayed in Springfield during the convention, received vociferous support and carried the nomination. =Today= Today, the corner of W. Lake Street and N. Wacker Drive bears the address of 191 N. Wacker. This address is in the West Loop neighborhood of the Loop community area in Chicago. The 157 m (516 ft), 37-story office tower, named 191 North Wacker, was designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox and built in 2002. The major tenants include Drinker, Biddle & Reath, Much Shelist, Watson Wyatt Worldwide, Heitman Financial, and RSM McGladrey. In 2017, the city rededicated plaques gifted in the early 20th century by the Daughters of the American Revolution, which commemorate the nomination of Lincoln at the Wigwam, and the Saganaush Hotel.

It is part of the Ancient City of Damascus, which was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979. The location of the current citadel was first fortified in 1076 by the Turkman warlord Atsiz bin Uvak, although it is possible but not proven that a citadel stood on this place in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. After the assassination of Atsiz bin Uvak, the project was finished by the Seljuq ruler Tutush I. The emirs of the subsequent Burid and Zengid dynasties carried out modifications and added new structures to it. During this period, the citadel and the city were besieged several times by Crusader and Muslim armies. In 1174, the citadel was captured by Saladin, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt, who made it his residence and had the defences and residential buildings modified. Saladin's brother Al-Adil rebuilt the citadel completely between 1203 and 1216 in response to the development of the counterweight trebuchet. After his death, power struggles broke out between the other Ayyubid princes and although Damascus switched hands several times, the citadel was taken by force only once, in 1239. The citadel remained in Ayyubid hands until the Mongols under their general Kitbuqa captured Damascus in 1260, thereby ending Ayyubid rule in Syria. After an unsuccessful revolt broke out in the citadel, the Mongols had most of it dismantled. After the defeat of the Mongols in 1260 by the Mamluks, who had succeeded the Ayyubids as rulers of Egypt, Damascus came under Mamluk rule. Except for brief periods in 1300 and 1401, when the Mongols conquered Damascus, the Mamluks controlled the citadel until 1516. In that year, Syria fell into the hands of the Ottoman Empire. Damascus surrendered without a fight and from the 17th century onward the citadel functioned as barracks for the Jannisaries‚ÄîOttoman infantry units. The citadel started to fall into disrepair in the 19th century and its last military use was in 1925, when French soldiers shelled the old city from the citadel in response to the Great Syrian Revolt against the French Mandate of Syria. The citadel continued to serve as a barracks and prison until 1986, when excavations and restorations started. As of 2011, excavation and restoration efforts are still ongoing. The citadel is located in the northwest corner of the city walls, between the Bab al-Faradis and the Bab al-Jabiyah. The citadel consists of a more or less rectangular curtain wall enclosing an area of . The walls were originally protected by 14 massive towers, but today only 12 remain. The citadel has gates on its northern, western and eastern flanks. The current citadel dates primarily to the Ayyubid period while incorporating parts of the older Seljuq fortress. Extensive repairs in response to sieges and earthquakes were carried out in the Mamluk and Ottoman periods. Before the citadel It is uncertain whether a building stood on the site of the citadel before the 11th century AD. The Ghouta, the wider area in which Damascus is located, has been occupied since at least 9000 BC, but there is no evidence for settlement within the area that is today enclosed by the city walls before the 1st millennium BC. The area occupied by the later citadel was most likely outside this first settlement. The presence of a citadel during the Hellenistic period is uncertain. Damascus certainly had a citadel during the Roman period, but whether it was located on the site of the present citadel is uncertain and subject to scholarly debate. Old citadel=Construction of the old citadel= In 1076, Damascus was conquered by the Turkman warlord Atsiz bin Uvak, who established himself as the ruler of the city and began the construction of the citadel. He then tried to invade the Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt but was defeated in 1077. The Fatimids subsequently built on their victory over Atsiz and besieged Damascus in 1077 and again in 1078, but both attempts to take the city were unsuccessful. The siege of 1078 was eventually lifted by Tutush I, brother of the Seljuq sultan Malik Shah I, to whom Atsiz had appealed for help. After the Fatimid besiegers had left, Tutush I took over the city and, distrusting Atsiz, had him assassinated in 1078. The construction of the citadel was finished under Tutush I. =From Seljuqs to Zengids= After the death of Tutush I in 1095, Syria was divided between his sons Abu Nasr Shams al-Muluk Duqaq and Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan. Duqaq took control of Damascus while Radwan established himself as ruler of Aleppo. During Duqaq's reign (1095‚Äì1104), additional work was carried out on the citadel. In 1096, Radwan besieged the citadel but failed to capture it. During the rule of the Burid dynasty (1104‚Äì1154), work was carried out on the citadel in response to multiple attacks on Damascus by Crusader and Muslim armies. In 1126, a Crusader army approached Damascus, but their advance was stopped from the city. A second attempt by Crusaders in 1129 advanced to within of the city before they had to retreat. Crusader incursions prompted some improvements to the castle in the 1130s by Burid rulers, Taj al-Muluk Buri and Shams al-Mulk Isma'il. Zengi, the atabeg of Aleppo and Mosul, attacked Damascus in 1135 and again in 1140. Zengi's second attack was thwarted because Damascus forged a coalition with the Crusader states to the south, arguing that if Damascus were conquered, these states would fall as well. Crusader armies attacked Damascus a third time in 1148 during the Second Crusade. This siege of Damascus ended within a week when an army led by Nur ad-Din Zangi, ruler of Aleppo and the son of Zengi, threatened the besieging Crusaders, forcing them to withdraw. After unsuccessful attacks in 1150 and 1151, Nur ad-Din finally captured Damascus in 1154. The citadel was only surrendered to Nur ad-Din after Mujir ad-Din Abaq, the last Burid ruler, had been given safe passage and lordship over the city of Homs. Nur ad-Din ruled as Zengid emir of Damascus from 1154 until his death in 1174. He took up residence in the citadel and rebuilt or refurbished its residential structures. After an earthquake hit Damascus in 1170, Nur ad-Din built a wooden house for sleeping and prayer next to the original stone residence of the citadel. In addition, he built a mosque and a fountain in the citadel. Between 1165 and 1174, Nur ad-Din re-fortified Damascus with a concentric wall, and it is possible that he also strengthened the defences of the citadel. Nur ad-Din died of an illness in the citadel on 15 May 1174 and was buried there; his body was later transferred to the Nur ad-Din Madrasah in Damascus. =Saladin to Al-Adil= One of the bastions of the Citadel of Damascus protected by multiple alt=A square stone tower with battlements and bret√®ches Immediately following Nur ad-Din's death in 1174, Damascus was seized by Saladin, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt. In that year, Saladin rode from Egypt past the Crusader states to Damascus with only 700 horsemen. The city opened its gates to Saladin without resistance, except for the citadel, which surrendered to him later that year. Saladin added a tower to the citadel and refurbished the residential buildings. Like his predecessor Nur ad-Din, Saladin died of an illness in the citadel on 4 March 1193. He was initially buried inside the citadel, but later reburied in a mausoleum near the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. At Saladin's death in 1193, rival Ayyubid factions led by Saladin's sons established themselves in Egypt, Aleppo, Damascus, and Iraq. Al-Afdal, Saladin's eldest son and emir of Damascus, was initially recognized by the younger sons as their overlord. However, hostilities broke out in 1194 between Al-Afdal and Al-Aziz Uthman, Saladin's second-oldest son and Ayyubid sultan of Egypt. In 1196, Al-Aziz and Saladin's brother Al-Adil captured Damascus, except for the citadel, where Al-Afdal had taken refuge. After negotiations, Al-Afdal surrendered the citadel and his titles to Al-Aziz and was exiled to Salkhad in the Hauran. Al-Adil recognized the overlordship of Al-Aziz and became ruler of Damascus. At the death of Al-Aziz in 1198, several members of Saladin's family, including Al-Afdal and Az-Zahir Ghazi, ruler of Aleppo, allied themselves against Al-Adil and marched on Damascus. Al-Afdal and Az-Zahir besieged Damascus in 1200 and 1201, but both attempts were unsuccessful. Al-Adil eventually negotiated a peace with Al-Afdal and Az- Zahir, who recognized Al-Adil's suzerainty as sultan of Egypt and emir of Damascus. New citadel=Construction by Al-Adil and dismantling by the Mongols= After his position as sultan of Egypt and emir of Damascus was secured, Al-Adil started an extensive rebuilding programme of the citadel. Between 1203 and 1216, the old fortifications were razed and a larger castle was built at the same location, incorporating parts of the old Seljuq citadel. The lower Ayyubid princes were each required to finance and build one of the large towers of the citadel. Several of Al-Adil's Ayyubid successors rebuilt many of the administrative and domestic structures inside the citadel, including residences, palaces, and a pool. As-Salih Ayyub was the only successor who also modified the defences. Possible motivations for this complete rebuilding by Al-Adil include the damage the old citadel may have sustained from earthquakes in 1200 and 1201 and the threat that other Ayyubid princes continued to pose toward Al-Adil. The most likely motivation is that the defences of the old citadel became obsolete due to the introduction in the 12th century of the counterweight trebuchet, a siege engine easily capable of reducing thick stone walls to rubble. The new citadel introduced a number of important changes to the defensive system, including higher and thicker walls, a wide moat surrounding the citadel, and numerous closely spaced, high, massive towers. Unlike the older towers, these were square rather than round in design. The towers contained platforms on which trebuchets could be placed. Due to their high position, these trebuchets could outrange enemy artillery and thereby prevent them from breaching the walls. After Al-Adil's death in 1218, intense power struggles broke out among his sons and other Ayyubid princes. Between 1229 and 1246, Damascus switched hands regularly and was attacked five times by different Ayyubid armies. During this period, the citadel was only once taken by force‚Äîthrough mining of one of its walls‚Äîin 1239. This occurred when the citadel's garrison had been reduced to below the number needed to defend a castle of that size. Following the murder in 1250 of Al-Muazzam Turanshah, the last Ayyubid sultan of Egypt, Damascus was seized by the Ayyubid ruler of Aleppo, An-Nasir Yusuf. He was in control of most of Syria until the arrival of the Mongols. When the Mongols invaded Syria and threatened Damascus after conquering Aleppo in 1260, An-Nasir fled from Damascus, leaving the city virtually undefended. The notables of Damascus started negotiations with the Mongol ruler Hulagu Khan; the city was handed over to his general Kitbuqa in 1260. When the Mongol army left Damascus to quell rebellions in the countryside, the Ayyubid garrison of the citadel revolted, as they had been instructed to do by An-Nasir. In response, the Mongols besieged the citadel in 1260. The garrison surrendered after heavy bombardments and without hope of being relieved by An-Nasir. The defences of the citadel were then largely dismantled. =Mamluk period= alt=Cars and people in front of a stone wall with window and door openings and the remains of vaults The new Mamluk sultan of Egypt, Qutuz, defeated the Mongols in the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260. Damascus now came under Mamluk influence. In the same year, Qutuz was assassinated by his commander Baibars, who succeeded Qutuz as sultan of Egypt (1260‚Äì1277). During Baibars' reign, the citadel was rebuilt and the northern wall was moved to the north. More rebuilding was completed during the reigns of the sultan Qalawun (1279‚Äì1290) and Al-Ashraf Khalil. The latter had a structure called the Blue Dome built in the citadel. It was the first dome in Syria that was decorated with coloured tiles on the outer surface, a tradition imported from Iran. Following the Mamluk defeat in the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar, Damascus, except for the citadel, changed hands to the Mongols in 1300. The Mongols besieged the citadel and set up a trebuchet in the court of the Umayyad Mosque, but they withdrew from Damascus before the citadel could be taken. In the following decades, extensive reconstruction work took place on the citadel. The damage done to the citadel during the siege, primarily on its east side, was repaired. The mosque was reconstructed and enlarged, the towers were repaired, and the Blue Dome was covered with lead plates as the tiles themselves had been destroyed. During the last two decades of the 14th century, a civil war raged in the Mamluk sultanate between Sultan Barquq, who had established the Burji dynasty in Cairo, on one side and on the other side Saif al-Din Yalbugha, governor of Aleppo, and Mintash, governor of Malatya. The city and the citadel were besieged several times during this period. During these sieges, both sides made use of siege towers, trebuchets, rockets and cannons. After Yalbugha switched sides and teamed up with Barquq, Mintash was killed in 1393, leaving Damascus and its city under the control of Barquq. Also during this time, the Zahiri Revolt, a conspiracy to overthrow Barquq, was discovered at the Citadel. =Siege by Timur and its aftermath= In 1400, the Mongol army under Timur, better known as Tamerlane, swept down on Syria and arrived at Damascus after having subdued Aleppo, Homs, and Baalbek. A Mamluk army from Egypt under Sultan Faraj ibn Barquq, the son of Barquq, failed to lift the siege. In 1401, the city surrendered to Timur, except for the citadel, which Timur besieged. Towers with trebuchets were set up around the citadel and in the Umayyad Mosque. The garrison surrendered after the northwestern tower was brought down through mining. The defenders were slaughtered and a heavy tribute was imposed on the citizens of Damascus. When they failed to deliver, the city was sacked and the Umayyad Mosque was burned. The damage to the citadel, especially to its northern and western walls, was only repaired in 1407. In 1414, governor of Damascus Nawruz al-Hafizi, sought refuge in the citadel against the army of Sultan Al-Mu'ayyad Shaykh. The citadel was bombarded by trebuchet and cannon. The siege ended when a treaty of surrender was signed. In 1461, the southwest tower collapsed in a fire when missiles were fired from it to force the rebellious governor of Damascus to leave the city. This tower and four others were rebuilt in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, indicating that the repairs of 1407 had been carried out in haste. =Ottoman period= alt=A small gate with iron bars set in a wall built of uneven stones, one of which is decorated After the Mamluk defeat by the Ottoman army under Sultan Selim I in the Battle of Marj Dabiq in 1516, Damascus and the citadel surrendered peacefully to the Ottomans. Damascus was given to Janbirdi al-Ghazali, a Mamluk who had submitted to Selim I. When Selim I died in 1520, al-Ghazali revolted and took the citadel. He marched upon Aleppo to expand his realm, but had to retreat and was eventually defeated and killed in the vicinity of Damascus in 1521. Damascus again changed hands, to the Ottomans. From 1658 onward, the citadel was controlled by the Janissaries‚ÄîOttoman infantry units. In 1738 and in 1746, they were involved in conflicts with the governors of Damascus; the Janissaries temporarily lost control of the citadel in 1746. The north gate of the citadel collapsed in 1752, and sustained heavy damage due to a severe earthquake in 1759. According to contemporary accounts, both the western and southern walls collapsed, but the damage was quickly repaired in 1761. When Ali Bey of Egypt, who opposed Ottoman overlordship, invaded Syria in 1771, the city of Damascus surrendered to him without a fight, except for the citadel. Ali Bey withdrew after a short siege. Two further sieges took place in 1787 and 1812, both successful and both initiated because the citadel's garrison had revolted against the governor of Damascus. The last siege of the citadel took place in 1831. In that year, the citizens of Damascus and the local garrison of Janissaries revolted against governor Mehmed Selim Pasha, who took refuge in the citadel. He was promised safe passage after a siege lasting 40 days but was murdered before he could leave the city. In 1860, Christian refugees from the Druze-Maronite conflict in Lebanon spilled into Damascus, resulting in tensions with the Muslim population. There was a massacre of the Christian population, many of whom sought refuge in the citadel and eventually fled the city with the help of the Algerian‚ÄìDamascene notable Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri. Descriptions and photographs of the citadel by nineteenth-century European travellers indicate that the defences remained in relatively good shape until 1895, but that the structures inside the walls were reduced to complete ruins. In 1895, substantial damage was done to the citadel because it was quarried for stone to build barracks. =World War I and the French Mandate period= When the British and Arab forces marched on Damascus in the final year of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign in World War I, the Ottoman authorities fled and left Damascus in the control of a committee of citizens. The newly appointed Ottoman military governor released 4,000 prisoners from the citadel, who subsequently started pillaging and killing sick and disabled Ottoman soldiers who had been left behind in the city. These riots only stopped with the entrance into the city of the Australian Light Horse troops on 1 October 1918. French military forces occupied the citadel during the French Mandate period in Syria (1920‚Äì1946). During the Great Syrian Revolt in 1925, the French shelled Al-Hariqa, the area immediately south of the citadel‚Äîwhere Syrian rebels were supposed to be present‚Äîfrom positions in the hills to the north of the city, and from the citadel itself. This bombardment resulted in widespread destruction. After the French Mandate period, the citadel continued to serve as a prison and barracks until 1986. =Restoration and research= The Ancient City of Damascus, including the citadel, was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979. Since 1986 restoration works have been carried out by various Syrian and foreign missions with the aim of opening the citadel to the public. Until 1999, the restorations were carried out by the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums (DGAM). In 1999 a joint French- Syrian mission was initiated under the supervision of the DGAM and the Institut fran√ßais du Proche-Orient (IFPO). Between 2000 and 2006, this mission carried out extensive archaeological and art-historical research in the citadel, as well as further restoration works. In celebration of these restorations, a ceremony was held on 1 July 2006 which was attended by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. In 2004 an agreement was signed between the DGAM and the Italian General Direction for Development Cooperation for a joint mission to renovate and reorganize the citadel and the National Museum of Damascus. This mission started working in the citadel in 2007. Much attention will be given to the reinforcement of damaged or structurally weak parts in the architecture. It is expected by the Syrian‚ÄìItalian mission that, once renovations are finished, the citadel will be used for cultural and social events and activities. Citadel today=Location and layout= The citadel is located in the northwest corner of the old walled city of Damascus, between the Bab al-Faradis and the Bab al-Jabiyah. Whereas most medieval Arabic castles are located on prominent hilltops, the citadel of Damascus was built on flat ground at the same level as the rest of the city, a feature it shares with the Citadel of Bosra. The location of the citadel ensured that it could control the Barada River, which flows north of the citadel. The location of the river also offered protection against attack from that side of the citadel. The Nahr Aqrabani, a canal branching off the Barada, flowed immediately below the northern wall and provided additional protection. The dry moats on the other sides of the citadel could be filled from these streams. Another branch of the Barada, the Nahr Banyas, entered the city under the citadel. Hydraulic structures below that made control of the flow of water into Damascus possible from within the citadel were probably constructed under Al-Adil. The citadel was fully integrated into the defences of Damascus, with the city walls abutting the citadel on its southwest and northeast corners. The citadel erected under the Seljuqs occupied an area measuring . Parts of the Seljuq walls were integrated in the rebuilding undertaken by Al-Adil. In this way, a second inner ring of defence was provided, as Al-Adil's walls enclosed a slightly larger area. The Ayyubid citadel encloses an uneven rectangular area of . The outer walls, constructed by Al-Adil, were pierced by three gates and originally protected by 14 towers, although only 12 of these remain. Except for the western part of the curtain wall, the defensive works of the citadel that are still standing are primarily of Ayyubid date, with extensive Mamluk restorations. The walls are partly obscured from sight by the urban fabric of Damascus, which has encroached upon the citadel during the 19th and 20th centuries. The shops along the north side of the Al-Hamidiyah Souq are built against the citadel's southern fa√ßade, while parts of the eastern defences are also obscured by buildings. The buildings that stood against the western and northern walls were cleared in the 1980s. The walls and towers of the citadel are constructed from carbonate rocks and basalt that were quarried in the vicinity of Damascus. =Towers= Today, the citadel has 12 towers. There is one tower on each corner, three in between along the north and south walls and two facing east. Originally, the citadel had two more towers on the western wall, as reported by European travellers until 1759. The earthquake that hit Damascus in that year led to the collapse of the western defences of the citadel, with the western towers not being rebuilt afterwards. The central northern tower, which once housed the north gate of the citadel, and the southwest corner tower have also largely disappeared. Of the former, only the west wall remains while of the southwest tower only parts of the basement can still be seen. The other 10 towers have been preserved up to their original height, which ranges between . The northern corner towers are square while the southern ones are L-shaped. All the other towers are rectangular with their broad sides parallel to the walls of the citadel. All towers are crowned by a double parapet equipped with machicolations and numerous arrowslits. These parapets surrounded and thereby protected the large platforms from which trebuchets were operated. =Curtain walls= The curtain walls of the citadel connect the towers with each other. Given that during the design of the citadel so much emphasis was placed on the massive towers, the curtain walls are relatively short. They range between in length for the curtain wall that connects the two central towers of the east wall to for the curtain wall connecting the northwest corner tower with the next tower east of it. Where the walls are preserved up to their original height, which is on the south side of the citadel, they measure , while their thickness ranges between . Along the inside of the curtain walls ran vaulted galleries that allowed quick access to all parts of the citadel. These galleries had arrowslits from which an approaching enemy could be shot. The walls were crowned by a walkway that was protected by crenellations. =Gates= The citadel's three gates are located on the north, east and west sides of the citadel. The first two are the work of Al-Adil, although the northern gate has been repaired in the Mamluk period, while the current west gate is of later date. The northern gate was primarily reserved for military matters; the eastern gate was in civic use. During the Mamluk period, the eastern gate was one of two locations, the other being the Umayyad Mosque, where official decrees were posted, and this is reflected in a number of inscriptions that have been found here. The northern gate, or Bab al-Hadid (\\"Iron Gate\\"), was built with a primary emphasis on military matters. It originally consisted of arched entrances in the east and west walls of a tower in the middle of the northern curtain wall. These entrances led to a central vaulted room and from there through a long vaulted passage before reaching the courtyard. This large gate complex also incorporated the gate structures of the old Seljuq citadel. Based on stylistic evidence and inscriptions found in the citadel, the original construction of the Ayyubid gate can be dated to the period between 1210 and 1212. Most of the outer gate tower has disappeared and a street now runs through the western arch that still survives, while the vaulted passage that led into the citadel is now used as a mosque. The east and north gate complexes were connected through a long vaulted passage that can also be dated to the reign of Al-Adil. The eastern gate, constructed between 1213 and 1215, is the only one that opens toward the area enclosed by the city walls of Damascus. It is located in one of the citadel's square towers and protected by another tower immediately south of the gate tower and a barbacan running between these towers. It is a bent-axis gate running through vaulted passages before reaching the courtyard. Behind it is a square hall in which four columns support a central unusually shaped dome. It incorporates a gate tower from the old Seljuq citadel. The gate lacks defensive structures like murder-holes and is more decorated than the northern gate, which must be related to the fact that the gate faces the city. The gate is decorated with a superb muqarnas canopy that is now hidden because the outer door is blocked. The western gate was originally protected by two square towers that were probably built during the reign of Baibars. After the 1759 earthquake, which led to the collapse of the western defences of the citadel, these towers were not rebuilt. Unlike the other two gates, this gate has a straight passage. =Southwest building= In the southwest corner of the courtyard, built parallel to the southern wall, is a two-storey building measuring and reaching a height of . The date of this building has long been unclear, but based on the archaeological and architectural analysis carried out between 2002 and 2006, it has been shown that it predates Al- Adil's refortification of the citadel and must have been an addition to the defences of the Seljuq citadel. The function of this building after it was incorporated into Al-Adil's new walls, and thus after losing its defensive function, remains unclear as the archaeological analysis did not reveal any in situ material from which the building's use could be reconstructed.

From the beginning, Churov created an image of a person who would remain loyal to president Putin under any circumstances. During his tenure, he made a number of controversial statements, which were interpreted as his willingness to rubber-stamp election results favorable to Putin even if there were reports of widespread violations. Participation of independent observers was made considerably more complicated. In the 2011 Russian legislative election, Churov maintained that the elections were free of falsifications, although the media reported a number of instances when the data of Central Election Commission of Russia differed with the protocols of election districts. One of the demands during the 2011‚Äì13 Russian protests was the resignation of Churov.Russian election protests ‚Äì follow live updates, Guardian, retrieved 10/12/2011 On the other hand, the Central Electoral Committee did not falsify the results itself, and Churov was even instrumental in creating the efficient appeal system, which helped to strike down some decisions of lower level electoral committees. On 27 March 2016, the executive term of Churov expired, and he was not reappointed by Putin. The new Chairperson of the Central Election Commission of Russia became Ella Pamfilova. In June 2016 Churov was appointed an Ambassador for Special Tasks at Russian Ministry for Foreign Affairs.

He originated the concept of incentive compatibility, and showed how desired outcomes can be achieved by using incentive compatible mechanism design. Hurwicz shared the 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (with Eric Maskin and Roger Myerson) for his seminal work on mechanism design. Hurwicz was one of the oldest Nobel Laureates, having received the prize at the age of 90. Hurwicz was educated and grew up in Poland, and became a refugee in the United States after Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. In 1941, Hurwicz worked as a research assistant for Paul Samuelson at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Oskar Lange at the University of Chicago. He was a research associate for the Cowles Commission between 1942 and 1946. In 1946 he became an associate professor of economics at Iowa State College. Hurwicz joined the University of Minnesota in 1951, becoming Curtis L. Carlson Regents Professor of Economics in 1989. He was Regents' Professor of Economics (Emeritus) at the University of Minnesota when he died in 2008. Hurwicz was among the first economists to recognize the value of game theory and was a pioneer in its application. Interactions of individuals and institutions, markets and trade are analyzed and understood today using the models Hurwicz developed. Personal life Hurwicz was born in Moscow, Russia, to a family of Polish Jews a few months before the October Revolution. Soon after Leonid's birth, the family returned to Warsaw. Hurwicz and his family experienced persecution by both the Bolsheviks and Nazis, as he again became a refugee when Germany invaded Poland in 1939. His parents and brother fled Warsaw, only to be arrested and sent to Soviet labor camps. Hurwicz, who had graduated from Warsaw University in 1938, at the time of Nazi invasion on Poland was in London, moved to Switzerland then to Portugal and finally in 1940 he emigrated to the United States. His family eventually joined him there. Hurwicz hired Evelyn Jensen (born October 31, 1923), who grew up on a Wisconsin farm and was, at the time, an undergraduate in economics at the University of Chicago, as his teaching assistant during the 1940s. They married on July 19, 1944 and later lived at a number of locations in Minneapolis. They had four children: Sarah, Michael, Ruth and Maxim. His interests included linguistics, archaeology, biochemistry and music. His activities outside the field of economics included research in meteorology and membership in the NSF Commission on Weather Modification. When Eugene McCarthy ran for president of the United States, Hurwicz served in 1968 as a McCarthy delegate from Minnesota to the Democratic Party Convention and a member of the Democratic Party Platform Committee. He helped design the 'walking subcaucus' method of allocating delegates among competing groups, which is still used today by political parties. He remained an active Democrat, and attended his precinct caucus in February 2008 at the age of 90. He was hospitalized in mid-June 2008, suffering from renal failure. He died a week later in Minneapolis. Education and early academic career Encouraged by his father to study law, in 1938 Hurwicz received his LL.M. degree from the University of Warsaw, where he discovered his future vocation in economics class. He then studied at the London School of Economics with Nicholas Kaldor and Friedrich Hayek. In 1939 he moved to Geneva where he studied at the Graduate Institute of International Studies. After moving to the United States he continued his studies at Harvard University and the University of Chicago. Hurwicz had no degree in economics. In 2007 he said, \\"Whatever economics I learned I learned by listening and learning.\\" In 1941 Hurwicz was a research assistant to Paul Samuelson at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and to Oskar Lange at the University of Chicago. At Illinois Institute of Technology during the war, Hurwicz taught electronics to the U.S. Army Signal Corps. From 1942 to 1944, at the University of Chicago, he was a member of the faculty of the Institute of Meteorology and taught statistics in the Department of Economics. About 1942 his advisors were Jacob Marschak and Tjalling Koopmans at the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics at the University of Chicago, now the Cowles Foundation at Yale University. Teaching and research Hurwicz received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1945‚Äì1946. In 1946 he became an associate professor of economics at Iowa State College. From January 1942 until June 1946, he was a research associate for the Cowles Commission. Joining full-time in October 1950 until January 1951, he was a visiting professor, assuming Koopmans' classes in the Department of Economics, and led the commission's research on theory of resource allocation. He was also a research professor of economics and mathematical statistics at the University of Illinois, a consultant to the RAND Corporation through the University of Chicago and a consultant to the U.S. Bureau of the Budget. Hurwicz continued to be a consultant to the Cowles Commission until about 1961. Hurwicz was recruited by Walter Heller to the University of Minnesota in 1951, where he became a professor of economics and mathematics in the School of Business Administration. He spent most of the rest of his career there, but it was interspersed with studies and teaching elsewhere in the United States and Asia. In 1955 and again in 1958 Hurwicz was a visiting professor, and a fellow on the second visit, at Stanford University and there in 1959 published \\"Optimality and Informational Efficiency in Resource Allocation Processes\\" on mechanism design. He taught at Bangalore University in 1965 and, during the 1980s, at Tokyo University, People's University (now Renmin University of China) and the University of Indonesia. In the United States he was a visiting professor at Harvard (1969), at the University of California, Berkeley (1976‚Äì1977), at Northwestern University twice in 1988 and 1989, at the University of California, Santa Barbara (1998), the California Institute of Technology (1999) and the University of Michigan in (2002). He was a visiting Distinguished Professor at the University of Illinois in 2001. Twin of Heller Hall, named for Walter Heller, Department of Economics, University of Minnesota, West Bank Back at Minnesota, Hurwicz became chairman of the Statistics Department in 1961, Regents Professor of Economics in 1969, and Curtis L. Carlson Regents Professor of Economics in 1989. He taught subjects ranging from theory to welfare economics, public economics, mechanisms and institutions and mathematical economics. Although he retired from full-time teaching in 1988, Hurwicz taught graduate school as professor emeritus most recently in the fall of 2006. In 2007 his ongoing research was described by the University of Minnesota as \\"comparison and analysis of systems and techniques of economic organization, welfare economics, game-theoretic implementation of social choice goals, and modeling economic institutions.\\" Hurwicz's interests included mathematical economics and modeling and the theory of the firm. His published works in these fields date back to 1944. He is internationally renowned for his pioneering research on economic theory, particularly in the areas of mechanism and institutional design and mathematical economics. In the 1950s, he worked with Kenneth Arrow on non- linear programming; in 1972 Arrow became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Economics prize. Hurwicz was the graduate advisor to Daniel McFadden, who received the prize in 2000. Earlier economists often avoided analytic modeling of economic institutions. Hurwicz's work was instrumental in showing how economic models can provide a framework for the analysis of systems, such as capitalism and socialism, and how the incentives in such systems affect members of society.. Hurwicz Lecture originally presented at the North American meetings of the Econometric Society, at the University of Minnesota on 2006-06-22. The theory of incentive compatibility that Hurwicz developed changed the way many economists thought about outcomes, explaining why centrally planned economies may fail and how incentives for individuals make a difference in decision making. Hurwicz served on the editorial board of several journals. He co-edited and contributed to two collections for Cambridge University Press: Studies in Resource Allocation Processes (1978, with Kenneth Arrow) and Social Goals and Social Organization (1987, with David Schmeidler and Hugo Sonnenschein). His most recent articles were published in the journals \\"Economic Theory\\" (2003, with Thomas Marschak), \\"Review of Economic Design\\" (2001, with Stanley Reiter) and \\"Advances in Mathematical Economics\\" (2003, with Marcel K. Richter). Hurwicz presented the Fisher- Schultz (1963), Richard T. Ely (1972), David Kinley (1989) and Colin Clark (1997) lectures. Awards and honors=Memberships and honorary degrees= Hurwicz was elected a fellow of the Econometric Society in 1947 and in 1969 was the society's president. Hurwicz was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965. In 1974 he was inducted into the National Academy of Sciences and in 1977 was named a Distinguished Fellow of the American Economic Association. Hurwicz received the National Medal of Science in 1990 in Behavioral and Social Science, presented to him by President of the United States George H. W. Bush, \\"for his pioneering work on the theory of modern decentralized allocation mechanisms\\". He served on the United Nations Economic Commission in 1948 and the United States National Research Council in 1954. In 1964 he was a member of the National Science Foundation Commission on Weather Modification. He was a member of the American Academy of Independent Scholars (1979) and a Distinguished Scholar of the California Institute of Technology (1984). Hurwicz received six honorary doctorates, from Northwestern University (1980), the University of Chicago (1993), Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (1989), Keio University (1993), Warsaw School of Economics (1994) and Universit√§t Bielefeld (2004). He was an honorary visiting professor of the Huazhong University of Science and Technology School of Economics (1984). =Named for Hurwicz= First presented in 1950, the Hurwicz criterion is thought about to this day in the area of decision making called \\"under uncertainty.\\" Original release: Abraham Wald published decision functions that year. Hurwicz combined Wald's ideas with work done in 1812 by Pierre-Simon Laplace.John Milnor credits Hurwicz with this idea. Hurwicz's criterion gives each decision a value which is \\"a weighted sum of its worst and best possible outcomes\\" represented as Œ± and known as an index of pessimism or optimism. Variations have been proposed ever since and some corrections came very soon from Leonard Jimmie Savage in 1954. These four approaches‚Äì Laplace, Wald, Hurwicz and Savage‚Äì have been studied, corrected and applied for over fifty years by many different people including John Milnor, G. L. S. Shackle, Daniel Ellsberg, R. Duncan Luce and Howard Raiffa, in a field some date back to Jacob Bernoulli. In 2010, the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota launched the Heller-Hurwicz Economics Institute, a global initiative created to inform public policy by supporting and promoting frontier economic research and by communicating findings to leading academics, policymakers, and business executives around the world. Funds raised by the Institute are used to attract and retain preeminent faculty and, in part, to support graduate student research. The University of Michigan has an endowed chair named for Hurwicz, the Leonid Hurwicz Collegiate Professor of Complex Systems, Political Science, and Economics, currently held by Scott E. Page. The Leonid Hurwicz Distinguished Lecture is given to the Minnesota Economic Association (as is the Heller lecture). John Ledyard (2007), Robert Lucas, Roger Myerson, Edward C. Prescott, James Quirk, Nancy Stokey and Neil Wallace are among those who have delivered the lecture since it was inaugurated in 1992. =Nobel Prize in Economics= In October 2007, Hurwicz shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Eric Maskin of the Institute for Advanced Study and Roger Myerson of the University of Chicago \\"for having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory.\\" During a telephone interview, a representative of the Nobel Foundation told Hurwicz and his wife that Hurwicz was the oldest person to win the Nobel Prize. Hurwicz said, \\"I hope that others who deserve it also got it.\\" When asked which of all the applications of mechanism design he was most pleased to see he said welfare economics. The winners applied game theory, a field advanced by mathematician John Forbes Nash, to discover the best and most efficient means to reach a desired outcome, taking into account individuals' knowledge and self-interest, which may be hidden or private. Mechanism design has been used to model negotiations and taxation, voting and elections, to design auctions such as those for communications bandwidth, elections and labor talks and for pricing stock options. Unable to attend the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm because of his poor health, Hurwicz received the prize in Minneapolis. Accompanied by Evelyn, his spouse of six decades, and his family, he was the guest of honor at a convocation held on the campus of the University of Minnesota presided over by university president Robert Bruininks. Immediately following a live broadcast of the Nobel Prize awards ceremony, Jonas Hafstr√∂m, Swedish ambassador to the United States, personally awarded the Economics Prize to Professor Hurwicz.

He successfully appealed the conviction in 2007 and ultimately, in 2014 his confession to police was found to be inadmissible as evidence causing the Crown to dismiss the murder charges for lack of evidence. Background Nelson Hart lived with his wife, Jennifer, and twin daughters, Karen and Krista, in the town of Gander, Newfoundland, Canada. Tammy Leonard, a social worker, was working with the Hart family in the months leading up to the death of the twins. She testified that the Harts were having chronic financial problems and were on social assistance. There was consideration on behalf of the social workers to remove the children from the family before they moved in with Jennifer Hart's father. In June 2002, the family found themselves homeless again, and the possibility of the children's removal was revisited. By mid-summer, the Hart family was living in an apartment and receiving regular visits from a new social worker, Carolyn Chard, who testified that Nelson appeared increasingly angry with her presence. At no time did either social worker think that Hart posed any danger to his children. Death of twin daughters On 4 August 2002, Hart and his daughters travelled to the nearby area of Little Harbour on Gander Lake. Nelson returned home in a panic and said that Krista had fallen in the lake. Hart returned to Gander to get help, but when police arrived, Karen was dead and Krista was unconscious. The next day she was taken off life support. Investigation and undercover operation In the initial questioning, Hart claimed that his daughter had fallen into the lake, but months later changed his story to say, that being an epileptic, he had suffered a seizure and couldn't recall how the girls ended up in the water. He claimed that he lied to avoid losing his driver's licence. By February 2005, the police hadn't made much more progress in the case, so they decided to launch an elaborate undercover operation which would end up costing over CAD $400,000. It began with Hart being approached in a parking lot by an undercover agent, and eventually being asked to run a delivery for what he was told was an organized crime group. Over a period of four months, the agents would continue the operation and get closer to Hart, and led him to believe that he was becoming more accepted in the organization. After four months, the supposed leader of the group asked Hart a question he was told would test his loyalty. It was at this time he was asked about the murder of his daughters, and with some detail described the scenario, eventually taking some of the agents to the scene of the crime. The jury at the trial was able to watch the confession taped from a hidden camera in the hotel where Hart described the murder. :\\"This is just about the perfect murder,\\" the officer said. :\\"It was pretty well-organized,\\" Hart replied. :\\"You must be a thinker, eh?\\" the officer said. :\\"Sometimes it pays to be that way.\\" Conviction On 13 June 2005, Hart was charged with first degree murder, and his trial began on 27 February 2007. His lawyer claimed that Hart was intimidated by the undercover agents and made up the story to impress them. Ultimately, the jury did not believe this and other claims, and on 28 March 2007 gave the verdict of guilty, and automatically sentenced him to life in prison with the eligibility of parole in no less than 25 years. Hart did not testify in his own defence during the trial, as the judge refused to close the court to spectators during his testimony. Appeal On 11 April 2007, Hart filed an appeal to the guilty verdict, claiming that the videotaped confessions were not admissible. It also claims that the judge should have closed the court to allow Hart to testify during the trial. In a judgment dated 17 September 2012, the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal allowed Hart's appeal and ordered a new trial. However, on 28 February 2013, the parties were granted leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The appeal was heard on 3 December 2013. On 31 July 2014 the Supreme Court found that the evidence against Hart procured through the \\"Mr. Big\\" operation was not admissible and would be excluded in any new trial. On 29 July 2014, Crown Prosecutors in Gander announced that they will not seek another murder trial for Hart and Supreme Court Justice David Peddle granted the Crown's request to withdraw murder charges against him due to insufficient evidence.

It depicts a menacing armor-clad warrior with a horned helmet, whose facial features are obscured by shadow, atop a horse, holding a bloody bearded axe and shield. The image eventually led to spin-offs of varying merchandise, including subsequent paintings of the warrior, novels, statues, a comic book series published by Verotik and another by Image Comics, and related D&D; adventures, published by Goodman Games. Frazetta later painted several other Death Dealer paintings, including ones to be used as covers for the comic book series. In other media=Album cover= The painting was used as the cover on Molly Hatchet's debut album in 1978. =Novels= Death Dealer spawned a novel franchise, written by author James Silke. Four novels were published, in order: *Prisoner of the Horned Helmet (1988), in which the readers are introduced to the protagonist, who is given the name Gath of Baal. In the book he is a tribeless barbarian in a large forest that, after the end of the Ice Age, will one day become the Mediterranean sea. A large Mongol- esque invasion force by the name of the Kizzaks try to invade the forest, and various parties try to recruit Gath's aid to defend against them. One of them, the beautiful sorceress Cobra, gives Gath a helmet possessed by the god of death. The helmet gives him godlike power but at the same time tries to break Gath to its will. With the help of the worldly travelling entertainer Brown John and the virtuous young woman Robin Lakehair, Gath manages to control the helmet and fights against the Kizzak horde, eventually winning. *Lords of Destruction (1989) *Tooth and Claw (1989) *Plague of Knives (1990)'' Rise of the Death Dealer (2005) was an Omnibus edition containing the first two novels. =Statues and action figures= Sculptor Randy Bowen produced the first statues based upon the character. Dark Horse Comics published several statues of the character, both full-size and miniature. Diamond Distributors published a series of Frank Frazetta action figures in the form of statues. Among the works were the original Death Dealer and one of the future renditions. Filmswords.com has created a helmet based upon that of the Dealer. =Comic books= The first Death Dealer comic book series was published in 1995 by the company Verotik. The 4-issue series was written by musician Glenn Danzig and illustrated by Simon Bisley (issue 1), Liam Sharp (issues 2 and 3), and by Arthur Suydam (issue 4). Frazetta provided covers for the books as well. In 2007, Image Comics/Frazetta Comics published the Death Dealer: Shadows of Mirahan 6 issue miniseries featuring Death Dealer in the first story fully approved by Frank Frazetta. The book's creators are Nat Jones, Jay Fotos, and Joshua Ortega. The story was written by Jones, Fotos and Ortega, with pencils and inks by Jones, and colors by Fotos. The story tells of an ancient land, and two warring nations fighting in an epic war. The Death Dealer appears on the field of battle and slaughters both sides. When the two kingdoms forged an alliance, the Dealer disappears for years but returns years later. A statue of the Death Dealer is unveiled at Fort Hood, Texas. =Military= Since 1985, the Death Dealer has been used as the mascot of III Corps (United States).

Amaze Entertainment oversaw development for the Nintendo DS version. The game is the ninth edition of the long-running WWE SmackDown vs. Raw (later renamed to WWE) video game series based on the professional wrestling promotion World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It is the sequel to 2006's WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007, succeeded by WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 in 2008. It is the first WWE game to include the promotion's ECW brand. Gameplay Each wrestler now has two fighting style categories, one primary and one secondary. Each fighting style has its advantages and disadvantages in each particular match type. There are eight styles altogether: high-flyer, hardcore, submission art, powerhouse, showman, brawler, dirty and technical. In addition, creative manager of THQ Cory Ledesma stated early in production that he planned on having numerous wrestler animations redone. A new \\"struggle submission system\\" has been introduced, incorporating more analog control into the game. The player executing the submission can now decide how much pressure is applied by moving the analog stick in a particular direction. Similarly, the player locked in a submission hold will have to power out also by using the analog stick. The game features the revived ECW brand, and it takes its place alongside the established Raw and SmackDown! brands. The official box art features the ECW logo prominently. The game's ECW branding has expanded the number of weapons available under the ring during gameplay. New weapons such as guitars are available and tables and barbed wire bats can be set on fire. Despite the inclusion of the brand, the video game franchise will keep its SmackDown! vs. Raw name, although an early logo included \\"ECW Invasion\\" in the title. It has been changed, however, to \\"Featuring ECW\\". The game features several arenas that WWE held events at in 2006 and 2007. There are also arenas based on each WWE television show. =Modes= Elijah Burke making his ring entrance. The game allows several different game modes to be played, each with different goals and options. The Season and General Manager Modes of previous games have been merged into the new \\"WWE 24/7\\" mode, which takes its name from WWE's video on-demand service. Players can choose to play one of the game's included superstars or create a superstar, or as a general manager of one of the brands. Playing as a wrestler, the goal is to take that wrestler and achieve \\"legend\\" status. In order to do so, the player has to win matches, the team with and feud with other wrestlers, and gain popularity. At the same time, they must choose whether to train, exercise, relax, or take part in other activities when not wrestling, all with their own positive and negative effects. (The player could only choose to be either on the Smackdown brand or the Raw brand, as the ECW brand was excluded). Playing as a general manager is similar to the previous General Manager modes in the series, in which one has to choose a brand and act as its General Manager (Jonathan Coachman for Raw, Theodore Long for SmackDown!, Tommy Dreamer for ECW), draft a roster and make decisions to make it the most popular brand of the three. The General Manager is allowed to make staffing decisions, schedule workouts and events. This was also the last game in the Smackdown vs Raw series to have a General Manager mode. There is also an all-new Tournament Mode, which allows the player to control a superstar through the various stages of the WWE tournament, such as Beat The Clock Sprint and King of the Ring, as well as Money in the Bank tournament. The game also allows you to create your own tournament. (This feature is excluded from the Nintendo DS and mobile versions.) Like previous games in the series, the game also allows players to challenge for and defend championships. The game includes championships used by the WWE in 2007, bringing back the branded championships from the previous game and for the first time, the ECW Championship.  Fighting style system  The game featured the Fighting Style System which would not appear in later games until the release of WWE 2K18, where the system has returned. With each style, the character would adopt a series of preset abilities. And, depending on primary ability, they would also be able to perform a unique move that can only be activated if the player has a stored finisher icon. The fighting styles were Powerhouse, Showman, Hardcore, Dirty, Brawler, High-Flyer, Submission and Technical. This system was highly criticized as these pre-setting gave some wrestlers abilities which they cannot actually use, or stopped them from using common moves. For example, Carlito and Chavo Guerrero did not have the ability to perform any of their springboard attacks, and Mr. McMahon was as strong as some of the larger characters in the game. Also, the choice of fighting styles limited the variety of moves available in create-a-moveset. Wrestlers with the powerhouse fighting style can break out of a pin attempt with just one button press, unless they had sustained a large amount of arm damage. They could also do a powerful Irish Whip (later named a 'Hammer Throw'), which could cause damage if the opponent hit the corner turnbuckles. A player (regardless of weight) could be sent reeling over the top rope with the force of this move. Their special ability was called 'Rampage', a temporary adrenaline rush in which their grapple moves could not be reversed or blocked. Technical wrestlers automatically reversed all quick grapple moves until they had taken a good deal of arm damage. They also had the ability to perform diving attacks onto opponents outside of the ring. Their special ability was an adrenaline rush that allowed them to counter every attack for a limited time. Showman is one of the more common kinds. Performing taunts or dives from higher positions cause a faster rise in momentum. They also have 2 special abilities. One allows them to perform one of their opponent's taunts, and if uninterrupted, the opponent is be unable to gain any momentum for a limited time. They can alternatively copy their opponent's finishing move if in the correct position to do so. However, the copied move is weaker than the original. The most common kind is the Brawler. Brawlers can sit on a downed opponent and punch their opponent's head repeatedly. They also have a special combination of 3 to 5 strikes. If the first strike connects, the defending wrestler is not able to block, avoid or counter the remainder of the strikes in the combination. Their special ability is called 'Wreck Shop', a limited adrenaline rush in which all opponent strikes are countered and all strikes become unblockable. High-flyers can perform springboard diving attacks to opponents inside or outside of the ring. Instead of countering or side-stepping attacks, they perform an evasive roll. Their special ability is a possum pin. After recovering from being knocked down, a high-flyer can remain on the ground. If the attacker attempts a grapple move, the defending wrestler will go for a pin attempt which is difficult to break out of. However, if the opponent attempts a strike, then the pin attempt is lost. Submission wrestlers can break out of Struggle Submissions with ease. They can also force an opponent to submit to any Struggle Submission, even if it is not a finisher or signature move. Dirty wrestlers, like Chavo Guerrero, can perform dirty moves, which boost their momentum faster. They can also remove turnbuckle covers and use weapons to build momentum. They can also use the referee as a human shield, making themselves immune to all attacks. When they release the referee, they shove him into the opponent. This is difficult to avoid and momentarily stuns the opponent and the referee. Their special move involves an eye-poke and a low blow which causes a lot of damage to the head and torso. Hardcore wrestlers get momentum bonuses for using weapons. They can also perform grapple moves while holding a weapon. If they try to use a steel chair with full momentum, they automatically perform the Steel Chair DDT. If they are caused to bleed, they instantly get full momentum. Their special move can only be performed with a steel chair in hand. They strike themselves in the face repeated until they bleed. While this causes full momentum, it also causes critical head damage. Roster ECW made its first appearance in the series as a brand, and Ashley, CM Punk, Elijah Burke, Kelly Kelly, JTG, Shad and MVP made their WWE video game debuts. Sabu, Sandman, Marcus Cor Von and Kenny Dykstra made their only appearances in the franchise. It is the last WWE video game to feature Torrie Wilson. This is the first game in the series not to feature Chris Benoit after his double murder and suicide in June 2007. All materials related to Benoit was removed or made unavailable through normal means, including all versions of the crossface and diving headbutt. Jillian Hall and The Boogeyman were omitted from the game even though they were a part of the current roster at the time and were featured in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007. Development Kane wrestles Rey Mysterio (this is an early screenshot; Rey Mysterio's attire was changed from white to black). =PlayStation 2= Graphics and gameplay are similar to the previous years in the SvR series. It also includes the new 24/7 mode which includes Become a Legend or GM Mode where you can also train superstars and gain them popularity. =Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3= The Xbox 360 has the custom soundtrack feature which people can import their own music in superstars entrances. However, the PS3 has a first person view in entrances where people can control where the superstar looks with the sixaxis controller. The PS3 version also had a special \\"Collector's Edition\\" which came with a DVD detailing the game, a Kelly Kelly trading card, and a booklet featuring various superstars signature moves. The Xbox 360 version also had special \\"High Flyer\\" and \\"Dirty\\" Editions which came with Special Edition Slipcase, \\"I'm a High Flyer\\" or \\"I Fight Dirty\\" T-shirts, 1 page Kelly Kelly calendar, 8 Numbered Limited Edition \\"Fighting Styles\\" Postcards, and a \\"Create a Superstar\\" Mini Guide. =Wii= Instead of featuring 24/7 mode, it features Main Event Mode, where you can play as a created superstar and rise to the top. The Wii version of the game features only chairs as the exclusive weapons. Also the Wii version only has 5 match types such as Singles Match, Hardcore Match, Tag Team Match, Triple Threat Match and Knockout Match. =PSP= The game has the same graphics as the previous games in the SvR PSP ports, however, Slaughter, Eddie Guerrero and Jim Neidhart are PSP exclusive unlockable Legends. =Matches= This would be the last game to feature the Buried Alive Match, as it would not appear in its sequel SmackDown vs. Raw 2009, or any other games to follow until WWE 2K16 (however only in the 2K Showcase). Reception The game was met with average to mixed reception upon release. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 73.60% and 71 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; 71.72% and 74 out of 100 for the PlayStation 3 version; 70.47% and 71 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 version; 66.20% and 68 out of 100 for the PSP version; 61.64% and 61 out of 100 for the DS version; 59.14% and 59 out of 100 for the Wii version; and 55% for the Mobile version. GameZone gave the Mobile version 5.5 out of 10 and said, \\"Overall it does more than most, has decent visuals, and runs pretty smoothly. But it doesn‚Äôt have the proper mechanics to make it feel like a wrestling game ‚Äì consequently, it comes off as an arcade button-masher.\\" However, IGN gave the same version four out of ten and said, \\"Smackdown vs. Raw 2008 can only be recommended for the hardcore wrestling fan. For anyone else looking to spice up their action gaming category I recommend Chess. At least every match will be different.\\" The PlayStation 2 version of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 received a \\"Platinum\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

Mudde, The Ideology of the Extreme Right, Manchester University Press, 2000, pp. 28-9 Nonetheless he and von Thadden did not enjoy a good relationship, due to Mussgnug's closeness to his rival Gerhard Frey. Von Thadden left the party in 1975 over the issue and Mussgnug secured for Frey a seat on the NPD's Executive Committee. Ultimately Mussgnug resigned on 16 December 1990 following poor results for the party in the 1990 federal election.Hermann Kurthen, Werner Bergmann, Rainer Erb, Antisemitism and Xenophobia in Germany After Unification, Oxford University Press, 1997, p. 267 Succeeded by Deckert, he left the NPD after this and became involved in setting up the German League for People and Homeland (DLVH).Hans-Joachim Veen, Norbert Lepszy, Peter Minch, The Republikaner party in Germany: right-wing menace or protest catchall?, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1993, pp. 27-8 He disappeared from politics when this group proved unsuccessful.

The district covers an area of , with its boundaries between Lincoln Boulevard and Sunnylane/Coltrane Rroads on the west and east, and between NE 48th and NE 86th on the south and north. The student body is primarily made up of African-American students (98%). Two schools, an arts academy, a ninth grade academy, a pre-school program and two community learning centers are maintained within the district. The ad-valorem tax base is primarily residential property and the land surrounding Remington Park, which contains such non-taxable properties as the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum, the Oklahoma City Zoo, the Omniplex Science Museum, the National Softball Hall of Fame, the Oklahoma State Firefighter Museum, and the land on which Remington Park is built.  History  A map discovered in 1987, dated June 8, 1900, is marked \\"Territory of Oklahoma, Oklahoma County, District 37,\\" and is drawn with the current Millwood district boundaries. The land was purchased by a firm from South Carolina, which planned to build a cotton mill on the site along with homes and a school for mill workers, but the entire project was later dropped. The only work completed plotted for a housing project and the one-room school house historically known as Deep Fork School. In 1918, the school board traded the original site for another tract (which is located near the present spot of the Millwood Middle School Building) and a new three-room, two-story rock building was built. In 1935, with WPA labor, a large two-story rock building was built, complete with a principal's office, classrooms, cafeteria, and auditorium. Kindergarten was started in 1949 on a tuition basis, and in 1951, kindergarten was included in the regular school program. In 1956 Millwood consisted of Kindergarten through 8th grade with about 25 students in each grade. Like a lot of schools in those days, Millwood was segregated with an all white faculty and students until 1963-64. By 1962 attendance had more than doubled, and the school was an athletic power even back then. From 1960 to 1962 the basketball team was undefeated for three seasons, dominating conference members Pleasant Hill, Crutcho, Harrison and others and in 1962 defeated Casady's 8th grade team twice. In 1960 a new building which included 11 classrooms, library, new offices, kitchen, lounge, and cafeteria, was added at a cost of $275,000. Six new 72-passenger buses were purchased in 1963, along with a plan to expand the existing facilities and to add a ninth grade. The curriculum required additional facilities, including a home economics room, drafting and manual arts room, and two classrooms. During the spring of 1971, a special election was held for the purpose of establishing an independent school district with the addition of a new high school for grades 10-12. The high school was accredited the year of operation and held its first graduation in 1972 with 16 students. Recent developments A preschool program was added in 1980, and computer education programs were added in 1982. A pre-kindergarten program was added to the primary school in 1995. In 1996, the fifth grade was moved from the middle school to the primary school, which was then changed to an elementary school with grades pre-kindergarten through five. The sixth grade was moved from the middle school in the fall of 2002. The Millwood Elementary School Arts Academy (MESAA) opened for the 2003-2004 school year. Parents and staff participated in the development of this academy, designed to offer an intense, integrated arts curriculum with opportunities in the areas of drama, vocal/instrumental music, visual arts and dance. Admission to MESAA is through an application process. In the school year of 2006-2007, the arts academy reformed the middle school cheerleading squad.

When in 1943 was assigned to Defence of the Nile Delta area it operated Hurricanes and a detachment of Spitfire fighters for high-altitude interceptions. In early 1944 it was completely equipped with Spitfires and based in Corsica. Now its mission changed to support operations in Italy and southern France, missions consisted mainly in escorting bombers and conducting armed reconnaissance patrols. In late 1944 it was transferred to the United Kingdom, where it was based until moved to Germany at the end of the war. When fighters were needed to defend the Northern Territory from the Japanese Australia started receiving American fighters but Australian government wanted RAF Spitfires to be deployed to Australia. Spitfire had better high altitude performance than the RAAF P-40 Kittyhawk and was considered by RAAF as the best fighter Australia could get. In 1942 RAAF 452 Squadron, RAAF 457 Squadron RAAF and RAF 54 Squadron were moved to Australia as 1st Wing RAAF. They saw a lot of combat over the first twelve months fighting Japanese bombers, recon and fighter sweeps. RAAF 79th Squadron was used in New Guinea and the Solomons campaign for protection of the airfields which the American heavy bombers used. In late 1943 79 Squadron relocated to Morotai. As Mk.V Spitfires were quickly worn out by combat operations in 1943 new Mk.VIII Spitfire started to arrive to RAAF. Unfortunately Spitfire plane was not rugged enough for the flying conditions of Northern Australia and the Pacific and had numerous technical and mechanical failures. It did not help that supporting Spitfire squadrons on remote Pacific islands proved to be a nightmare due to poor logistics.

In September 1943 it became a fighter-bomber unit with Spitfire Mk.IX. ;Czechoslovakian Air Force ;Czechoslovakian National Security Guard After the end of the war in late 1945 Czechoslovak RAF Spitfire squadrons were transferred to the Czechoslovak armed forces. All Free Czechoslovak Air Force squadrons were merged in 313 squadron, equipped with Spitfires MK.IX. They were the fighter force in the postwar Czechoslovak air force until Communist Putsch in 1948 removed all wartime serving Czechs pilots and planes from the air force placing them into prison camps or forced labour. The new communist government was supplied with Soviet fighters and hastily get rid of the Spitfires, selling them to Israel.

Egypt operated 26 Mk.V Spitfires from 1943 to 1949 and 38 Mk.IX planes from 1946 to 1955. In 1948 Spitfire Mk.IX was the main fighter in Egyptian Air Force, so they clashed with Israeli fighters. They also suffered heavy losses in attacks, as in May 1948 when Spitfires of 2 Sqn mistakenly attacked RAF base in Ramat David and lost five planes. From 1947. until 1956. the Egyptian Air Force operated some Spitfire Mk. 22 and one Mk. IX two seats trainer.

The three squadrons formed 1√®re Escadre de Chasse (1st Fighter Wing), with 20 Spitfires in each squadron. All were initially equipped with Spitfire Vs received from RAF, but later received other versions. These squadrons were based in Corsica from 1943 and covered the Allied landing in Southern France in August 1944. Later they moved to Alsace-Lorraine, supporting the First French Army advance into Germany. ;Armee de l'Air After world War two French Air Force had about 300 Spitfires in Europe. Some more were acquired by refurbishing spitfires found in North Africa scrap depots. First French used in Indochina war were spitfires. The RAF transferred 246 Squadron's Spitfire Mk. VIIIs to French Air Force. More were received from RAF surplus or were transferred from France ;Aviation Navale The French Aviation purchased Seafires to operate from ex-Royal Navy aircraft carriers H.M.S. Biter (future Dixmude) and Colossus (future Arromanches). France bought a first batch of 50 and a second batch of 65 Seafire Mk IIIs. Some Seafire XV planes were later bought to meet NATO missions. French Navy purchased a total of 179 Mk.III and 15 Mk.XV for Fighter Squadrons 1.F, 12.F and flights 10.S, 11.S, 54.S ; and also Rochefort school flight. Two squadrons were deployed on the carrier Arromanches in 1948 to fight in the Indochina War. Aviation Navale Seafires operated from land bases and from Arromanches on ground attack missions until January 1949. After returning to Europe Seafires were replaced with Seafire XVs and in 1950 these were replaced by Grumman F6F Hellcats.

IAF was highly successful in flying the Spitfire for bombing operations in the last stages of the war. When British India split into two countries in 1947 the IAF chose to include in its inventory the Spitfire but main combat aircraft in inventory was the Hawker Tempest. These Spitfires spent most of their career in the IAF as advanced trainers, although they were used in action during the invasion of Kashmir in light bombardment and tactical reconnaissance to interdict enemy lines of supply. ;Indian Air Force. * No.1 Squadron, IAF * No.2 Squadron, IAF * No.3 Squadron, IAF * No.4 Squadron, IAF * No.6 Squadron, IAF * No.7 Squadron, IAF * No.8 Squadron, IAF.This was the first Indian squadron to be equipped with Spitfires, tasked with defending the city of Calcutta, occasionally attacked by Japanese aircraft. * No.9 Squadron, IAF * No.10 Squadron, IAF * No.12 Squadron, IAF * No.14 Squadron, IAF * No.15 Squadron, IAF * No.16 Squadron, IAF * No.101 Squadron, IAF * No.1 Service Flying and Training School, Ambala * Conversion Training Unit IAF  ;Indonesian Air Force  Supermarine Spitfire T.9 163 of the Irish Air Corps at Baldonnel (Casement) airfield in 1967 The Irish Air Corps operated 12 LF.III Spitfires, in its de-navalised Seafire model between 1947‚Äì55, and were at once very popular with the crews.

Israel bought 59 Spitfire LF IXc from Czechoslovakia in 1948 to address its lack of fighters. They joined 101 Squadron and enhanced the IAF's combat capability, although only 17 arrived in time to fight. During the October offensive, Spitfires escorted Beaufighters and B-17s to attack El Arish airbase and other targets. They also intercepted Egyptian Spitfires and Machis, shooting down several. In 1952 an additional 35 LF IXc/e aircraft were purchased from Italy, at which time the Spitfire in IDF service was known as the \\"Yorek\\".

Due to these aircraft being misidentified frequently as Bf 109s by Soviet anti-aircraft artillery batteries and VVS fighters, a number of Spitfires were lost to \\"friendly fire\\". The Spitfire closely resembled Messerschmitt Bf 109 aircraft so Spitfire unit markings were made more prominent, however this did not appear to help (the 57th already displayed a yellow lightning bolt down the entire side of their fuselages) and the Mk.V was withdrawn from combat duties after only three months of service as part of defensive operations in the Kuban sector.Lend-lease on airforce.ru. (2006) Spitfires over the Kuban Igor Zlobin. Translation by James F. Gebhardt The Soviet Union was then supplied with some 1,200 Mk.IXs from 1943. Soviet pilots liked them but they did not suit Soviet combat tactics and the rough conditions at the forward airfields close to the front lines. Spitfires Mk. IXs were therefore assigned to air defence units, using the high altitude performance to intercept and pursue German bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. By 1944, the Spitfire IX was the main fighter used in this role and would remain so until 1947. The Soviet Air Force modified some Spitfires as two-seat trainers and in the post-war period some were used as trainers. ;Soviet Air Force *57th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment (April‚ÄìJune 1943) *821st Fighter Aviation Regiment (April‚ÄìJune 1943)  Supermarine Spitfire XIX at the Swedish Air Force Museum Soon after the end of the Second World War, the Swedish Air Force equipped a photo reconnaissance wing, F 11 in Nyk√∂ping (just south of Stockholm), with 50 Mk XIXs, designated S 31. Several S 31 photographic missions in the late 1940s entailed flagrant violations of Soviet ‚Äì and, at least once, Finnish ‚Äì airspace in order to document activities at the air and naval installations in the Baltic and Kola regions. At that time, no Soviet fighter was able to reach the operational altitude of the S 31. No Swedish planes were lost during those clandestine operations. However, by the early 1950s, Soviet air defenses had become so effective that such practices had to cease.Bortom Horisonten : Svensk Flygspaning mot Sovjetunionen 1946‚Äì1952 by Andersson, Lennart, Hellstr√∂m, Leif The S 31s were replaced by jet-powered SAAB S 29Cs in the mid-1950s. ;Swedish Air Force * F 11 photo reconnaissance wing  A derelict Syrian Spitfire at an unknown location. ;Syrian Air Force Syrian Government purchased 20 Spitfire Mk.22 in 1953.

Northern Aegean Sea map. The North Aegean islands are a number of disconnected islands in the north Aegean Sea, also known as the Northeast Aegean islands, belonging to Greece and Turkey. The islands do not form a physical chain or group, but are frequently grouped together for tourist or administrative purposes. To the south are the Dodecanese islands; and to the west are the Cyclades and Sporades islands. Within this group, the main islands in the northeastern Aegean Sea and along the Turkish coast are the Greek islands of Samos, Ikaria, Chios, Lesbos, Lemnos, Agios Efstratios, Psara, Fournoi Korseon, Oinousses and the Turkish islands of Imbros (G√∂k√ßeada), Tenedos (Bozcaada) and the Rabbit or Tav≈üan Islands. The main islands in the Thracian Sea in the far north are the Greek islands of Samothrace and Thasos. History From the Mesolithic Age, the North Aegean, as indeed the entire Aegean, ceased to be an obstacle and became a bridge joining the inhabitants of the region. Shipping, trade, economy, culture and social interactions developed in the archipelago and surrounding areas on the basis of communication and contact between the inhabitants. This was especially true after the permanent settlement of the islands 5000 years BC. The islands of the north Aegean were in such a position that shipping and trade contributed greatly to the development of a significant culture. The culture reaches its peak around 3000BC. The growth of settlements such as Poliochnis in Lemnos, Emporiou in Chios and Iraiou in Samos, amongst others, are evidence of the importance of these centers at this time. By ca. 2000 BC the Ionians had installed themselves in Chios while Samos and Lesvos are in the hands of the Achaeans. In the late 12th and early 11th centuries BC, a time when vast numbers of the people moved to Greece, the Aioleis arrived in Lesvos. From the 8th to the 5th century BC the islands enjoyed great prosperity in their economy, trade and the arts. The islands were conquered by the Persians in the Greco-Persian Wars in the 5th century BC. After their release in 468 BC they made an alliance with Athens. However, during the Peloponnesian War (429-404 BC ) their allegiance swayed between Athens and Sparta. In 338 BC the Macedonians came into power followed by Ptolemaic Egypt. After this period the islands suffered the same fate as the rest of Greece by becoming the province of the Roman Empire. During the Byzantine era there is calm in the North Aegean, but from the 7th century on this was disrupted by Arab raids. After the conquest of Constantinople by the Franks in 1204 the islands find themselves shared amongst the Venetians, Genoese and Frank princes (Frankokratia). Under this rule shipping and trade flourished. The fall of Constantinople in 1453 and the founding of the Ottoman Empire resulted in a period of destruction, plundering and persecution for the islands. The occupation also led to the decline of the Christian population. In the early 16th century the islands began to enjoy a period of prosperity. The inhabitants of the islands were actively involved in the Greek War of Independence and the emergence of leaders in the struggle such as Lykourgos Logothetis, Constantine Kanaris and Dimitrios Papanikolis brought about reprisals from the Turkish authorities. The massacres of Chios in 1822 and Psara in 1824 brought attention from European powers which helped the Greek cause. However, due to their position, close to the Asia Minor coast, the Turks did not let go of their hold on the islands easily. It was not until 1912 when the islands of the north Aegean were finally incorporated into the Greek state during the First Balkan War.

Entrance is by examination, except for the sixth form, where admission is based on GCSE results. The school gives means-tested bursaries to help with fees. Unlike many independent schools, BGS does not offer scholarships based on academic achievement. History The school was founded in 1548 and granted its Charter by King Charles II in 1662. Until 1975 it was a direct grant grammar school, and when this scheme was abolished it chose to become independent. The school motto is (Do This).Merriam-Webster definition of Hoc-Age The school grounds have been used as a helicopter landing ground by the royal family when they are visiting the local area due to its large fields. The most recent landing was by Prince William, in 2020. =Second World War= The new school building in Frizinghall was actually completed in 1939, however the start of the Second World prevented the building from being opened as a school. During the war, the main school building was used as a Primary Training Centre,The people's war A recollection by a soldier who was at BGS during the war and there is still evidence of this around the building. During this time, many BGS pupils were evacuated to Settle,The peoples war and returned when the building was released from army occupation and completed. Inside the school there is a large memorial to the former pupils who died in the war. =Frizinghall railway station= Frizinghall railway station closed in 1965 and remained closed for 22 years. During this time, staff and pupils at the school campaigned to get the station reopened, as they used it as their main source to school. In the end, it was due to the efforts of an English teacher, Robin Sisson, that the station was reopened. Faculty Headmaster, Simon Hinchliffe is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC). Education Bradford Grammar School In 2013, the pass rate for both GCSE (Grades A* ‚Äì C) and A-Levels was 99%. 31 courses are offered for A-Levels, and 97% of sixth-form pupils went on to study further education or deferred a year. The standard requirement for entry to the sixth form is nine B grades at GCSE, in 2008 the lower sixth had an average equivalent to ten A grades at GCSE. Facilities Over the past 15 years the school has completed a ¬£14 million buildings development programme. In 2001 the school built a multi-million pound Sixth Form Centre, funded primarily by Roger Evans and by pupil fundraising. Former pupil David Hockney contributed to the funding of the large theatre, where many school productions are performed, adjacent to the sports hall. The school's computing facilities have been updated regularly in the past few years, and the school now has ten IT suites. Extra- curricular activities=Sport= The school's first sport for boys is rugby union, and for girls it is netball or hockey. Other sports done at the school include squash, tennis, table-tennis, cross-country, swimming, water polo, cricket, and rowing on the River Aire. The school has an all-weather pitch used for hockey and football as well as nine courts used for netball and tennis. The ¬£1m pavilion, built in 2008, contains changing rooms and space for functions. The school has two squash courts (each with their own showers and changing rooms). BGS has four rugby pitches, which in the summer are converted into two cricket grounds. The school has an equipped gym with rowing machines, cycling machines, a treadmill and weights which was modernised in 2011. A 25m swimming pool is used for swimming and water polo training at lunchtimes and evenings. A further junior gym is used for fitness training and PE lessons. =Cadet Force= As an alternative or a supplement to extra-curricular sport, the school maintains a volunteer Combined Cadet Force. In the 1980s, this was reduced to just the Army contingent. However, the RAF section has since been reopened, and pupils now regularly fly and partake in RAF courses. The school owns its own 25-metre shooting range. In later years, the CCF has been regenerated by Squadron leader Dheeraj Bhasin, a former RAF pilot. =Music= Musical groups and clubs that run for pupils include: Senior Orchestra, Junior Orchestra, junior and senior choirs and chamber choirs, Close Harmony Group, Big Band, Concert Band, Samba Band, String Group, Dixieland Crackerjacks, junior and senior saxophone groups, and Soul Band.

Arts The interior walls of the school are decorated with artwork by pupils and a number of David Hockney's works are on display in public and private areas of the school. The music suite has several practice rooms and holds concerts throughout the year. A musical is staged every two years, in which the drama department works closely with the music department to produce a performance. The Hockney Theatre hosts a programme through the year and a full-time technician manages a student production team to service the performances. Curriculum evenings by the lower school drama groups or the A-Level Theatre Studies groups are placed between plays written specifically for pupils, Shakespeare performances, comedies and musicals.

Amtrak serves the Pomona station with thrice-weekly service provided by the Sunset Limited and Texas Eagle combined service; Metrolink's Riverside Line runs a commute schedule to and from Los Angeles on weekdays. History Exterior view of the previous Pomona Railroad Station, ca.1906 The 1940 station was designed by Donald Parkinson in the Mission Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival styles. Utahrails.net: Union Pacific's Parkinson Depots Details include stuccoed walls, an arcade and red clay tile roofs.Great American Stations. Accessed February 15, 2013. It once served the main Southern Pacific Railroad line from Los Angeles to New Orleans, and the main Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad line. Currently both lines are now Union Pacific Railroad lines. Train service Metrolink has served Downtown Pomona station since February 5, 2001. In fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2015, an average of 221 passengers boarded Riverside Line Metrolink trains at Downtown Pomona station daily. Metrolink trains board at the south platform, across the pedestrian bridge. Approximately 300 parking spaces are available for Metrolink passengers. Originally a center platform was created for additional Metrolink service facing track 2, but was abandoned around 2006 due to declining ridership. Amtrak trains board at the North platform facing Track 3, near the station building. There are no Amtrak personnel at the station, but tickets can be picked up from the Metrolink ticket vending machines at the station so long as reservations are made in advance, either on Amtrak's web site, or via telephone. Amtrak serves the station following a Union Pacific-owned freight route which redirects through El Monte and Baldwin Park to connect to the Monte Vista Rail Corridor, rather than follow the route of the Riverside Line. Of the 77 California stations served by Amtrak, Pomona had the lowest passenger traffic in Fiscal Year 2015, boarding or detraining 1,812, which corresponds to an average of approximately 5 passengers daily due to inconvenient travel times to and from Los Angeles. The different Pomona (North) station serves the ex Southern Pacific, Pacific Electric and Santa Fe Lines, now the Metrolink San Bernardino line. =Platforms and tracks=Connecting bus service Foothill Transit uses the station as a transit center for the area, with extensive connections throughout the San Gabriel Valley. The bus depot is located near the main station building, adjacent to the North platform. Foothill operates a transit store and information center in the station building. Lines 195, 197, 286, 291, 292, 480, 482, 852, and 855 provide local bus service, while the Silver Streak provides express service to Downtown Los Angeles. A special bus during the Los Angeles County Fair line 22 is operational on weekends the fair is open. Omnitrans operates route 61 to the Pomona station. Foothill passes are accepted for one trip on Omnitrans, and Omni passes are accepted for one trip on Foothill at the station. Both operators provide free rides for passengers holding a valid Metrolink ticket or pass.

Built in 1831, it was located at Wolf Point in the present day Loop community area at the intersection of the north, south and main branches of the Chicago River. The location at West Lake Street and North Wacker Drive (formerly Market Street) was designated a Chicago Landmark on November 6, 2002. The hotel changed proprietors often in its twenty-year existence and briefly served as Chicago's first theater. It was named after Sauganash, an interpreter in the British Indian Department. History Thompson's original 1830 58-block plat of Chicago showing the intersection of the branches of the Chicago River Mark and Monique Beaubien, the owners and builders of the hotel, were French Indian traders. In 1826 they moved to Chicago on the advice of Mark's elder brother Jean, an established trader who lived next to Fort Dearborn. The Beaubiens settled in a small cabin on Wolf's Point and also traded with the Native Americans and other travelers to the growing settlement. They built a tavern on the east bank of the south branch of the Chicago River at the point where the north and south branches meet. The tavern initially was named the Eagle Exchange Tavern. In 1831, they added a frame to the log structure to create Chicago's first hotel, the Sauganash Hotel. When completed, it was one of only two residential structures on the south side of the main branch of the Chicago River, the other being that of his brother, Col. Jean B. Beaubien. The settlement had only twelve houses at the time. The hostelry immediately became famous,\\"At this date, Chicago was a village of only twelve houses\\" ‚Äì Frank Alfred Randall, John D. Randall (1999). History of the development of building construction in Chicago. University of Illinois Press. . p. 8. and when reconstructed later became the city's largest and finest hotel. Immediately adjacent to the hotel's public bar was Chicago's first drug store. The Greek Revival trim of the new hotel contrasted with the other eleven buildings of Chicago. The symmetry of its facade was typical to contemporary Greek Revival practiced on the East Coast. Juliette Kinzie, who came to Chicago from Connecticut in 1831, described it as \\"a pretentios white two-story building, with bright blue wood shutters, the admiration of all the little circle at Wolf Point\\". The hostelry's clientele transcended race, with natives and settlers enjoying each other's company. The flow of travelers and settlers intensified with the end of the Black Hawk War in 1832.Keating, Ann Durkin (2005). Chicagoland: city and suburbs in the railroad age. University of Chicago Press. . pp. 39‚Äì40. In 1833 the hotel housed election of the first town trustees of the newly formed Town of Chicago. Beaubien kept the Hotel until 1834 and during his ownership he regularly entertained guests with his violin. On August 18, 1835, two years after the Potawatomi natives signed the treaty agreeing to be moved to a reservation beyond the Mississippi River in northwestern Missouri, they selected 800 braves to perform their last war dance parade on a path that passed in front of the hotel. In 1835, a Mr. Davis assumed control of the hotel, which subsequently had a series of proprietors. The building briefly served as Chicago's first theater, and hosted the first Chicago Theatre company in November 1837 in an abandoned dining room. By 1839, it returned to service as a hotel, but was destroyed by fire in 1851, and subsequently torn down. The Wigwam was built in its place nine years later. Honoree Billy Caldwell \\"Sauganash\\", who served as an interpreter for the Indian Agents, was the honoree of the hotel. Born in approximately 1780, \\"Sauganash\\" was half native-american whose father was Colonel Caldwell, an Irish officer in the British Army stationed at Detroit; his mother was a Pottawatomi. He was schooled at a Jesuit school in Detroit, where he learned English and French. Caldwell learned several Indian dialects. Billy Caldwell's Indian Name was \\"Straight Tree\\", but he was known by \\"Sauganash\\", meaning Englishman in the Potawatomi language. As a warrior, Sauganash was under the influence of Tecumseh until his death in 1813, and he rose to the level of a Captain in the British Indian Department during the War of 1812. Theater In 1834 (three years before Chicago incorporated as a city), the hotel hosted the first professional public performance in Chicago at a cost of $.50 ($ today) for adults and $.25 for children. The show promised a wide variety of talents including ventriloquism. In the following two years, several traveling showmen performed at the hotel. In 1837, the Chicago Theater, which was the first local theater company, set up shop in the hotel's abandoned dining room. Co-managers Harry Isherwood and Alexander McKinzie procured an amusement license for the company from the city council, and it began performing a different billed show every night starting in late October or early November for approximately six weeks. The plays included titles The Idiot Witness, The Stranger, and The Carpenter of Rouen. Production of The Stranger took place in the dining room of the hotel. Following a six-week engagement, the company went on tour until the following spring, when it returned to a different local venue.

A modicum of practical travel information, with recommended restaurants and hotels, is also generally included. The first Blue Guide ‚Äì London and its Environs ‚Äì was published in 1918 by the Scottish brothers James and Findlay Muirhead. The Muirheads had for many years been the English-language editors of the famous German Baedeker series. When they also acquired the rights to John Murray III‚Äôs famous travel ‚Äúhandbooks‚Äù they established the Blue Guides as heir to the great 19th century guide book tradition. History=Precursors= In 1828, Karl Baedeker (1801‚Äì59) published his first guidebook, Rheinreise von Mainz bis C√∂ln and in 1836 John Murray III‚Äôs (1808‚Äì92) first Handbook was released (Handbook for Travellers on the Continent). The first Baedeker in English, The Rhine (1861), was published jointly by Baedeker and Murray. These handbooks were to become the standard for English travellers for the remainder of the 19th Century. James Muirhead (1853‚Äì1934) began working for Baedeker in 1878, preparing a Handbook for Travellers to London. Findlay Muirhead (1860‚Äì1935), graduate of the University of Edinburgh, left his studies at Leipzig in 1887 to join his brother at Baedeker. For almost the next 30 years the brothers were responsible for all English language Baedekers, including compiling guides to Britain, the US and Canada. Following the outbreak of World War I, the Muirhead brothers found themselves out of a job. They acquired the rights to Murray‚Äôs Handbooks in 1915 from the cartographical publisher Edward Stanford, who had bought them 14 years earlier from John Murray IV. In the same year they established their company, Muirhead‚Äôs Guide-books Limited. =The Blue Guides and the Guides Bleu= A 1917 agreement with French publisher Hachette allowed co-publication in English and French of guidebooks under the names Blue Guides and Guides Bleus, respectively. Hachette‚Äôs existing Guides Joannes had blue covers, while Baedeker‚Äôs guides had red covers. The first Blue Guide, Blue Guide London and its Environs, was published in 1918. Two years later, Hachette published Guide Bleu Londres et ses Environs. The Hachette relationship with the Blue Guides ended in 1933. =1931-82= The Blue Guides were acquired by Ernest Benn Limited in 1931. (Litellus) Russell Muirhead (1896-1976), Findlay‚Äôs son, became the series editor in 1934. He retired in 1963, remaining a consulting editor until 1965 when the Muirhead family‚Äôs connection with the series ended. In 1963, Stuart Rossiter (1923-82) was appointed editor and in 1967 the first of Rossiter‚Äôs ‚Äúscrupulously edited guides, compiled for the independent educated traveller wanting to avoid the monotony of international uniformity‚Äù (Blue Guide Greece) was compiled by Rossiter himself and published. Blue Guide Rome and Environs, by Alta Macadam, was released in 1971. Her Italy titles thereafter become some of the best selling Blue Guides and included Sicily (1975), Northern Italy (1978), Florence (1982), Venice (1980), Tuscany (1993), and Umbria (1993), all frequently updated and re-issued. Other key Blue Guide authors are and have been Ian Robertson (Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Austria, Switzerland, Cyprus, France, & Paris and Versailles), John Tomes (Scotland, Wales), Ian Ousby (England), Paul Blanchard (Italy). =1982 to present= In 1982, W.W. Norton of New York became the United States co-publisher, selling all Blue Guides in that country. Two years later, the Blue Guides were acquired by A&C; Black (Publishers) Limited, themselves later acquired by Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, publishers of the Harry Potter books among others. In 2004, Somerset Books, a small, London-based, family-owned travel publisher known for its Visible Cities guides, acquired the Blue Guides. A year later published its first original title, Blue Guide Northern Italy.

Plot Overweight, depressed improv actor James (Jeff Garlin) is a Second City cast member in Chicago. He lives with his mother and cheats on his diet. He quits his acting job on a sleazy television prank show, his girlfriend, Andrea (Rebecca Sage Allen), breaks up with him, and his agent, Herb (Richard Kind), dumps him. When he visits his friend's daughter's elementary school for Career Day, he rambles about his problems, boring the kids, and embarrassing himself in front of the teacher, Stella (Bonnie Hunt). James relaxes in the evenings by lying on the hood of his car parked \\"in a great spot\\" beside Wrigley Field, and during the days by walking around the North Side of Chicago with his friend Luca (David Pasquesi), appreciating the buildings. While wearing a pirate costume for a hot dog stand, James hears about a Chicago-based remake of Paddy Chayefsky's 1955 Marty, his favorite film, and one that mirrors his adult life. He knows the director but cannot get an audition. After walking out on his Compulsive Eaters Anonymous meeting, James goes to an ice cream parlor, where he meets \\"big-time hottie\\" Beth (Sarah Silverman), who recognizes him from Second City and offers him free ice cream. She asks him an obscurely lewd question, which she then cheerfully explains. James, smitten, returns to the shop, where Beth takes him on adventures, including a shopping trip for her to try on underwear. They meet later after one of his comedy performances. One thing leads to another, and Beth volunteers to return to James's (and his mother's) apartment, where they have sex. A day later, Beth succinctly dispatches James when he shows up at her apartment. Beth explains that she had just never been with a fat guy. Meanwhile, his role in Marty is given to a clueless young actor, real-life teen idol Aaron Carter. As the story ends, James moves to his own apartment. He reconnects with Stella, the elementary school teacher, and continues acting.

He shot it in 18 days, but those days were spread out over two years,\\" reported the Associated Press. IFC Films released the film on a non-traditional schedule, called \\"IFC First Take\\", part of IFC in Theaters. It appeared on pay-per-view cable television simultaneously with a limited theatrical release, in September 2007. The DVD followed about seven months later, April 15, 2008. In the meantime, IFC made a deal with Blockbuster, giving the video chain 60 days of exclusive rental and video on demand rights on each film. During interviews on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and Wait Wait‚Ä¶ Don't Tell Me!, Garlin said that the title bothers Larry David because it ends in a preposition. Critical reception Rotten Tomatoes gave I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With a \\"fresh\\" rating of 73% with 36 positive reviews and 13 negative ones. The New York Times called the \\"rambling\\" film \\"laid back and affectionate\\". In an appreciative review, Chicago-based Roger Ebert called it \\"a minor movie, but a big-time minor movie... If there is such a thing as a must-see three-star movie, here it is.\\" However, John Maynard in The Washington Post scorned the movie, writing, \\"A better awkward title would be 'Random Events of a Failed Actor Plodding the Streets of Chicago.'\\" ReferencesExternal links  Category:2006 films Category:2006 independent films Category:2006 romantic comedy films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:English-language films Category:Films about actors Category:Films directed by Jeff Garlin Category:Films set in Chicago Category:Films shot in Chicago Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:The Weinstein Company films Category:2006 directorial debut films ","title":"I Want Someone to Eat Cheese With"},{"id":"10327149","text":"The Ballad of Lawless Soirez is the solo debut album of Louisiana musician Gill Landry, released in 2007 by Nettwerk Records.

Along with Nosema apis, it causes the disease nosemosis, the most widespread of the diseases of adult honey bees. N. ceranae can remain dormant as a long-lived spore which is resistant to temperature extremes and dehydration. This fungus has been shown to act in a synergistic fashion with diverse insecticides such as fipronil or neonicotinoids, by increasing the toxicity of pesticides for bees, leading to higher bee mortality. It may thus play an indirect role in colony collapse disorder.Aufauvre J., Biron D. G., Vidau C., Fontbonne R., Roudel M., Diogon M., Vigu√®s B., Belzunces L. P., Delbac F., Blot N.

Scientific reports, 7(1), 8556. Range Nosema ceranae was first described in 1996 and was identified as a disease of Apis mellifera in 2004 in Taiwan.(Huang et al., 2007; submitted in 2005 but published in 2007). Since its emergence in honeybees, N. ceranae has been identified in bumblebee species in South America, China, and England where infection studies indicate N. ceranae has a higher virulence in bumblebees than honeybees. Researchers in Spain have analysed samples of Apis mellifera, the European honey bee, mostly sent from colonies suffering unexpected decreases in bee population per hive or lower honey production, as reported by the beekeepers during the last two to three years. In 2004, 90% of some 3,000 samples had positive results for N. ceranae. In 2005, of 800 samples, 97% had positive results. During 2006, both France and Germany have detected the disease and recognized the genetic sequence of N. ceranae in their respective territories. In the United States, N. ceranae has been detected in honey bees from Nebraska, Wisconsin, Arkansas, New York, and South Dakota using PCR of the 16S gene.Chapon, L., M.D. Ellis, and A.L. Szalanski. 2009. Nosema and tracheal mites in the north central region ‚Äì 2008 survey. Proceedings of the American Bee Research Conference. American Bee Journal 149: 585-586.Population genetics and distribution of N. ceranae in the United States, University of Arkansas Social Insect Genetics Lab In New York, N. ceranae was detected in 49 counties, and of the 1200 honey bee samples collected, 528 (44%) were positive for Nosema, from which, PCR analysis of 371 spore positive samples revealed that 96% were N. ceranae, 3% had both N. ceranae and N. apis, and 1% had N. apis only.Szalanski, A.L., J. Whitaker, and P. Cappy. 2010. Molecular diagnostics of Nosema ceranae and N. apis from honey bees in New York. Proceedings of the American Bee Research Conference. American Bee Journal 150: 508 Effects on bees This pathogen has been tentatively linked to colony collapse disorder, a phenomenon reported primarily from the United States, since fall of 2006. Highly preliminary evidence of N. ceranae was reported in a few hives in the Central Valley area of California. \\"Tests of genetic material taken from a \\"collapsed colony\\" in Merced County point to a once-rare microbe that previously affected only Asian bees but might have evolved into a strain lethal to those in Europe and the United States.\\" The researcher did not, however, believe this was conclusive evidence of a link to CCD; \\"We don't want to give anybody the impression that this thing has been solved.\\" A USDA bee scientist has similarly stated, \\"while the parasite nosema ceranae may be a factor, it cannot be the sole cause. The fungus has been seen before, sometimes in colonies that were healthy.\\" Likewise, a Washington State beekeeper familiar with N. ceranae in his own hives discounts it as being the cause of CCD. In early 2009, Higes et al. reported an association between CCD and N. ceranae was established free of confounding factors, and that weakened colonies treated with fumagillin recovered. News articles published in October 2010 quoted researchers who had discovered that Nosema fungus had joined with a previously unsuspected virus, invertebrate iridescent virus, or IIV6, dealing test bee colonies a lethal blow. Neither the fungus nor the virus alone kills all the test group, but the two combined do. Both the fungus and the virus are found with high frequency in hives that have suffered CCD. Final testing is in progress with field tests on colonies. N. ceranae and N. apis have similar lifecycles, but they differ in spore morphology. Spores of N. ceranae seem to be slightly smaller under the light microscope and the number of polar filament coils is between 20 and 23, rather than the more than 30 often seen in N. apis. The disease afflicts adult bees and depopulation occurs with consequent losses in honey production. One does not detect symptoms of diarrhea as in N. apis. The most significant difference between the two types is how quickly N. ceranae can cause a colony to die. Bees can die within 8 days after exposure to N. ceranae,(Higes et al. 2006) a finding not yet confirmed by other researchers. The forager caste seems the most affected, leaving the colony presumably to forage, but never returning. This results in a reduced colony consisting mostly of nurse bees with their queen, a state very similar to that seen in CCD. Little advice on treatment is available, but it has been suggested that the most effective control of N. ceranae is the antibiotic fumagillin as recommended for N. apis. The genome of N. ceranae was sequenced in 2009. This should help scientists trace its migration patterns, establish how it became dominant, and help measure the spread of infection by enabling diagnostic tests and treatments to be developed. Treatment N. ceranae is apparently released from the suppressive effects of fumagillin at higher concentrations than that of N. apis. At fumagillin concentrations that continue to impact honey bee physiology, N. ceranae thrives and doubles its spore production. The current application protocol for fumagillin may exacerbate N. ceranae infection rather than suppress it. Fumagillin application should be a major cause of N. ceranae dominance in this time.

It was built in 1754 in the late Mughal Empire style for Nawab Safdarjung. The monument has an ambience of spaciousness and an imposing presence with its domed and arched red brown and white coloured structures. Safdarjung, Nawab of Oudh, was made prime minister of the Mughal Empire (Wazir ul-Mamlak-i-Hindustan) when Ahmed Shah Bahadur ascended the throne in 1748. Isometric view of Safdarjung Tomb Geography The tomb is located near the Safdarjung Airport at the T junction of Lodhi Road and Aurobindo Marg (earlier name Mehrauli Road) in New Delhi. Background Safdar Jung The structure was constructed in 1754 in the late Mughal Empire style Safdarjung. Mirza Muqim Abul Mansur Khan, who was popularly known as Safadarjung, who ruled over Awadh was an independent ruler of Awadh as viceroy of Muhammad Shah. He was very rich and most powerful. With the death of Emperor Muhammad Shah of Mughal Empire, he moved to Delhi. When Mohammed Shah Ahmed Shah ascended the throne of the Mughal Empire in Delhi in 1748, Safdarjung was made the Prime Minister (Vazir) of the empire with the title of Vazir ul-Mamalk-i-Hindustan and at that time the empire was on decline as their rule extended only to North India. As Vazir he usurped all powers under his control as the king was only a puppet, a figurehead, who was into enjoying life with wine, opium and women. But his control over the emperor‚Äôs family was so cruel that the emperor called the Marathas to rid of their Vazir. The Marathas drove Safdarjung out of Delhi in 1753. He died soon thereafter in 1754. After his death his son Nawab Shujaud Daula pleaded with the Mughal Emperor to permit him to erect a tomb for his father in Delhi. He then built the tomb, which was designed by an Abyssininan architect.It was built by Bilal Muhammad Khan, at the cost of three lacs of rupees.https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.69530/page/n208/mode/1up To the south of this tomb is the historic site of the battle that was fought in 1386 between Timur of Mangol and Mohammed Tughlaq when the latter was defeated. Architecture Three-domed mosque within the complex to the right side of the entrance gate The Safdarjung tomb, the last monumental tomb garden of the Mughals, was planned and built like an enclosed garden tomb in line with the style of the Humayun tomb. It was completed in 1754. The slabs from the tomb of Abdul Rahim Khankhana were used in the construction of the tomb. The tomb has four key features which are: The Char Bagh plan with the mausoleum at the center, a ninefold floor plan, a five-part fa√ßade and a large podium with a hidden stairway. Isometric view of the mausoleum A view of the tomb from entrance The main entry gate to the tomb is two-storied and its fa√ßade has very elaborate ornamentation over plastered surfaces and is in ornate purple colour. There is an inscription in Arabic on the surface and its translation reads \\"When the hero of plain bravery departs from the transitory, may he become a resident of god‚Äôs paradise\\". The rear side of the fa√ßade, which is seen after entering through the gate, has many rooms and the library. To the right of the gate is the mosque which is a three-domed structure marked with stripes. Ceiling at the entrance of the tomb. Entering through the main gate gives a perfect view of the mausoleum. Its walls are built high and the central dome, which is the main mausoleum of Safdarjung, is built over a terrace. Red and buff stones are the materials used for building the main mausoleum which measures square. The central chamber, square in shape, has eight partitions with a cenotaph in the middle. Here there are partitions in rectangular shape and the corner partitions are in octagonal shape. The interior of the tomb is covered with rococo plaster with decorations. There are four towers around the main tomb at the corners which are polygonal in shape and are provided with kiosks. They have marble panels which are faded, and decorated arches. There is an underground chamber in the mausoleum which houses the graves of Safadrjung and his wife. The ceiling of the mosque has been plastered, painted and ornamented. The fa√ßade, though built in the style of the Taj Mahal, lacks symmetry as the vertical axis has been given prominence which has resulted in an unbalanced appearance to the tomb. The dome is more elongated; the central part has a taller pishtaq. The four minarets at the four corners are part of the main mausoleum which was totally a different concept in elevation compared to the Taj Mahal where the towers are detached and away from the facade of the tomb. The architecture of the tomb is praised and also derided; it is derided for the lack of proportioning of its various units and use of poor material for construction. Reginald Heber, who was Bishop of Calcutta between 1823 and 1826, based on the light brown colour of the stone used, had observed that the tomb has the \\"colour of potted meat\\". Even ASI has observed that the marble used for ornamentation in the towers though pleasing is \\"rather florid\\". Another observation is that the tomb can not be compared to the Taj Mahal or the Humayun Tomb, as, at the time it was built, the Mughal Empire was on the decline and sandstone had to be used and lines were set improperly and the quality appeared \\"thread bare\\". Garden The large square garden surrounding the tomb is surrounded by a wall that is approximately long on each side. The layout is in the form of four squares with wide footpaths and water tanks, which have been further subdivided into smaller squares. The garden is in the Mughal charbagh garden style, and is a smaller version of the garden of the Humayun Tomb which is also built in Delhi. One channel leads to the entrance gate and the other leads to the three pavilions. The main podium over which the mausoleum is built measures on each side. The high walls have been built in rubble stone masonry and have recessed arches in the interior. The towers or chatris are octagonal in shape. Its overall layout consists of four pavilions which have multiple chambers and the entrance gateway to the east is impressive. On the eastern side adjoining the gate are many apartments and a mosque, and a courtyard. The pavilions are laid out in the western, northern and southern directions and are named Jangli Mahal (palace in the forest), Moti Mahal (pearl palace) and Badshah Pasand (King‚Äôs favorite) respectively. Nawab‚Äôs family used to reside in these pavilions. Now the entire monument is under the control of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) who have their offices in the pavilions and also a library over the main gate Recent times On 21 August 2012, the then Health Minister of India, Ghulam Nabi Azad offered Eid prayers in a mosque in the complex. However under the law of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), \\"prayers at centrally protected monuments are not allowed unless the practice was prevalent at the time when it was notified as protected\\" and it is one of the 174 protected monument of ASI in Delhi. Earlier also, Indian vice president Hamid Ansari \\"planned to offer Eid prayers\\" at the tomb but was cancelled at the \\"eleventh hour\\". Tomb of Safdarjung The tomb has four fountains on each of the four sides. In December 2013, it was reported that a plan was going on for \\"activating the fountains\\" as officials believed that they \\"were in working condition\\". But \\"in recent excavation\\", ASI unearthed a drainage system adjacent to the fountain. The system would \\"help them restart these\\". Though there are four fountains, but according to ASI, only one, which is opposite to the main entrance would be made \\"functional\\". In June 2014, the ASI shifted their office from the tomb to General Pool Offices near the Indian National Army Colony. In November of the same year new visitor boards were installed in the tomb to \\"promote the lesser known but striking monuments in the city [ Delhi ]\\". The 2013 Hollywood film, Jobs, was shot in the tomb.

He was co-founder of the Journal of Biological Chemistry. Life Christian Archibald Herter was born in Glenville, Connecticut. His father, also Christian Herter, was a notable and wealthy artist and interior designer, head of the Herter Brothers. He was privately educated and began his medical degree at the early age of 15. By the age of 18, he had received an MD from the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. He studied pathology under William H. Welch at Johns Hopkins University and traveled to Zurich to study under Auguste-Henri Forel. Herter initially practiced mainly neurological medicine in New York City. His experience was captured in The Diagnosis of Diseases of the Nervous System, a manual he wrote for \\"students and practitioners\\" in 1892. Herter's interest in laboratory medicine led him to relinquish his medical practice and build a laboratory in the fourth floor of his house on 819 Madison Avenue. In 1897, he was appointed professor of Pathological Chemistry at University and Bellevue Hospital Medical College. His lectures were published in 1902. Herter returned to his alma mater in 1903 as Professor of Pharmacology and Therapeutics. It was during this time that he researched diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. His work on celiac disease, which he called \\"intestinal infantilism\\", led to the eponym Gee-Herter disease. His important contribution was to highlight the retarded growth of affected children. Herter's theory as to the cause ‚Äì that it was due to overgrowth and persistence of gram-positive bacterial flora normally belonging to the nursling period ‚Äì failed to gain acceptance. However, he did correctly identify that any \\"attempt to encourage growth by the use of increased amounts of carbohydrates\\" led to relapse. This would later be discovered to be due to the gluten content of wheat. Herter was instrumental in the organization of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research and was on its original Board of Scientific Directors. In 1905, along with John Jacob Abel, he co-founded and edited the Journal of Biological Chemistry. Herter financed the loss-making journal until his death, whereupon a fund was created in his memory to support it. Herter married Susan Dows in 1885, and fathered three daughters (Mary, Christine, and Susan), and two sons died in infancy. Mary Dows became a noted publisher, Christine Herter became a painter, and Susan married the artist Ernest Benham Dielman. Christian Herter died aged 45 of a neurological wasting disease, possibly myasthenia gravis. Henry Drysdale Dakin, who had worked in Herter's lab since 1905, married Herter's widow in 1916. They moved the house and laboratory in the 1920s to a newly constructed estate named Edgehill, at Scarborough-on-Hudson, near Scarsdale, New York and continued Herter's unfinished research. The Christian A. Herter Lectures In 1903, Herter established a memorial lectureship in remembrance of his second son Albert, who died the previous year at the age of 2. In addition, he established a similar lectureship at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The lecture series began in 1904 and has continued yearly since. The lectures are given at the New York University School of Medicine, under the sponsorship of the Department of Biochemsitry. The lecturers are by invitation, and over the years have included some of the most illustrious members of the scientific community, such as Nobel Prize laureates Albrecht Kossel and Konrad Emil Bloch.

It was Palmer's first Top 40 hit in the U.S., reaching #16. The song was written by Andy Fraser. Palmer released a re-mixed version of this song on his 1992 compilation album Addictions: Volume 2, as the lead single from that album, ultimately becoming a radio hit peaking at Number 8 on the U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary charts. Most noteworthy is the near- absence of Bob Babbitt's bass-heavy guitar hook, replaced by an acoustic guitar figure, giving it an \\"unplugged\\" feel as was the fashion at the time by well-established artists remaking past hits as acoustic numbers. With its blend of Caribbean steel pan, violins and moving lyrics, \\"Every Kinda People\\" has become one of Palmer's best-loved songs, covered multiple times by other artists (including The Mint Juleps (1987), Randy Crawford (1989), Chaka Demus and Pliers (1996), Amy Grant (1996), Jo O'Meara (2002), Joe Cocker (2004) and Ana Popovic (2013)), and cited by music fans and spiritual groups for its positive message of peace and multiculturalism.

History Figaro is probably best known as the pet cat of Geppetto and Pinocchio. Figaro was Walt Disney's favorite character in Pinocchio; he loved the kitten so much, he wanted him to appear as much as possible. Figaro later starred independently in a number of Disney shorts, as the pet cat of an unnamed African-American woman similar to Tom and Jerry's Mammy Two Shoes, and later Minnie Mouse, as it was common for Disney characters to be transposed from movies to cartoon shorts. Three of the cartoons he appeared in were his own cartoons; \\"Figaro and Cleo\\" (1943), \\"Bath Day\\" (1946) and \\"Figaro and Frankie\\" (1947). Similar to Pluto, Figaro is one of the few Disney characters who is not anthropomorphized, but just a normal cat. He has a cameo in Disney's Alice in Wonderland as a caterpillar being annoyed by a copper centipede bearing resemblance to a dog. Figaro has appeared periodically in Disney comics, in Pinocchio adaptations as well as in his own stories set in the present day of Mouseton. Adaptations of Bath Day and Figaro and Frankie were published in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #73 (Oct 1946) and #79 (April 1947) respectively. He was used very sparingly in the 1950s, but in five issues of Walt Disney Comics Digest, he had a bimonthly column on types of cats called Figaro's Feline Friends, from issue #17 (Nov 1969) to #25 (Oct 1970). Since the late 1990s, Figaro has occasionally popped up in Dutch Disney comics as a story's lead character. Figaro was going to have a cameo in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but was later dropped for unknown reasons. After nearly a 50-year hiatus of not being in any new Disney cartoons, Figaro, like many other Disney characters of the 1940s and 1950s, was cast as a customer in Disney's House of Mouse. While the video game Kingdom Hearts featured a level taking place inside Monstro's belly and included Pinocchio, Geppetto and Cleo, Figaro was absent, but appeared in the manga based on the first game. Figaro's most recent appearance has been in several episodes of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and Minnie's Bow-Toons, as her pet cat. It could possibly be a different cat named Figaro as Cleo, his counterpart, is never seen.  In the parks  Figaro can be found all over the Disney theme parks, including Pinocchio's Daring Journey and Celebrate A Dreams Come True Parade. At Fantasy Faire in Disneyland, Figaro can be seen sleeping in a window of one of the buildings. He is occasionally awoken by a caged bird that chirps familiar Disney songs. In the Pinocchio's Village Haus restaurant, he appears in various murals retelling the Pinocchio Story, as well as serving as the namesake of Figaro Fries and appearing over the exit. A design flaw led to the exit signs not being properly centered at the Disneyland version of the restaurant, so Figaro is shown pulling the sign on a rope to fix things. At Disneyland Paris, the problem was corrected and Figaro is shown leaning on the exit sign giving a thumbs up. His namesake is also used in a shop called Figaro's Clothiers located in the Mediterranean Harbor at Tokyo DisneySea.  Personality  Figaro is based on and acts like an immature and spoiled little boy. He is easily angered but deep down has a heart of gold. He takes a disliking to many things including, but not limited to, waiting, baths, being made a fool of, dogs and giving Cleo a goodnight kiss. In the shorts, his character was made less cuddly and more malicious. He is a prime rival of Pluto as the two are constantly seen battling each other for different things, most notably Minnie's affections. Figaro usually enjoys tormenting Pluto when no one's around but occasionally learns to make peace with the dog. In recent years, Figaro and Pluto's relationship become a lot less hostile; nowadays, the little kitten looks up to the big dog. In his modern appearances in Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and Minnie's BowToons, his personality changes as he becomes more well behaved. He acts as a close friend and confidant to Minnie, often sleeping in her shop while she works. His roles in the show have been minor so far. His enemies include Monstro, Pete and sometimes Pluto in select shorts.

Life and career Lagercrantz was born in Stockholm, Sweden, the son of bank director Carl Lagercrantz and Countess Agnes Hamilton. He married Martina Ruin (born 1921), daughter of Professor Hans Ruin and Karin Sievers, in 1939. Lagercrantz is the father of actress Marika Lagercrantz and author David Lagercrantz. His sister Lis Asklund was an author, social worker, curator, and program producer for Sveriges Radio. His nephews Lars L√∂nnroth and Johan L√∂nnroth are also famous in their own right. Lagercrantz commanded considerable influence as a critic and publicist. He became an expert of sorts in literary biography, and several of his studies on important Swedish writers are still cornerstones of Swedish literary studies, in particular, his biography of August Strindberg (1979) and his portrait of his friend Gunnar Ekel√∂f, Jag bor i en annan v√§rld men du bor ju i samma. During the latter part of his professional life, Lagercrantz' concerns in his role as literary critic and cultural pundit progressed from the strictly aesthetic to the political. In 1958, he published a biography of the late poet Stig Dagerman which was severely criticized by a young Beppe Wolgers for being confined to Dagerman's \\"dark predicament\\" and not completely representing a man \\"who paid such great interest to cinema as well as football\\". Lagercrantz' political engagement became apparent during his time at Dagens Nyheter, where he was head of the cultural section from 1951 and editor-in-chief from 1960 on. He was an influential, albeit controversial, voice in the political and cultural radicalism of the 1960s and 1970s, assuming a crucial role in the national secularization debate. Lagercrantz in his public role gave rise to strong emotions. His cultural radicalism in particular was perceived as provocative in light of his aristocratic background (his mother belonged to the noble Hamilton family). Lagercrantz was widely criticized for the conciliatory and fairly positive appraisals of Communism that he published in Dagens Nyheter after travelling as a journalist to the Soviet Union and China. Lagercrantz dwelt on parts of this in his autobiographical works. His upper- class childhood and adolescence are the subject of Min f√∂rsta krets (1982), and the turbulence of his time at Dagens Nyheter is the topic of his memoir Ett √•r p√• sextiotalet (1990). Olof Lagercrantz grew up in Falk√∂ping and in 2001 was awarded the title of Honorary Resident of Skaraborg by the Skaraborg Academy in tribute to the fact he had wielded one of the mightiest pens of the 20th century.

Biography Campbell was born in Argyll, Scotland, on 1 October 1906, the son of Col Duncan Campbell of Inverneill (on Loch Fyne) and Ethel Harriet Waterbury, an American.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf He was educated at Cargilfield School in Edinburgh and then Rugby in England.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-john-lorne- campbell-1345284.html He then attended St John's College, Oxford studying Rural Economy and Celtic, graduating in 1929 and receiving an MA in 1933. During this time, Prof John Fraser engendered a strong love of Gaelic and Scots folklore.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-john- lorne-campbell-1345284.html In the 1930s Campbell was living on the Hebridean island of Barra where, with the author Compton Mackenzie, he founded the Sea League to fight for the rights of local fisherman and organised a strike of motorists in protest at having to pay tax on an island with no made-up roads. In 1935 he married the American musician Margaret Fay Shaw, whom he met on the island of South Uist. In 1938 the couple bought the island of Canna, south of Skye, and went to live there in Canna House. He farmed the island for 40 years and made it a sanctuary for wildlife. At the same time he continued to record a disappearing Gaelic heritage and to write and publish extensively about Gaelic and Highland culture and life. In 1981 Campbell gave Canna to the National Trust for Scotland, but he continued to live on the island. Campbell's partnership with Shaw was professional as well as marital. Together the couple assembled an important archive of Scottish Gaelic song and poetry, including manuscripts, sound recordings, photographs and film, in an effort similar to that carried on by Marjory Kennedy-Fraser in the 1900s. Campbell's three-volume collection of Hebridean folk songs, published between 1969 and 1981, is regarded as a valuable source by musicians and folklorists. The Campbell archive at Canna House is now in the possession of the National Trust for Scotland. In addition to his other interests, in 1936 Campbell began to study the distribution and migration of insects. His Hebridean collection, started on Barra in 1936 was continued on Canna from 1938 with the use of a mercury vapour moth trap from 1951 onwards. The collection now consists of 30 cabinet drawers containing 283 species of macrolepidoptera, including the first recorded specimen of the noctuid moth Dianthoecia caesia taken in Scotland and some other surprises. He was the official migrant recorder for Canna from 1938, and was at times able to get the help of more than one head lighthouse keeper from Hyskeir. He died on 25 April 1996 whilst on holiday at Villa San Girolamo in Fiesole in Italy,https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf and in accordance with his wishes was \\"buried where he fell\\", but in 2006 his body was returned to Canna and reburied in a wood planted by himself. His widow remained at Canna House until her death in 2004 at the age of 101.

The first volume is based on the collection of waulking songs made by Donald MacCormik, who was school attendance officer, in South Uist in 1893. Campbell found translations of about half the songs made by Fr. Allan McDonald, in the Carmichael papers in Edinburgh University Library, and completed the translation and added notes and a large glossary. The airs were transcribed by F. Collinson from Campbell's recordings made between 1938 and 1965; he also wrote the musicological chapters. Volumes II and III are based entirely on Campbell's recordings. The singers were from Benbecula, South Uist, Eriskay, Vatersay, Barra, and Cape Breton. The three books contain 135 songs connected with the waulking of the homespun tweed cloth; such waulkings, by hand, appear to have died out in the early 1950s.

Apart from these, JLC has at times reviewed books for An Gaidheal, the Free Man, the Modern Scot, the New Alliance, the Oban Times, Outlook, the Scotsman, the Stornoway Gazette, and the Tablet, as well as writing articles on such subjects for them. Reviews written by JLC for Scottish Gaelic Studies are included in the list under that heading. =Recordings= EDIPHONE: 274 recordings made on Barra and Cape Breton in 1937. Most of the airs of the Cape Breton Gaelic songs have been transcribed by the late Seamus Ennis when working for the Irish Folklore Commission. The words were taken down by JLC in Cape Breton. It is hoped to publish this. No machine is available to play these wax cylinders now. PRESTO DISC RECORDINGS: The first electrical recordings of traditional Gaelicd songs were made by JLC in Barra in 1938, numbering 110. Very important as some of the singers did not survive until the time of tape. Ten songs from these recordings were published by the Linguaphone Co. for the Folklore Institute of Scotland, of which JLC was president, in 1950; see No.22, 32 more Presto disc recordings were made on Canna in 1942, including one of the late Professor John Fraser. WEBSTER WIRE RECORDINGS: 1202 recordings made between 1949 and 1957, most between 1949 and 1951 when JLC had a Leverhulme Expense Grant . Some made in Nova Scotia. GRUNDING TAPE RECORDINGS: 602 made between 1957‚Äì1962. PHILLIPS PORTABLE TAPE RECORDER: 125 recordings made between 1963 and 1969. CASSETTE RECORDINGS: Made since 1969. Not yet listed. Most of the wire and tape recordings were made in the southern Outer Hebrides, or from visitors thence to Canna. The reciters who made them, and the help given by collaborators, are described in the Introduction to Hebridean Folksongs Vol. III; transcriptions of the singing of 42 women and 8 men, are represented in the three volumes, which with Angus MacLellan's stories and memoirs and its published in Gairm only represent a fraction of the collection of recordings. Apart from the above recordings, JLC arranged for the making of studio recordings of some of the late Calum Johnston's songs, in Edinburgh in 1948. =Entomology= Besides a large number of notes in entomological journals, the following articles were published: * 1936 Scottish Naturalist Nov‚ÄìDec.

Paul Blanchard Paul graduated in Natural Sciences from St John's College in 1948, becoming Chief Flying Instructor (CFI) in his third undergraduate year. Elementary Gliding Blanchard wrote the first version of Elementary Gliding and offered it to the BGA and the Surrey Gliding Club, however they were not interested in marketing it. He subsequently asked the CUGC to produce and distribute it. The result was a duplicated \\"Second Edition\\", dated February 1952, \\"compiled by P.H. Blanchard\\", with technical drawings by Roger Austin and cartoons by Pete Sullivan, both CUGC members. It incorporated improvements made by other Club members as well, particularly Ken Machin (later CFI). The next edition no longer carried Blanchard's name, just that of the publisher, \\"Cambridge University Gliding Club\\". Paul Blanchard c. 1948 In 1955 a printed version of the manual appeared, published by Thermal Equipment Ltd, and since 1958 subsequent editions have been published by the BGA, all under the original author's name. Philip Wills wrote an introduction referring to Paul Blanchard as having been \\"Chief Instructor of the Surrey Gliding Club\\", however later editions stopped acknowledging Austin and Sullivan as part of the CUGC. Bluebell (CUGC's T21) remained immortalised in the cover, complete with the former cement works chimney nearby. The CUGC archive contains Ken Machin's copy of the first printed edition autographed by the author: \\"With best wishes from Paul\\". Apart from the illustrations, the major CUGC input to Elementary Gliding was the idea of a square circuit, opposing the prevailing practice of loitering while flying towards the airfield, until arriving in position for the final approach. CUGC developed square-circuit training and improved airbrakes in response to the introduction of dual ab initio instruction in Bluebell (1950). Career Paul Blanchard, following his father, worked initially for Tate & Lyle in London, then settled in the broader industrial chemical manufacturing industry based in the USA. He authored a book describing key elements of Corn starch production (Technology of Corn Wet Milling and Associated Processes, ) which remains the authority on the subject. Personal Paul Blanchard married Barbara Ruth Horder, a twin, at Croydon in the early summer of 1953. The marriage produced four recorded children.

This can provide increased resistance to changes in conditions such as pH or temperature. It also lets enzymes be held in place throughout the reaction, following which they are easily separated from the products and may be used again - a far more efficient process and so is widely used in industry for enzyme catalysed reactions. An alternative to enzyme immobilization is whole cell immobilization. Commercial use Immobilized enzymes are very important for commercial uses as they possess many benefits to the expenses and processes of the reaction of which include: *Convenience: Minuscule amounts of protein dissolve in the reaction, so workup can be much easier. Upon completion, reaction mixtures typically contain only solvent and reaction products. *Economy: The immobilized enzyme is easily removed from the reaction making it easy to recycle the biocatalyst. This is particularly useful in processes such as the production of Lactose Free Milk, as the milk can be drained from a container leaving the enzyme (Lactase) inside ready for the next batch. *Stability: Immobilized enzymes typically have greater thermal and operational stability than the soluble form of the enzyme. In the past, biological washing powders and detergents contained many proteases and lipases that broke down dirt. However, when the cleaning products contacted human skin, they created allergic reactions. This is why immobilization of enzymes are important, not just economically. Immobilization of an Enzyme There are various ways by which one can immobilize an enzyme: *Affinity-tag binding: Enzymes may be immobilized to a surface, e.g. in a porous material, using non-covalent or covalent Protein tags. This technology has been established for protein purification purposes. This technique is the generally applicable, and can be performed without prior enzyme purification with a pure preparation as the result. Porous glass and derivatives thereof are used, where the porous surface can be adapted in terms of hydrophobicity to suit the enzyme in question. *Adsorption on glass, alginate beads or matrix: Enzyme is attached to the outside of an inert material. In general, this method is the slowest among those listed here. As adsorption is not a chemical reaction, the active site of the immobilized enzyme may be blocked by the matrix or bead, greatly reducing the activity of the enzyme. *Entrapment: The enzyme is trapped in insoluble beads or microspheres, such as calcium alginate beads. However, these insoluble substances hinder the arrival of the substrate, and the exit of products. *Cross-linkage: Enzyme molecules are covalently bonded to each other to create a matrix consisting of almost only enzyme. The reaction ensures that the binding site does not cover the enzyme's active site, the activity of the enzyme is only affected by immobility. However, the inflexibility of the covalent bonds precludes the self-healing properties exhibited by chemoadsorbed self-assembled monolayers. Use of a spacer molecule like poly(ethylene glycol) helps reduce the steric hindrance by the substrate in this case. *Covalent bond: The enzyme is bound covalentely to an insoluble support (such as silica gel or macroporous polymer beads with epoxide groups). This approach provides the strongest enzyme/support interaction, and so the lowest protein leakage during catalysis.  Random versus Site-directed Enzyme Immobilization  Numerous enzymes of biotechnological importance have been immobilized on various supports (inorganic, organic, composite and nanomaterials) via random multipoint attachment. However, immobilization via random chemical modification results in a heterogeneous protein population where more than one side chains (amino, carboxyl, thiol etc) present in proteins are linked with the support with potential reduction in activity due to restriction of substrate access to the active site. In contrast, in site- directed enzyme immobilization, the support can be linked to a single specific amino acid (generally N- or C-termini) in a protein molecule away from the active-site. This way maximal enzyme activity is retained due to the free access of the substrate to the active-site. These strategies are mainly chemical but may additionally require genetic and enzymatic methods to generate functional groups (that are absent in protein) on the support and enzyme. The choice of SDCM method depends on many factors, such as the type of enzyme (less stable psychrophilic, or more stable thermophilic homologue), pH stability of enzyme, the availability of N- or C-termini to the reagent, non- interference of the enzyme terminus with the enzyme activity, type of catalytic amino acid residue, the availability, price and the ease of preparation of reagents. For example, the generation of complementary clickable functionalities (alkyne and azide) on the support and enzyme is one of the most convenient way for immobilizing enzymes via site-directed chemical modification. Immobilization of a Substrate for Enzymatic Reactions Another widely used application of the immobilization approach together with enzymes has been the enzymatic reactions on immobilized substrates. This approach facilitates the analysis of enzyme activities and mimics the performance of enzymes on e.g. cell walls.

He served as ordinary from 1995 until his retirement in 2010. Career He is a native of Roscrea, County Tipperary and was born in 1935. He was educated at Corville National School, Roscrea and St. Flannan's College in Ennis. He studied for the priesthood at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, and the Pontifical Irish College in Rome. He was ordained priest in Rome in 1959, where he earned a JCD degree. After ordination he completed his studies in Canon Law at the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome. On his return to Ireland he taught for a year at Col√°iste √âinde in Galway and joined the staff of St. Flannan's College in Ennis in 1963. In 1988 he was appointed curate at Ennis Cathedral and became administrator there in 1990. He has been pastorally involved with ACCORD (formerly the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council) since its foundation in the Killaloe diocese. He has worked with Marriage Tribunals at diocesan, regional and national levels. He has pursued a lifelong interest in sport and has been involved in coaching hurling teams at colleges, club and county grades. He succeeded as Bishop of Killaloe on 2 October 1994, having served as Coadjutor Bishop of Killaloe from 21 June 1994 until he succeeded to the see. Views Bishop Walsh has, both during his time as Bishop of Killaloe and later in retirement, expressed personal views of a variety of issues that are considered at variance with official church teaching. In November 2009, he urged talks of the ordination of women,Bishop urges women priests talks While on another occasion, he challenged the Church's rule of closed communion that almost completely excludes Protestants from its Eucharist. He has said that he has never suggested to Church of Ireland members that they were not welcome to receive the sacrament in his churches.Do not replace church as oppressor, bishop tells media =Clerical sex abuse= Referring to the Ryan report, he said it would be \\"a second injustice [in addition to the abuse of children] if the religious alone were singled out to carry all the blame. All adults share some responsibility (for what went on then), but they didn't want to know.\\" After the release of the Murphy Report on 26 November 2009, Bishop of Limerick Donal Murray was heavily criticised for his actions during his time as an Auxiliary Bishop of Dublin. Bishop Walsh said calls for the resignation of Bishop of Limerick Donal Murray were based on a \\"gross misreading\\" of the Murphy report on the Dublin diocese and warned against a desire \\"to get a head on a plate\\".Irish Times, \\"Bishop warns against seeking 'head on a plate'\\" Bishop Walsh said he was \\"quite uncomfortable with this kind of public trial. I'd have to ask, is it about healing for survivors or is it about the desire that we need to get a head on a plate?\\" He admitted in a radioPressure mounts on Bishop Donal Murray interview, that he hadn't had time to examine the report in detail \\"but I do know, I do know for a fact, some of the interpretation put on that and being placed against Bishop Murray is a misreading of the report. I do know that from somebody who has read in detail the report and I am satisfied with that.\\"An abysmal abdication of responsibility On 8 December, Bishop Walsh, said that the crisis in the Church was also a time of opportunity to remove what was wrong in the past. He added: \\"Every crisis is also an opportunity, an opportunity for serious change, to begin again, to renew our faith, our hope and indeed our love.\\"Crisis affords chance to remove ills of past, says Walsh Bishop Walsh wept openly after a parish priest declared the people's love for him at the blessing and dedication of a new Adoration Chapel in Shannon. Fr Tom Ryan told Walsh \\"we love you\\", and thanked the bishop for his 15 years of inspirational leadership, not just in the diocese of Killaloe, but across the Irish Church. Bishop Walsh called on Cardinal Desmond Connell to issue a statement following the fallout from the Murphy report. On 26 November, the day the Murphy report was published, Cardinal Connell released \\"a personal statement\\" noting that it had been \\"severely critical of the diocesan response (to abuse allegations), particularly in my earlier years in office\\". Cardinal Connell expressed his \\"distress and bewilderment\\" that priests could behave in such a way. He also wished \\"to express without reservation my bitter regret that failures on my part contributed to the suffering of victims in any form\\" and apologised to those hurt and asked forgiveness.Bishop of Killaloe urges Cardinal Connell to issue statement on Murphy report Retirement In January 2010, Bishop Walsh celebrated his 75th birthday, and according to Canon Law submitted his resignation to the Congregation for Bishops, but was expected to remain as Bishop of the diocese until a replacement was appointed. At a civic reception to honour his work as Bishop of Killoe in March 2010, Walsh received a standing ovation and said that for all of Irish bishops: \\"it is a very difficult time, and all of us are at risk from possibly some mistake made anything from 20 to 50 years ago\\". He added: \\"All of you councillors appreciate that your position can be hazardous when it comes around to election time and our own positions are hazardous for more serious and sad reasons at the moment.\\" Reflecting on his time as bishop, Walsh said: \\"I found it a heavy responsibility but... tried to be open and honest and transparent at all times and I hope that I managed to get to the end of it.\\" He said he was \\"very honoured and chuffed\\" to be granted the civic reception \\"in a town... that has given me so much\\". In a surprise for the bishop at the start of the reception, his colleagues in the over-70s Forever Young choir filed into the chamber and sang songs to honour the Tipperary man.Prelate honoured with civic reception On 18 May 2010, his resignation on the basis of age was accepted by Pope Benedict XVI and Fr Kieran O'Reilly, S.M.A. was named as the bishop of Killaloe.RINUNCIA DEL VESCOVO DI KILLALOE (IRLANDA) E NOMINA DEL SUCCESSORE The speed of the appointment is notable as it normally takes closer to a year to name a new diocesan ordinary. Bishop Walsh published a book of memoirs called No Crusader () in 2016. Interview in The Irish Times, November 2010 On 6 November 2010, opinions were expressed by Bishop Walsh in an interview in The Irish Times conducted by journalist Kathy Sheridan. Walsh's expressed viewpoints on key issues such as homosexuality, birth control and family planning, the ordination of women as priests, celibacy within the priesthood and the existence of the afterlife. Walsh asserts to have been \\"stunned\\" upon hearing about Pope Paul VI's Humanae Vitae encyclical, a document published to reaffirm traditional Roman Catholic teaching on family planning in 1968. \\"That was a watershed. Up to that time, I think, practically all Catholics accepted that, whether they disobeyed Catholic teaching or not, the teaching was right. It was there that the questioning began.\\" \\"John's\\" allegations An anonymous complainant, \\"John\\" alleged that he had been raped by three priests, Fathers T, U and V, in the early 1980s, and had been told by Bishop Walsh in 2005 to report the incidents to the police. Walsh had paid \\"John\\" ‚Ç¨20,000 personally, and ‚Ç¨45,000 out of Killaloe diocesan funds in 2008-09, \\"though he never formally sought compensation\\", and promised to seek a further ‚Ç¨30,000 from the diocese and the alleged offending priests in 2010. In the opinion of one journalist it was unclear to what extent Walsh felt sorry for \\"John\\", whom he described as \\"a decent person\\", or whether the money was paid to some extent as hush money.Irish Times, 13 August 2010; 14 August 2010, p.8 Walsh himself believed \\"John\\"'s story, saying that Father T was \\"the worst offender in that he started it. But the other two did worse\\". The three priests had been in the same class at the Maynooth seminary, and \\"John\\" alleged that his attempt to complain about them to the then College President, Miche√°l Ledwith, had been brushed off.The Irish Times, 14 August 2010, p.8 The 2005 McCullough Report had investigated and dismissed claims of homosexual behaviour at the College.

Biography  Wall was born at Sevalla in V√§stmanland County, Sweden. He was the son of the merchant sailor Erik Gustaf Saxholm and Johanna Fredrika Chagelin. He grew up under modest circumstances, mainly with his mother. After receiving private tuition, he got into contact with Lars Johan Hierta (1801‚Äì1872), the founder of Aftonbladet, in whose office he began to work as a boy, continuing his education in the meantime. He advanced in Hierta's employ and was eventually given editorial work. In 1846, he took over a printshop which he had previously rented for two years, and which now became known as the Wall printshop (Wallska tryckeriet). The company succeeded under his leadership and in 1847, he started the Sunday news S√∂ndagstidningen and the next year a weekly magazine for children and youth Veckoskrift f√∂r barn och ungdom. As a consequence, he was recognized as a burgess of the city in 1858. Some failed dealings caused a bankruptcy in 1859 and forced him to embark on a journalistic career to support himself. He began at G√∂teborgs Handels- och Sj√∂fartstidning, and later returned to Aftonbladet. He also started the book series Sveriges handelskalender and translated political writings. When Wall established Dagens Nyheter in 1864, there was no other morning paper in Sweden. He remained editor-in-chief until 1889. The company was reorganized to become a public limited corporation in 1874, Dagens Nyheter AB. Wall became its first chairman and remained so until his death in 1893.

The two-character story spans thirty-five years, from 1890 to 1925, as it focuses on the trials and tribulations, laughters and sorrows, and hopes and disappointments experienced by Agnes and Michael throughout their marriage. The set consists solely of their bedroom, dominated by the large fourposter bed in the center of the room. Its simple set and small cast have made it a popular choice for amateur theatrical groups. Among the couple's milestones are the consummation of their marriage, the birth of their first child, Michael's success as a writer, his extramarital affair, their daughter's wedding, and their preparations to move to smaller quarters and pass their home on to another newlywed couple. The Broadway production, directed by Jos√© Ferrer, opened on October 24, 1951, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, later moving to the John Golden to complete its 632-performance run. Original cast Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy later were replaced first by Burgess Meredith and Betty Field and then Romney Brent and Sylvia Sidney. It received Tony Awards for Best Play and Best Director. Cronyn and Tandy recreated their roles for a July 25, 1955, telecast live on the NBC anthology series Producers' Showcase. Adaptations The partially animated 1952 film adaptation directed by Irving Reis, which inexplicably altered the title to The Four Poster and changed the characters' names to John and Abby, starred Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer, who won the Venice Film Festival's Volpi Cup for her performance. The film was nominated for both the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Black-and-White Cinematography. The film version alters the ending to have the couple die at the end, and then their ghosts re-enter the house as newlyweds, prepared to enjoy their life together all over again.The Four Poster, full synopsis at Turner Classic Movies The play was adapted for Australian TV in 1964.

An √©corch√© () is a figure drawn, painted, or sculpted showing the muscles of the body without skin, normally as a figure study for another work or as an exercise for a student artist. The Renaissance-era architect, theorist and all-around Renaissance man, Leon Battista Alberti, recommended that when painters intend to depict a nude, they should first arrange the muscles and bones, then depict the overlying skin.√âcorch√© defined at ArtLex.com√âcorch√©chisel (H. 33 cm. L 21.8 cm) realized after Peter Paul Rubens after 1640 by Paulus Pontius. - Engraving No. SNR - 3 PONTIUS. Photograph taken during the exhibition Rubens Europe - Louvre Museum . Terracotta Anatomical study by Willem van den Broecke,1563 Some of the first well known studies of this kind were performed by Leonardo da Vinci, who dissected cadavers and created detailed drawings of them. However, there are some accounts of this same practice taking place as far back as ancient Greece, though the specifics are not known. Etymology The term √©corch√©, meaning literally \\"flayed\\", came into usage via the French Academies (such as the √âcole des Beaux Arts) in the 19th century. History Although there are some accounts of practices similar to √©corch√© as far back as ancient Greece, the degree of similarity is unclear. The term as used today can be applied with the greatest confidence to the Renaissance period onwards. =Renaissance= During the Renaissance in Italy, around the 1450 to 1600, the rebirth of classical Greek and Roman characteristics in art led to the studies of the human anatomy. The practice of dissecting the human body was banned for many centuries due to the belief that body and soul were inseparable. It wasn‚Äôt until the election of Pope Boniface VIII that the practice of dissection was once again allowed for observation. Many painters and artists documented and even performed the dissections themselves by taking careful observations of the human body. Among them were Leonardo da Vinci and Andreas Vesalius, two of the most influential artists in anatomical illustrations. Leonardo da Vinci, in particular, was very detailed in his studies that he was known as the ‚Äúartist-anatomist‚Äù for the creation of a new science and the creative depiction to anatomy. Leonardo‚Äôs anatomical studies contributed to artistic exploration of the movement of the muscles, joints and bones. His goal was to analyze and understand the instruments behind the postures and gestures in the human body. =17th‚Äì19th centuries= The study of anatomical figures became popular among the medical academies across Europe around the 17th and 18th century, especially when there was a lack of bodies available for dissections. Medical students relied on these figures because they provided a good representation of what the anatomical model looks like. The √©corch√© (flayed) figures were made to look like the skin was removed from the body, exposing the muscles and vessels of the model. Some figures were created to strip away the layers of muscles and reveal the skeleton of the model. Many of the life-size scale √©corch√© figures were reproduced in a smaller scale out of bronze that could be easily distributed. √âcorch√© figures were commonly made out of many different materials: bronze, ivory, plaster, wax, or wood. By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, wax was the most popular use of material in creating √©corch√© statues. The production of colored wax anatomies allowed for a variety of hues and tone that makes the models appear realistic. =21st century= The √©corch√© form of study still continues at traditional schools throughout the world including the New York Academy of Art, the Art Students League of New York, the Grand Central Academy of Art in New York City, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and the Academy of Art University in San Francisco.

The film was the debut Malayalam film venture of director Santosh SivanAnanthabhadram, Chennai Online, Retrieved: 2010-11-22 and actress Riya Sen. The story concerns ghosts, spirits, and black magic. The film was inspired by the paintings of Raja Ravi Varma, Theyyam, and Kathakali dance movements, and Kalaripayattu martial art forms. It rode on a renewed interest in both Ravi Varma and Kalaripayattu in and outside of India. Anandabhadram won five awards in the 2005 Kerala State Film Awards and two in the 2005 Asianet Film Awards. It also was a commercial success. During production, Santosh replaced Sabu Cyril as the art director, M. G. Radhakrishnan replaced Vidyasagar as the music director, Gireesh Puthenchery replaced Sreekumaran Thampy as the lyricist and Kavya Madhavan replaced Meera Jasmine as the actress. The audiography of the film was done by M. R. Rajakrishnan . It was also dubbed in Tamil, Telugu (as Sivapuram), Hindi (as Phir Wohi Darr) and English, and was an inspiration for Tanthra (2006), another Malayalam film. Plot In the ancient village of Shivapuram, little Ananthan hears a tale from his mother, Gayathri (Revathi). She tells him that his family comes from a line of powerful magicians, and they are responsible for protecting nagamanikyam, a jewel on a serpent's head. The jewel, she narrates, lies in a secret place in the house guarded by snakes, including a tiny snake called Kunjootan. Years later, obeying the wishes of his dead mother, Ananthan (Prithviraj Sukumaran) returns to his ancestral village to light the lamps at Shivakavu, a dark and mysterious temple of Shiva. On his way home he meets the comical Maravi Mathai (Cochin Haneefa) on the train. The local black magician Digambaran (Manoj K Jayan) opposes the lighting of the lamps on the grounds of local superstitions in order to get his hands on the nagamanikyam. Disbeliever Ananthan meets the supernatural for the first time in his life. In his effort to fit into the local environment, Ananthan gradually wins the villagers' hearts over by his easy and kind manners. This appreciation is breached briefly when the magician takes over his mind for a short while. Meanwhile, Ananthan's cousin Bhadra (Kavya Madhavan) falls for him and his light-hearted flirting, eventually leading to a commitment of love between them. At one point, Bhadra faces the dilemma of choosing between Ananthan's love and becoming a Devi (goddess) in a mystical ritual of self- offering. Chemban (Kalabhavan Mani), a blind martial arts expert, stands in the way of Digambaran's hunt for the nagamanikyam. The evil black magician manages to remove Chemban from his way, and leaves a trail of blood in his wake. Digambaran also lures Chemban's sister Bhama (Riya Sen). A series of sensuous and evil magical rites follows that features a wide paraphernalia of the exotic, including Kathakali movements, tantric paraphernalia, traditional magic spells. In the end, Ananthan and Bhadra escape from Digambaran after injuring them badly. However Chemban decides to destroy Digambaran for killing Bhama and to restore peace in the village. After a fight, Chemban cuts off Digambaran's right toe which had a ring of which he killed all who came across him. Later, Ananthan and Bhadra reunites after restoring the Nagamanikyam and Digambaran is seen without eyes which was taken by Chemban.

The story was inspired by tales told to Sunil by his grandmother when he was a child. Director Santosh Sivan was also influenced by such stories told by his own grandmother. Set in rural Kerala, the story is a fairy tale dominated by Shakta black magic, martial arts, and tantric seduction rituals. =Inspirations= Theyyam and Kathakali: Sivan said he received inspiration from the arts of his country: \\"We have a rich visual culture and even in Ananthabhadram, I have used certain aspects from Theyyam dancers and Kathakali to create the wizard Digambaran's image. The colour, long nails, kohl-lined eyes and so on were inspired from Theyyam and Kathakali.\\" The sequence between Manoj K Jayan using Riya Sen as a channel for black magic, choreographed by Aparna Sindhoor, the dance director of the film, uses Kathakali movements in particular, which has been an inspiration for major Indian films like director Shaji Karun's Vanaprastham (1999) and director Adoor Gopalakrishnan's Kalamandalam Ramankutty Nair (2005). Kalarippayattu: The film also used Kalarippayattu, the traditional martial art of South India, for the fight sequences between Digambaran and Chemban choreographed by action director Arash. Use of Kalari in the film followed the footsteps of Kalari-based movies like Palattu Koman (1962), Thacholi Othenan (1964), Kannappanunni (1977) and Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha (1989),Payyamveli Chanthu: Early Preview as well as famous martial art film actor Jackie Chan's The Myth. After Asoka, it was the second time the director had used Kalari (as it is known in popular coinage). Raja Ravi Varma: The director used three paintings of Raja Ravi Varma ‚Äì Damayanti and the swan, Lady in thought and Girl carrying milk tray ‚Äì as inspiration to picturize the song Pinakkamano (acted by Prithviraj Sukumaran and Kavya Madhavan; sung by M. G. Sreekumar and Manjari; choreographed by Aparna Sindhoor). Sivan said, \\"Yes, it is a tribute to Raja Ravi Varma, who is so intrinsically etched in every Malayali's mind.\\" This song came in the wake of a renewed interest in Varma's work in Indian showbiz, as evidenced in Indian pop star Falguni Pathak's music video for the song \\"Meri Chunar Ud Ud Jaaye\\" (2001, acted by Trisha Krishnan) which emulated Varma's Shakuntala and Shaji Karun's declared film to be made on the artist's life which would feature Madhuri Dixit (actress of Gaja Gamini, a film by painter M.F. Hussain). Pattanam Rasheed said about the make-up of the Pinakkamano sequence, \\"The skin tone I gave the characters is akin to an oil painting, orange-yellow shades, which give a painting-like look. That is why you feel that a painting is coming to life in some shots. The eye and eye brow make-up is also different, according to the old styles in the paintings.\\" Costumer Satheesh said, \\"Not one of the saris that Kavya wears is complete in itself. To get the colours of the body and border of the sari as close as possible to the ones in the paintings, I shopped in Chennai, Bangalore and Kochi. I had to attach the borders to some of the saris and dyed some to get the right shade... I had to rework all the jewels, with a few stones from one chain added to another.\\" art director Sunil Babu points out that despite attempts at accuracy, in the Damayanthi scene, the swan is missing. =Pre-production= Sabu Cyril was originally scheduled to direct the film with actress Meera Jasmine in the lead. Production was delayed due to a strike in the Malayalam film industry in June 2004. Later, Cyril became busy with Shankar's film Anniyan. At this point, Santosh Sivan stepped in to replace Cyril. Cyril's assistant Sunil Babu art directed the film. =Filming= Like his earlier directorial ventures Asoka and The Terrorist (a.k.a. Malli), Santosh was also the cinematographer for Anathabhadram. Prithviraj as the hero had his biggest success of 2005, out of the five cinemas he did that year. Manoj K Jayan was to have a sannyasin look with long hair in the proposed Sabu Cyril version, but sported a more contemporary look in the version that was eventually shot, winning much critical accolades. Soundtrack Initially Sabu Cyril was the film director and Santhosh Sivan was the Cinematographer. Vidyasagar composed songs for the film penned by Sreekumaran Thampi. The songs were never recorded. After some months Sabu Cyril opted not to direct the film due to other reasons. And the film was taken over by Santosh Sivan who appointed M. G. Radhakrishnan for the film. Radhakrishnan went on to win Asianet Film Awards as the best music director for the film's tracks.Lifetime achievement award for Sukumari, The Hindu, 2006-03-12, Retrieved: 2010-11-22 He also did the score for Sivapuram, the Telugu version of the film.

History Historically, the area developed as an oasis formed by the Barada river around the site where Damascus was founded. The Arab geographer, Al-Muqaddasi (died 991), mentions al-Ghouta as being one of the six rural territories belonging to the District of Damascus. Since ancient times, canals dug by Damascenes provided irrigation of land on either side of the Barada, increasing the size of the Ghouta to the south and east of the city. Separating the city from the dry grasslands bordering the Syrian Desert, the Ghouta has historically provided its inhabitants with a variety of cereals, vegetables and fruits. Eventually the irrigated agricultural area in the Damascus countryside reached a size of . In the 1980s, urban growth from Damascus started replacing agricultural use with housing and industry, shrinking the green zone. Before the Syrian Civil War, the area was home to about two million people, but in 2017 the population was estimated to be about 400,000. =During the Syrian Civil War= During the civil unrest that began in Syria in March 2011, some eastern Ghouta residents joined the protests against Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad and joined the Syrian rebels, expelling Syrian government forces by November 2012. In February 2013, Syrian rebels captured parts of the ring road on the edge of Damascus and entered the Jobar district of the capital city. Backed by Hezbollah, the Syrian Arab Army counterattacked and in May 2013 began a siege of Eastern Ghouta. In mid-2017, the main rebel faction in the area was Jaysh al-Islam, based in Douma (with an estimated 10‚Äì15,000 fighters in the region in early 2018Which rebel groups are fighting in Syria's eastern Ghouta?, Deutsche Welle, 20.02.2018). The second largest was Faylaq al-Rahman, an official affiliate of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), controlling much of central and western parts of Ghouta, including the Jobar and Ain Terma districts. Ahrar al-Sham (based in Harasta) and Tahrir al- Sham (HTS - controlling smaller districts such as Arbin, Hawsh al-Ashari and Beit Nayim, with an estimated strength in the area of 500 in February 2018Explainer: Who's fighting whom in Syria's Ghouta?, BBC Monitoring, 22 February 2018) had a far smaller presence.Wisam Franjieh In Besieged Eastern Ghouta, Rebel Infighting Increases Civilian Suffering, Syria Deeply, Aug. 1, 2017 The residents described the life under the control of Islamist rebels as \\"hell\\" to a Channel 4 correspondent as they were forcibly conscripted, prevented from leaving and had no water and electricity.Channel 4, Inside Ghouta as Syrian government fully controls Damascus for the first time in seven years, 24 May 2018 In February 2018, the Syrian army launched an operation to dislodge rebels from the area. In early March 2018, the Syrian army had captured 59% of the Eastern Ghouta pocket. On 7 April 2018, at least 48 people were reportedly killed in a chemical attack in Douma, which resulted in an armed response from the United States, France, and the United Kingdom.On 14 April 2018, the Syrian Army officially declared Eastern Ghouta to be free of militants, securing it under government control.

Early life and family MailandsB. B. Jennings was born to Oliver Gould Jennings (1865-1936) and Mary Dows Brewster. Both his paternal grandfather, Oliver Burr Jennings (1825‚Äì1893), and his maternal grandfather, Benjamin Brewster (1828‚Äì1897) after whom he was named, were involved with Standard Oil co-founder John Davison Rockefeller and had become his partners in running the Standard Oil Trust. Both men had gone west in the California Gold Rush and had set up a successful dry goods merchandise business, outfitting prospecting camps along the coast and around Sacramento.Nicholas E. Hollis, \\"Jennings Farm: Nurturing Education and Entrepreneurial Spirits\\", Educational Pioneers, Jennings Heritage Project, n.d., accessed May 5, 2007. B. B. Jennings's paternal grandmother, Esther Judson Goodsell, was the sister-in-law of Standard Oil co-founder William Avery Rockefeller, Jr. through his marriage to her sister, Almira Geraldine Goodsell Rockefeller. Jennings was raised in Fairfield, Connecticut, where his father had built a forty-room French Renaissance style home called the Mailands. The building later became part of the campus of Fairfield University and was renamed McAuliffe Hall. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. During World War I he served in the United States Navy as an ensign on a submarine chaser and was awarded the Navy Cross. In 1920, he graduated from Yale University, where he was tapped for the secret society Scroll and Key. He continued his involvement with Yale as an alumnus, serving as a member of the Yale Corporation Council and as chairman of the Yale Development Committee. Career After his graduation from Yale in 1920, Jennings began his career as a clerk in the marine department of the Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony). He became a purchasing agent, then manager of the company's real estate department, and then assistant to the president. In 1939, eight years after Socony merged with Vacuum Oil to form Socony-Vacuum, he was appointed to the board of directors and put in charge of transportation. In 1942, Jennings left the company to become assistant director of tanker operations in the United States Maritime Commission and then assistant deputy administrator for tanker operations of the War Shipping Administration. He was awarded the presidential certificate of merit for outstanding contributions to the war effort. He was also one of the first recipients of the Navy's Distinguished Public Service Award in October 1952, honored for his World War II services in the War Shipping Administration. After the end of the war he returned to the company and was named president and chairman of the executive committee. In 1955 he became chairman of the board and continued as chairman of the executive committee. Also in 1955, the company changed its name to Socony Mobil (renamed Mobil Oil Corporation in 1966). During his tenure as chief executive officer the company experienced rapid expansion, tripling its worldwide gross crude production. Jennings was vice president in charge of the transportation division of the American Petroleum Institute in 1947‚Äì1948 and its treasurer in 1949‚Äì1950. He was also a trustee of the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research and the Avalon Foundation. Jennings continued as chief executive officer of Socony Mobil until his retirement in 1958. Personal life On June 18, 1923, Jennings married Kate deForest Prentice (July 7, 1903 ‚Äî August 18, 1994), daughter of John Hill Prentice and Kate Sheldon Harrison. They had three children: *Mary Brewster Jennings, who married Paul J. Chase *Kate deForest Jennings, who married Harry H. Webb *John Prentice Jennings. In 1968, Jennings died at Roosevelt Hospital in New York City after a short illness. He was 70 years old and lived in Glen Head, New York.

(1133 ‚Äì 23 December 1193) is the patron saint of Iceland. He was bishop of Sk√°lholt from 1178 until his death. Thorlac's relics were translated to the cathedral of Skalholt in 1198, not long after his successor as bishop, P√°ll J√≥nsson, announced at the Althing that vows could be made to Thorlac. His status as a saint did not receive official recognition from the Catholic Church until 14 January 1984, when John Paul II canonized him and declared him the patron saint of Iceland. His feast day is 23 December, when Thorlac's mass is celebrated in Iceland.  Career  Born in 1133 at Hl√≠√∞arendi in the see of Sk√°lholt in southern Iceland, Thorlac was from an agrarian family. He was ordained a deacon before he was fifteen and a priest at the age of eighteen. He studied abroad at Paris with the Victorines, where he learned the Rule of Saint Augustine from roughly 1153 to 1159, and then studied Canon Law at the Augustinian priory in Lincoln. Returning to Iceland in 1165, Thorlac founded a monastery of Canons Regular at √ûykkvab√¶r after refusing to marry a rich widow. There he devoted himself to a strictly religious life, refusing to marry (many other Icelandic priests were married) and devoting himself to reciting the Our Father, the Creed, and a hymn, as well as fifty Psalms. Thorlac was consecrated a bishop by Augustine of Nidaros and worked to regulate the Augustinian Rule in Iceland, as well as eradicate simony, lay patronage, and clerical incontinency.  Canonization  Thorlac's life and dozens of his miracles are described in great detail in the Icelandic saga √ûorl√°ks saga helga (the Saga of Saint Thorlak), republished in Icelandic on the occasion of John Paul II's visit to Iceland in 1989.√Åsd√≠s Egilsd√≥ttir (ed.), √ûorl√°ks saga helga. Elsta ger√∞ √ûorl√°ks s√∂gu helga √°samt Jarteinab√≥kog efni √∫r yngri ger√∞um s√∂gunnar (Reykjav√≠k: √ûorl√°kssj√≥√∞ur, 1989). It seems likely that Thorlac's informal sanctification in the Church in Iceland, promoted by Latin texts on which this was based, 'was arranged in Icelandic ecclesiastical circles, clerics of both dioceses being conspicuous in reports of early miracles'. Thorlac was officially recognised as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church on 14 January 1984, when John Paul II canonized him and declared him the patron saint of Iceland. The sacred reliquary of St. Thorlac was maintained in the Diocese of Skalholt until it was destroyed in the Reformation, and his mortal remains were strewn about the cathedral grounds. The only known remaining relic of St. Thorlac is a bone fragment contained with other saints' relics in a lead box in sanctuary's end wall (\\"The Golden Locker\\") of the St. Magnus Cathedral, Faroe Islands.  Novena  A novena, or nine day devotional prayer, in honor of St. Thorlac was approved in May 2018, by the Bishop of Reykjavik, Iceland for use by all faithful.  Thorlac's mass  Thorlac's mass is celebrated on the date of his death, 23 December. It is considered the last day of preparations before Christmas. Therefore, on St. Thorlac's Day, the house is cleaned and preparations for the Christmas meal are begun. Fish was usually eaten on √ûorl√°ksmessa since 23 December was the last day of the Catholic Christmas fast. In west fjords in Iceland, it was customary to eat cured skate on this day; this custom spread to the whole of Iceland. The skate is usually served with boiled or mashed potatoes, accompanied by a shot of brenniv√≠n.  Other  A group based in the state of New York has advocated for Thorlak becoming the patron saint of people with autism.

As one of the most popular and well known of the band's songs, it was a hit single being the joint third (after \\"Streetcar\\" & \\"Into Oblivion (Reunion)\\") highest charting single to date. The song was released in two different forms on two albums; as \\"Juno\\" on the band's debut EP, Between Order and Model EP; and in its final incarnation as \\"Juneau\\" on their debut LP, Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation. Juno The original version of \\"Juneau\\" was titled \\"Juno\\" and was released on the band's debut EP, Between Order And Model. This version features more screamed vocals; or, in the band's preferred terminology, \\"aggressive vocals\\". Juno was recorded by the old FFAF line-up consisting of current members Matt Davies and Kris Coombs-Roberts and ex-members Darran Smith, Matthew Evans (screamed vocals), Andi Morris (bass) and Johnny Phillips (Drums). However, on the re-issue of the EP, the current line-up is credited to the recording. Juno was also included on Fierce Panda Records \\"Squirrel EP\\" released in 2003. Juneau For their debut album, Casually Dressed and Deep in Conversation, Funeral for a Friend re-recorded the song as \\"Juneau\\" (the correct spelling for the city \\"Juneau\\" in Alaska, USA; but see contrary uses such as Juno (film) and featuring a reduced amount of aggressive vocals and a more melodic sound. This version was recorded by the 'final' line-up of Funeral for a Friend and was the version that would become one of their most famous tracks to date, being released in both single and video forms. =Single= Released on 28 July 2003, Juneau peaked at #19 in the UK singles chart. Only \\"Streetcar\\" (#15) and \\"Into Oblivion (Reunion)\\" (#16) have reached higher in the chart, with \\"Escape Artists Never Die\\" equaling it. =Video= The video appears to take place in a cheap-looking motel. It opens with a man, presumably the proprietor of said establishment, lounging at a reception-style desk and watching porn on TV. The band is then seen walking into a large central room and beginning to play. Throughout the video, the scene changes to show: a teenage girl in her room; a man in a suit in a room containing only a box, which he eventually destroys; a man in a bathtub, sitting despondently under a running shower; and an elderly couple who sequentially sit at a table, dance, and then engage in a pillow fight. During the softer bridge section, all the characters seem to be at a turning- point, considering what to do next. After the bridge section, once the song returns to heavier instrumentation, the people return to action, taking on more serious behaviour: the girl trashing her room, the man destroying the box, the couple having a somewhat violent (albeit still well-intentioned) pillow-fight. Eventually, the girl and man seem to make peace with themselves and their recent actions (which were perhaps therapeutically cathartic), and the elderly couple remain as happy as they have been throughout; the only ambiguity appears to be the man in the shower, whose scenes are too short and unclear to draw much of a conclusion from. The video ends with the band exiting via the same route, and the man at the front desk paying cash to lead singer Matthew Davies-Kreye.

The film stars Rachel Weisz, Adrien Brody, Mark Ruffalo, Rinko Kikuchi, Maximilian Schell, and Robbie Coltrane. The film went into wide release in May 2009. Plot The Brothers Bloom, orphaned at a young age, begin performing confidence tricks as young children; Stephen dreams up elaborate scenarios and his younger brother, Bloom, creates trust with the marks. Stephen creates his first con as a way of encouraging his brother to talk to girls. Twenty-five years later, the brothers are the world's most successful con men. They even have a regular accomplice: Bang Bang, a Japanese explosives expert who rarely speaks. Bloom, however, is dissatisfied with being nothing but an actor in Stephen's schemes. He is tired of being no more than the characters his brother has come up with and wants an 'unwritten life'. He quits and moves to Montenegro. Three months later, Stephen finds Bloom and convinces him to execute one final con. Bloom reluctantly agrees. The brothers will masquerade as antiques dealers and target Penelope Stamp, a rich, socially-isolated heiress who lives alone in a New Jersey mansion. Bloom and Penelope meet when Bloom purposely runs into Penelope's sports car with his bike. Penelope reveals that she has been alone for most of her life and has picked up an array of strange hobbies such as juggling and kung fu. Bloom senses Penelope's craving for adventure and hints that he is sailing to Europe tomorrow. The next morning, Penelope arrives at the harbor to sail with the brothers to Greece. On the ship, Melville, a Belgian hired by Stephen, begins the con, telling Penelope that the brothers Bloom are in fact antiques smugglers and he wants their help with a smuggling job in Prague. Penelope is thrilled with the idea of becoming a smuggler and convinces the brothers to accept the job, unaware that this is part of the con. Meanwhile, Bloom and Penelope are becoming attracted to one another, but Stephen warns Bloom that the con will fail if he actually falls in love with Penelope. At the hotel bar in Prague, Bloom is visited by the brothers' former mentor and current enemy, Diamond Dog. He warns Bloom that Stephen will not be around forever, and tells Bloom he should join him. Stephen arrives and stabs Diamond Dog in the hand with a broken bottle, telling him to stay away. In Prague, Melville cons Penelope out of a million dollars and flees, according to plan. Penelope still wants to go ahead as an antiques smuggler and steal the rare book that Melville told her about. The brothers tell Bang Bang to set off a small explosive in Prague Castle that will trigger the fire alarm, allowing Penelope to sneak in and steal the book. But Penelope accidentally switches the backpacks containing the explosives and they blow up the entire tower, creating panic in Prague. Despite this, Penelope enters the museum and steals the book. She is caught, but somehow convinces the chief of police to let her go. The team goes to Mexico to complete the con. Bloom, who has fallen in love with Penelope, reveals to her that they are con men and the whole adventure has been a con. Stephen has anticipated his brother's change of heart and written it into his plan. The brothers fight and a gun accidentally discharges, wounding Stephen. Penelope checks out the wound, realizes that it is fake blood, and leaves with a broken heart. Bloom punches Stephen and leaves for Montenegro once again. Three months later, Penelope finds Bloom, wanting to be with him and to become a con artist. Unable to deny his love for her but not wanting her to be like him, Bloom meets with Stephen to set up one final con, where they will fake their own deaths. The team goes to St. Petersburg, where they must sell the rare book to Diamond Dog. They are ambushed by Diamond Dog's gang while heading to the exchange. Stephen is kidnapped and held for $1.75 million. Bloom suspects this is just another one of Stephen's tricks; Penelope, just in case, wires the money from her bank account to the mobsters. Bang Bang takes this opportunity to quit working for the Bloom brothers; as soon as she leaves, her car explodes, leaving Penelope and Bloom uncertain whether she was caught in the blast or faked her death. Bloom goes into an abandoned theater to make the exchange, and finds Stephen tied up and beaten. Bloom demands that Stephen tell him if this is real or if it is a con. A hit man tosses Bloom a phone, and Diamond Dog confirms that it is real. The hit man attacks them, and Stephen takes a bullet for Bloom and collapses on the floor. Bloom again asks whether this was real, or just the \\"perfect con\\". Stephen gets up and assures Bloom that he is fine. Stephen tells Bloom to leave St. Petersburg with Penelope, and that they will meet again. Bloom and Penelope drive away. After several hours, Bloom discovers that Stephen's bloodstain on his shirt has changed in color from red to brown, indicating that it is not fake blood. Realizing that Stephen has surely died, Bloom breaks down on the side of the road while Penelope tries to comfort him. As they are leaving, Bloom recalls what Stephen had said earlier, \\"The perfect con is one where everyone involved gets just the thing they wanted\\" ‚Äì and that perhaps his brother really pulled off the perfect con. Cast * Mark Ruffalo as Stephen Bloom: When Johnson first sat down with Ruffalo it was for the part of Bloom, but his actual personality was so similar to Stephen, Johnson chose to switch. ** Max Records as young Stephen * Rachel Weisz as Penelope Stamp: Weisz was being offered mostly drama roles but was interested in doing a comedy. She was drawn to the script because it is well written but still unusual. After Weisz decided on it she told her agent, \\"this is the one, this is the one.\\" While working on the film she developed a rapport with her costar Adrien Brody. * Adrien Brody as Bloom Bloom: When Brody first got the script he was working on The Darjeeling Limited and \\"was impressed by its originality and subtlety.\\" While working on the film Brody considered a \\"bromance\\" to have formed between himself and Ruffalo which led to more genuine rapport between them. ** Zachary Gordon as young Bloom * Rinko Kikuchi as Bang Bang: Johnson did not write the part for Kikuchi but was nervous when casting her; he was not sure she would want another mute part after being mute in her last American film, Babel. * Maximilian Schell as Diamond Dog. This is the actor's final English language film role. * Robbie Coltrane as Maximillen \\"The Curator\\" Melvile * Ricky Jay as the narrator * Andy Nyman as Charleston * Nora Zehetner as Rose * Noah Segan as The Duke * Stefan Kapiƒçiƒá as German bar owner * Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Lukas Haas (uncredited cameo) as Bar patrons Production The original script was titled Penelope after Weisz's character. Shooting began in Ulcinj, Montenegro on March 19, 2007. =Script and development= { \\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: left;\\" \\"Paper Moon is probably the closest to a direct influence. I love The Sting and House of Games, but Paper Moon was really the first thing I watched that took more of a fairy-tale approach and was more relationship based. Other than that, God, take your pick.\\" --Rian Johnson, director/writer } Johnson first had the idea for The Brothers Bloom a few years before Brick. Originally the film was going to be more serious and had a mentor relationship instead of brothers. He started writing the script after taking Brick to Sundance over the next sixth months. The script was challenging for Johnson to write because he wanted to create a character-based con man film with an \\"emotional payoff\\" while including all the storytelling aspects of the genre. Johnson felt by sticking to a standard form of a con man film (two guys with one girl and one of them falls in love with the girl) he could deviate from the classical ending with a big twist. When writing the script Johnson watched The Man Who Would Be King but his main influence came from Paper Moon. While filming the movie he watched The Conformist and 8¬Ω for visual style. =Filming locations= Penelope's castle is the Pele»ô Castle in Sinaia, Romania. Other locations include Belgrade (Serbia), the Constan»õa Casino, the Port of Constan»õa (Romania) and various locations in Greece and Montenegro. The exterior scenes involving the theft of the book were shot in Prague, both in and around Prague Castle and on the Charles Bridge.DVD 'extra': \\"In Bloom: 4 countries in 60 days\\" The ship board scenes were filmed on the steamship (yacht) SS Delphine. =Penelope's skills= During the two-week rehearsal period, Weisz had to learn to look like she could do all the skills that her character Penelope knew. This included banjo, violin, guitar, piano, juggling, break dancing, skateboarding, giraffe unicycle, and card tricks, among others. Brody helped Weisz learn to skateboard; she said, \\"Brody is a good skateboarder, so we were in the parking lot outside the place we were filming.\\" Brody also helped her to learn to rap; when she first tried \\"he was so ashamed.\\" The card trick was the most difficult for Weisz and took her a month of practicing every day to learn. The shot itself took 11 or so takes, but the one continuous shot in the film is not enhanced in any way. Soundtrack The Brothers Bloom: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released on May 19, 2009 by Cut Narrative Records. Director Rian Johnson's cousin, musician Nathan Johnson, composed the score for the film as he did on Johnson's directorial debut, Brick. Three songs in the film are not available on the soundtrack:\\"Tonight I'll Be Staying Here with You\\" by Bob Dylan, \\"Miles from Nowhere\\" by Cat Stevens, and \\"Sleeping\\" by The Band, which was performed karaoke-style by Rinko Kikuchi. Rian Johnson listened to The Band while writing the script, and their music was a major influence on the score. In a digitally-released soundtrack companion booklet, Nathan Johnson said that since the film was about storytelling, it made sense to use lyric-based songs as an inspiration. He also credited Italian composer Nino Rota as an influence. Release The Brothers Bloom had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2008. The film was then screened as the opening night feature at the Boston Independent Film Festival on April 22, 2009. At the Newport Beach Film Fest Johnson won a festival honors award in the category of Outstanding Achievement in Directing. The first seven minutes of the film were posted to the online streaming video site, Hulu, on April 23, 2009. =Box office= The Brothers Bloom was originally to be released in the fall of 2009 but Summit pushed it forward to May. The film opened in four theaters in the U.S. in its first week, earning $90,400. During the Memorial Day weekend from May 23‚Äì25, 2009, the first weekend after its initial limited release, The Brothers Bloom grossed $495,527, from 52 theaters, ranking it #15.

The site's consensus stated that \\"Despite strong performances The Brothers Bloom ultimately does not fulfill its lofty ambitions\\". On Metacritic, the film was assigned a weighted average score of 55 out of 100 based on 26 reviews from mainstream critics. Claudia Puig writing for USA Today stated that the film \\"has it all\\" with an \\"offbeat perspective\\" and \\"magical realism style that works exquisitely\\". She gave The Brothers Bloom a 3.5 out of 4 and wrote that it \\"is an often rapturous trot around the globe\\" but noted that the film \\"loses some steam in the final half hour.\\" Robert Wilonsky thought that Johnson had \\"infused The Brothers Bloom with so much heart and beauty that one can and should easily overlook its discomfiting moments.\\" Wilonsky suggested a second viewing of the film is \\"even more profound and touching\\". Roger Ebert commented how the film's \\"acting is a delight\\" but it was \\"too smug and pleased with itself\\". He continued by complaining that the film had \\"too many encores and curtain calls\\". Robert Abele's review of The Brothers Bloom for the Los Angeles Times criticized Brody for over-moping and considered Ruffalo as \\"out of sorts\\" but thought Weisz's performance as \\"the best thing in the movie\\". Abele also thought Johnson used too many filmmaking quirks and when Johnson was not distracting the audience he had his actors doing it. =Home media= The DVD and Blu-ray became available to rent on September 29, 2009 and to own on January 12, 2010.

The County of Champagne, descended from the early medieval kingdom of Austrasia, passed to the French crown in 1314. Formerly ruled by the counts of Champagne, its western edge is about 160 km (100 miles) east of Paris. The cities of Troyes, Reims, and √âpernay are the commercial centers of the area. In 1956, most of Champagne became part of the French administrative region of Champagne-Ardenne, which comprised four departments: Ardennes, Aube, Haute-Marne, and Marne. From 1 January 2016, Champagne-Ardenne merged with the adjoining regions of Alsace and Lorraine to form the new region of Grand Est. Etymology The name Champagne, formerly written Champaigne, comes from the Latin and referred to the similarities between the rolling hills of the province and the Italian countryside of Campania located south of Rome. History In the High Middle Ages, the province was famous for the Champagne fairs, which were very important in the economy of the Western societies. The chivalric romance had its first beginnings in the county of Champagne with the famous writer Chr√©tien de Troyes who wrote stories of the Round Table from the Arthurian legends. A few counts of Champagne were French kings with the comital title merging with the French crown in 1314 when Louis I, king of Navarre and count of Champagne, became king of France as Louis X. Counts of Champagne were highly considered by the French aristocracy. 1771 map of Champagne and Brie by Rigobert Bonne ReferencesExternal links Category:Geography of Aisne Category:Geography of Ardennes (department) Category:Geography of Aube Category:Geography of C√¥te-d'Or Category:Geography of Haute-Marne Category:Geography of Haute-Sa√¥ne Category:Geography of Meuse (department) Category:Geography of Seine-et-Marne Category:Geography of Vosges (department) Category:Geography of Yonne Category:History of Hauts-de-France Category:History of √éle-de-France Category:History of Grand Est Category:History of Bourgogne-Franche-Comt√© Category:History of Aisne Category:History of Ardennes (department) Category:History of Aube Category:History of C√¥te-d'Or Category:History of Haute-Marne Category:History of Haute-Sa√¥ne Category:History of Meuse (department) Category:History of Seine-et-Marne Category:History of Vosges (department) Category:History of Yonne ","title":"Champagne (province)"},{"id":"10328197","text":"\\"The Apostrophe to Vincentine\\" is a poem from Wallace Stevens's first book of poetry, Harmonium (1923). It was first published before 1923 and is therefore in the public domain according to Librivox. Interpretation Stevens's conflicted idealization of women in poems like \\"Vincentine\\" may not be to everyone's taste, but the poem can be appreciated as a remarkable kind of love poem as well as a study about his recurrent theme of transforming the world through imagination: the animal Vincentine, turned heavenly. She is Stevens's \\"unaccommodated object of desire before she has been clothed in the beauty of fantasy\\", according to Vendler.Vendler, p. 15 Buttel helpfully draws attention to the line \\"Was whited green\\", which startles the reader, \\"through a verbal approximation of painting technique, into a vivid mental recognition‚Äîthe object realized in art\\".Buttel, p. 150 He presents this as a device that Stevens often uses to clarify our vision, indirectly evoking the actual \\"by causing us to reflect on the resemblances between it and the visual and tactile qualities of paintings\\". Buttel also compares the poem to \\"Peter Quince at the Clavier\\" and detects the influence of St√©phane Mallarm√©, even suggesting that the phrase \\"white animal\\" derives from Mallarm√©'s \\"blancheur animale\\" in \\"L'Apr√®s-Midi d'un Faune\\". He sees Vincentine as giving profound meaning to Earth through her perfection, but not quite a fully realized deity of both earth and heaven.Buttel, p. 118-9 For Vendler this lack of full realization is the point: \\"Brutality and apotheosis end in stalemate.\\" The white animal and the transfigured woman (brunette, dressed, walking, talking, feeling) remain in a problematic relation. \\"There is no diction appropriate to both.\\"Vendler, p. 18  Notes  References  * Buttel, Robert.

Since then the venue has alternated between the United Kingdom and continental Europe. To mark the metamorphosis from a small informal colloquium to a major event in the IR research calendar, the BCS-IRSG later renamed the event to European Conference on Information Retrieval. In recent years, ECIR has continued to grow and has become the major European forum for the discussion of research in the field of Information Retrieval. Some of the topics dealt with include: * IR models, techniques, and algorithms * IR applications * IR system architectures * Test and evaluation methods for IR * Natural Language Processing for IR * Distributed IR * Multimedia and cross- media IR Time and Location Traditionally, the ECIR is held in Spring, near the Easter weekend.

History HTC formed in 1996, and played its first gig at the JV's Restaurant, a Falls Church honky tonk. Since then, the band has played in most major venues in the DC area and recorded four CDs, as well as numerous compilation cuts. HTC has won many Washington Area Musicians Association (WAMA) awards, including Debut Album and Country Album for its eponymous 1999 CD (Honky Tonk Confidential). The band's second CD, Your Trailer or Mine? (2002), won Album of the Year and Country Album, and its third CD, Who Gets the Fruitcake This Year? (2006), received Wammy awards for Country Album and Song of the Year.

(To calculate the shadows shown in this image, other techniques such as shadow mapping, shadow feelers or a shadow volume must be used together with deferred shading.http://http.download.nvidia.com/developer/presentations/2004/6800_Leagues/6800_Leagues_Deferred_Shading.pdf) In the field of 3D computer graphics, deferred shading is a screen-space shading technique first suggested by Michael Deering in 1988. It is called deferred because no shading is actually performed in the first pass of the vertex and pixel shaders: instead shading is \\"deferred\\" until a second pass. On the first pass of a deferred shader, only data that is required for shading computation is gathered. Positions, normals, and materials for each surface are rendered into the geometry buffer (G-buffer) using \\"render to texture\\". After this, a pixel shader computes the direct and indirect lighting at each pixel using the information of the texture buffers in screen space. Screen space directional occlusion can be made part of the deferred shading pipeline to give directionality to shadows and interreflections. Advantages The primary advantage of deferred shading is the decoupling of scene geometry from lighting. Only one geometry pass is required, and each light is only computed for those pixels that it actually affects. This gives the ability to render many lights in a scene without a significant performance hit.http://homepage.lnu.se/staff/tblma/Deferred%20Rendering%20in%20XNA%204.pdf There are some other advantages claimed for the approach. These advantages may include simpler management of complex lighting resources, ease of managing other complex shader resources, and the simplification of the software rendering pipeline. Disadvantages One key disadvantage of deferred rendering is the inability to handle transparency within the algorithm, although this problem is a generic one in Z-buffered scenes and it tends to be handled by delaying and sorting the rendering of transparent portions of the scene. Depth peeling can be used to achieve order-independent transparency in deferred rendering, but at the cost of additional batches and g-buffer size. Modern hardware, supporting DirectX 10 and later, is often capable of performing batches fast enough to maintain interactive frame rates. When order-independent transparency is desired (commonly for consumer applications) deferred shading is no less effective than forward shading using the same technique. Another serious disadvantage is the difficulty with using multiple materials. It's possible to use many different materials, but it requires more data to be stored in the G-buffer, which is already quite large and takes up a large amount of the memory bandwidth. One more disadvantage is that, due to separating the lighting stage from the geometric stage, hardware anti-aliasing does not produce correct results anymore since interpolated subsamples would result in nonsensical position, normal, and tangent attributes. One of the usual techniques to overcome this limitation is using edge detection on the final image and then applying blur over the edges, however recently more advanced post-process edge-smoothing techniques have been developed, such as MLAAhttp://igm.univ-mlv.fr/~biri/mlaa-gpu/TMLAA.pdf (used in Killzone 3 and Dragon Age II, among others), FXAAhttp://www.ngohq.com/images/articles/fxaa/FXAA_WhitePaper.pdf (used in Crysis 2, FEAR 3, Duke Nukem Forever), SRAA, DLAA (used in Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II), and post MSAA (used in Crysis 2 as default anti-aliasing solution). Although it is not an edge-smoothing technique, temporal anti- aliasing (used in Halo Reach and Unreal Engine) can also help give edges a smoother appearance. DirectX 10 introduced features allowing shaders to access individual samples in multisampled render targets (and depth buffers in version 10.1), giving users of this API access to hardware anti-aliasing in deferred shading. These features also allow them to correctly apply HDR luminance mapping to anti-aliased edges, where in earlier versions of the API any benefit of anti-aliasing may have been lost. Deferred lighting Deferred lighting (also known as Light Pre-Pass) is a modification of the Deferred Shading. This technique uses three passes, instead of two in deferred shading. On first pass over the scene geometry, only the attributes necessary to compute per-pixel lighting (irradiance) are written to the G-Buffer. The screen-space, ‚Äúdeferred‚Äù pass then outputs only diffuse and specular lighting data, so a second pass must be made over the scene to read back the lighting data and output the final per-pixel shading. The apparent advantage of deferred lighting is a dramatic reduction in the size of the G-Buffer. The obvious cost is the need to render the scene geometry twice instead of once. An additional cost is that the deferred pass in deferred lighting must output diffuse and specular irradiance separately, whereas the deferred pass in deferred shading need only output a single combined radiance value. Due to reduction of the size of the G-buffer this technique can partially overcome one serious disadvantage of the deferred shading - multiple materials. Another problem that can be solved is MSAA. Deferred lighting can be used with MSAA on DirectX 9 hardware. Deferred lighting in commercial games Use of the technique has increased in video games because of the control it enables in terms of using a large amount of dynamic lights and reducing the complexity of required shader instructions. Some examples of games using deferred lighting are: * Alan Wake * Assassin's Creed III * BioShock Infinite * Blur * Brink * Crackdown and Crackdown 2 * Crysis 2 * Dead Space, Dead Space 2 and Dead Space 3 * Deus Ex: Human Revolution * Dragon's Dogma * Guild Wars 2 * Halo: Reach * inFamous and inFamous 2 * LittleBigPlanet * Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes * Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain * Shift 2 UNLEASHED * Red Dead Redemption * Resistance series * Rochard * StarCraft II * Uncharted and Uncharted 2 * Vanquish Deferred shading in commercial games In comparison to deferred lighting, this technique is not very popular due to high memory size and bandwidth requirements, especially on seventh generation consoles where graphic memory size and bandwidth are limited and often bottlenecks. * Amnesia: The Dark Descent * Battlefield 3 * Dota 2 * Dungeons * Digital Combat Simulator (DCS) World 2.5 * Grand Theft Auto IV * Killzone 2 and Killzone 3 * Mafia II * Miner Wars 2081Miner Wars 2081 * Metro 2033 * Rift * Shrek * Splinter Cell: Conviction * The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game series: Shadow of Chernobyl, Clear Sky and Call of Pripyat * Tabula Rasa * Trine * Trine 2 * Viva Pinata Game engines featuring deferred shading or rendering techniques * AnvilNext * Chrome Engine * CryEngine 3 * Fox Engine * Frostbite 2 * GameStart * Haemimont Games Engine (HGE) * I-Novae * Leadwerks * MT Framework * Rockstar Advanced Game Engine * Torque 3D * Unity * Unreal Engine 4 * Vision * Creation Engine as of Fallout 4 and Skyrim SE History The idea of deferred shading was originally introduced by Michael Deering and his colleagues in a paper published in 1988 titled The triangle processor and normal vector shader: a VLSI system for high performance graphics. Although the paper never uses the word \\"deferred\\", a key concept is introduced; each pixel is shaded only once after depth resolution. Deferred shading as we know it today, using G-buffers, was introduced in a paper by Saito and Takahashi in 1990, although they too do not use the word \\"deferred\\". The first deferred shaded video game was Shrek, an Xbox launch title shipped in 2001. Around 2004, implementations on commodity graphics hardware started to appear. The technique later gained popularity for applications such as video games, finally becoming mainstream around 2008 to 2010.

The home was designed for Henry J. Neils, a stone and architectural materials distributor, and his wife Frieda. It is unusual for a Wright-designed home both in the type of stone used as well as in its aluminum window framing. The Neils approached Wright in 1949 to help build a new home on property adjacent to their existing home, overlooking Cedar Lake. The home was designed through close collaboration between the architect and the Neils who were knowledgeable about architecture. It was Wright's only home to use marble walls: the small marble blocks were left over from other marble projects, and Henry Neil, who was a trustee of a marble company, was able to acquire them at a good price and convince Wright to use the material; however, the color of the completed walls did not satisfy either Wright or the Neils, and some of the blocks were later stained. Unlike Wright's normal use of wooden window frames, the home used aluminum frames made by Neils' company. The house was designed in Wright's post-World War II Usonian architecture, with the goal of \\"affordable, beautiful housing for a democratic America.\\" The L-shaped, one-story home's floor plan features a dominant living room and social and spatial separation into \\"active\\" and \\"quiet\\" areas. The short side of the L consists of the \\"active\\" portion, centering on a living room with -high vaulted ceiling and views of Cedar Lake; the \\"quiet\\" portion is the long side ending in a three-car carport and has bedrooms as well as a gallery leading to a hidden main entrance. Located on 2801 Burnham Boulevard, the home is visible from public streets but remains privately owned by members of the Neils family. References * Storrer, William Allin.

Freiburg-St.Georgen is a district of the German city Freiburg and consists of three villages: Uffhausen, Wendlingen and Sankt Georgen itself. Sankt Georgen became a part of Freiburg in 1937. It is bordered by the Sch√∂nberg in the South, Merzhausen to the South-East, the Wiehre to the East, Haslach to the North-West and the Rieselfeld to the North- East. To the South-West it borders Schallstadt and Opfingen and Tiengen to the West. History The first settlements in the area can be traced back to the 8th century BC, around the area of what today is called Uffhausen. One road and water well from Roman times can be dated to around 50 BC. The first official Allemanic settlement was founded and first mentioned as Wendlingen December 26, 768, as Wendlingen. This date is perceived as the official founding date of Sankt Georgen today. Uffhausen was first mentioned in 873.

It runs from the Punta Gorda, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area northeast to the Greater Jacksonville Metropolitan Area. As is the case with all Florida roads with AASHTO route numbers, the entirety of US 17 has a hidden FDOT designation: * State Road 35 from the route's terminus at US 41 in Punta Gorda to East Main Street in Bartow. * State Road 555 from East Main Street in Bartow to US 92/SR 600 in Lake Alfred. * State Road 600 from Lake Alfred to DeLand along the course of the route's cosigning with US 92. * State Road 15 from the intersection with SR 50 and US 17/US 92/SR 15 south in Orlando to the Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway interchange in Jacksonville. * State Road 5 from the Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway interchange in Jacksonville to the Georgia state line over the St. Marys River. Concurrencies include US 98 between Fort Meade and Bartow, and a notably long one with US 92 between Lake Alfred and northern DeLand, which itself includes concurrencies with US 192 in Kissimmee, US 441 between Kissimmee and Orlando, SR 50 in Orlando, and SR 46 in Sanford. Others include SR 20/SR 100 between San Mateo and Palatka, and Interstate 10 (I-10), I-95, US 23, and US 1 in Downtown Jacksonville in that order. Route description=Punta Gorda through Winter Haven= Intersection of US 17 and SR 70 in Arcadia US 17 begins in downtown Punta Gorda at US 41 (Tamiami Trail). From here, it proceeds east as a pair of one- way streets along Marion and Olympia Avenues. Once outside of the Punta Gorda city limits, the one-way streets rejoin each other becoming a six-lane highway. From here, it is briefly elevated over the Seminole Gulf Railway and city streets before intersecting with Interstate 75 (I-75) in Solana. After a brief jog east, it travels roughly northeast along the Peace River into Desoto County, where it goes through Fort Ogden, Nocatee, and Arcadia. It splits into one-way streets again through Arcadia, where it intersects SR 70\\\\. Once out of Arcadia, it continues northeast into Hardee County and the cities of Zolfo Springs (where it crosses the Peace River), and Wauchula. At Fort Meade, it joins with US 98, which follows it northward (westward on US 98) until Bartow. While US 98 goes northwest, US 17 goes northeast. In the city of Bartow, US 17 is known as Spessard Holland Parkway. Here, US 98 leaves to the west at a connecting road to SR 60, where hidden SR 35 breaks away from US 17 and SR 555 replaces it. From here, US 17/SR 555 makes a sharp northeast turn into Gordonville as it passes by the Bartow Municipal Airport. North of there, US 17 serves as the main road through Eagle Lake After the intersection of Crystal Beach Road, the highway divides into a one-way couplet with three lanes in each direction, with the northbound section on 5th Street and the southbound segment on 4th Street. The two segments converge again south of Cameron Road (Gilbert Road) to become a six-lane divided highway. At the next major intersection, SR 540 (Old 9 Foot Road) joins US 17 and both roads continue north in a short concurrency. At Eloise, Old 9 Foot Road moves east onto County Road 655, which is the southern terminus of SR 655 (South Lake Shipp Road) on the west side. A left turn at this intersection and a right turn onto the parallel Seventh Street Southwest takes motorists to Winter Haven Amtrak Station. US 17/SR 540 goes over the Amtrak line between Lake Shipp and Lake Lulu, both of which go over a canal running between the two lakes. The canal serves as the southern border of Winter Haven. Descending as it passes the Chain O' Lakes Sports Complex, SR 540 leaves US 17 at Cypress Gardens Boulevard to continue eastward, but this intersection is also for Southwest Avenue R, which also leads to Winter Haven Station. Between Avenue G Southwest and Avenue C Southwest, US 17 curves to the left from Third Street and then to the right onto Sixth Street. From there it intersects Central Avenue, which is SR 542 east of US 17\\\\. After winding around Spring Lake east of Lake Mirror, the road runs along the west side of Inman Park until it reaches the intersection with SR 544\\\\. =Concurrency with US 92= Older US 17/US 92 markers in Lake Alfred US 17 and US 92 join at the south end of Lake Alfred in Polk County. and thus the new hidden state road is SR 600 which carries US 92 west into Auburndale, Lakeland, Plant City, Tampa, and St. Petersburg. SR 555 soon splits off as CR 555 to the north along the old road through Lake Alfred, known as South Buena Vista Road while US 17/US 92 runs one block east on Lake Shore Way. Just south of East Thelma Street, US 17/US 92 splits onto two different roadways while CR 555 ends on the west side of the intersection. CR 557 begins at Haines Boulevard, where it heads west for a block to former CR 555, and then turns north towards I-4; just past CR 557, US 17/US 92 turns east towards Haines City. It enters downtown Haines City on Hinson Avenue after crossing under US 27 at a cloverleaf interchange, meeting the north end of SR 17\\\\. Right after crossing under a , narrow railroad bridge with arch-shaped pedestrian tunnels on both sides, it turns north onto 17th Street where it meets CR 580, which runs east to Poinciana. In Davenport, US 17 meets CR 547, which heads west to US 27 and north along old US 17/US 92\\\\. US 17 then intersects with Ronald Reagan Parkway (CR 54) at Loughman. After crossing into Osceola County, US 17/US 92 picks up the Orange Blossom Trail (OBT) name. From here US 17/US 92 roughly parallels I-4 along the overlap. OBT takes US 17 east and north through Kissimmee and into Orlando. The OBT name temporarily ends at Pleasant Hill Road (former SR 531) in southern Kissimmee, where it becomes John Young Parkway (formerly Bermuda Avenue) to Vine Street (US 192/SR 530). (US 17 ran through downtown Kissimmee on Emmett Street, Broadway and Main Street until 1999) It turns east there on US 192, while John Young Parkway becomes SR 423\\\\. When all three meet US 441 at Main Street, US 192 follows US 441 southbound, while US 17/US 92 follows US 441, as well as unsigned SR 500 and SR 600, north into downtown Orlando, but not before becoming OBT again at the northern city limits. Due to its proximity with Walt Disney World and affiliated resorts as well as Sea World, Universal Studios, and others, US 17/US 92/US 441 intersects many toll roads between Kissimmee and Orlando, the first of which is the partially tolled and partial limited- access Osceola Parkway in Kissimmee. Immediately after this in Orlando is SR 417 (Central Florida GreeneWay) at exit 11\\\\. North of here the Central Florida Parkway lead to Sea World. Neither of these intersections or interchanges however, compare to the combined interchanges of Florida's Turnpike and SR 528 (Beachline Expressway), in Sky Lake, which contains a series of convoluted parclo interchanges and partial ramps from side roads. North of this interchange, the road passes west of The Florida Mall and intersects SR 482\\\\. The first interchange with I-4 is at exit 80 in Holden Heights. Eastbound access from I-4 comes from partial cloverleaf ramps, and westbound access comes from a left-turn ramp between the two carriageways that runs under the eastbound lane and merges with the east to southbound ramp before merging with southbound OBT. The interchange provides no south to east access and no west to north access, but such access can found from the intersection with West Michigan Street. Further north the road heads into Orlando and comes to the interchange with SR 408 (East-West Tollway) at exit 9, which is a diamond interchange. After curving around Givens Street and Springdale Road, both of which can only be accessed from West Concord Street, OBT moves closer to a parallel railroad freight line and meets the intersection of SR 50 (Colonial Drive) northwest of downtown. At SR 50, US 17/US 92 turns east onto a new concurrency taking hidden SR 600 with it, while US 441 continues northwest on OBT towards Apopka. US 17/US 92/SR 50 meets the south end of Edgewater Drive and crosses under I-4 at a second interchange (exits 83A east and exit 84 west) and SR 527 (Orange Avenue southbound and Magnolia Avenue northbound) before meeting SR 15 (Mills Avenue), where US 17/US 92 turns north. Mills Avenue carries SR 15 on both sides of SR 50, but is only signed as such to the south, as north of SR 50, it carries US 17/US 92 (and unsigned SR 600). It crosses Lake Estelle on the Andrews Causeway before reaching the border between Orlando and Winter Park. In Seminole County, the redevelopment of the 17-92 Community Redevelopment Area is handled by the US 17-92 Community Redevelopment Agency, a component unit of the County government. In Sanford, Florida, US 17/US 92 shares a concurrency with westbound SR 46 beginning at Paola Road (CR 46A) and 25th Street. During this triple-concurrency, US 17/US 92/SR 46 intersects an at-grade railroad crossing with a freight line at the intersection of West 13th Street, also the western terminus of CR 415, and then a pair of railroad crossings at a junction of two other freight lines. The routes turn left at the intersection of First Street, and the wrong way concurrency between US 92 and SR 46 becomes more geographically accurate. Along this segment, US 17/92/SR 46 climbs a bridge over the CSX Sanford Subdivision which includes the Sanford Amtrak Auto Train on the southeast corner of that bridge, and the Sanford SunRail station on the northwest corner. SR 46 leaves US 17/US 92 at the intersection of Sanford CR 15 (Upsala Road), while SR 46 continues west towards Mount Dora and US 17/US 92 continues north along Monroe Road. Just before the intersection with Orange Boulevard, and an at-grade crossing with the Sanford Subdivision, US 17/92 curves to the northeast as it approaches part of the interchange with I-4. Still within the vicinity of this interchange the road turns left onto West Seminole Boulevard only to curve north where it crosses the St. Johns River into Volusia County via the Benedict Bridge, which replaced the Lake Monroe Bridge, running parallel to the very interstate it had just passed under. =DeLand and points north= US 17 in downtown DeLand In the City of DeLand US 17/US 92 adopts the name Woodland Boulevard. At Howry Avenue, the road becomes the eastern border of the National Register of Historic Places-listed Downtown DeLand Historic District. Two blocks later, it intersects SR 44, which does not allow any turns ‚Äî right or left ‚Äî and so adjacent city streets are marked for those turns. Another two blocks north of this point, US 17/US 92 leaves the historic district at Rich Avenue, but then at Ohio Avenue enters another historic district for Stetson University. Further north US 92 then splits away from US 17, with US 92 continuing east to Daytona Beach as International Speedway Boulevard, while US 17 continues north. That straight north directive ends at the intersection of SR 11, and US 17 curves to the northwest, where it serves as the termini of both State Road 15A and its county extension County Road 15A. Within DeLeon Springs, the road runs straight north again and serves as the southern terminus of County Road 3, a scenic detour off of US 17. Curving northwest again before the intersection of Spring Garden Ranch Road, US 17 approaches the vicinity of DeLeon Springs State Park and begins to run parallel to CR 3 again, which it continues to do beyond the preserve, even as it enters Barberville and intersects SR 40\\\\. CR 3 finally terminates with US 17 in Connersville. Momentarily curving east in Satsuma, the road crosses one creek before entering San Mateo where it begins at yet another concurrency, in this case with SR 20/SR 100\\\\. All three roads enter Palatka, and after the intersection with SR 207, US 17 again crosses the St. Johns River, along with SR 20/SR 100 on the Palatka Memorial Bridge. From here, SR 20 breaks away onto South 9th Street and heads west towards Gainesville and the Florida Panhandle, and then US 17/SR 100 pass by the historic Palatka Amtrak station, originally known as the Old Atlantic Coast Line Union Depot, which now serves as the Palatka Railroad Preservation Society and the Browning Railroad Museum, where it encounters a grade crossing. After US 17 curves northwest, SR 100 breaks away onto Reid Street heading towards Lake City, while US 17 takes a turn to the direct north. The last major intersection in Palatka is with SR 19\\\\. North of here, the road follows the CSX \\"A\\" Line, the same one used by Amtrak that serves Palatka station. The road follows that line until it reaches Bostwick, where it runs along CR 209, while US 17 shifts to the northwest. US 17 in Green Cove Springs In Clay County, US 17 continues its rural surroundings until it enters suburban Jacksonville. South of Green Cove Springs it goes over the same Amtrak line it ran parallel to between Palatka and Bostwick and becomes the northern terminus of CR 209, only to later intersect with eastbound SR 16, where it forms a concurrency and becomes Orange Avenue. Most of this segment runs through preserved wetlands with no structures whatsoever, except for a local Elks Lodge until it reaches Oak Street. SR 16 turns west at Ferris Street while US 17 continues north along part of the Green Cove Springs Historic District, then past various Clay County government buildings. After this, it crosses over the Governors Creek Bridge where it continues its status as a commercial strip, although the commercialization diminishes somewhat after Shedd Road. After passing by the entrance of Camp Chowenwaw Park US 17 crosses Black Creek and enters Hibernia, Florida, where it encounters Black Creek Park on the other side of the creek and runs parallel to the Black Creek Rail Trail. The road then enters Fleming Island, Florida where it serves as the eastern terminus of County Road 220 (Doctor's Inlet Road), which is also the intersection of Bald Eagle Road. Black Creek Trail ends on the bridge over Doctor's Inlet, but US 17 continues to move north into Orange Park, Florida, where the road is known as Park Avenue. Besides serving as the eastern terminus of SR 224, it also serves as the location of the Orange Park Kennel Club, just south of the interchange with I-295 which itself serves as the border between Orange Park and Jacksonville, where the road becomes Roosevelt Boulevard. Here, the highway goes past Jacksonville Naval Air Station (NAS Jax). Near downtown Jacksonville, US 17 joins I-10 for approximately one mile (1.6 km), before merging into I-95. US 17 then exits onto US 23 and continues as North Main Street along with US 1 until it reaches the Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway then continues on its own as it crosses the Nassau County border. US 17 in north Jacksonville In Nassau County, US 17 enters Hedges and then Yulee where it intersects SR 200/SR A1A. US 17 turns northwest and continues into Becker where it intersects CR 108 to the west, then a truck weigh station on the east side and finally the last interchange with I-95 in the state, a partial cloverleaf interchange on both the northwest and northeast corners of the I-95 bridge over both the road and the Florida East Coast Railroad mainline, where it instantly enters Gross until it curves north and reaches the Georgia border, crossing over the St. Marys River. US 17 bridge on the Florida-Georgia border History A US 17 shield used in Florida prior to 1993 The original Lake Monroe Bridge over St. Johns River, which carried US 17 (and US 92) from 1933 to 1994 US 17 was one of the original routes of the U.S. Highway system, which was established in 1926. It initially terminated in Jacksonville, but was extended south through Orlando to Punta Gorda in 1932. From 1956, signs for U.S. Highways in Florida had different colors for each highway. The \\"shield\\" for US 17 was yellow, until the state was forced by the federal government to conform to standards that required consistent black-and- white signs in 1993. In 1980, US 17 was realigned and elevated slightly at the southern end in Punta Gorda to accommodate the construction of Interstate 75, which also included splitting the route into the current one-way pairs along Marion Street and Olympia Avenue. The route formerly continued along Marion Avenue to Florida Street and Dundee Road. Since then, US 17 has been incrementally widened to a divided highway with four or more lanes through Charlotte, Desoto, and Hardee Counties. Much of the widening has incorporated a parallel abandoned Florida Southern/Atlantic Coast Line Railroad corridor between Bowling Green and Arcadia, which was removed in the early 1980s. Today, the northbound one-way segment through Wauchula runs along this former rail corridor as well as the southbound one-way segment through Arcadia. In 2006, a short segment was realigned to the east along this rail corridor just north of Arcadia, bypassing Brownville. The former alignment is now known as Cubitis Avenue. Another segment through Zolfo Springs was realigned to the former railroad corridor in early 2018. Main Street in Zolfo Springs is the previous alignment of this segment of US 17. In 1994, the original Lake Monroe Bridge over the St. Johns River near Sanford, which was built in 1933 along with this segment of US 17, was replaced with the current four-lane Bill Benedict Bridge. The swing span of the original bridge has been preserved and now serves as a pier next to the current bridge. On August 13, 2004, Hurricane Charley made landfall just before 4:00 p.m. local time near the southern terminus of US 17. Incredibly, Charley would either hit or threaten to hit the entire route of US 17, devastating almost the entire route in Florida, at least from Punta Gorda to well north of Orlando (when Charley followed the route of Interstate 4 out to sea). The Georgia stretch of US 17 was not hit, but was under a hurricane warning. When Charley made landfall again in South Carolina, its trail all the way through Virginia was close to the route of US 17. In late 2013, the Florida Department of Transportation began an $80 million project to construct a flyover interchange with US 17-92 traveling over SR 436 in Casselberry. This interchange was built to alleviate congestion at one of the busiest intersections in Florida. The flyover interchange was completed on April 6, 2015, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony held. Future US 17 is currently being widened from the Hardee/Desoto County Line to Sweetwater Road in southern Hardee County, which will be completed in summer of 2018. Upon completion of this project, US 17 will be at least four lanes continuously from the terminus in Punta Gorda to Haines City.

Static relays are contrasted with electromechanical relays, which use moving parts to create a switching action. Both types of relay control electrical circuits through a switch that is open or closed depending upon an electrical input. Static relays have been designed to perform similar functions with the use of electronic circuit control as an electromechanical relay performs with the use of moving parts or elements. For example, in an induction type electromechanical relay, the time delay for the switching action can be adjusted by adjusting the distance traveled by the disc, whereas in a static relay the delay can be set by adjusting the value of the resistance in an R-C time delay circuit. Static relays may be based on analog solid state circuits, digital logic circuits, or microprocessor-based designs. Some authors use the term \\"static relay\\" to refer only to solid state relays. Structure A static relay consists of: * An input circuit that measures the value of desired property * A comparator circuit that compares the measured value to a preset threshold * An optional time delay circuit that controls the timing of the switch action after the input has reached the threshold * A power supply for the static relay circuits For example, an overcurrent protective relay may have an AC to DC power supply for the input circuit, a level detector circuit and an RC time delay circuit. While early comparators used discrete transistor circuits, modern designs use operational amplifiers.

As is the case with all Florida roads with federal designations, the entirety of US 19 has a hidden Florida Department of Transportation designation: * State Road 55 from the US route's southern terminus at US 41 south of Terra Ceia to the junction with US 221 / SR 55 north in Perry. * State Road 30 from the junction with US 221 / SR 55 in Perry for roughly one mile to the junction with US 27 south (SR 20 east) / US 98 west (SR 30 west) via US 221 Truck. * State Road 20 from the junction with US 27/US 98 in Perry cosigning with US 27 until the routes split in Capps. * State Road 57 from the US 27/SR 20 split in Capps to the Georgia state line north of Texas Hill. US 19 remains independent of I-75, even as the routes converge in the Tampa Bay Area. The route is co-signed with Interstate 275 over the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge over the mouth of Tampa Bay, US 98 between Chassahowitzka and Perry, Alternate US 27 between Chiefland and Perry, and US 27 between and Perry and Capps. Route description=Manatee County to Pinellas County= Sunshine Skyway Bridge, carrying I-275/US 19 across Tampa Bay The road begins at an interchange with U.S. Route 41 in Manatee County, and remains independent until the interchange with Interstate 275 at Exit 5, where it overlaps I-275 across the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, the terminus of which is at Interstate 275 & State Road 682 at Exit 17. According to a Dateline NBC study, part of US 19 in Florida is the most dangerous road in the United States. A Florida Highway Patrol test period beginning in 1998 and ending in 2003, as mandated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, showed the stretch of US 19 from Pasco County to Pinellas County to average approximately 52 deaths a year, or 262 deaths in the 5-year duration of the study. 100 of these deaths were pedestrian related making US 19 the #1 worst road to walk on in these two counties. Multiple efforts to improve US 19 have been suggested to the FDOT. Within Downtown St. Petersburg, US 19 crosses Alternate US 19, which used to serve as the southern terminus of Alt US 19 until 2006. US 19 runs along 34th Street until just south of the interchange at State Road 694 at Gandy and Park Boulevards in Pinellas Park. This interchange was intended for the formerly proposed Gandy Freeway. In eastern Largo, State Road 688 shares an interchange with the northern terminus of State Road 693, a road that leads to St. Pete Beach and was once part of State Road A19A. Immediately after this, the next interchange is at State Road 686, the road to the St. Petersburg-Clearwater Airport. State Road 60 is the site of the world's first Single-point urban interchange. Drew Street is north of the interchange, and for years has been a source of major accidents. By 2006, the freeway gap was filled between SR 60 and Sunset Point Road, however the service roads terminate at a creek between Drew Street and NE Coachman Road, creating a traffic situation similar to that of the Oakdale Merge on Long Island, New York. As of 2017, US 19 is built to freeway standards from just south of 49th Street N to just north of State Road 580. The freeway is built in the style of many Texas freeways, with service roads along the length of the route and Texas u-turns at major interchanges. =Pasco County= The US 19 bridge over the Pithlachascotee River between New Port Richey and Port Richey US 19 in Hudson and Hudson Beach When Alternate US 19 terminates at US 19 in Holiday across from a major trailer park, a de facto extension of the road serves as a brief multiplex with US 19 in Holiday which terminates a block north of the northern terminus of Alternate US 19 in Holiday at Mile Stretch Road (CR 595). After the intersection with Moog Road, US 19 takes a slight curve to the northeast before intersecting with State Road 54. Shortly after this, the road crosses CR 518 (Trouble Creek Road), then dips as it approaches the gateway to Gulf Harbors and curves straight north before reaching Gulf Boulevard. Downtown New Port Richey can be found roughly two miles north of this point at Main Street which is the northern terminus of unmarked southern CR 595, although the terminus used to be at Grand Boulevard in Port Richey. The bridge over the Pithlachascotee River, which carries US 19 from New Port Richey to Port Richey was a two-lane drawbridge until 1965. An even older version of that bridge is now fishing pier owned by a boat rental dealership.Fishing pier, part of old US 19 Bridge (Historic Pictures of Western Pasco County) Just as in Pinellas County, US 19 in Pasco County has been rated the most dangerous road in the United States. Ridge Road (CR 524) is considered to be one of the most dangerous intersection of US 19. However instead of making any genuine effort to improve the intersection by building an interchange, local governments have allowed developers to add a Wal-Mart and smaller stores in the vicinity of the intersection. The closest thing to an interchange that has been considered is an overpass strictly for left-turn lanes.Suncoast News; Taking the High Road by Carl Orth; August 4, 2001 North of Ridge Road, US 19 passes by the Gulf View Square Mall as well as the Embassy Plaza and Embassy Crossing shopping centers on the opposite side of the mall. North of these two shopping centers, a marginal dirt road can be found on the east side of US 19 as far north as Fox Hollow Drive, while on the west side a paved road that may have been part of the old US 19 runs from the north end of the mall to Clemens Boulevard. After this, the road intersects CR 77 (Regency Park Drive) south of Jasmine Estates, Florida, which is only noticed because an 18 screen movie theater is located opposite from the terminus, before turning straight north again near the intersection with Hammock Road and Ranch Road. The next major intersection is State Road 52 in Bayonet Point. The southwest corner of SR 52 is dominated by a flea market which was originally a race track. After curving from north to northeast near the Old Dixie Highway in Hudson Beach, US 19 intersects with Hudson Avenue and Fivay Drive, the latter of which was formerly part of County Road 1. The northern terminus of Little Road (CR 1) was built at the turn of the century further north. Between the former and current terminus of CR 1, US 19 is dotted with independent motels, one of which was plagued with so much flooding during the early 21st Century that it was torn down. Another marginal dirt road exists along the east side of this section. North of Little Road, US 19 curves straight north again. Aripeka Road (CR 595) is located in one of the most rural sections of the county. Despite efforts to preserve some of the land in this section, a new gated community geared towards horse owners has sprung up north of Aripeka Road. US 19's journey through Pasco County ends at County Road 578 (County Line Road), and Holiday Springs RV Resort across from the west end of CR 578. =Hernando County= Tourist sign on US 19 just north of County Line Road (CR 578) After the intersection at County Road 578 (County Line Road), US 19 continues northbound as a six-lane highway with occasional frontage roads. Tourist Development Council signs at both borders boast of the county being part of Florida's Nature Coast. The southern half of US 19 serves as most of the western border of Spring Hill, Florida. Applegate Road near Wendy Drive is only a short distance from CR 574 (Spring Hill Drive) and CR 595 (Osowaw Boulevard) serve as the Gateways to Spring Hill and Hernando Beach, although southbound US 19 travelers can reach CR 595 from Tarpon Boulevard. Osowaw and Tarpon Boulevards were once part of the Old Dixie Highway, which crossed over US 19 and back until shopping centers and a portion of Timber Pines, Florida were built along the road. Evidence of post- war, pre-Disney efforts to attract tourists can be found in two dinosaur- shaped landmarks. The first is north of the Windward Village gated community, and the second is built around a local garage and former Sinclair gas station. In between there is another short former section of Old Dixie Highway north of Windward Village. Forest Oaks Boulevard is a street that runs past a local Hernando County Sheriff's station as it winds its way to Deltona Boulevard (CR 589). Berkley Manor Boulevard is the next intersection, but strictly leads to another Deed Restricted Community in Spring Hill. On the opposite side of these two intersections is a shopping center in front of two other roads leading to gated communities. US 19 leaves Spring Hill north of Northcliffe Boulevard, and enters Weeki Wachee, Florida, \\"the City of Live Mermaids.\\" Weeki Wachee Springs State Park, famous for the daily Mermaid performances and Buccaneer Bay water park is at the intersection of State Road 50 (Cortez Blvd). This coastal spur becomes County Road 550 (Hernando County, Florida) will travel out to Bayport (Bayport Park and boat ramp) and to Pine Island, the county's only Gulf water beach. A shopping center can be found diagonally across from the park. North of State Road 50 US 19 is four-lanes wide, and has had a limited number of median openings that contain left-turn lanes until 2014. Signs warn motorists that the region is a Bear Habitat. This is because much of what surrounds Route 19 north of Hexam Road consists of the Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge. Even the intersection with CR 476 (Centralia Road) is barely notable without signs. =Citrus County= Across the Hernando-Citrus County Line, US 19 continues its rural surroundings, but this time has a limited number of left-turn lanes in the center-median. Recent development in the area may lead to the addition of such turn lanes. US 98 joins US 19 in Chassahowitzka, where State Road 700 ends. County Road 480 also shares this intersection, and overlaps US 98 before branching out on its own towards Floral City. The first developed neighborhood encountered along US 19-98 is Sugarmill Woods. After the western terminus of Cardinal Lane, the road passes by Howard's Flea Market then curves to the northwest. Within Homosassa Springs, the division temporarily ends after it overlaps County Road 490. CR 490A terminates at the three-route concurrency with US 19-98-CR 490. Less than 1/2 mile north of end of the CR 490 concurrency, the road becomes divided again. North of Homosassa Springs US 19-98 serves as the location of a series of car dealerships, local garages, a Moose Lodge, churches and the intersection of Ozello Trail (CR 494). As the road approaches Crystal River Airport, it enters the City of Crystal River, since the Airport serves as the unofficial southern border. At the intersection of County Road 44W, US 19-98 becomes a six-lane divided boulevard. The division of this highway ends again, just south of the intersection of State Road 44, where the road curves west as it approaches County Road 495 (North Citrus Avenue). US 19-98 curves back north and becomes a divided highway once again as it approaches Crystal River Mall. Other former sections exist between Crystal River and , while the current US 19-98 passes by sparsely located hotels, bars, houses, cluster developments and signs advertising locally prepared peanuts. It also passes by the Seven Rivers Regional Medical Center just south of the Crystal River Nuclear Power Plant and then County Road 488 in Red Level. A field where American Civil War re-enactments are staged lies just north of the back entrance to a local quarry. The Cross Florida Barge Canal was the last section of US 19 that is two lanes wide in Citrus County. A new four-lane divided bridge was completed by FDOT in the early-2010s,District Seven Construction -- Citrus County (Florida Department of Transportation) which was originally planned in conjunction with the proposed Suncoast Parkway extension to Red Level. A smaller four-lane bridge carries US 19-98 across the Withlacoochee River as it crosses the Citrus-Levy County Line. =Levy County to Dixie County= County Road 326, looking east along CR 326 US 19-98 crosses the Withlacoochee River and immediately enters Levy County and the city of Inglis, where it intersects with County Road 40. West of US 19-98, CR 40 is named \\"Follow That Dream Boulevard\\" for the 1962 movie starring Elvis Presley. Shortly after this, the road intersects CR 40A. North of Inglis, US 19-98 runs along sparse residences, trailer parks, a Florida Sheriff's Youth Facility, the Gulf Hammock Wildlife Management Area and eventually Goethe State Forest. Within the forest, the road crosses the Ten Mile Creek bridge before reaching an at-grade interchange with State Road 121 & County Road 336 in Lebanon Junction. From there, US 19-98 runs along an abandoned railroad line along the east side, while the median is widened and lined with the trees that existed before the road was ever built. This section also secretly overlaps CR 336. At the intersection of County Road 326 in Gulf Hammock, an old locomotive and caboose are on display. Blinking signals exist over the intersection with State Road 24 in Otter Creek, but the overlap with CR 336 leaves just before the signal. Alternate US 27 joins US 19-98 in Chiefland where State Road 500 ends. This intersection was transformed into a 90-degree intersection, which directly faces a local high school. Almost instantly US 19-98-Alt 27 encounters the intersection of US 129. US 19-ALT 27-98 makes a sharp left turn near the intersection of State Road 26 in Fanning Springs, where it also crosses the Joe H. Anderson Sr. Bridge over the Suwannee River, thus entering Dixie County. It then follows the left bank of the Suwannee River and intersects the eastern terminus of County Road 55A, and even contains a Truck Weight station in the median before reaching State Road 349 in Old Town, which used to be U.S. Route 129 Alternate. The road starts making more of a northwest turn after this and shortly afterward encounters CR 351 in Cross City, then passes through Shamrock where the road crosses County Road 358 twice. After the second crossing of CR 358, it begins to take an even more northerly direction before leaving Dixie County at the Steinhatchee River. =Taylor County to Jefferson County= US 19/US 27 crossing the Aucilla River, south of Lamont Immediately after crossing the Steinhatchee River, US 19 enters Taylor County, where it intersects with State Road 51 at Tennille. The rest of the way, US 19 passes through small unincorporated areas such as Salem, Carbur, Athena, and Pinland. In Bucell Junction US 19 gains the name Byron Butler Parkway as it intersects with State Road 30 and State Road 30A near the Perry-Foley Airport. SR 30 secretly joins US 19 momentarily. Within the city limits of Perry, SR 55 veers to the right along US 221. SR 30 is the secret designation north of here. Alternate US 27 terminates at US 27, which replaces it as an overlapping US route as US 98 heads west along State Road 30. From this point, the secret designation is State Road 20. It also briefly carries U.S. Truck Route 221 until it reaches County Road 359A (Wright Road). In Eridu the road intersects with County Road 14. US 19/US 27 briefly enters Madison County where the name is changed to the Florida-Georgia Parkway, where it intersects with County Road 150, then Jefferson County. The first major town in Jefferson County that the road enters is Lamont, Florida, where US 19/US 27 encounters SR 165 and CRs 257A & 257B, as it begins to move in a more westerly direction. =Capps to the Georgia State Line= US 90 in Monticello US 27 leaves US 19 in Capps along with SR 20, on its way through Tallahassee. From this point on, State Road 57 is the secret designation, and the road maintains the name Florida-Georgia Parkway. After the intersection with CR 158B, US 19 encounters Interstate 10 at Exit 225 in Drifton, then an intersection with County Road 57A, and later County Road 158. The road shares a concurrency with CR 259 as it intersects US 90 (SR 10) and CR 146, but it ends just south of the intersection with CR 149 in Monticello. US 19 finally crosses the Georgia state line where SR 57 ends and Georgia SR 3 and 300 begin, the former of which is the state route for US 19 into Atlanta, while the latter of which is the state route for US 19 from there to Albany, Georgia. History A US 19 shield used in Florida prior to 1993 US 19 first entered Florida in 1929. It underwent three route shifts, the first in 1933, the second in 1946, and the third in 1951 which adjusted it to its current alignment, and created the alternate route in Pinellas County. US 19 was extended to its southern terminus of Memphis in September 1954, when the original Sunshine Skyway Bridge opened to traffic. From 1956 until 1993, US 19 signs in Florida featured white numbering on a red shield. The \\"color-coding\\" of U.S. Routes by the Florida Department of Transportation was stopped when the state could no longer use Federal funds to replace the signs with anything but the standard black-and-white version; a few red US 19 signs remain.

It runs from the South Florida Metropolitan Area northwest to the Tallahassee Metropolitan Statistical Area. Throughout the state, US 27 has been designated the Claude Pepper Memorial Highway by the Florida Legislature. It was named after long-time Florida statesman Claude Pepper, who served in both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. The stretch running from Miami to South Bay was originally designated the Thomas E. Will Memorial Highway by the Florida Legislature in 1937 when that portion was known as Florida State Road 26. Will, the founder of Okeelanta, Florida, had worked for almost twenty years to get the state to build a road from Miami to the area south of Lake Okeechobee. For most of its length in the state, US 27 is a divided highway. Between Miami and Leesburg, US 27 follows SR 25, between Leesburg and Williston, it follows SR 500, between Williston and High Springs, it follows SR 45, between High Springs and Downtown Tallahassee, it follows SR 20, within Downtown Tallahassee it follows SR 61, and between Tallahassee and the Georgia border, it follows State Road 63 (SR 63). Concurrencies include State Road 80, between South Bay and Clewiston, SR 78 from Moore Haven to Citrus Center, US 98 between Sebring and West Frostproof, US 441 between Leesburg and Ocala, which also includes a concurrency with US 301 between Belleview and Ocala. Others include US 41 between Williston and High Springs, SR 20 between High Springs and Tallahassee, US 129 in Branford, US 19 between Perry and Capps, and SR 61 in Tallahassee. Route description=Miami through Central Florida= Southern terminus in Miami US 27 begins its northward journey as North 36th Street in Midtown Miami, heading west from US 1 for before turning northwest to pass under the western terminus of the Airport Expressway (State Road 112, SR 112). It then proceeds northwest for five miles (8 km) as South Okeechobee Road, parallel to the Miami Canal, forming the southwest boundary of the city of Hialeah. After an interchange with the Palmetto Expressway (SR 826), it continues northwest as North Okeechobee Road for five miles (8 km) before an interchange with the Homestead Extension of the Florida Turnpike. After another four miles (6 km), the highway curves to the north and, after passing the northern terminus of Krome Avenue (SR 997), crosses into Broward County. US 27, looking North near the Everglades. US 27, looking south towards the I-75 interchange Lake Placid Tower, on US 27. Similar to the Citrus Tower further north in Clermont, which is also on US 27 In Broward County, the highway passes protected wetlands and heavy duty power lines on the west and the outer reaches of the suburban communities of Pembroke Pines and Weston on the east where it curves to the northwest. It passes by West Broward High School in Pembroke Pines, in which many school buses coming from Sheridan Street use US 27 to get to Johnson Street to where the high school is. US 27 then reaches an interchange with I-75 and Alligator Alley which is an elaborate partial cloverleaf with flyovers from US 27, loop ramps from I-75 and no re-entry to either road. From here, the road is surrounded by Everglades-related wilderness and recreational areas before curving to the north toward South Bay, where it intersects State Road 80 and overlaps the road before curving west along the shores of Lake Okeechobee. The highway skirts the southwestern shore of Lake Okeechobee and then heads west through Lake Harbor and then Clewiston, before making a sharp turn to the north towards Moore Haven, where it crosses the Mamie Langdale Memorial Bridge over the Caloosahatchee Canal and makes another sharp turn to the west. The road then intersects with State Road 78, which it overlaps until reaching Citrus Center, then proceeds in a northerly direction toward the central Florida communities such as Lake Placid, where it intersects State Road 70. The southern terminus of the concurrency with U.S. Route 98 is also the eastern terminus of State Road 66. From here, the hidden routes are State Road 25 and State Road 700. Shortly after this, US 27-98 runs through a commercial strip area before curving to the west at a wye intersection along the south shore of Lake Jackson in Sebring, where State Road 17 begins. The road heads back to the northwest as it runs along and then away from the edge of the lake. North of here, the road runs west of Lake Sebring, but in Avon Park it runs much closer to the shores of Lake Glenada, where it passes through South Florida Community College territory. From here it passes by Lake Lelia, and Lake Anoka, and just east of Avon Park Executive Airport it intersects State Road 64 and the northern terminus of a segment of State Road 17. SR 64 continues east along part of SR 17 as a bi-county extension northeast into Polk County which runs through Lake Wales Ridge State Forest and terminates at the Avon Park Air Force Range. North of here, US 27 carries hidden state routes (SRs 17, 25 and 700) into Polk County until it reaches Sunray Deli Estates, where SR 17 breaks away again, and runs relatively parallel to US 27 until it reaches Haines City. Meanwhile, after making a reverse curve over a bridge above a CSX Railroad Line that is used by Amtrak's Silver Star and Silver Meteor lines, US 98 breaks away in West Frostproof, taking SR 700 with it. In the opposite direction of this intersection is a continuation of County Road 630. After passing by Warner University, Crooked Lake Park and County Road 640, US 27 becomes slightly less rural as it approaches an un-numbered partial cloverleaf interchange with State Road 60 in Lake Wales. North of this point, US 27 becomes a six-lane highway, and remains that way until reaching State Road 540 in Waverly, Florida, where the road narrows down to four lanes again. However, the widening of US 27 to a six-lane highway continues in Polk County between here and SR 542 in Dundee. North of here, US 27 runs through Lake Hamilton, and curves around the eastern shores of the lake for which the community was named. After passing by a pair of gated communities and crossing over a bridge between Middle Lake Hamilton, and the ironically named larger Little Lake Hamilton, it curves north and intersects SR 544\\\\. Taking a turn to the northeast after passing by Lake Henry, US 27 encounters another un- numbered interchange with U.S. Route 17/92 in Haines City, and immediately passes over another CSX Railroad Line that is used by Amtrak's Silver Star and Silver Meteor lines. With the exception of a segment between Hammock Lake and Tower Lake, most of US 17 remains a commercial strip, especially as it enters Davenport, and approaches quarter-cloverleaf interchanges on the southeast and northwest corners of the bridge over Interstate 4 at Exit 55. =Citrus Ridge to Santos= Minneola, looking south towards the Citrus Tower North of I-4, US 27 contains more un-numbered interchanges. The first of which is a trumpet interchange with US 192 (State Road 530) on the Polk-Lake County Line in Citrus Ridge, and shortly afterwards an at-grade intersection with County Road 474 (CR 474), although some maps have indicated another interchange here. Most of the road remains a rural four-lane highway with at-grade intersections. After passing by Lake Louisa State Park and winding around the eastern shores of the lake that the park was named for, US 27 approaches a cloverleaf interchange without exit numbers at SR 50 in Clermont. After passing the Florida Citrus Tower and Presidents Hall of Fame, the road enters Minneola along the east side of Lake Minneola, where it crosses a bridge over the South Lake-Lake Minneola Scenic Trail, intersects such roads as County Road Old 50, as well as County Road 561, the latter of which it shares a brief concurrency. After this it briefly runs parallel to the southwest side of Florida's Turnpike, until it veers slightly to the west and approaches a quarter- cloverleaf interchange with SR 19 south of Howey-in-the-Hills, which also includes a southbound interchange with Florida's Turnpike. The northbound Turnpike interchange can be found further northwest. At Okahumpka, US 27 intersects two county roads that are extensions of state roads. The first of which is County Road 48, and the next of which is the northern terminus of County Road 33 before running along the western shore of Lake Harris and eastern shore of Lake Denham, the location of Singletary Park. North of Lake Harris, it enters Leesburg where US 27 has an intersection with State Road 44. US 441 later joins US 27, and as a result, the hidden state routes are officially SR 25-500. SR 500 becomes more prominent however, because in Lady Lake, SR 25 branches away as County Road 25. This once served as the southern terminus of the US 27-441 Alternate Route around Lake Weir into Belleview, but still remains a scenic route. US 441 Around the Lake-Marion county border, US 27-441 enters a retirement community known as The Villages. Because of the frequent use of street-legal golf cars in the community, bridges and tunnels for these carts can be found throughout the road. US 27-441 leaves The Villages as it approaches County Road 42, a bi-county east-west scenic route through Central Florida. North of here, it serves as the newly constructed bypass that leads to CR 484, in Summerfield. Within Belleview, the road encounters two somewhat important intersections; County Road 25A, and then State Road 35. SR 35 joins US 27-441 in a wrong-way concurrency with SR 500 as the road curves more to the west, until it reaches the intersection with US 301, where SR 35 turns south, and SR 500 becomes the hidden state road for US 27-301-441 for a few blocks. However SR 25 reunites with the triplex at the former eastern terminus of CR 484, and shares a concurrency with SR 25, and US 27-301-441's new secret route becomes SR 25-500. After that the road curves more to the north again. Near the right of way for the formerly proposed Cross Florida Barge Canal, the median for the road widens, but narrows back down to normal again. Before it does, however, it intersects CR 328, where a police station exists between the median. Supports for a bridge that was intended to run over the canal exist behind the police station. To the west of this intersection is the Santos Trailhead of the Cross Florida Greenway.Cross Florida Greenway State of Florida =Santos through High Springs= Fellowship from the south Before US 27-301-441 enters Ocala, it veers off to the left at an intersection with County Road Old 441 (Southeast Lake Weir Avenue), a former segment of US 441 that eventually leads to Ocala Union Station. The first major intersection after this is 31st Street. Then it crosses under a railroad bridge before reaching the City Limits and the intersections with the northern terminus of CR 475 and crossing SR 464 (17th Street). US 27-301-441 intersects with SR 200 (becoming the new hidden state road until US 301 reaches US 1-23). The highway reaches the heart of Ocala at the intersection with SR 40 (West Silver Springs Boulevard). After this, the road crosses a railroad bridge west of Ocala Union Station. Five blocks later, it reaches the intersection of SR 492(Northwest 10th Street) only to move in the opposite direction, leaving the US 301-441 overlap and taking SR 500 with it. After retaining its status as an independent US highway, US 27 moves from Northwest Tenth Street to Northwest Blitchton Road and has another interchange with Interstate 75, although this one is a mere diamond interchange, as opposed to the elaborate partial cloverleaf with flyovers in Weston. From here it continues northwest through rural Marion County, much of which is surrounded by horse farms. The few truly significant intersection in this region include County Road 464B in Fellowship and then County Road 326 near Emathla. The last intersections at the Marion-Levy County border are with CR 316 and Levy-CR 335. Though horse farms are scarce along this segment in Levy County, the surroundings remain rural. CR 316 begins again at an intersection with US 27 in East Williston, and as the road enters the City of Williston, it serves as the western terminus of CR 318, crosses a set of CSX railroad tracks, and loses its status as an independent US route. State Road 500 continues straight ahead along ALT US 27, while US 27 turns north and joins US 41(hidden SR 45), as well as State Road 121, which already ran east for a few blocks along ALT US 27. The concurrency with SR 121 is short-lived though, as it branches away to the northeast. The US 27-41 concurrency is one of the few segments that are only two lanes wide, and it begins to lean to the northwest until briefly shifting straight north before approaching Archer, where it intersects CR 346, then a former Florida Railway and Navigation Company right-of-way, and finally State Road 24. After SR 24, US 27-41 curves back northwest but head straight northward through State Road 26 in Newberry and both remain as such until US 41 reaches High Springs, and joins US 441 towards Lake City and points north. =High Springs to Tallahassee= Branford US 27 heads west along the unsigned SR 20\\\\. which is named First Avenue until it crosses the Santa Fe River and enters Columbia County. From here it continues to run northwest, but briefly turns straight west after entering Fort White just before intersecting State Road 47. The road shifts to the right again and turns northwest before leaving the city, but gradually turns back west as it gets closer to Suwannee County. Before the road crosses the Ichetucknee River at the Columbia-Suwannee County Line, it intersects with Southwest Riverside Avenue, which serves as the western terminus of the O'Leno to Ichetucknee Trail and the eastern terminus of the Suwannee River Greenway, a former ACL Railroad line.Suwannee River Greenway at Branford (Florida Greenways and Trails) Both US 27 and the trail run through Hildreth, the home of the Ichetucknee Springs State Park, and then encounters the east end of a multiplex with U.S. Route 129 (State Road 49) which is also the southern terminus of County Road 49. US 27-129 and the trail enter the hamlet of Wachtokha, but the trail remains straight while the road curves slightly to the northwest. A slight curve to the southwest is where both routes officially enter Branford where US 129 turns north onto Hidden SR 249. The Suwannee River Greenway crosses US 27 between the west end of the US 27-129 multiplex and Frank R. Norris Bridge across the Suwannee River, but it was also once the northern terminus of US ALT 129, which followed US 27 across the river into Lafayette County until it reached State Road 349 in Grady. Mayo near the SR 51 intersection. On the right is the M. Pico Building The road runs through the rural community of Alton without being noticed, but slows down as it enters Mayo where it intersects State Road 51, the northwest corner of which contains the historic Lafayette County Courthouse. After the intersection of Lafayette Street, the road curves northwest again. Outside the city limits, the road intersects various local roads, the most significant of which is County Road 534. The rest of the way, US 27 runs northwest through more of western rural Lafayette County, but it turns straight west again as it approaches Buckville where it intersects the southern terminus of County Road 53 and northern terminus of County Road 534, both of which were once part of State Road 53. The last intersection in Lafayette County is with County Road 348 in Townsend before US 27 becomes surrounded by swampland as it enters Taylor County. US 27 at the Aucilla River, which is the Madison/Jefferson County border Swampland continues to surround US 27 until it comes close to Perry, where a small truck weigh station can be found along the westbound shoulder. The road divides momentarily at the intersection of State Road 30, which has controlled turn lanes in the divider, but then turns back into an undivided two lane road as it curves northwest. At Buckeye Nursery Road, US 27 gets the name East Hampton Springs Avenue. East Hampton Springs curves from northwest to southwest once again, and the straight west at Washington Street. The street name changes from East Hampton Springs Avenue to West Hampton Springs Avenue at US 221(hidden SR 55) but also joins U.S. Truck Route 221. Several blocks later the road intersects Byron Butler Parkway which is the northern terminus of the US 19-98-ALT 27 multiplex. Here, U.S. Alternate Route 27 terminates, U.S. 98 and SR 30 leaves US 19 turning straight ahead west onto West Hampton Springs Avenue, and US 27 joins US 19 becoming a four-lane highway again. US 19-27 also continues to carry US Truck 221 until it reaches County Road 359A (Wright Road), but also continues to take SR 20 with it heading straight northwest through the rest of Taylor County, and then very briefly in Madison County, where it intersects County Road 150. US 19 breaks away in Capps onto State Road 57 on its way through Monticello, but not before resuming a westward direction at the Madison-Jefferson County Line. In Tallahassee, the road becomes the 1957-built Apalachee Parkway, a major east‚Äìwest thoroughfare. The parkway has a short expressway section just east of the capitol, then is a busy four-lane surface boulevard with service roads for the next few miles, passing the Governor's Square Mall, Tallahassee Mall and many state office buildings. US 27 runs west along this stretch of road however, and the Apalachee Parkway ends at SR 61(Monroe Street) in front of the Florida State Capitol building. US 27 and SR 20 make a sharp turn north along SR 61, but at the intersection of U.S. Route 90 in Florida, SR 20 turns west while US 27 continues north along SR 61. =North from Tallahassee= Construction of Apalachee Parkway in Tallahassee, Florida, April 1957 After the intersection with US 90, hidden State Road 63 officially begins at the intersection of North Monroe Street and Thomasville Road, where State Road 61 resumes its status as a separate exposed route. After crossing Seventh Avenue, it begins to curve to the northwest avoiding Lake Ella. The first intersection during this curve is County Road 158 (Tharpe Street), and is the beginning of SR 63's alternate street name of Old Quincy Highway. SR 63 approaches its only suffixed auxiliary route in the form of County Road 63A before encountering a partial cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 10 (Exit 199). North of the interchange, it begins to leave the Tallahassee City Limits. A great deal of this segment of SR 63 consists of RV parks and other facilities serving tourists for the Lake Jackson Mounds Archaeological State Park It also serves as the northeast terminus of County Road 0356. After crossing a bridge that runs over a small portion of Lake Jackson, the road simultaneously intersects the northern terminus of State Road 263 and southern terminus of County Roads 157 and 0361. The road runs along the west side of Tallahassee Commercial Airport, and makes a reverse curve as it approaches a bridge over the Ochlockonee River, where it crosses the Leon-Gadsden County Line and continues to move northwest. After crossing another bridge, the first major intersection in the county is the eastern terminus of County Road 270. Further north, County Road 159 secretly joins US 27/SR 63 in a triple concurrency, and all three routes approach a CSX Railroad line until they curve northeast before entering the Town of Havana. CR 159 branches off on its own to the northwest before US 27/SR 63 curves straight north as it approaches the intersection with State Road 12 and CR 12A. SR 12 joins the road in a brief concurrency before branching off to the east as CR 12, within the Havana Town Limits. The previously mentioned CSX railroad line runs more or less parallel to the road again. The road and the tracks curve back and forth near each other until the tracks take one final turn to the northwest in Hinson, and SR 63 begins to curve back to the northeast before the intersection with County Road 159A. Shortly after this SR 63 curves further to the northeast as it approaches County Road 12B. Finally in Darsey, SR 63 serves as the northern terminus of County Road 157 and the southern terminus of an extension of Georgia State Route 111, before curving to the northwest again and finally terminating at the Florida-Georgia State Line, where US 27 continues onto Georgia State Route 1. History A US 27 shield used in Florida prior to 1993 US 27 first entered Florida in 1934, terminating at Tallahassee. In 1949, it was extended to its current terminus in Miami. From 1956 until 1993, US 27 signs in Florida featured white numbering on a green shield. The \\"color-coding\\" of U.S. Routes by the Florida Department of Transportation was stopped when the state could no longer use Federal funds to replace the signs with anything but the standard black-and-white version; a few green US 27 signs remain. Shortly after its second landfall, Hurricane Irma's eye traveled roughly along the entire course of US 27 in Florida north of Lake Placid. Major intersectionsRelated routes At least four special routes of US 27 have existed in Florida, however only one exists today. * U.S. Route 27 Alternate ‚Äì Sebring Southgate to Avon Park; former route * U.S. Route 27 Alternate ‚Äì Sunray Deli Estates (north of Avon Park) to Haines City; former route * U.S. Route 27 Alternate ‚Äì Lady Lake to Belleview; former route co-signed with Alternate U.S. Route 441. * U.S. Route 27 Alternate ‚Äì Williston to Perry See also * * ReferencesExternal links *US 27 in Florida (SoutheastRoads.com) Florida 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 27 Category:1934 establishments in Florida ","title":"U.S. Route 27 in Florida"},{"id":"10328569","text":"U.S. Route 29 (US 29) in the State of Florida is the westernmost south-to- north U.S. route in the state. It runs from downtown Pensacola north to the Alabama state line entirely within Escambia County. US 29 runs as a four-lane highway through much of the panhandle, becoming six lanes through and near several towns. The highway's hidden state road designation is entirely State Road 95 (SR 95). Street names include North Palafox Street, Pensacola Boulevard, and Century Boulevard. From Brent to Cantonment, US 29 runs between two different railroad lines. On the west side is a line formerly owned by the Saint Louis and San Francisco Railway (now owned by Alabama and Gulf Coast Railway), and on the east side is a line previously owned by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (now CSX). Route description US 29 begins its northward journey at an intersection with US 90 and 98 in downtown Pensacola along North Palafox Street, which starts off as a four-lane undivided concrete boulevard, with occasional provisions for center-left turn lanes. The road enters Goulding at CR 480, and straddles the Pensacola-Goulding border until just south of the intersection with SR 752, which ends west of the next intersection, which is SR 295. The road passes by the western edge of the Escambia Wood Treating Company Superfund Site and enters Brent. The division of the highway begins at Massachusetts Avenue which is part of the eastern terminus of SR 292, and remains that way throughout much of the county. After the intersection with SR 296, the name of US 29 changes to Pensacola Boulevard, and North Palafox Street moves onto its former routing along CR 95A, which it will maintain until it reaches Ten Mile Road (see below). North of CR 95A, US 29 serves as the western terminus of State Road 750, which leads to the Pensacola Regional Airport, and later becomes the northern terminus of CR 453, a four-lane boulevard that serves as a shortcut to western Pensacola. After the western terminus of SR 742, US 29 encounters a massive interchange with I-10 at exits 10A and 10B, which includes loop ramps, flyovers, and an unusually wide median, all of which is on the border between Brent and Ensley. A far more conventional diamond interchange with US 90 Alt. can be found up ahead, but not before encountering three signalized intersections, four if you count the emergency signal for a county firehouse. Commercial surroundings begin to thin out north of US 90 Alt., but don't disappear entirely. After the intersection with Ten Mile Road, the route enters Gonzalez. Approximately north of there, CR 95A (now simply named \\"Highway 95A\\") runs parallel to the northbound lane connected only by turn lanes, mainly from the northbound lane itself. This trajectory ends across from CR 297, and after this, CR 95A moves away from US 29. CR 95A briefly returns to the side of the northbound lane near a local diner, only for US 29 to curve away from it to the northwest between Tate School Road and CR 749. Before entering Cantonment, CR 95A merges with US 29 just south of the grounds of a large International Paper factory across the street from that intersection, where the road becomes a four-lane undivided highway. The railroad line that serves that plant, connecting the former Frisco line to the old L&N; line encounters the road in a grade crossingCantonment, Florida 1978 Topographical Map (NETR: Historic Aerials Online) just south of the intersection with Muscogee Road (CR 184) and Beck's Lake Road, where CR 184 secretly joins the route. Shortly after this intersection, CR 95A separates from US 29 once again just after the divider is revived. After the intersection with Neal Road, US 29 gains the supplemental name \\"Don Sutton Highway\\" and then runs under a power line right-of-way. From there, the route continues northwest as it passes by the Central Commerce Park just before entering Molino curving back towards the north. CR 184 branches off to the east onto West Quintette Road, then US crosses over the Jack's Branch River, and later flies through the intersection with CR 196. North of there the road descends slightly over a culvert over a tributary of Cowdevil Creek, but then elevates through a wooded area which ends at some farmland at the top of this ascension. The road passes by an Escambia County Sheriff's station on the northeast corner of Omega Avenue, and later dips again as it approaches the culvert over the Dry Creek just south of a blinker-light intersection with CR 182. Just north of here, the road inherits the name \\"Century Boulevard,\\" and runs parallel to the same power line right-of-way it crossed under at Neal Road in Cantonment. It passes a power substation across the street from local businesses, but more forestland can be found on the east side while more farmland can be found on the west side, with the brief exception of church across from the intersection with Bet Raines Road. From there, the forest on the east side evolves into farmland until it approaches SR 97 which spans southeast to CR 95A and northwest to Atmore, Alabama. The power lines move to the northeast and less than 1/2 mile from there, US 29 encounters the northern terminus of CR 95A right after a second crossing of the Jack's Branch River. From here the road begins to curve more toward the northeast. Just north of the Morgan Cemetery, US 29 enters Barth, which contains a side road toward the Lakeside at Barth campground. After a pair of bridges over the Morgan Branch, the road passes a local cemetery before intersecting with Mason Road and Cotton Lake Road, the former of which serves as the entrance to a Christian summer camp called \\"Camp O' the Pines\\" Crossing a pair of bridges over Mitchell Creek, it passes a side road to the West Fraser \\"McDavid Sawmill,\\" and later runs under the same power lines it encountered north of Neal Road in Cantonment. Northeast of those power lines, the road enters Bogia, where it intersects two local streets named for the community and a pair of bridges over Cotton Creek. north of a dirt road named Driver Road, which only intersects the southbound lanes, US 29 officially enters McDavid, where it intersects the western terminus of Main Street, where a church and the McDavid Post Office can be found and shortly afterwards the eastern terminus of CR 164. After passing by a volunteer firehouse on the east side and a gas station on the west side, the road runs over a pair of bridges over Mitchell Creek then climbs another hill, where the road runs through more forestland with sparse houses and farms. Northbound US 29 as seen from the median of Brown Road south of Bluff Springs After the intersection with Brown Road, US 29 begins to run down a hill and later curves to the right where it crosses over a pair of bridges over Canoe Creek, then enters Bluff Springs, which appears to be more residential than communities further to the south, but is not lacking in woodlands or farmlands either. Century Boulevard makes a sharper right curve after the intersection with North Canoe Road, and remains as such despite briefly curving between Thompson Road and Bluff Springs Road. After this it crosses a pair of bridges over the Pritchell Mill Branch. At the intersection of Dawson Road some reduce speed warning sings can be spotted for the northbound lanes, showing a sign of the end of rural high-speed travel. This is because the divider that has run along the middle of the road since Brent is replaced by a continuous left-turn lane at the intersection of Tedder Road near a branch of the Century Fire Department just before the road crosses a bridge over Wiggins Branch, where it enters Century. US 29 just before crossing the Florida‚ÄìAlabama state line Despite entering the town limits, the surroundings remain rural and residential. At the intersection of CR 4, the route secretly gains a hidden concurrency with SR 4. The road dips down over a bridge over Mill Creek before the eastern terminus of CR 4A, with a southeast continuation onto Front Street, and then approaches the intersection of West and East Hecker Road. Signs approaching East Hecker Road point to the Alger- Sullivan Lumber Company Residential Historic District. SR 4 breaks away from US 29 to head east towards Jay, Baker, and Milligan, while US 29 begins to curve into a more northwesterly direction. The road curves further to the northwest at the intersection with East McCurdy Street and further to the northwest just before the intersection with Jackson Street. The last intersections with US 29 in Florida are Renfro Street to the east and Glenn Street to the west (both dead end streets) before the road finally intersects the Florida-Alabama state line at State Line Road, then climbs a bridge over a large railroad yard to enter downtown Flomaton, Alabama. History A US 29 shield used in Florida prior to 1993 US 29 originally ran in a concurrency with the former alignment of US 331 between 1926 and 1936. Beginning in 1956, signs for U.S. Highways in Florida had different colors for each highway. The shield for US 29 was red with white lettering and outline, until the state was forced by the federal government to conform to standards that required consistent black-and-white signs in 1993.

It runs from Miami in South Florida northwest to the Georgia border north of the Lake City area. Within the state, US 41 is paralleled by Interstate 75 (I-75) all the way from Miami to Georgia (on the northern border), and I-75 has largely supplanted US 41 as a major highway. Like all AASHTO designated highways in Florida, US 41 always carries a FDOT designated hidden state road number: * State Road 90 from US 1 (SR 5) in Miami to the junction with 5th Avenue/9th Street/Tamiami Trail north (US 41/SR 45) in Naples. * State Road 45 from US 41 (SR 90) in Naples to the junction with US 441 (SR 25) and North Main Street (CR 236) in High Springs, with the following exceptions: ** State Road 45A between the north and south termini of US 41 Business (SR 45) in Sarasota County. ** State Road 684 from the junction with the south end of US 41 Business (SR 45) to 44th Avenue Connection in unincorporated Manatee County. ** State Road 55 from 44th Avenue Connection to the north end of US 41 Business (SR 45) in Palmetto. ** State Road 599 from the junction of the south end of US 41 Business (SR 45) and SR 676 east near Tampa to US 92 (SR 600) in Tampa. ** State Road 600 from US 41 south (SR 599 south) to Nebraska Avenue (SR 45 south) in Tampa. * State Road 25 from the junction with US 441 (SR 25), US 41 (SR 45) and North Main Street (CR 236) in High Springs to the Georgia state line near Jennings. Concurrencies include US 301 between Bradenton and Palmetto, US 92, in Tampa, US 98 and SR 50A in Brooksville, SR 44 in Inverness, US 27, between Williston and High Springs, US 441 between High Springs and Lake City, and US 129 between Hillcoat and Jasper. According to both AASHTO documentation and FDOT straight line diagram inventory, the defined southern terminus of US 41 is located at Collins Avenue in Miami Beach, but FDOT has chosen not to sign the final leg of the route past SR 90 since 2000. From there, the route runs concurrent with SR A1A westbound, then south along US 1/SR 5, before meeting the route's signed southern terminus at Brickell Avenue. Route description=Miami to Tampa= US 1 in Miami US 41 seen towards east in the Big Cypress National Preserve, a few miles north of the Everglades National Park Between Miami and Naples, US 41 cuts across the Florida peninsula, running through the vast Everglades wilderness. This section has been designated a National Scenic Byway. The byway runs east‚Äìwest through the Big Cypress National Preserve, skirting the northern border of the Everglades National Park for about . The part of the highway between Tampa and Miami is known as the Tamiami Trail (derived from the combination of Tampa and Miami, the road's two ends), thus, this section of the road is commonly known as the East Trail, as it runs east‚Äìwest across this part of the state, in contrast to the road's otherwise distinctively north‚Äìsouth routing. Alligators are a common sight along the scenic Tamiami Trail from Miami to Naples. Unlike the parallel road, Alligator Alley, the trail is only one lane in each direction, and it has no fences to keep wildlife from crossing it. In Naples, US 41 changes direction at the intersection of hidden SR 90 and hidden SR 45, turning from west to north towards Tampa, or from south to east towards Miami. This segment of US 41 is still considered the Tamiami Trail. US 41 has a bypass in Fort Myers that separates from the trail, however in the Venice Area, US 41 breaks away from the trail onto hidden SR 45A, while US 41 Business uses the trail. A connector to I-75 can be found just north of the northern end of the business route. US 41 northbound past SR 72 in Gulf Gate Estates Two major US highways terminate at US 41 in the Sarasota-Bradenton Metropolitan Area. The first is US 301 in Sarasota, which runs straight, while US 41 curves to the west towards the John Ringling Causeway, only to turn back north again. North of the western end of it CR 610, it runs along the western edge of Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport where it crosses the Sarasota-Manatee County line. Across from the airport, the road serves as the address for New College of Florida, and then the University of South Florida's Sarasota/Manatee Campus. In Bradenton, US 41 makes a sharp turn east onto SR 684 at the intersection of US 41 Business. The road curves north onto SR 55 and it encounters US 301 again, and shares a short concurrency with the road across the Manatee River. US 301 makes a sharp right turn onto SR 43 at a diamond interchange, while US 41 continues north. Just after the interchange with the northern end of US 41 Business in Memphis, another interchange exists with the southern end of US 301 exists. Here, US 41 rejoins hidden SR 45, while hidden SR 55 moves to US 19, where it will stay until it reaches Perry. The rest of US 41's journey will continue along the east coast of Tampa Bay. =Tampa to Lutz= From US 41 Business and SR 676 near the unincorporated Palm River-Clair Mel to US 92 in Tampa, US 41 carries the unsigned SR 599 designation. It contains the northwestern end of the Tamiami Trail at the SR 60 intersection. It is normally three lanes wide, but between I-4 and the northern end of SR 569 is only two lanes wide. The unsigned state highway is long. At the northern end, US 41 turns west. (If one continues straight, 40th Street leads to Busch Gardens Tampa Bay.) Major intersections include the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway (SR 618), SR 60, I-4, SR 583, SR 569, and SR 574\\\\. US 41 runs west along US 92 (Hillsborough Avenue) for several blocks, and upon doing so shares SR 600 as a hidden route. One other major intersection exists with SR 585, before running along the southern border of the Hampton Terrace Historic District where it turns north onto Nebraska Avenue(SR 45) just before approaching I-275 at Exit 47 A-B. Though not every signalized intersection along Nebraska Avenue provides access to I-275, many of them do. At first, the road runs through Old Seminole Heights where it remains along the border of the Hampton Terrace Historic District until the intersection of Hanna Avenue. The only other intersection that passes for a major street in the area is Sligh Avenue, which leads to Exit 48 on I-275 to the west. The road leaves Old Seminole Heights by crossing the 1923-built Nebraska Avenue Bridge over the Hillsborough River and enters Sulphur Springs, where one can find such sites as the Springs Theater on the corner of Sitka Street and on the opposite side, the former Tampa Greyhound Track between Bird Street and Waters Avenue. As the road is about to leave Sulphur Springs, a concrete median begins before US 41 crosses another at- grade railroad crossing along the south side of SR 580(Busch Boulevard). The rest of the way, it becomes the main north-south road through North Tampa, other than I-275. West of the University of South Florida, US 41 intersects such major streets as State Road 582(Fowler Avenue) and then several block north of there crosses SR 579/CR 582A(Fletcher Avenue). Further north, SR-CR 678 is the last chance for motorists to access I-275. After this, it curves to the northwest as it begins to run along the west side of the CSX Brooksville Subdivision, and both share an underpass with no access to I-275. Entering Lutz, the at-grade interchange with the northern end of BUS US 41(Hidden SR 685), is where US 41 becomes six lanes wide. Most intersections beyond this point are only of local importance. Nevertheless, US 41 crosses the Brooksville Subdivision at a sharply diagonal at-grade crossing, and both curve to the right, where they both run straight north through the rest of Lutz. From this point on, it runs along the east side of the Brooksville Subdivision, both of which run straight north throughout most of the community. Shortly after passing the historic Old Lutz Elementary School on the east side, it encounters a traffic signal with the eastern end of Lutz- Lake Fern Road (unmarked CR 582) on the west side. A replica of the former Lutz Seaboard Air Line Railroad Depot can be found on the northwest corner between the railroad tracks and the local library. The further north that US 41 runs, the more likely it runs into dead end streets and private roads, some of which are on the opposite side of the tracks. The road curves to the northwest before intersecting with County Line Road at the Hillsborough-Pasco County Line and enters Land o' Lakes, where it is named Land o' Lakes Boulevard throughout the county. =Pasco County= US 41 only remains in the northwest direction until it encounters the northern end of State Road 597(Dale Mabry Highway) and after turning straight north passing by some naturist resorts, almost instantly intersects SR 54. Almost a mile () north of that point, the Brooksville Subdivision banks off to the northwest, while US 41 prepares to squeeze between some lakes for which the hamlet is named. North of County Road 583 (Ehren Cutoff) in the former community of Denham, the road narrows down to four lanes but remains divided as it curves to the northwest. Here, the road crosses the former right-of-way for a railroad line that ran between Tarpon Springs and Trilby until the mid-1970s. The road curves north again and then passes Land o' Lakes High School where it had only recently been widened. This newly widened section serves as the two gateways to the still under construction Connerton Conner development, and has been slated to become the future end of CR 524(Ridge Road Extension). Just after that, the gateway to the still under construction Tierra Del Sol development is where the division of the highway ends, although US 41 is still in the process of being widened throughout the northern Tampa Bay suburbs. Most of the surroundings beyond that point include dog sitting kennels, and run-down farms, although a road to the Pasco County Jail, with a fire station on the northeast corner stands out among the usual surroundings. After making another right curve and squeezing between two more small lakes, US 41 approaches a section of Land o' Lakes known as Gowers Corner, where the intersection of SR 52 can be found. Just east of Gowers Corner is the Pilot Country Airport, a local airport community. Besides some random former motels and other businesses, most of the surroundings of this segment of the road consists of farmland, this time, much more active. Near a former lumber yard, US 41 crosses the Brooksville Subdivision again, and a local automotive and truck repair shop can be found on the northeast corner of that crossing. Continuing north, the road encounters sites such as the Detroit Resort Motel and shortly after this runs along the western edge of the Pasco Lake Estates community where it runs along a former section of the road known as Old Gainesville Highway and Pasco Lake Drive. An old narrow bridge across a dry creek can be found just north of this development. By the time the road reaches South Masaryktown the number of farm fields begin to diminish. A few small trailer parks, private homes and even some small businesses pop-up along the side of the road, but the farms don't completely move away from the road until after it crosses a narrow bridge over the Masaryktown Canal. Just north of the intersection of Bowman Road the west side of the road features a somewhat larger trailer park and private houses in front of a notably wide right-of-way for a future southbound lane. This right-of-way ends at Hernando-County Road 578, another County Line Road in Masaryktown, and US 41 becomes Broad Street. =Hernando County= 2009 Photo of US 41 and Wilson Boulevard in Masaryktown. Within Masaryktown, US 41 remains two lanes wide and serves as the main road, which includes a few small private motels and a restaurant known as Cafe Masaryktown, at a blinker-light intersection. Before the intersection of County Road 576, the road widens to four lanes again, and then enters Garden Grove, where it serves as the eastern edge of Hernando County Airport. After the airport property ends, it intersects County Road 574(Spring Hill Boulevard), and then widens to six lanes nearly half way before approaching County Road 572(Powell Road). Near downtown Brooksville, US 41 intersects SR 50/US Truck Route 98, and secretly takes SR 700 with it. SR 700 is exposed further north as it branches off to the northwest near the former Brooksville Hospital site. US 41 then narrows down to two lanes, curves to the east and becomes a one-way street that's concurrent with southbound U.S. Route 98 and eastbound SR 50A. At the intersection of North Mildred Avenue, eastbound SR 50A, US 41, and US 98 are concurrent along Broad Street, while westbound SR 50A, US 41, and US 98 are concurrent along East Jefferson Avenue, then West Jefferson Avenue. This one-way configuration for Broad Street and Jefferson Street has been in effect since November 1993, according to the Florida Department of Transportation. While both segments go up and down steep hills in the heart of the city, the Broad Street (eastbound) section runs over an old railroad bridge built in 1936. The two intersections of Main Street(CR 445, former SR 45A) also contain the Hernando County Courthouse on the northeast corner of temporarily \\"eastbound\\" US 41/US 98/SR 50A,\\" and the southeast corner of \\"westbound\\" US 41/98/SR 50A. After both segments drop into one last hill, US 98/SR 50A leaves US 41 at East Jefferson Street near May Avenue, and US 41 becomes a two-lane highway that drops down into yet another steep hill before curving north again where it intersects County Road 484 at a blinker-light intersection and climbs another one. It remains a two-lane highway through the rest of Hernando County. From this hill the road descends again as it runs between a trailer park on the northbound side, and a Brooksville school complex on the southbound side, both of which are on the southeast and southwest corners of CR 480(Croom Road) respectively. From there the road serves as the end of CR 445(Howell Avenue), but shortly afterwards becomes the southern end of Old Crystal River Road, which despite the name does not lead to Crystal River, assuming that it ever did. The rest of the route becomes more rural, as it runs towards some preserved land. Less private land can be found north of the southern end of CR 481 near Lake Lindsey. North of CR 476, US 41 runs through a portion of the Withlacoochee State Forest where it remains until it crosses the Hernando-Citrus County Line, and gets the name South Florida Avenue. =Citrus County through Marion County= Upon leaving the forest, the road remains almost as rural as it spends much of its time in Southern Citrus County as the same two-lane highway it was in northern Hernando County moving up and down various hills. As the road gets close to Downtown Floral City, it begins to run along the west side of the Withlacoochee State Trail, a former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad right-of-way that was converted into a rail trail shortly after being abandoned by CSX in 1987. The western end of County Road 48 is where US 41 also begins to include part of the DeSoto Trail. Meanwhile, the Withlacoochee State Trail continues to run along the east side of the road, often behind the backyards of local businesses and vacant lots. The only resemblance of a major intersection within this area is County Road 39A, a suffixed route of a former segment of State Road 39. Sign for the Citrus County Speedway in Inverness Highlands South. Inverness Airport is nearby. At some point, the road expands to a four- lane divided highway. The same types of local businesses continue to flank both roadsides until the road enters Inverness Highlands South where Citrus County Speedway and Inverness Airport can be seen on the west side. On the opposite side of these landmarks, Fort Cooper State Park is only accessible from the Withlacoochee State Trail, until the road enters the city limits of Inverness where it widens to six lanes. As the road climbs a slight grade and curves to the left, it approaches a concurrency with SR 44 which also includes a local divided highway named Highland Boulevard in this intersection. From there, US 41/SR 44 descends along a slight grade on the west coast of Cooter Lake, then winds around the Old Citrus County Courthouse and then Inverness Masonic Temple and at the intersection of Seminole Avenue suddenly turns straight west. The concurrency ends at a wye intersection west of Tallmadge Avenue, as SR 44 heads straight to Crystal River, while US 41 branches off to the northwest onto North Florida Avenue. The first intersection after this is Davidson Avenue, which is part of County Road 581. Later it dips towards a hotel at the intersection of Montgomery Avenue and curves to the right as it replacing the aforementioned road's alignment. The road runs along the eastern edge of Whispering Pines Park as it climbs another hill with a shopping center at the bottom of an embankment and descends again towards the entrance of the Inverness Middle School on the same side, and a small industrial park on the other side. Just before leaving the Inverness city limits, the Withlacoochee State Trail crosses under US 41 and runs along the west side of the road. The trail can be seen again on the west side of the road just south of East Arlington Street near Inverness Highlands North, and remains along that side of the street, although the trail moves slightly further away north of East Van Ness Street. On the opposite side of the street, a former Seaboard Air Line Railroad right-of-way follows US 41, although it's no longer noticeable until further north. Nevertheless, US 41 and the trail still remain close enough to each other as they enter the City of Hernando. Here, the road serves as the eastern end of County Road 486, a short cut to Crystal River for southbound traffic. As the road approaches the shores of one of the Tsala Apopka Lakes, State Road 200 branches off to the northeast towards Ocala, Jacksonville, and Fernandina Beach while US 41 continues northwest. From here the road is slightly further away from the Withlacoochee State Trail, but that trail is still close enough to the road. In the meantime, the previously mentioned SAL line becomes more noticeable. The road curves to the north and descends along a hill into Holder, where it meets the only main intersection; County Road 491. From there the road curves back northwest again, and runs through Citrus Springs The first intersection of Citrus Springs Boulevard is not the last place where Withlacoochee State Trail. and the former SAL line can be found on both sides, but it is the last place where a trailhead can be found in close proximity to the road. North of there the area has more pine trees, but both trails can still be seen on each side. Dead end streets for housing developments that were never built can be seen across the former railroad tracks. The Withlacoochee State trail moves away from US 41 for the last time just south of the second intersection with Citrus Springs Boulevard, which is the gateway to Citrus Springs. US 41 becomes wide enough for turn lanes on both sides and has a traffic signals that the previous intersection lacked. North of here, the former SAL ROW is still in sight, even though the area remains wooded for the most part, although there's some slight clearing as it curves straight north. Deep within another unfinished development on the west side of the road, the trail ends, but part of the name is encountered again at the western end of County Road 39(Withlacoochee Trail), a former segment of State Road 39, which now terminates all the way down in eastern Pasco County. The road curves northwest one last time as it prepares to leave Citrus County, passing by some small industrial lots and a local youth athletic park. US 41 approaches the Brittan Alexander Bridge over the Withlacoochee River and enters Marion County. After climbing an embankment for a bridge over the Florida Northern Railroad line to the Crystal River 3 Nuclear Power Plant, US 41 intersects County Road 488 then curves northeast as it approaches the Brittan Alexander Bridge over the Withlacoochee River to enter Dunnellon and turns into Williams Street. The north end of the bridge contains City Hall and a city-run boat ramp on the northwest side, and a motel/restaurant/canoe & kayak dock on the northeast side. Almost immediately, US 41 enters the Dunnellon Boomtown Historic District, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and includes a former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad depot that served the line now used for the previously mentioned nuclear power plant in Crystal River. Within the same district just north of the station is the intersection of Pennsylvania Avenue, which is County Roads 40/336 to the west and County Road 484 to the east. From here, US 41 also serves as a not-so hidden concurrency with State Road 40. North of the city US 41/SR 40 enters Chatmar, then Rainbow Falls, and then Rainbow Lakes Estates, which is where the Headsprings Entrance to Rainbow Springs State Park can be found. Just north of that point, SR 40 breaks away to the northeast on its way to Ocala, Silver Springs, and Ormond Beach while US 41 continues north on its own. The last intersection of any importance is County Road 328 in Romeo, before the road crosses over into Levy County. =Levy County through Alachua County= Just as with many state and county roads in Levy County, US 41 runs along numerous farm fields interrupted by wooded areas, and intersects with many dirt and other rural roads. These roads include County Road 545 along the border, County Road 464, which becomes a suffixed alternate of State Road 464 in Marion County, and in Morriston, County Road 326, a bi-county extension of State Road 326. The road begins to curve straight north before entering the city of Williston, where the rural surroundings continue. Without the city limits sign though, drivers would find it difficult to believe they're in Williston until the road approaches the entrance to the Williston Municipal Airport. Beyond the airport, State Road 121 joins US 41 at an intersection shared by CR 316, which previously overlapped SR 121 from the southwest. The rural surroundings of southern Levy County don't start to diminish until the intersection of Southwest Seventh Avenue. Right after Southwest First Avenue, a wide turning ramp at an intersection takes northbound US 41/SR 121 drivers onto US Alt 27(SR 500), and shares a brief concurrency in the city until US Alt 27 terminates at US 27. SR 500 continues southeast as hidden routes of US 27 and other U.S. Routes as it heads towards Ocala, Orlando, Kissimmee, and Indiatlantic, while US 41, and SR 121 turn north along US 27. Shortly after the merger of US 27 and 41, SR 121 breaks away to the northeast and takes the DeSoto Trail with it. The US 27/41 concurrency remains only two lanes wide, and it begins to lean to the northwest until briefly shifting straight north before approaching Archer, where it intersects CR 346, then a former Florida Railway and Navigation Company right-of-way, and finally State Road 24. After SR 24, US 27/41 curves back northwest but head straight northward through State Road 26 in Newberry and both remain as such until US 41 reach High Springs, where US 27 makes a left turn onto State Road 20 towards Perry, Tallahassee, and Havana, while US 41 briefly becomes independent before it joins US 441 towards Lake City and points north. The intersection of US 441 serves as the northern end of its hidden State Road 45, and the southern end of CR 236, and the road is reunited with the DeSoto Trail where it will remain until it reaches Lake City. =Columbia County= Signs for the northbound US 41/441 overlap as it approaches the Santa Fe River bridge. US 41/441 crosses the Santa Fe River then runs north passing by O'Leno State Park and River Rise Preserve State Park, near which it shares a brief concurrency with a county extension of State Road 18. It then runs through Ellsville, where it has another interchange with I-75 (Exit 414), just south of the western end of State Road 238. Approaching Lake City, US 441 splits from US 41 onto State Road 25A south of the city. The routes remain parallel, and at some point Route 41 is joined by State Road 47 which was signed as terminating at US 41. However, this concurrency only lasts until the intersection of State Road 10A, where SR 47 turns east for a block before joining US 441. The next block is U.S. Route 90, where the DeSoto Trail heads west, and State Road 100 joins US 41 to the northern extends of Lake City. Before leaving Lake City's limits, US 41 curves to the northwest to run parallel to a Georgia Southern and Florida Railway line. Since it also carries two hidden state roads at this point, it serves as the end for suffixed alternates of both routes, albeit Columbia County suffixed alternates. The first is County Road 100A(Northwest Bascom Norris Drive), and much further north, outside of the city at County Road 25A(Northwest Valdosta Road), which is a county extension of State Road 25A. Due to the parallel railroad line along the east side, the interchange with Interstate 10 is a pair of quarter-cloverleaf ramps on the southwest and northwest corners of the underpass. Construction of the interchange itself forced the relocation of CR 131(Northwest Falling Creek Road), which terminates at US 41 just north of the aforementioned interchange. Slightly further north, the road serves as the address for WCJX (106.5 FM). From here it runs through small towns such as Winfield and Suwannee Valley. The last notable intersection in Columbia County is CR 246(Lassie Black Road). =Hamilton County to the Georgia State Line= Crossing the Ed Scott Bridge over the Suwannee River into Hamilton County, Florida US 41 enters White Springs, Florida, where it breaks away from the GSF railroad line and turns west onto Spring Street. Here the road serves as the southern end of CR 135, and while running through the White Springs Historic District serves as the eastern end of State Road 136, before turning straight north again into Roberts Street, and running along the western edge of the city. The last suffixed route of hidden SR 25 can be found on Camp Street as CR 25A, but that route does not reunite with its parent road. As it leaves the city it returns to the same side of the GSF railroad line it was at earlier, both of which will run through the unincorporated community of Facil where it encounters the southern end of CR 137. Northwest of there, it runs through Occidental, and then Genoa where it serves as the eastern end of CR 132. Beyond that, it runs through a strip mining area where the only other community is Camps Still, however after passing through Hillcoat, which is where the northern end of CR 137 can be found, US 41 joins US 129 as well as hidden SR 51. The newly overlapped routes briefly run straight north before making a reverse curve around the left side of Roberts Pond and Shaky Pond before entering the City of Jasper. US 41/129/SR 100 turns west onto State Road 6(Hatley Street), which becomes County Road 6 east of the intersection, while hidden SR 51 becomes County Road 51(Second Avenue Northeast) north of the same intersection. Northbound US 41 and Westbound SR 6 before crossing the Alapaha River. After Fifth Avenue, the road begins to curve to the northwest, and by 15th Avenue, the concurrency with US 129 ends as the road moves towards more of a northwest angle, taking hidden SR 100 with it. SR 6 and US 41 return straight west as it leaves the city until CR 148 (Northwest 86th Boulevard), where they begin to curve northwest again. Shortly after this curve, as well as another bridge over the Alapaha River, the concurrency with SR 6 ends. SR 6 heads southwest toward I-75 and Madison, while US 41 curves more toward the northwest. The only other intersection north of that point seems to be CR 152, although further north in Jennings, the road briefly overlaps CR 141, but that overlap ends at the eastern end of State Road 143 whose intersection is shared by CR 141. The rest of the way, US 41 serves as part of the border of Jennings, the northernmost community along the route in the state. Northwest Ninth Street and Oak Street are officially the last intersections with US 41 in the state before the road crosses the Georgia State Line, terminating hidden SR 25, and replacing it with Georgia State Route 7. History A US 41 shield used in Florida prior to 1993 US 41 first entered Florida as far back as 1926, terminating in Naples. Former sections of US 41 include US 441 from High Springs through Gainesville to Ocala, and SR 40 from Ocala to Rainbow Lakes Estates, and US 301 from Sarasota to Bradenton. In 1950, US 41 was extended east to Miami along former U.S. Route 94. From 1956 until 1993, US 41 signs in Florida featured white numbering on an orange shield. The \\"color-coding\\" of U.S. Routes by the Florida Department of Transportation was stopped when the state could no longer use Federal funds to replace the signs with anything but the standard black-and-white version. Some orange US 41 signs may still remain.

US 90 passes through the county seats of all 15 counties on its course in Florida, and it is also the road upon which many of the county courthouses are located. It is never more than from Interstate 10 (I-10) throughout the state. It runs as a two-lane highway through most of the sparsely populated inland areas of the Florida Panhandle, widening to four lanes through and near several towns. The speed limit is for all rural points west of Monticello, and it is on all rural points beginning in Madison County to Glen St. Mary. Like all highways in Florida, US 90 always carries a state road number, which may or may not always be signed. These numbers are assigned by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT): *State Road 10 (SR 10) from the Alabama state line to US 90 Alt./SR 10 east in Jacksonville with one exception: **SR 10A between the western and eastern termini of US 90 Alt. in Escambia County, which carries SR 10\\\\. *SR 212 from the US 90 Alt./SR 10 interchange in Jacksonville to the eastern terminus at SR A1A in Jacksonville Beach. Concurrencies include US 98 in Pensacola, US 331 in DeFuniak Springs, US 221 in Greenville, US 301 in Baldwin, and US 1 in Jacksonville. Lesser concurrencies with state and county roads also exist in various parts of the state. The segment between US 319 in Tallahassee and US 441 in Lake City also includes part of the DeSoto Trail. Route description=Escambia County, including Pensacola= As it enters the Sunshine State from Alabama after crossing a bridge over the Perdido River, US 90 and the eastbound beginning of unsigned SR 10 passes by two roads for a local fish camp on the northeast side of the bridge then bends northeast toward the rural community of Beulah. This segment of the road is known as Mobile Highway. Halfway along this alignment a single truck weigh station that's accessible from both directions can be found on the south side of the road. Once it begins to turn more to the east again, US 90 becomes a divided highway before it shifts south towards Pensacola while US 90 Alternate (US 90 Alt.) stays to the north of the city taking SR 10\\\\. This stretch of highway is also known as Nine Mile Road. US 90 itself moves onto hidden SR 10A where it narrows back down to two lanes and then takes a turn to the southeast, still keeping Mobile Highway as the street name. From there, the road becomes the southern terminus of County Road 99 (CR 99), the westernmost two-digit route in Florida. After passing by the Florida Division of Forestry's Beulah Fire Lookout Tower, and then a few schools and churches, the road crosses waterways such as Elevenmile Creek and then Eightmile Creek before entering Bellview. Here, the first major intersection is CR 173, better known as the Blue Angels Parkway, and a county extension of SR 173\\\\. Next, it turns into a four-lane divided highway north of Goodwin Lane, and then becomes the southern terminus of SR 297\\\\. The only other intersection south of this point is Belleview Avenue between there and a much more important intersection with the western terminus of SR 296 and eastern terminus of CR 296\\\\. From there, open space exists on the southwest side of the street which is interrupted only by one street, specifically CR 341 (Marlane Drive). The road then crosses a body of water known as Bayou Marcus Creek which leads to Crescent Lake, the southwest corner of which is flanked by the Osceola Municipal Golf Course. The road runs along the border of West Pensacola and Myrtle Grove until it reaches the intersection with SR 727 (Fairfield Drive) and is entirely within West Pensacola. Eastbound SR 727 provides the only northbound access to the next state route, because that route happens to contain a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 295, which includes only east-to-south and west-to-north access from US 90, and south-to- east and north-to-west access from SR 295\\\\. Later it serves as the northern terminus of SR 295 Spur and eastern terminus of SR 298 (New Warrington Road). The road then approaches a bridge over some railroad tracks and then begins to turn more towards the east and less towards the south. US 90 finally enters the city of Pensacola after the intersection of CR 453 (W Street) where it merges onto West Cervantes Street, which is also the name of a local street west of CR 453\\\\. Eight blocks later, US 90 encounters the intersection of US 98 and SR 292, and US 98 moves from a concurrency with SR 292 to one with US 90\\\\. Together US 90 & 98 run through the heart of Pensacola. Among the intersections they share are with US 29 where West Cervantes Street becomes East Cervantes Street. But US 29 has been overshadowed by a partial interchange with I-110 at exit 2. Two to three blocks later it encounters southbound SR 291 along Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive (formerly Alcaniz Street), and northbound SR 291 along Davis Highway). Four blocks later, the US 90/98 concurrency ends at the intersection with SR 289, where US 98 turns south towards the Pensacola Bay Bridge and runs along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico toward Perry, Lakeland, and Palm Beach, while US 90 continues along Cervantes Street. Veering slightly to the right after the intersection with 15th Street, it crosses a bridge over Bayou Texar, and hits land again at the intersection of Bayou Boulevard across from the Bayou Texar Boat Ramp, which can only be accessed from Stanley Avenue a block east. Pensacola Scenic Bluffs Highway After the eastern terminus of SR 296 at Perry Avenue, the name of the road changes to \\"Scenic Highway,\\" becoming an official Florida Scenic Highway known as the Pensacola Scenic Bluffs Highway. It narrows down from four lanes to two lanes between Chipley Avenue and Strong Street, and it turns north where it runs along the west side of Escambia Bay. Along the way, it frequently encounters the CSX P&A; Subdivision, a former Louisville and Nashville Railroad line that carried Amtrak's Sunset Limited from 1993 until 2005 when Hurricane Katrina truncated the line to New Orleans. The road moves closer to the tracks near Magnolia Point just south of Hyde Park Road. Most of the area along this segment is residential, and those that aren't normally tend to consist of either parkland or merely open space. Despite having neither a state or county road designation, the intersection of Summit Boulevard of importance because it leads to Pensacola Regional Airport. After another random series of local streets, residences and parks, US 90 approaches a signaled intersection with Langley Avenue, which is across the street from a wayside for Chimney Park along Red Bluff, the site of the former Hyer-Knowles Planing Mill, which was destroyed by Confederate General Braxton Bragg as part of an attempt to prevent the factory from falling into Union hands. This site has been part of the National Register of Historic Places since May 2012. Just west of a peninsula called Gulf Point, the last state highway US 90 encounters in the city is SR 742\\\\. From there it enters Ferry Pass, where it will remain through the rest of the county. A folded diamond interchange is the first interchange with I-10 in the state (exit 17), just before I-10 crosses the Escambia Bay Bridge. Later, the P&A; Subdivision branches off to the east at Lora Point in order to cross its own bridge across the bay while US 90 moves to the northwest along the coast of Macky Bay. The first intersection along this segment also happens to be the first major intersection, SR 290 (Olive Road). All other streets along this segment are local ones, and all on the west side of the road. However, when the coastline moves to the north it provides local streets on the east side. Once this happens, the route finally encounters the eastern terminus of US 90 Alt. where the scenic route officially ends, and it becomes a four-lane divided highway again before crossing some bridges along the swamps on the left side of the bay the first of which is for the Escambia River where it crosses the Escambia‚ÄìSanta Rosa county line. =Santa Rosa County= Not yet outside of the Pensacola metropolitan area, US 90 enters Pace and gains the name Caroline Street. After the intersection of CR 197A, the road turns northeast, where it crosses CR 197 (Chumukula Highway), and at County Road 197B (West Spencer Field Road) it turns east again. The road remains straight east and west as it encounters another segment of CR 197A. After the northern terminus with SR 281 the road curves northeast, and officially enters Milton. It then crosses a pair of bridges over Pond Creek, where it passes by Mayo Park.Mayo Park (Santa Rosa County Official Site) Just east of the intersection with Glover Lane, Old US 90, a former segment of US 90 veers off to the right, but it is only a local street. The rest of the area is surrounded by portions of city territory, which becomes more widespread as it approaches the southern terminus of SR 89 (Dogwood Drive), but also has a hidden concurrency with SR 89 east of there. A far more visible concurrency exists later on when the road curves back to the east where it meets the intersection with SR 87, the eastern corners of which also includes the intersection of the Blackwater Heritage State Trail.Welcome to Blackwater Heritage State Trail (Florida State Parks; including map) From this point on the road narrows down to two lanes as it runs through the Milton Historic District, an area that has been on the National Register of Historic Places since November 12, 1987 and also includes an intersection with CR 191, which contains the east end of Old US 90\\\\. The district ends as the road crosses a bridge over the Blackwater River, and leaves the city limits. As the road enters East Milton and the Marquis Bayou, US 90/SR 87 encounters the entrance to Russell Barker Landing Park, and across from that the historic former section of US 90 known as State Road 1 (see below), which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Later the road runs through the rural outskirts of Milton which includes another park known as Locklin Field Park, and then curves to the southeast. The old road is encountered again under a bridge over the CSX P&A; Subdivision, and after becoming the northern terminus of CR 89 thus eliminating the hidden SR 89 concurrency, it then runs parallel to the old road as well as the P&A; Subdivision on the north side. All three roads (US 90/SR 78, Old SR 1, and the P&A; line) run relatively straight northeast to southwest from that point on. Right after Peter Prince Field, the concurrency with SR 87 ends as that route turns south toward Navarre Beach, while the other routes continue in the same direction, with only random local intersections. A street which would seem to be a former segment of US 90, but isn't known as Goodrange Drive veers off to the southeast in Harold, while US 90 turns at a more northeasterly angle where it encounters Deaton Bridge Road which leads to Blackwater River State Park after passing by the Harold Nolf Heliport. On the opposite of this is one leg of the wye to Miller Bluff Road. Goodrange Drive merges back with US 90, which remains at the same trajectory. From there, the road runs along a mostly dirt road called \\"Bliss Way.\\" Both road run under a power line right-of-way, then pass by the George T. McCutchan Airport (a local airstrip) before it later encounters the no longer existent community of Floridale, briefly moving away from the tracks, and then returning to tracks before cutting through the southeast corner of Blackwater River State Forest. Upon leaving the forest, it runs near an animal feed store and horse farm which is the last business to be found in the county. The last intersection in the county is Lake Yellow River Road on the southwest the Santa Rosa‚ÄìOkaloosa county line, and Garner Landing Road on the northeast side. =Okaloosa County= In much of Okaloosa County, US 90 takes one of the names given to the former sections in Santa Rosa County; the \\"Old Spanish Trail.\\" The first community it runs through is Holt, where it moves slightly further away from the railroad tracks at the intersection of Cooper Lane, and then encounters CR 189, a county extension of SR 189\\\\. It runs in a concurrency with CR 189 that shifts back to the side of the tracks before reaching Summertime Drive, which then turns north onto Galliver Cutoff to meet the state highway it was originally part of. Later it crosses a bridge over the P&A; Subdivision, and then serves as the eastern terminus of SR 4 in Milligan, however it also shares a hidden concurrency with SR 4 as both roads run along West James Lee Boulevard. One intersection with the southern terminus of CR 397 (Old River Road), and its dirt road extension Ellis Road exists before US 90/SR 4 cross a bridge over the Yellow River. East of this bridge, the road becomes a four-lane divided highway and County Road 4 branches off to the southeast and leads to southern Crestview. US 90 enters Crestview itself where the divider ends at CR 188, but remains four-lanes wide. Further into the city, it runs along the border of the Crestview Commercial Historic District and then encounters an intersection with Main Street where West James Lee Boulevard becomes East James Lee Boulevard, and then intersects SR 85 and Courthouse Terrace on the southwest corner of that intersection. US 90 leaves the historic district at Industrial Drive, and then passes by Twin Hills Park on the south side, and the Okaloosa County Jail on the north side. At the intersection with Del Cerro Camino, the road changes from a four-lane undivided highway to a four-lane divided one. East of Crestview, US 90 remains four lanes wide as it crosses a bridge over Mandle Creek, but narrows down to a two lane undivided highway before crossing the bridge over the Shoal River. The rest of the way through the county it includes both names \\"East James Lee Boulevard\\" and \\"Old Spanish Trail\\", as it meanders around rural Okaloosa County. As it enters Killingsworth Crossorads, the road runs along the north side of the P&A; Subdivision, but the tracks begin to move away momentarily as it enters Deerland, where it encounters the southern terminus of CR 393\\\\. The tracks return to the side of the road just west of the intersection of Mare Creek Drive, and will remain on this side even as both pass through some last developments hidden away on both sides before it crosses the Okaloosa-Walton county Line. =Walton County= Shortly after crossing the county line, US 90 continues to carry the name \\"Old Spanish Trail\\" where it enters the community of Bottle Branch and serves as the northern border of Eglin Air Force Base, although some private property occasionally can be found. Here the road serves as the northern terminus of State Road 285. Continuing along the northern edge of the base, US 90 and I-10 run parallel to each other, until the base territory ends, and I-10 moves to the southeast. In DeFuniak Springs, US 90 runs along the north side of the DeFuniak Springs Airport where it is joined in a concurrency with southbound US 331\\\\. After the airport US 90/331 runs along the north side of the DeFuniak Springs Country Club and then intersects a street named Baldwin Avenue, a city street with little importance other than the fact that it runs along the north side of the P&A; Subdivision. This concurrency ends as US 331 turns south onto unmarked State Road 83 (Freeport Road), which joins US 90 as they both enter the DeFuniak Springs Historic District until it heads north onto North Ninth Street. US 90 doesn't leave the historic district until the intersection of Second Street, but it encounters three other local intersections after this. A sure sign that the road's presence in the city is coming to an end, is when it approaches the east end of Baldwin Avenue with Dorsey Avenue as the road curves to the northeast along the railroad tracks, eventually leaving DeFuniak Spring and turning more toward the east again. As the road enters the former community of Koerber, and then passes by the site of the former railroad station, US 90 appears to serve as the southern terminus of CR 183 (Kidd Road). However, CR 183 secretly joins US 90 in a concurrency as they both climb a small hill, and shortly descend near a small industrial area. US 90/CR 183 curve slightly to the southeast as they enter Argyle, where CR 183 secretly joins CR 10A, while US 90 briefly curves to the northeast. CR 10A is named Old Highway 90), then removes the name \\"Old Spanish Trail\\" from US 90 as it crosses US 90 before both the old and \\"new\\" versions of US 90 cross the Walton-Holmes County Line. =Holmes and Washington Counties= US 90 winds around western rural Holmes County, as it does in much of the state. On the opposite side of a land mass called Long Pond Hill, US 90 finally reunites with the Old Spanish Trail at CR 10A, at an intersection also shared with a dirt road called the Baker Manning Loop. Shortly after this, the road enters its first municipality in the county, the Town of Ponce De Leon, where the only major intersection is an unsignalized one with State Road 81. The intersection with SR 81 would actually be a wye, if the west leg didn't continue south towards I-10 at Exit 96, Redbay, and points south. Shortly after the east leg of the wye with SR 81, US 90 crosses over Sandy Creek and then encounters the northern terminus of CR 181A (Ponce de Leon Springs Road), at an intersection also shared by Old Mill Road, a local city/county street. CR 181A leads to Ponce de Leon Springs State Park, and then down to CR 181\\\\. East of there, the road crosses a bridge over the P&A; Subdivision, but before leaving Ponce de Leon, US 90 has another encounter with CR 10A (Old US 90) east of the eastern terminus of Main Street. CR 10A is encountered again at Oak Grove Church Road, but the FDOT maps still includes the abandoned section between Oak Grove Church Road and US 90.FDOT Holmes County Florida Map, including US 90 and CR 10A George L. Dickenson Bridge Just as US 90 enters Westville a concurrency with CR 181 (South Cypress Street) begins, and US 90/CR 181 run parallel to CR 181C (R.M. Ward Road). The concurrency and the parallel suffixed route end when CR 181 turns north onto Pine Street, and the alignment of US 90 shifts back towards the east. But just as it briefly runs direct east, it turns southeast again, as it approaches the George L. Dickerson Bridge over the Choctawhatchee River, and thus the Holmes-Washington County Line, upon which it immediately enters the Town of Caryville, maintaining the street name \\"Old Spanish Trail.\\" The southeast corner of this bridge contains a local parallel street to a boat ramp. Despite running through a clearly defined town, US 90 runs by very few established landmarks, one of which is Caryville Town Hall and then intersects with Church Street, the southern side of which was a former segment of CR 279\\\\. Roughly two blocks after this it encounters the northern terminus of CR 279, which leads to I-10 at Exit 104, and then to Vernon, and Greenhead. Almost instantly the road crosses a bridge over a tributary to the Choctawhatchee River. Shortly after the embankment for this bridge ends, the road has two other local intersections before encountering the southern terminus of CR 179, which leads north to Pittman. East of there it is not only named Old Spanish Trail, but Brown Avenue. US 90 leaves the Caryville Town limits and meanders around the thumb of Washington County running through Garnair Airport, before it re- enters Holmes County, continuing to use \\"Old Spanish Trail\\" as the street name. =Holmes and Washington Counties; The second run= In its second journey through Holmes County, US 90 runs in a straight line northeast and southwest at least one block away from the P&A; line until it reaches Boswell Road and curves to the southeast beginning to move slightly further away from that line. East of the intersection of West Banfill Avenue, which forks off to the northeast, US 90 becomes a four-lane divided highway again. Along this segment it passes by the Holmes County High School on the south side just before entering Bonifay. At the intersection of CR 173, the divider ends abruptly, and the rest of the road remains a four-lane undivided highway well through the intersection with State Road 79, narrowing down to two lanes at Weeks Street. Two government offices can be found outside of the city limits. Many of the surroundings after this transform into farmland, and then sparse residences, and the road even runs through a forest on its way out of the county. US 90 east of the intersection of SR 77 (Main Street) in Chipley At a bridge over Holmes Creek, US 90 returns to Washington County. Few locations along this segment are of any note, other than a one-lane dirt road named Ray's Place that leads across the tracks to Vosika's Airport. However, just east of the site of the former Hulaw L&N; Railroad Station, US 90 becomes the northern terminus of State Road 277, and then turns into a four-lane undivided highway once again. At Hoyt Street, the road becomes West Jackson Avenue as it officially enters Chipley, where it passes by Washington County Public Library, and City Hall across the street, which is not to be confused with the old City Hall, listed on the National Register of Historic Places and located further into town. Second Street is where the name of the road changes from West Jackson Avenue to Jackson Avenue. East of Third Street, which has a South Third Street Historic District south of US 90, the historic Washington County Courthouse can be found on the south side of the street, where Fourth Street would be. Naturally, the next intersection is Fifth Street, which leads to the Old City Hall and the Woman's Club of Chipley. One block later, Main Street is actually State Road 77, and also has a hidden concurrency with SR/CR 273\\\\. A block from there, Seventh Street leads to the Chipley Amtrak Station, as well as the former L&N; Depot it replaced. Finally, at Martin Luther King Jr. Drive (formerly Eighth Street), the name changes to East Jackson Avenue, which remains four lanes wide until after it passes the grounds of the Florida Department of Transportation's District Three headquarters, and narrows down to two lanes. From there, it retains the name Old Spanish Trail. The road briefly tries to move straight east and west pulling away from the railroad tracks but returns to the same angle before the intersection with New Prospect Road. It maintains the usual surroundings of woodlands and farms interrupted by local streets, some of which are actually paved. The last intersection in Washington County is Candy Kitchen Road, then US 90 crosses the Washington- Jackson County Line from the southwest to the northeast, and immediately encounters the intersection with Woodrest Road. =Jackson County= Every other street that US 90 intersects from that point on is local and even less notable until it reaches County Road 195 (Sapp Road). Shortly after the road intersects Railroad Street, it enters the City of Cottondale, where the street name changes to Levy Street, and the asphalt becomes concrete as it descends beneath a concrete arch bridge beneath the Atlanta and Saint Andrews Bay Railway. Out from under that bridge, one other local intersection can be found to the south before the road intersects U.S. Route 231. After the intersection with Willow Street, another former segment of the road named \\"Pontiac Loop,\\" branches off to the southeast. As the road leaves the city limits, it makes a slight curve to the southeast at London Road, which ends when it meets Whiteville Road, but not until after Pontiac Loop terminates with US 90\\\\. The route remains straight east and west from here, and along the way has an intersection with unmarked former CR 10A (Old Cottondale Road). Two intersections later, US 90 is given the name West Lafayette Street before it enters the City of Marianna where right after entering the city limits it curves to the northeast to run beneath a bridge under the P&A; Subdivision followed by a sudden change into a four-lane undivided highway and a wye with the intersection of State Road 73. At the southeast leg of this wye a concurrency with SR 73 begins, which itself has a concurrency with CR 164\\\\. US 90/SR 73/CR 164 serves as the eastern terminus of State Road 276 (Pennsylvania Avenue), which continues north as Bumpnose Road. Later it becomes the eastern terminus of former CR 10A (Old Cottondale Road). After curving around the 1895-built Joseph W. Russ Jr. House which is also the county visitor's center, and then the 1840-built Ely-Criglar House and a bed & breakfast next door, the road intersects Wynn Street and serves as the southern border of the Marianna Historic District, remaining four-lanes wide. US 90 from the beginning of the concurrency with northbound SR 73 The US 90/SR 73 concurrency ends at the southern terminus of State Road 166 (Jefferson Street), where SR 73 turns south, but the concurrency with CR 164 continues along US 90 which becomes East Lafayette Street. As the border of the historic district ends between Chipola and Bertram Streets, US 90/CR 164 runs behind the backyard of the St. Luke Missionary Baptist Church on Jackson Street which runs parallel to the south. After encountering the intersection with Jackson Street, the road changes from a four-lane undivided highway into a four-lane divided highway as it crosses a bridge over the Chipola River and leaves the Marianna city limits. The first intersection east of the Chipola River is a street named \\"Old U.S. Road,\\" which would seem to be a former section of US 90 by the name, but is not. Much more importantly, the next intersection is a wye with State Road 71, the west leg of the wye is the east end of the concurrency with CR 164, and the east leg of which is the west end of a concurrency with SR 71\\\\. US 90/SR 71 runs southeast and intersects some local streets before they cross a bridge over Merrits Mill Pond. At the end of this concurrency, SR 71 turns south, and a segment of the Old Spanish Trail resumes after this, running along the south side of the road. East of there, US 90 becomes a two-lane undivided highway again, intersecting only local streets. US 90 over the Chipola River in Mariana North of Cypress the road intersects the northern terminus of CR 275 (Church Street) and then turns straight east, and continues in this trajectory as it enters the Town of Grand Ridge where it becomes a four-lane divided highway again and intersects State Road 69 (Porter Avenue). US 90 remains a four lane divided highway well east of the town limits. Nearly halfway outside of Grand Ridge, it intersects County Road 69A, where a short segment of \\"Old U.S. Highway 90\\" can be found on the northeast corner which actually ends at US 90 between the two ends of Morgan Loop, as it curves to the southeast. An abandoned segment of this road used to end at Mohawk Trail. As it enters the Town of Sneads it instantly has an intersection with County Road 10A (Keevers Road), which leads to the Old Spanish Trail. Further in town, it takes a slight turn to the northeast where it becomes a four-lane undivided highway as it runs along part of Three Rivers State Park before it serves as the southern terminus of County Road 271 (River Road), which runs along the west coast of the Jim Woodruff Reservoir and through parts of the Apalachee Wildlife Management Area, and then has an intersection with County Road 286 (Gloster Avenue) which leads to the last interchange with I-10 in the county, and then into Calhoun County. More than a block later, it narrows back down to two lanes. After curving to the southeast momentarily, CR 10A and the Old Spanish Trail reunite with US 90 before the road leaves town, and the road turns straight east once again. This alignment ends as it curves back to the southeast and approaches the last landmark along US 90 in Jackson County, the Apalachee Correctional Institute, a massive prison farm. East of that point, the road begins to cross the Victory Bridge over the floodplains of the Apalachicola River, but does not cross the river directly just yet, until it curves back to the east. A power line right of way and one last local intersection can be found before the road and bridge finally crosses the river itself between the Jim Woodruff Dam and the Old Victory Bridge, where US 90 finally leaves what is historically considered \\"West Florida.\\" =Gadsden County= In Gadsden County, US 90 leaves the Central Time Zone and enters the Eastern Time Zone as it crosses the Victory Bridge over the Appalachicola River entering the City of Chattahoochee. Most of the road in the county is named \\"Memorial Blue Star Highway,\\" except in specific cities. This area is where the route is closest to the Florida-Georgia State Line. It is also where the route gains a concurrency with County Road 269 between Bolivar Street (which is the westernmost street leading to Georgia) and Main Street. After passing by the Florida State Hospital, which includes the NRHP-listed U.S. Arsenal-Officers Quarters, another concurrency begins, this time with CR 269A, where the street name changes from West Washington Street to East Washington Street. After the route leaves the city and CR 269A turns north toward Georgia State Route 97, it starts to move further away from the border. After the intersection with CR 369B in Oak Grove it passes by the Joshua Davis House and then curves southeast where it enters Mount Pleasant as it intersects CR 369\\\\. The CSX Tallahassee Subdivision which began in Chatahoochee and carried the Amtrak Sunset Limited approaches US 90 south of there in Saint John running entirely along the southwest side. The tracks follow US 90 even as it enters the City of Gretna where the road is named Main Street and the closest two intersections resembling major ones are with CR 268, and later CR 270A. Southeast of Gretna, the road enters Douglas City as it turns back east again as it joins a concurrency with State Road 12, which also contains a hidden concurrency with State Road 65, although Google Maps refers to it as County Road 65. The tracks begin to move away from US 90/SRs 12/65, but almost comes back just before the intersection with CR 274 before entering Quincy where the multiplex becomes West Jefferson Street. Within the city the roat encounters an at-grade railroad crossing with a spur of the Tallahassee Subdivision. This spur runs next to the beginning of the concurrency with State Road 267 and CR 268 once again. The concurrency with SR 267 may have been in the process of being eliminated though, as a four-lane stub extends a block north of US 90\\\\. US 90/SRs 12/65/267/CR 268 enter the Quincy Historic District at Stewart Street. Four blocks later at Adams Street, SR 267 leave US 90 to the north, and CR 268 turns in the opposite direction. Between there it runs in front of the Gadsden County Courthouse and a block later at Madison Street, SRs 12/65 turns north. From there, US 90 becomes East Jefferson Street. Officially leaving the historic district east of Love Street, the road passes by a Sheriff's office and the Eastern Cemetery turning southeast again, just before it leaves the city and becomes a four-lane divided highway, but it clings to the name \\"East Jefferson Street\\" until just before the Gadsden Medical Center complex. The road briefly strays from the southeast trajectory to cross over the Little River and Hurricane Creek and then heads back to the southeast. It serves as the termini of CR 159 and CR 268 before the road enters Midway. The road leaves and re-enters Midway twice before it crosses I-10 once again at Exit 192, which is a parclo interchange. Here it re-enters Midway for the third and last time. The CSX Tallahassee Subdivision finally meets up with the south side of US 90 again before both cross separate bridges over the Ochlockonee River where they cross the Gadsden-Leon County Line. =Leon County, Tallahassee, and Jefferson County= As New Quincy Highway, US 90's southeast trajectory is diminished somewhat in Ochlockonee where it serves as the northern termini of CR 1585, CR 1583, and CR 1581, then curves slightly to the northeast. The road's entry into downtown Tallahassee is inevitable, but first it runs along part of the city line and intersects with State Road 263, which is part of the Capital Circle. Just before entering the capital completely, it intersects State Road 20, which joins SR 10 as an additional hidden route, later becoming West Tennessee Street. US 90 then passes the north entrance of Florida State University and expands to six-lanes, also intersecting streets that lead to Florida A&M; University, until its junction with US 27 which is momentarily co-signed with SRs 61 and 373. Here, SR 20 turns right and becomes the hidden state road for US 27 until it reaches High Springs in Alachua County. The rest of the way, US 90 is four lanes wide. The northeast corner of US 90 and County Road 146 serves as the territory for Leon High School, starting with a separate section for Leon Performing Arts. This territory ends across from South Franklin Boulevard (CR 1555). After that, the road curves to the northeast, and gains two frontage roads, the longer of which is named Briarcliff road which runs along the south side, and the railroad tracks that usually run close to US 90 run south of that. Briarcliff Road ends at Short Street, and the next major intersection is the northern terminus of State Road 265 and southern terminus of County Road 151, where US 90's name change from East Tennessee Street to Mahan Drive. The railroad tracks that usually run close to US 90 begins to move to the southeast across from Spottswood Drive. The next major intersections are with CR 373 (Blair Stone Road) and then US 319 which is also part of the Capital Circle. Just east of there across the city line is the intersection with the west end of Former State Road 158. The road stays out of the city in the same direction only to return to it momentarily in the vicinity of another parclo interchange with I-10 at Exit 209. As it leaves the capital limits for the last time, it tries to straighten out only to curve at an even sharper northeast angle. Approaching the vicinity of Wadesboro it takes a curve to the southeast again where County Road 59, a bi-county extension of State Road 59 joins US 90 in a concurrency. After crossing a creek leading to Long Pond on the southwest side, the road briefly enters a corner of Jefferson County but re-enters Leon County again to intersect CR 154 (Old Magnolia Drive) as it lets go of CR 59\\\\. Besides some private roads, the only other intersections after this are Sunray Road, the south side of which leads to Letchworth Mounds State Park in Jefferson County, and later a road to a boat ramp on the southwest bank of Lake Miccosukee. The road re-enters Jefferson County again after crossing a causeway over the southern end of Lake Miccosukee and is named West Washington Street. Most of the road in Jefferson County runs through forestland with broken by occasional ranch land on the south side, along sporadic bridges crossing small creeks and intersecting with local roads of no importance until it reaches County Road 158A (Old Lloyd Road), which leads to the Lloyd Historic District. The official point where US 90 skirts the border with Monticello is near the Crooked Creek housing development, although most of the rural surroundings continue, as it enters the rest of the city. A local street named Mahan Drive merges with US 90, and may have been part of the original version of the road in Leon County. East of there, the road passes through more historic sections of the city, where it passes by the Avera-Clarke House, now a bed & breakfast, and later the NRHP-listed Monticello High School on the southwest corner of West Washington and South Water Streets. Another NRHP- listed site on US 90 is the Perkins Opera House on the south side between Mulberry Street and the traffic circle with US 19 which contains the Jefferson County Courthouse in the center, and itself is part of the Monticello Historic District. As one might expect, the name of US 90 changes to East Washington Street east of the courthouse and traffic circle, but it keeps that name as it leaves the city line at Simpson Avenue. After the road intersects a spur to CR 146 named \\"Catholic Church Side,\\" US 90 curves to the southeast, although it briefly curves to the east to cross a bridge over Wolf Creek, only to turn southeast once again. Few intersections at this point are of any significance other than one leading to the Jefferson County Corrections Institute and a dead end street leading to a local cemetery. This changes though when it encounters the intersection with CR 257 north of Aucilla One last dirt road in the county on the north side is Gramling Road which leads to the Upper Aucilla Conservation Area, but further along two other dirt roads on the south side can be found before it crosses a bridge over the Aucilla River, where US 90 leaves Jefferson County and enters Madison County. =Madison County= As expected the first streets to intersect US 90 are local ones of little importance until it reaches the southwestern terminus of Honey Lake Road, then curves southeast to cross a bridge over the Little Aucilla River, an eastern tributary of the Aucilla River. The road then tries to curve more to the east as it passes by Pellis Springs Road and later Hensey Cemetery. The CSX Tallahassee Subdivision encounters US 90 once again between Northwest First Avenue and moves away from it again before the intersection with Northwest Tenth Loop before the road enters Greenville. Grand Street veers off to the right to move closer to the tracks, but it also serves as the means of getting to Grand Avenue which follows the tracks throughout the town. Meanwhile, Grand Street actually returns to US 90 just before it reaches the west end of the concurrency with US 221 at Pitt Street. Together US 90-221 intersects an at- grade crossing with a Georgia and Florida Railway line that often stays in close proximity to US 221, and then passes by the Haffye Hays Park, a local park that contains a memorial to Ray Charles. After passing by some local industry, US 221 turns south near the historic Bishop-Andrews Hotel, but US 90 picks up a concurrency with Former State Road 150. When US 90/CR 150 encounters Evergreen Cemetery, it's a sign that Grand Avenue is about to end, and thus the railroad tracks will be in sight once again. CR 150 turns north toward northern Madison County, while US 90 continues east, winding around much of rural central Madison County. The railroad tracks start to move further and further away from US 90 again after the first intersection with Elizabeth H. Sims Road. In the vicinity of Madison County High School, the road briefly becomes a wider undivided highway with provisions for left- turning lanes, but then narrows back down to two lanes. In the City of Madison itself US 90 is named Base Street, which becomes a four-lane undivided highway between Southwest Captain Brown Road and College Loop, both of which were part and all of former US 90 respectively. Halfway between College Loop is an intersections with both Lawson Circle and Turner Davis Drive, the latter of which is an entrance to North Florida Community College. After the intersection with CR 360A, the road turns straight east and west again. The historic Wardlaw-Smith House is on the northwest corner of US 90 and North Washington Street, which is also where the concurrency with State Road 53 begins, as well as the accompanying Florida Short Route, and Lone Star Trail. Later it intersects Range Road and North Range Road, the former of which leads to SR 14, and the northeast corner of which is the location of the city's Four Freedoms Monument. Across US 90 from it is the Madison County Courthouse. Three blocks later the concurrency with SR 53 ends at Duval Street, when SR 53 turns south. The same intersection is also the southern terminus of State Road 145. East of this point US 90 remains a four-lane undivided highway until it almost reaches Northeast 22nd Street, where it narrows down to two lanes. It remains straight east until it approaches the at-grade interchange with State Road 6 and turns southeast. Along this segment, US 90 tries to avoid moving further toward a southerly direction than an easterly one, and finally succeeds in doing so when it enters Lee. The main crossroad along US 90 in Lee is CR 255, a south-to-north road that spans from CR 53 near the Madison- Lafayette County Line near Mayo to CR 150 near Pinetta. It also provides the last chance for access to I-10 within the county. East of the city, it runs along the north side of the railroad tracks once again, although it begins to pull away from the tracks at the intersections of Beulah Church Road and Southeast 208th Street. Within Twin Rivers State Forest, US 90 veers to the southeast as it approaches the intersection of CR 141 (Myrrh Road), a bi- county road that leads to the Jennings area near the Georgia border, and rises along an embankment over the CSX line that was used by the Sunset Limited, only to curve back to the same direction it ran before that intersection. 9/10 of a mile after some power linesGoogle Maps' US 90 from power lines in Twin Rivers State Forest to Old US 90, which also serve as an entrance to the forest on the south side, the west end of the former US 90 ROW that used the Hillman Bridge (Old Ellaville Bridge), is used as the means of reaching Northeast Ellaville Central Avenue. Both the existing road and former road curve south again in order to cross the Suwannee River, and therefore leaves Madison County entering Suwannee County. =Suwannee County= Continuing southeast, the highway remains a two-lane road north of I-10 as it passes by Suwannee River State Park, where it encounters the east end of the former ROW that used the Hillman Bridge, the western terminus of County Road 132 which is a direct route to Suwannee Springs, and the unincorporated community of Ellaville. The CSX line previously used by the Sunset Limited hugs the side of the road once again, this time on the north side. After passing through Falmouth, US 90 has another parclo interchange with I-10 at Exit 275, and goes south of I-10 once again. East of there, the road is named Howard Street. Local streets lead to the Suwannee County Airport south of the road and just west of the City of Live Oak, and the tracks that hugged the north side of the road west of the city move a block north, as the road enters the city. At Houston Avenue US 90 is joined by County Road 249, which follows it in a short concurrency for four blocks until it reaches U.S. Route 129 (Ohio Avenue) where it turns south and becomes hidden SR 249\\\\. The intersection between US 90 and US 129 are the official four corners of the city. Outside of Live Oak, US 90 becomes the eastern terminus of CR 10A and then the northern terminus of CR 49, a county extension of State Road 49. East of there, the road intersects primarily local streets, among them 89th Road, a road leading to \\"Wings 'N' Sunsets\\" Airport. After this it inconspicuously runs through Houston where it encounters the southern terminus of unmarked CR 417\\\\. Just before entering Wellborn, US 90 encounters another segment of CR 10A that veers off to the northeast. The only other resemblance of a major intersection in Wellborn is CR 137\\\\. CR 10A ends at US 90 before it crosses the Suwannee-Columbia County Line. =Columbia and Baker Counties= Rural western Columbia County provides some surprisingly interesting intersections, the first of which is the northern terminus of County Road 252A, a suffixed alternate of Suwannee-County Road 252. The next is the southern terminus of County Road 135 which leads to Bahia and CR 250\\\\. The shared intersections of Northwest Turner Road and Pinemount Road is also where the Lake City border runs along the north side of US 90 until it reaches the intersection of Whispering Pine Road, and then moves away. The last intersection with a non-local street in this region is with eastern terminus of County Roads 252A and northern terminus of County Roads 252B. US 90 enters Lake City as Duval Street just in time to encounter a diamond-interchange at I-75. Almost instantly it serves as the northeastern terminus of State Road 247, and then begins to curve to the northeast. Along this segment, it also serves as the northern terminus of CR 341, but mote importantly serves as the western terminus of SR 10A (Baya Drive), From there it turns straight east again at Eadle Street. Other than various local streets, US 90 has an intersection with U.S. Route 41 (hidden SR 25) and SR 100, which turns from US 41 onto US 90\\\\. Merely three blocks from US 41, US 90/SRs 10 & 100 encounters an intersection with one of its spur routes, US 441 (SRs 25A/47). The Desoto Trail and Florida Short Routes turn south here but the Lone Star Trail continues along US 90\\\\. East of the city limits in Newco, SR 100 becomes an independent route as it branches off to the southeast on its way to Starke, Palatka, and Flagler Beach, while US 90 continues east later serving as the eastern terminus of SR 10A. Both roads serve as the border of Lake City Municipal Airport. Later on in Mount Carrie, US 90 itself serves as the southern border for the Osceola National Forest and is the location of the Lake City Correctional Facility and Columbia Correctional Institute before crossing the Columbia-Baker County Line where it enters the forest itself. After leaving Osceola National Forest just west of CR 250A, it passes Olustee Battlefield Historic State Park, and then has another interchange with I-10 at Exit 324, running north of the interstate where it will remain for the duration of its journey. In Sanderson US 90 encounters CR 229, which it has a one-block concurrency with until it reaches CR 127\\\\. The road encounters an intersection with Arnold Rhoden Road which leads to a former segment of US 90 that serves as the road to Sanderson Cemetery. US 90 runs parallel to this road as it then crosses a bridge over the CSX Line that was used by the Sunset Limited. East of Margaretta, the road encounters two other local county roads; the southern terminus of CR 139, and then the northern terminus of CR 123\\\\. Both roads lose their designations less than five miles from US 90\\\\. The Town of Glen St. Mary is where the road is given the name Mount Vernon Avenue, and it crosses CR 125 (Glenn Street), and then becomes a four-lane undivided highway even as it leaves town two-thirds of the way between Hillard Avenue and Wildcat Road. The road crosses what has been designated the \\"South Prong\\" of the St. Mary's River, and then enters Macclenny, where the name turns into Macclenny Avenue. The first major intersection in the city is County Road 23A (Lowder Street), but far more important is the intersection with State Road 121 (Sixth Street). Merely a block away it becomes the western terminus of State Road 228, and southern terminus of County Road 23B, both of which are Fifth Street. Beyond the city limits, the road continues along the same trajectory along with the parallel CSX line on the south side until they both cross the Baker-Nassau County Line, where it veers slightly to the northwest. =Nassau and Duval Counties= Within US 90's brief stay in Nassau County as North Beaver Road, it encounters only two dirt roads, the former crossing of an abandoned railroad line, and then a third dirt road. The only bridge in the county is over another tributary to the St. Marys River. It then crosses the Nassau-Duval County Line, where it also enters the Jacksonville City Limits and has its first intersection with County Road 121. Later the road momentarily leaves Jacksonville and enters Baldwin, where it has a concurrency with U.S. Route 301 for several blocks. This concurrency may disappear if the Florida Department of Transportation decides to build the proposed Baldwin Bypass around the western edge of town.US 301 Expansion; Baldwin Bypass (FDOT, Region #2) Immediately after another railroad crossing with the CSX Callahan Subdivision, both US 90 and 301 narrow down to two lanes at the east end of this concurrency, and then US 90 re-enters Jacksonville. As it passes along the north side of Cecil Airport, the road intersects CR 119, where the name changes from Lake City Road back to Beaver Street. It then runs north of the current northern terminus of the First Coast Expressway (State Road 23), which is intended to be extended to US 90\\\\. Next is the intersection of Chaffee Road, which is now CR 115C south of US 90\\\\. East of Chaffee Road, the road runs along the north side of part of the CSX Jacksonville Terminal Subdivision, until Devoe Street when it pulls away from the tracks and then runs straight east and west again at the southeast end of Bulls Bay Highway. No access is available to Interstate 295 because of the close proximity of the interchange with I-10, but the bridge beneath it contains a right-of-way for a future westbound lane. A large railroad wye does exist at the eastern edge of this underpass and a moderate intersection can be found east of there with the northern terminus of SR 103, which becomes an unmarked city street north of the road. Several blocks later, the road maintains the same trajectory, becoming four-lanes through the industrialized west side just west of SR 111\\\\. It also serves as the northern terminus of State Road 129. As it approaches Downtown Jacksonville, a single ramp leads to both southbound and northbound Interstate 95 while an unconventional southbound only off-ramp connects to the road between the two carriageways of I-95 and then it encounters southbound U.S. Route 1 (Main Street) where it turns right, while U.S. Alternate Route 90 (SR 10A) continues for one block east, then turns left onto northbound US 1 (Ocean Avenue), only to turn back east again a block after that onto Union Street. Already in another concurrency with US 1 since Union and State Streets, SR 228 runs along US 1/90 until it reaches Duval and Adams Streets then branches off to the east. At Bay Street, the northern terminus of SR Spur 15 can be found. US 1/90 crosses the St. Johns River on the Main Street Bridge then turns east again along State Road 13 at Prudential Drive. This concurrency lasts until SR 13 turns south onto Hendricks Avenue, and US 1/90 turn south a block later at Kings Avenue. US 90 runs along southbound US 1 until it reaches another interchange with I-95 heading south towards, Daytona Beach, Miami, and the Florida Keys, taking the Old Spanish Trail and Lone Star Trail with it, while US 90 turns east again onto Atlantic Boulevard, which branches off to the northeast at an interchange as a separate SR 10\\\\. US 90 continues in the same trajectory as Beach Boulevard and for the last , the hidden route for this segment is SR 212\\\\. State Road 212 The first major intersection US 90 encounters as Beach Boulevard (SR 212) is a parclo interchange with U.S. Alternate Route 1, known as the Hart Expressway. Next is an at-grade intersection with State Road 109 (University Boulevard), and later the eastern terminus of SR 228 (Commodore Point Expressway), which terminates in the median of Beach Boulevard and like US ALT 1 leads to the Hart Bridge Expressway back into Downtown Jacksonville. The road then crosses a bridge over Pottsburg Creek, a tributary of the St. Johns River, and later encounters the eastern terminus of U.S. Alternate Route 90 which is also shared by an intersection with State Road 115 (Southside Boulevard). After passing by Forestry Tower Park, and then intersecting St. John's Bluff Road, it gains access to Interstate 295 that it couldn't have in western Jacksonville, albeit with a single-point urban interchange. From there the road becomes the dividing line between Florida State College - South Campus and the University of North Florida, which ironically is on the south side of US 90, while FSC South is on the north side. Another SPUI variant can be found at Kernan Boulevard, though this road is not a limited-access highway at all. The last two intersections that pass for major ones in Jacksonville are Hodges Boulevard and then CR 101A (San Pablo Boulevard). Near its eastern terminus, it crosses the B.B. McCormick Bridge, leaving Jacksonville and entering Jacksonville Beach, continuing east through commercial establishments, and ending at SR A1A in Jacksonville Beach. However, Beach Boulevard continues for eastward as County Road 212, ending at First Avenue North. History From 1926 to 1949, US 90 ran along what is today part of State Road 12 from Quincy to Havana, and south along a concurrency with US 27 from Havana to Tallahassee. Other former segments of the route are scattered throughout the state. US 90's routing in Florida has not been changed since 1950. In 1953, the segment between Tallahassee and Monticello was named Mahan Drive for a Monticello florist and horticulturalist named Fred Alfred Mahan (1886-1960) who beginning in 1935 was given a contract by the Coastal Roads Company of Miami, Florida to beautify and improve the road. This included the removal of dead stumps along the right of way of the Lake Miccosukee Causeway at the Leon-Jefferson County Line. A US 90 shield used in Florida prior to 1993 From 1956 until 1993, US 90 signs in Florida featured white numbering on a blue shield. The \\"color-coding\\" of U.S. Routes by the Florida Department of Transportation was stopped when the state could no longer use Federal funds to replace the signs with anything but the standard black-and-white version. Some blue US 90 signs may still remain. After Hurricane Ivan destroyed the I-10 Bridge in Northwest Florida, motorists waited as long as 2 hours to cross the Escambia bridge between Santa Rosa and Escambia counties. The Perdido River Bridge was replaced between 2010 and 2013.Escambia County Construction (Florida Department of Transportation; Region #3) =State Road 1= The Florida State Road No. 1 (also known as the Old Brick Road, Red Brick Road, U.S. Highway 90, or Old Spanish Trail) is a historic road near Milton, Florida. It is located, roughly, in three sections east of Milton, parallel to US 90, between Marquis Bayou and Harold. On June 23, 1994, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.Santa Rosa County listings at National Register of Historic PlacesFlorida's Office of Cultural and Historical Programs; Santa Rosa County listings at Florida's Office of Cultural and Historical Programs; Florida State Road No. 1U.S. Highway 90 - Old Spanish Trail - Historic State Route 1 at The Lost Highway @ RoadSites.org =Beach Boulevard in Jacksonville (SR 212)= What is now called Beach Boulevard is actually an extension that was added to the original, post-Civil War road called Hogan Road, which stretched from the South bank of the St Johns River downtown, and led Southeast across the bridge over Little Pottsburg Creek and moved onward toward St Augustine. Hogan Road was named after the Hogan Family that were the first white settlers in Duval County. Hogan Road had two sections, the Northbank section moving north from the north bank of the St Johns River downtown, and the Southbank section moving south from the south bank of the St Johns River downtown. In the late 1930s, a new road called Beach Boulevard was built from the beaches toward Downtown Jacksonville until it intersected with the Southbank section of Hogan Road just west of what is now called Parental Home Road. The Southbank section of Hogan Road between Parental Home Road and the South bank of the St Johns River downtown was renamed Beach Boulevard and added to the new section, thus allowing the new Beach Boulevard to exist under one name from the South bank of the St Johns River, all the way out to the Atlantic Ocean. Other changes were made in the 1950s, when Interstate I-95 bisected the new Beach Blvd just south of the riverbank. All that is left of the original Hogan Road is the Northbank section downtown, and a small piece of the original Southbank section that stretches from just west of Parental Home Road South across the Little Pottsburg Creek, and ends at the intersection of Southside Boulevard. Prior to the 1945 renumbering, it was State Road 376, added to the state road system by the Florida Legislature in 1937. The road was built on the right-of-way of the Florida East Coast Railway Mayport Branch (Jacksonville and Atlantic Railroad) to relieve traffic on the parallel Atlantic Boulevard (pre-1945 State Road 140, now State Road 10).Patton, Charlie: \\"Piney Woods Miracle\\" Florida Times- Union, November 23, 2000 Construction began before World War II but was suspended between fall 1941 and 1945. After the renumbering, it was reassigned to SR 212, and dedicated December 17, 1949, along with the B.B. McCormick Bridge over the Intracoastal Waterway.

Apart from this District Nagpur (Maharashtra) have also a very large Parwar community. There is an area in Itwari of Nagpur known as Parwar-Pura having large number of Parwar's homes and shops . Most of the Nagpur's Parwar are migrated from Sagar, Deori, and other small villages of Sagar District of MP. Parwar exclusively follow the Digambar Jain tradition. Parwar usually preferred their marriage within community. There are 12 Gotra in Parwar community. Each Gotra has 12 Moor (lineages). A marriage within the same gotra or lineage are not allowed. Traditionally a marriage within any of the 8 branches (the moor of boy or girl, mother's family, father's mother's family etc) was not permitted and hence the community was termed ashta-shakha.Parwar Bandhu, Year 2, Issue 3, March 1924, p. 131 A number of Jain scholars have belonged to this community, including Tarana Swami, the founder of Taran Panth and the Bhattarakas of Chanderi. Osho was born in the Samaiya section of this community. Also, Pandit Sumerchand Diwakar, Pandit Nathuram Premi, Dr Hiralal Jain, Dr Mahendrakumar Nyayacarya, Pandit Phulacandra Shastri, Pandit Hiralal Jain, Pandit Balacandra Shastri, Pandit Jaganmohanlal Shastri, Pandit Devakinandan Nayak, Swami Satyabhakta, Wardha, philosopher, founder of Satya Samaj (1899‚Äì1998) many other illustrious scholars of Jainism were born in the Parwar [also spelt as Paravara] community. The map of districts having large number of Parwar Jain in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh is shown below. Map of district having large Digambar Parwar Jain Community History A number of inscriptions mentiong the community have been found in the region adjacent to the Betwa river,Siddhantacharya Phulachandra Shastri, Parwar Jain Samaj ka Itihas, 1990, Jabalpur which flows on the border of MP and UP. In the older inscriptions they are called Paurapatta or Puravada. The oldest inscriptions include those found at Vidisha (948 CE),Epigraphia Indica, Vol XXX, 1987, p.210-219Pachrai (1065 CE), Aharji (1152, 1153), Chanderi (VS 1252,13450), Sironj (VS 1299, 1316), Narwar (VS 1319). A long inscription at Deogarh of VS 1493 mentions Lakshaman Singhai and his large family, who installed an idol of Lord Shantinath under the supervision of Bhattaraka Devendrakirti of Balatkara Gana. It is probably the first mention of the Singhai (or Sanghapati) title in the region. Some authors have proposed a historic connection between the Parwar and the Porwad communities.Siddhantacharya Phulachandra Shastri, Parwar Jain Samaj ka Itihas, 1990, Jabalpur Jainism had a continuous presence in this region since antiquity. Jainism was flourishing during the Gupta period at Vidisha region. The Durjanpur idols installed during the rule of Ramagupta date to about 365 AD. The Udaigiri cave Parshvanath inscription mentioning the lineage of Bhadranvaya is dated to 425 AD.Kasturchand Jain Suman, Bharatiya Digambar Jain Abhilekh aur Tirth Parichay, Madhya-Pradesh: 13 vi shati tak, Delhi, 2001 The great Shantinath temple at Deogarh was built before 862 CE, suggesting a prosperous Jain community in this region. According to Mahavamsa, Devi, the wife of Maurya Ashoka was a daughter of a merchant of Vidisha, whose son Mahinda took Buddhism to Sri Lanka. It is likely that the Parwar community is a continuation of the ancient merchant community of the region. Organization The Parwars are divided into 12 gotras, each gotra is further divided into 12 shakhas (mura)s. Traditionally 4 of the shakas of the grandparents of the boy, and four of the shakhas of the grandparents of the girl were required to be distinct for a marriage to take place. Thus the Parwars were sometimes termed ashta-shaha. There were once several social divisions among the Parwars, which are no longer significant. Some Parwars follow Taran Panth and are called Samaiya, because Taran Swami based his teachings on Samayasara of Acharya Kundakunda. Parwar Sabha was founded in 1917 at Ramtek, after the Bundelkhandiya Jain Sabha broke into community groups. In the 1924 convention, it was proposed that only four shakhas be considered for marriage, but the proposal was defeated. A newsletter Parwar Bandhu was published during 1929‚Äì1944. A \\"Parwar Directory\\" was published in 1924 which included population data, according to which the Parwar population then was 48,074.Parwar Directory, Pannalal Jain Sivni, 1924 The community resided in 1438 towns and villages with largest population in Sagar, Jhansi, Jabalpur, Damoh and Tikamgarh districts. The largest number are in Lalitpur (1122 in 1924), Mungawali (481), Khaniadhana (320), Pachhar (Ashoknagar Isagarh), Mandawara (304), Sivni (358), Sagar (595), Bamora (374), Khurai (503), Bina-Itawa (358), Pindarai (Mandla 314),Jabalpur (1058) and Tikamgarh. This puts the majority of the major centers within a 50-mile radius from Deogarh (see , Map) along the Betwa river in early 20th century. The main concentration of the Parwars is still in these towns; however, many of them have moved to major industrial cities further away such as Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. A few Parwar families now migrated to Americas.

It is the longest US road in Florida. It was established in 1933 as a route between Pensacola and Apalachicola, and has since been extended eastward across the Florida Peninsula and westward into Mississippi. It runs along much of the Gulf Coast between Mobile, Alabama and Crystal River, Florida, including extensive sections closely following the coast eastward from the Alabama-Florida state line to St. Marks. At a length of 671 miles, US 98 is the longest numbered route in the state of Florida. Within Florida, US 98 is marked as an east‚Äìwest road from the Alabama-Florida border to Perry. Throughout most of the Florida Peninsula, the road is marked as a north‚Äìsouth road, but directions return to east-west on the northeast shore of Lake Okeechobee. As is the case with all Florida roads with federal designations, the entirety of US 98 has a hidden Florida Department of Transportation designation: * State Road 80 from the US route's eastern terminus at SR A1A to Main Street (SR 15) in Belle Glade. * State Road 15 from Hooker Highway (SR 812/SR 80) in Belle Glade to the junction with Parrot Avenue (US 441 / SR 15) and Park Street (SR 70 east) in Okeechobee. * State Road 700 from the route's eastern split in Canal Point to Lake Parker Avenue (SR 700 north) in Lakeland, and again from to US 92 in Lakeland to South Suncoast Boulevard (US 19) in Citrus County. * State Road 35 from SR 60 / Broadway Avenue (SR 35 south) in Bartow to US 301 in Pasco County, with one exception: ** State Road 548 from Main Street (SR 35 north) to George Jenkins Boulevard (SR 548 west) in Lakeland. * State Road 55 from South Suncoast Boulevard (US 19 south) in Citrus County to US 221 (SR 55 north) in Perry. * State Road 30 from US 221 in Perry to the Alabama state line via the Lillian Bridge over Perdido Bay, with the following exceptions: ** State Road 30A between the eastern and western termini of both of US 98 Business (SR 30) and US 98 Alternate (SR 30) in Bay County ** State Road 289 from US 98 Business (SR 30) to US 90 (SR 10A) in Pensacola. ** State Road 10A from North 9th Avenue (SR 289 north) to North Pace Boulevard (SR 292 north) in Pensacola. ** State Road 292 from West Cervantes Street (US 90 / SR 10A) to US 98 Business (SR 30) in Pensacola. Concurrencies include US 90 in Pensacola, US 319 from Port St. Joe to St. Teresa and in Medart, ALT US 27 from Perry to Chiefland, US 19 from Perry to Chassahowitzka, US 41 then SR 50A in Brooksville, SR 50 from Brooksville to Ridge Manor, US 301 from Moss Town to Clinton Heights, US 17 from Bartow to Fort Meade, US 27 from West Frostproof to South Sebring, US 441 from Okeechobee to Royal Palm Beach, and SR 80 from near Belle Glade to Palm Beach. Route description US 98 is a route that extends from the panhandle to Palm Beach. From the Alabama state line to Apalachee Bay, it follows the coast of the Gulf of Mexico through Pensacola and Panama City. It then turns inland and passes through Perry and Chiefland before turning back towards the gulf coast north of Crystal River. The highway stairsteps its way across the peninsula through Dade City, Lakeland, and Sebring. Near Lake Okeechobee, it follows the northern and eastern shore toward Belle Glade. It then heads east to its endpoint on the Atlantic seaboard in Palm Beach. =Across the Panhandle= US 98 concurrency with Chase Street, in downtown Pensacola US 98 enters Florida from Alabama via the Lillian Bridge which spans Perdido Bay. The two-lane highway lands on the state's western shore just west of Pensacola as Lillian Highway. At an intersection with SR 298 and County Road 297 (CR 297), Lillian Highway splits away from US 98 and continues along the state road. At SR 173, US 98 widens into a four-lane divided highway. SR 727 provides access to Warrington to the south and to Pensacola's northwestern suburbs. As it enters West Pensacola, US 98 passes along the southern border of the Corry Station Naval Technical Training Center. It turns north onto SR 295 and the two routes head north together for a short distance. Both SR 173 and SR 295 direct traffic to Naval Air Station Pensacola, which lies south of the intersection of US 98 and SR 295. US 98 enters Pensacola after traversing a short bridge across Bayou Chico. A few blocks later, it turns onto Pace Boulevard (SR 292), which takes US 98 north to West Cervantes Street, which carries US 90\\\\. Together, US 90 and US 98 run through the heart of Pensacola. They intersect US 29 (N. Palafox Street),a half diamond interchange with Interstate 110 (I-10), and the SR 291 one-way couplet of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive (southbound) and Davis Highway (northbound). Shortly thereafter, US 98 turns south at SR 289 and splits away from US 90\\\\. US 98 and SR 289 are concurrent for a few blocks until the U.S. Highway's eastbound traffic turns onto E. Chase Street; westbound traffic arrives at SR 289 on E. Gregory Street. After a short jaunt on the Bayfront Parkway, US 98 turns south to cross the Pensacola Bay Bridge over the eponymous body of water. The highway lands on the Fairpoint Peninsula in Gulf Breeze. It passes Gulf Breeze High School before it turns to the east. On the opposite end of the eastward curve is a trumpet interchange with Pensacola Beach Boulevard, which heads south to Pensacola Beach. East of Gulf Breeze, US 98 goes through the Naval Live Oaks Reservation. It meets SR 281 in Tiger Point. The route then continues on through Navarre, where it intersects with Florida State Road 87 and then the Navarre Beach Causeway. The Hathaway Bridge, which carries US 98 from Panama City Beach to Panama City US 98 continues on to Perry through Okaloosa, Walton, Bay, Gulf, Franklin, Wakulla, Jefferson, and Taylor counties, passing through different cities and towns, such as Fort Walton Beach, Destin, Santa Rosa Beach, Panama City, Port St. Joe, and Apalachicola, along the beautiful and well-known Emerald Coast and the quieter, less developed Forgotten Coast. =South turn: Concurrency with US 19= Within the city limits of Perry, US 98 and SR 30 makes a sharp turn to the south along US 19 which is also the northern terminus of Alternate US 27 and is named Byron Butler Parkway. US 27, which replaces US 98 as an overlapping US route for US 19 heads east along hidden State Road 20. It also briefly carries U.S. Truck Route 221 until it reaches County Road 359A (Wright Road). US 221 terminates at US 98 along with that truck route, and the hidden route SR 55 joins the concurrency. In Bucell Junction, State Road 30 turns east State Road 30A near the Perry-Foley Airport. SR 30 turns east as it heads towards US 27 east of the Perry City Limits. and SR 55 becomes the sole secret designation. Later on, US 19-98-ALT 27 enters Tennille, where it intersects with State Road 51. After this the road crosses the Steinhatchee River as it enters Dixie County and begins to make less of a southerly turn and more of an easterly one. The rest of the way, US 98 passes through small towns such as Shamrock where it intersects County Road 358 twice. The road starts making more of an east turn after this and shortly afterwards encounters CR 351 in Cross City, and then State Road 349 and CR 349 in Old Town, which used to be U.S. Route 129 Alternate. It even contains a Truck Weight station in the median before it follows the left bank of the Suwannee River and intersects the eastern terminus of County Road 55A, before it crosses the Joe H. Anderson Sr. Bridge over the Suwannee River. After this it enters Fanning Springs, where it runs along the border of Gilchrist and Levy Counties. US 19-ALT 27-98 makes a sharp right turn after the intersection of State Road 26 and finally enters Levy County entirely. South of there US 98 continues its pattern of having a limited number of left-turn lanes in the center-median. Recent development in the area may lead to the addition of such turn lanes. In Chiefland, US 19-98-Alt 27 has a brief hidden concurrency with State Road 320. The hidden route is exposed as SR 320 turns west into Manatee Springs State Park. Later it encounters an intersection with the southern terminus of US 129. Almost instantly, Alternate US 27 leaves US 19-98 onto hidden SR 500 as it heads towards Bronson and Williston. This intersection was transformed into a 90-degree intersection, which directly faces a local high school. From there, US 19-98 runs along an abandoned railroad line along the east side, while the median is widened and lined with the trees that existed before the road was ever built. Blinking signals exist over the intersection with State Road 24 in Otter Creek, and at some point south of there, an overlap with CR 336 begins. At the intersection of County Road 326 in Gulf Hammock, an old locomotive and caboose is on display, and eventually Goethe State Forest where ironically the wide, tree-lined median comes to an end before reaching an at- grade interchange with State Road 121 & County Road 336 in Lebanon Junction. Leaving the forest, the road crosses the Ten Mile Creek bridge South of Lebanon Junction, US 19-98 runs along sparse residences, trailer parks, a Florida Sheriff's Youth Facility, the Gulf Hammock Wildlife Management Area. Southbound US 19-98 as they cross the Withlacoochee River between Levy and Citrus Counties. US 19-98 eventually enters the city of Inglis, where it serves as the eastern terminus of CR 40A. A more important intersection is encountered deeper within the city, and that intersection happens to be its parent route County Road 40. West of US 19-98, CR 40 is named \\"Follow That Dream Boulevard\\" for the 1962 movie starring Elvis Presley. A small four-lane bridge carries US 19-98 across the Withlacoochee River as it crosses the Citrus-Levy-Citrus County Line. After running between a pair of trailer parks and a sand mine, it approaches a much larger bridge. The Cross Florida Barge Canal was the last section of US 19 that is two lanes wide in Citrus County. A new four-lane divided bridge was completed by FDOT in the early-2010s, which was originally planned in conjunction with the proposed Suncoast Parkway extension to Red Level. Before reaching the potential site of this interchange, it runs by a field where American Civil War re-enactments are staged lies just north of the back entrance to a local quarry, which is across from the western terminus of County Road 488. The quarry obstructs a former segment of US 19-98, as does the territory for the Crystal River Nuclear Power Plant. South of there US 19-98 passes by sparsely located hotels, bars, houses, cluster developments and signs advertising locally prepared peanuts, and in between also passes by the Seven Rivers Regional Medical Center. As the road approaches a car dealership on the northwest corner of West State Park Drive, a local road leading to Crystal River Preserve State Park one truly begins to feel that he or she has entered the City of Crystal River, since it then passes by the Crystal River Mall, and the divider ends as US 19-98 becomes a four-lane undivided boulevard. It then curves east as it passes by some more motels and restaurants on the water across from City Hall then approaches County Road 495 (North Citrus Avenue). East of this intersection, it crosses the Cross Town Trail, a small rail-trail that was once an Atlantic Coast Line Railroad line spanning from Homosassa through Dunnellon. The road starts to curve south again, just north of the intersection of State Road 44, but it also has a hidden concurrency with SR 44 south of that point. From Northeast First Terrace a divided and some bicycle lanes begin once again. A black US 98 shield used in Florida until 1993. At the intersection of County Road 44W, the road changes from a six-lane rural divided highway to a four- lane divided highway. The road leaves the city limits south of the Crystal River Airport, and from there US 19-98 passes the intersection of Ozello Trail (CR 494), then serves as the location of a series of car dealerships, local garages, a Moose Lodge, and other businesses. Within Homosassa Springs, the division temporarily ends at Faust Lane across from a bowling alley. The road becomes a four-lane undivided highway with a continuous center left-turn lane, then it overlaps County Road 490. CR 490A terminates at the three-route concurrency with US 19-98-CR 490. South of there, the road passes over a small creek and approaches the Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park on the west side. Just after the road becomes divided again, the CR 490 concurrency comes to an end, as CR 490 moves onto West Yulee Road and US 19/98 curves to the southeast. Occasionally, some parcels of land that are part of the Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge turn up, but most of the surroundings involve random commercially zoned land. The pattern of sporadic median openings without left-turn lanes resumes, even near a trailer park where such turn lanes would be most useful. It is here that the road turns south again and passes by a popular local flea market. The last developed neighborhood encountered along US 19-98 is deed-restricted community named Sugarmill Woods. Nevertheless, sporadic rural businesses and even residential properties turn up along the sides of the road and the median openings without left-turn lanes continue until the road approaches a Publix shopping center and an abandoned Shell gas station and convenience store in Chassahowitzka. US 98 leaves US 19 at the intersection with County Road 480, which also overlaps US 98 briefly before branching out on its own towards Floral City. =Chassahowitzka through Polk County= As US 98 breaks away from US 19 at the corner of the Publix in Chassahowitzka, it joins hidden State Road 700, which is momentarily overlapped with County Road 480 before that county road makes a left turn to the northeast towards Floral City. A large portion of this segment of US 98 is a four-lane divided highway though the Citrus-Hernando County Line. After crossing the county line, it meets the current terminus of the Suncoast Parkway, as well as the accompanying Suncoast Trail. The divided section ends between the World Woods Golf Club and the entrance to a Hernando County Landfill. At that point, the road becomes a two-lane undivided highway and runs through Northern Hernando County mining country. Along the way it intersects two county roads at blinker lights. The first is at Deschamps Corner called County Road 491(Citrus Way), a bi-county road spanning north and south from CR 484 north of Spring Hill to Lecanto, Beverly Hills, Holder, and Stokes Ferry in Citrus County. The next is County Road 476(Lake Lindsey Road), another bi-county road spanning east and west from US 19 north of Weeki Wachee through Bushnell, Florida in Sumter County. Southeast of that intersection, it also crosses a former railroad mining spur leading to the CSX Brooksville Subdivision. Just east of a pair of truck weigh stations is the northern terminus of County Road 485, which serves as the beginning of US Truck Route 98. After moving over some steep hills and passing a branch of the Pasco- Hernando Community College as well as a Florida State Trooper police station, US 98 briefly becomes a four-lane divided highway again at Yontz Boulevard, only to resume its status as a two-lane road as it enters the City of Brooksville. There, the road passes by some local industry, including the garage for Hernando ParaTransit and the county bus system, and then faces an un-gated at-grade crossing with the CSX Brooksville Subdivision. Just before the intersection of West Jefferson Avenue (SR 50A), US 98 has a divide that cuts off the intersection of Fort Dade Avenue (County Road 484). The route then turns east and joins SR 50A in a concurrency, while SR 700 continues south along Ponce De Leon Boulevard. Shortly after this new concurrency, it makes a right along North Mildred Avenue, for eastbound traffic only, and both merge with US 41. Between North Mildred Avenue and May Avenue, eastbound SR 50A, US 41, and US 98 are concurrent along Broad Street, while westbound SR 50A, US 41, and US 98 are concurrent along East Jefferson Avenue, then West Jefferson Avenue. US 41 reunites with Broad Street at North Mildred Avenue. This one-way configuration for Broad Street and Jefferson Street has been in effect since November 1993, according to the Florida Department of Transportation. While both segments go up and down steep hills in the heart of the city, the Broad Street (eastbound) section runs over an old railroad bridge over the CSX Brooksville Subdivision, built in 1936. US 98 continues to overlap SR 50A and US 41 through downtown Brooksville, then makes a sharp right turn off of US 41 onto East Jefferson Street near the May-Stringer House and former Rogers Christmas House. The US 98-SR 50A concurrency continues through the eastern terminus of SR 50A into the west end of a concurrency with SR 50 and hidden route 700, which US 98 becomes concurrent with once again. From there, the speed limit increases to 60 miles per hour as US 98/SR 50 runs southeast through farmland and wooded swampland, then turns straight east again when it runs between a pair of lakebeds before the intersection with CRs 484 and 541. At that point, the road moves up and down a series of hills but first passes by communities such as Rolling Acres and Hill 'n Dale. The hills continue along the road, but along more farms and sparsely populated areas, along with at least one church and later a trailer park. Entering the unincorporated community of Ridge Manor West, the road approaches some hotels, gas stations and restaurants serving motorists and tourists on Interstate 75. US 98-SR 50 is the only interchange along I-75 in Hernando County, and the left-turn lanes leading to the on-ramps are notoriously short. Directly east of I-75 is a development that shares the community's namesake as well as one shopping center. US 98-SR 50 both cross over the Withlacoochee River in Ridge Manor. The road takes one last drop, only to rise again and officially enter Ridge Manor at the intersection of Kettering Road and Croom-Rital Road which leads to a trailhead for the Withlacoochee State Trail US 98-SR 50 pass under a bridge for this trail. At the crossing over the Withlacoochee River, two former sections of the road exist on the east side of the river; Paul N. Steckle Lane, and Ridge Manor Boulevard. The shorter Paul N. Steckle Lane exists on the north side and contains a Hernando County Firehouse, local residences, and one entrance to the Cypress Lake Preserve. Ridge Manor Boulevard begins on the south side, and crosses over to the north side east of the firehouse and west of the Hernando County Eastside Solid Waste Convenience Station. When SR 50 continues east and narrows down to two lanes toward Clermont, Orlando, and Titusville, US 98 turns southeast and also narrows down to two lanes even as it crosses the Withlacoohcee River for the second time, this time at the Hernando-Pasco County Line, entering Trilby. The first major intersection is a blinker-light intersection with County Road 575, but a far more important one is with US 301 in Trilacoochee, where it shares yet another concurrency running south. South of this point, US 98-301 passes by the Owensboro Junction Trailhead, of the Withlacoochee State Trail. This was once a former junction between the Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line Railroads, until both were merged into the Seaboard Coast Line and the segments that crossed Routes 98 and 301 were abandoned. From that point, the road runs up and down a series of hills where it passes by some small motels, local auto repair shops, trailer parks, farms, a Moose Lodge, a local golf course, and a drive-in movie theater. The road officially enters Dade City in the vicinity of the aforementioned drive-in theater, and passes by the Pioneer Florida Museum right next to a former citrus plant. Across from the south end of that plant is the intersection with eastern County Road 578, and shortly afterwards veers to the left at an at-grade interchange onto the former US 98-301 Truck Bypass, which was converted into mainline US 98-301 in 2007. The former segment of US 98-301 is now SR 39 as well as hidden state routes hidden SRs 35-700 and runs into downtown Dade City. US 98-301 moves closer to the CSX Wildwood Subdivision (part of the S-Line), where it encounters the eastern terminus of SR 52 and the Dade City Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Depot. At County Road 35 Alternate, US 98-301 turns from southeast to southwest as it moves back towards another at-grade interchange with the former \\"Business\\" US 98-301, and runs straight south again onto a four-lane divided highway. After the intersection with County Road 52 Alternate in Clinton Heights, US 98 branches off to the southeast taking hidden SR 35 and 700 with it, while US 301(SR 39) continues south towards Zephyrhills, Hillsborough River State Park, and eventually the Manatee-Bradenton-Sarasota area. The road climbs various hills, and includes random farms and trailer parks. The road has another encounter with both CR ALT 35 and the Wildwood Subdivision near Ellerslie, at a bridge over both, and an unnumbered interchange with the former of these two. Continuing southeast, the road encounters fewer farms and approaches the western edges of the Green Swamp, where it encounters the northernmost bridge over the Hillsborough River, which is nothing more than an elevated culvert. At the Pasco-Polk County Line, the road becomes the eastern terminus of County Road 54, and then the southern terminus of State Road 471. =Polk County through Okeechobee= Running southeast from the Pasco-Polk border, US 98 remains rural, but eventually becomes more suburban as it enters communities such as Providence, where the road turns straight south, becomes a divided highway, and serves as the northern terminus of County Road 35A, a suffixed alternate of hidden SR 35 leading through Kathleen. Farther south the road becomes the official eastern terminus of County Road 582, a bi-county extension of State Road 582 in Hillsborough and Pinellas County, which for the time being runs east then curves back around to another intersection farther south. US 98 officially enters Lakeland, then the road curves southeast again before the interchange with Interstate 4 (Exit 32), after this interchange CR 582 is encountered again at the intersection of Griffin Road. 9/10 of a mile later, the road turns straight south and becomes North Florida Avenue. According to the Florida Department of Transportation, the northern terminus of State Road 563 can be found at 10th Street, in spite of the fact that signage for that road can only be found at the next major intersection, U.S. Route 92, which until 2005 was also the west end of a brief concurrency with US 98 east to Lake Parker Avenue. Since then the route has been rerouted south along North Florida Avenue until it reaches the intersection of State Road 37 and State Road 548, where US 98 turns east onto SR 548. US 98/SR 548 curves from east to southeast over a bridge over the two railroad lines that feed into Lakeland Amtrak station just west of this bridge, and follows the southwest side of one of those lines which leads to Miami. The first intersection at ground level south of this bridge is East Main Street (former U.S. Route 92 Business). The next major intersection is Lake Parker Avenue (hidden SR 700) and Hollingsworth Road where SR 548 terminates and SR 700 rejoins US 98 as the hidden route once again. Long after passing the southwestern shore of Lake Bonny, US 98/SRs 35/700 encounters the southern terminus of State Road 659 (former SR 33A). Shortly after this intersection, the road prepares to leave the Lakeland city limits beneath the partial cloverleaf interchange with Polk Parkway at Exit 10, which contains loop ramps only from US 98. This interchange is within a mere block of the western terminus of State Road 540, although that route secretly has a concurrency with US 98 until it reaches Highland City, and moves to the west as County Road 540. CR 630/US 27/US 98 intersection, looking south Southwest of Lake Hancock, the road begins to skirt the borders of Bartow, first along a residential area on the west side, then south from there around the vicinity of Bartow Regional Medical Center. The road doesn't fully enter that city until the intersection of Lyle Parkway, where it turns from southeast to straight south once again. US 98 intersects SR 60 which also has a hidden concurrency with CR 555. SR 700 continues straight south into downtown Bartow as CR 700, while US 98 turns east along SR 60. SR 60 branches off to the southeast while US 98/SR 35/SR 555 continues straight east and later intersects US 17, where SR 555 becomes the hidden route for US 17 north into Haines City, while US 98/SR 35 turns south at the beginning of a concurrency. After running over a bridge for SR 60 and a railroad line, US 17-98 encounters CR 700 at Main Street (former SR 60), and SR 700 becomes a hidden route along US 98 again. The rest of the way through southern Bartow, US 17/98 remains mostly a commercial strip, but this status begins to diminish around the intersection of South Clear Springs Road. Eventually it enters the unincorporated community of Homeland which contains an intersection with CR 640, where to the east of this you'll find the Mosaic Peace River Park. In Fort Meade US 98/SR 700 leaves US 17/SR 35 and turns east again, secretly taking CR 630 with it. All three routes leave Fort Meade at the bridge over the Peace River where it becomes Frostproof Boulevard. In this segment, US 98/SR 700/CR 630 has two sharp reverse curves to the south and east, the first being near Pleasant Grove Cemetery, and a much larger one near Lake Hendry Road. After these curves, the route remains relatively straight west and east and after crossing the CSX Railroad Line that is used by Amtrak's Silver Star and Silver Meteor lines it reaches US 27 in West Frostproof, where it turns south once again onto yet another US route concurrency. County Road 630 continues to the east. From here, the hidden routes are SR 25 and SR 700. US 27/US 98 at Lake Lillian Drive, looking south Within Frostproof itself, US 27/98 makes a reverse curve onto a bridge over the same CSX line that serves the Silver Star and Silver Meteor, and then enters an unincorporated community named Sunray Deli Estates, where the route first encounters State Road 17, a scenic Florida Highway that was designated US Alternate 27 until 1999. However, the route continues as county extension to the southwest that loops right back to US 27/98. South of here, US 98 carries hidden state routes (SRs 17, 25 and 700) into Highlands County until it reaches Avon Park, where SR 17 (another former US Alternate 27) breaks away again at the eastern terminus of State Road 64, and runs relatively parallel to US 27 until it reaches Sebring. SR 64 continues east along part of SR 17 as a bi-county extension northeast into Polk County which runs through Lake Wales Ridge State Forest and terminates at the Avon Park Air Force Range. US 27/98 meanwhile, continues to run south to southeast along the shores of Lake Glenda where it passes through South Florida Community College territory, and then Lake Sebring and Lake Jackson. Curving to the east around the southern shores of Lake Jackson, the route encounters a wye intersection in Sebring, where the second southern terminus of State Road 17 can be found. The commercial zoning that has lined US 27/98 since Avon Park begins to diminish south of Sebring, but doesn't completely disappear. US 98 and hidden SR 700 leaves US 27 at the eastern terminus of State Road 66, thus joining the Florida Cracker Trail in the process, while US 27/SR 25 continue southbound towards Miami. Running east, this segment of US 98 is two lanes wide, and shortly after leaving a concurrency with US 27 encounters another with another CR 17, this time a county spur of SR 17 that spans from north of Lake Henry to Sebring. For the time being, US 98 takes CR 17 around the southern shores of Red Beach Lake, and lets go of the concurrency before it stops running along that lake. East of here, it encounters a grade crossing with the CSX line that carries the Silver Star and Silver Meteor yet again, just before intersecting the road that leads to both Sebring Regional Airport and Sebring International Raceway. After these two sites, the road runs along the north shore of Lake Istokpoga, where it passes through Lorida. Beyond the lake, the road serves as the northern terminus of CR 621, but later enters the barely existing unincorporated community of Fort Basinger as it encounters the northern terminus of CR 721, while making a sharp curve to the northeast to cross a bridge over the Kissimmee River where it crosses the Highlands-Okeechobee County Line. Momentarily running northeast, the first moderate intersection that US 98 encounters is a segment of County Road 68 in Basinger, where it curves southeast and shares yet another concurrency. Along the way, two county suffixed alternates of hidden SR 700 can be found, first 700B, which leads to Basinger Cemetery, and then 700A, which leads to the Basigner Fire Tower and CR 724. The Florida Cracker Trail branches off to the northeast at CR 68, which eventually leads to its state designation in Fort Pierce. Meanwhile, US 98 continues to run south through rural Okeechobee County, but the rural atmosphere of the road begins to disappear after CR 718, especially near the Okeechobee County Airport. The next major site is yet again a grade crossing with the CSX railroad line that carries the Amtrak Silver Star through Okeechobee station. Between Northwest Fifth and Northwest Fourth Streets, US 98 finally turns straight south, only to encounter a major intersection with State Road 70, where it turns left into another concurrency, running east and officially entering the City of Okeechobee. After crossing a railroad spur leading to the vicinity of the Amtrak station, US 98 leaves SR 70 at the intersection of U.S. Route 441, where it turns south. =Lake Okeechobee to Palm Beach Area= US 98/441 prepares to run along the coast of Lake Okeechobee at the eastern terminus of SR 78 south of Okeechobee. US 98/441 runs straight south out of the Okeechobee City Limits, along with its hidden state roads 700 and 15 respectively. This trajectory continues until the routes reach Eagle Bay and the road encounters a T-intersection with State Road 78 on the northern shores of Lake Okeechobee. There, US 98/441 makes a sharp left turn to the northeast and then the southeast as it runs along the east side of the lake as well as the levee system protecting the coast. Along this segment, the two hidden state roads aren't exactly as hidden as they are in other parts of the state. Two suffixed alternate routes of hidden State Road 15 can be found in Up-the-Grove Junction before the route enters Martin County, where it remains along the east side of the lake. As the route enters Port Mayaca, the road crosses a bridge over the St. Lucie Canal that returns to ground level at the interchange with State Road 76. Shortly after this, US 98/441 crosses the Martin-Palm Beach County line just north of a Florida East Coast Railroad grade crossing with no signs indicating the location of the border. Winding around the shores of the lake, the road eventually turns to the southwest. In Canal Point, US 98/441 is named Lakeshore Drive and briefly curves to the east from Lakeshore Drive to West Main Street. A block later, SR 700 breaks away from US 98 for the fourth and final time at a blinker-light intersection, where the two U.S. Routes, as well as not-so-hidden SR 15, make a right onto East Main Street and resumes it southwest run along the coast of Lake Okeechobee, or at least within close range of the levees. The road keeps the name East Main Street well into its entry into City of Pahokee, where it serves as the northern terminus of State Road 729, which was once a segment of State Road 15A. The FEC line that runs along this segment has a grade crossing southwest of this, and runs parallel to that route. Though not necessarily state or county roads, some of the more prominent intersections in town include Larrimore Road and South Barfield Highway. Further downtown, the road makes a left turn to the south from Main Street to Lake Avenue and a block later serves as the northern terminus of State Road 715 across from the Pahokee City Hall, which also continues onto East First Street. At the intersection of McClure Road, Lake Avenue curves to the east and becomes East Seventh Avenue. Aside from South Barfield Highway, every other intersection with this segment is a residential street. East 7th Avenue then curves from east to south at another FEC grade crossing on the southwest corner of the southern terminus of State Road 729 near the western terminus of CR 717. South of that point, the road is named Belle Glade Road and later makes another reverse curve to the west and south again along the east side of that FEC line before eventually approaching Belle Glade. Before reaching the city limits though, US 98/441 makes a sharp left turn to the east at the intersection of the Hooker Highway, where State Road 80 joins the route, while SR 15 continues south along westbound SR 80. Eastern terminus in Palm Beach Between Belle Glade and Loxahatchee, US 98/441/SR 80 are surrounded by sugarcane fields. In Twenty Mile Bend, State Road 700 ends at US 98, and later CR 880 terminates at the route. Lion Country Safari marks the beginning of a rural to urban transition of the road for the remainder of its journey. The road doubles from four to eight lanes in Royal Palm Beach, as the road serves as the border between Royal Palm Beach and Wellington. At the State Road 7 interchange, US 441 turns south towards Miami. The South Florida Fairgrounds and the Coral Skys Amphitheatre, where the South Florida Fair takes place, are next on the route, just east of SR 7. After passing Florida's Turnpike, it gains two more lanes and becomes an expressway, with diamond interchanges with Jog Road, Haverhill Road and Military Trail. East of Military Trail, it loses a lane in each direction as it straddles the southern end of Palm Beach International Airport, where private aircraft are serviced, with commercial access to the airport available via SR 704A. It then approaches a bridge over the Tri-Rail main line as it intersects the service roads for I-95 at Exit 68, then becomes a four-lane road in several older, high-density neighborhoods in West Palm Beach. East of the Florida East Coast Railroad Main Line bridge crossing, it intersects US 1 and SR 5, reducing to two lanes as it crosses Lake Worth Lagoon on two bridges, and ending on a roundabout with SR A1A in Palm Beach near the Mar-a-Lago estate, which is next to the southern terminus of US 98 at SR A1A, in Palm Beach.Google Inc.

History=Conners Highway= US 98, on the north side of Lake Okeechobee, looking west towards the intersection with SR 78 Prior to the designation of US 98 in Florida, sections of the route in the southern part of the state were part of the Conners Highway. The Conners Highway or W. P. Conners Highway was a privately built toll road from West Palm Beach, Florida to Okeechobee, Florida, and a free continuation of the road to Tampa, Florida. It cost $2 million to build across the swamps at the outskirts of the Everglades. The toll section had three toll booths, at 20 Mile Bend, Canal Point and south of Okeechobee. It was opened on July 4, 1924. The last section of the full route to be paved, from Okeechobee to Sebring, was paved in 1925. A toll of $1.50 per car and driver, and 50 cents extra per passenger, was charged at each toll booth. The route also included the Williams Ferry across the Kissimmee River west of Okeechobee, which charged 50 cents. The highway was advertised as a cross-state alternate to the unpaved Tamiami Trail, also part of the west mainline of the Dixie Highway. Parts of it, including the tolled section, were used as the South Florida Connector of the Dixie Highway. Tolls were removed on June 10, 1930. =The early years of US 98= US 98 was first commissioned in 1934 and its entire route was within Florida, running from Pensacola to Apalachicola but over a route quite different from its current path. A US 98 shield used in Florida from 1956 to the 1993 =Eastward extension= In 1951, the eastern end was extended to its present terminus in Palm Beach, Florida. Much of this extension was (and is) concurrent with other US routes.Dale Sanderson. End of US highway 98 at USEnds.com From Apalachicola, it followed the path of US 319 to Wakulla (which it was then cosigned with), then along new State Road 30 across the lower Big Bend to Perry. From 1952-54, while this section was being built, Temporary US 98 ran from Wakulla to Tallahassee on US 319, and then along US 27 east to Perry. From Perry, US 98 was extended southward concurrently with US 19 for over to near Chassahowitzka where it was routed southeastward to Brooksville and eastward on State Road 50 to near Trilby where it left Route 50 and turned south. US 98 met US 301 south of Trilby and was extended southward concurrently with US 301 to south of Dade City where it followed State Road 35 to Fort Meade, joined by US 17 at Bartow. From Fort Meade, US 98 turned eastward to a junction with US 27 at West Frostproof from where it followed US 27 concurrently southward. From DeSoto City, US 98 was again sent east along the path of State Road 66 to State Road 70 near Okeechobee and then along Road 70 into Okeechobee. From there, US 98 was routed concurrently with the then recently extended US 441 to Canal Point. From Canal Point, it replaced State Road 716 to the junction with US 441 at Twenty Mile Bend and then followed the path of US 441 and State Road 80 to its terminus at Palm Beach. The final sections from Canal Point to Palm Beach were designated Temporary US 98 until the early 1960s, because a relocation was planned via SR 710 through Indiantown.Panama City News Herald, McKethan Makes Announcement: U.

Several of these involved the construction of bypass routes (in Panama City, Dade City, Lakeland, and Bartow) or straightening alignments (near Lakeland and Bartow). Around 1990, US 441 was realigned onto new road from north of Belle Glade to Twenty Mile Bend and, by the late 2000s, US 98 was transferred to this route as well, the most significant rerouting of US 98 in Florida in nearly half a century. The former path of US 98 from Canal Point is now signed as State Road 700 north of the junction with US 98/US 441 and County Route 700 south of that to County Road 880. FDOT announced in January 2010, near the end of the Pensacola Bay Bridge's 50-year design life, that the bridge was structurally deficient and would have to be replaced within six years.\\"Pensacola Bay Bridge is 'structurally deficient,' must be replaced.\\" Northwest Florida Daily News, January 21, 2010.

As of 2011, a study is underway to determine the \\"feasibility, location, and conceptual design\\" of a replacement bridge.Pensacola Bay Bridge PD&E; Study Accessed May 24, 2011. As of February 2013, plans have begun to replace the bridge with construction beginning within two years, at a cost of $595.6 million, on a course slightly to the west of the existing bridge. The new bridge, like the current one, will not charge a toll.Sen. Don Gaetz: No toll for Pensacola Bay Bridge Accessed February 1, 2013. As of February 2020, construction of the new bridge is complete with only the pedestrian portion to be completed with the old bridge being dismantled to make way for the parallel bridge to begin construction. However, just months later during Hurricane Sally on September 15-16, 2020, a barge got stuck under the bridge before a crane fell onto one span of the bridge; this knocked almost the entire span into Pensacola Bay, rendering the bridge completely unusable.

It runs from Chiefland north to the Georgia State Line in Levy, Gilchrist, Suwannee, and Hamilton Counties. The secret designation for US 129 in Florida, between Chiefland and Hildreth is SR 49 (SR 49). Between Hildreth and Branford, it follows SR 20, between Branford and Live Oak, it follows SR 249, between Live Oak and Jasper, it follows SR 51, between Hillcoat and Jasper, it follows SR 25, and between Hillcoat and the Georgia border, it follows SR 100\\\\. The only signed concurrencies that exist are with US 27 between Hildreth and Branford, with US 41 between Hillcoat and Jasper, and with SR 6 in Jasper. Route description=Levy and Gilchrist Counties= US 129 begins just northwest of the southeastern terminus of the US 19-98-27 ALT concurrency in Chiefland. The road is concurrent with hidden SR 49, running northeast until it reaches Northwest 30th Avenue and turns straight north where it remains through the rest of Levy County. A few blocks after crossing the Levy- Gilchrist County line, US 129 enters the City of Trenton, where it curves briefly to the northeast at Southwest 10th Avenue, only to return directly north at the northern terminus of County Road 339 where the road becomes South Main Street, which contains such historic sites as the Trenton Church of Christ and the Gilchrist County Courthouse. The four corners of Trenton can be found at SR 26, which becomes West Wade Street on the west side and East Wade Street on the east side, while US 129 changes from South Main Street to North Main Street. Further north in the vicinity of Fourth Avenue and Lancaster Avenue the former Atlantic Coast Line Depot serves as the trailhead of the Trenton-Newberry Rail Trail. At a fork in the road, SR 47 branches off to the northeast toward Lake City, while US 129 turns to the northwest. North of the Trenton City Limits, US 129 passes by the Trenton Fire Tower near Joppa Lake. After the intersection with CR 344, the road turns straight north again at CR 307, just south of the Sam Whet Farms Airport. In the Town of Bell, the only major intersection is CR 342, which runs west to CR 341, although the northern border of the town is at the intersection of Northwest 20th Street, which is CR 236, and also leads to CR 341\\\\. North of the town limits, the road intersects CR 340, which is a tri-county road spanning from SR 349 in northeastern Dixie County to Monteocha in Alachua County. The last routed intersection with US 129 in Gilchrist County is CR 138, but the last intersection in general is Northwest 117th Place, which is just south of the bridge over the Santa Fe River, where it enters Suwannee County. =Suwannee County, including Branford and Live Oak= From the Santa Fe River Bridge, the first intersection is 296th Street, and all subsequent intersections are equally minor until it reaches Hildreth, where it crosses the Suwannee River Greenway Trail,Suwannee River Greenway Trail then encounters the east end of a concurrency with US 27 (hidden SR 20) which is also the northern terminus of SR 49 and the southern terminus of CR 49\\\\. US 27-129 and the trail enter the hamlet of Wachtokha, but the trail remains straight while the road curves slightly to the northwest. A slight curve to the southwest is where both routes officially enter Branford, Florida where US 129 turns north onto Hidden SR 249, while US 27 continues west across the Frank R. Norris Bridge over the Suwannee River into Grady towards Mayo, Perry, Tallahassee, and beyond. North of US 27, the first major intersection is SR 247, which takes motorists northeast to western Lake City. The Suwannee River Greenway returns to the west side of US 129 as both leave the Branford City Limits, but makes a sharp left turn at the intersection of CR 248, which follows the south side of that road into a dead end at Little River Springs. The same abandoned railroad line that was originally owned by Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and used by that trail continues to hug the west side of US 129 until it enters McAlpin. Between 170th Terrace and Aven Road, the road veers to the right and then curves back in the opposite direction as it climbs an embankment for a bridge over the previously mentioned abandoned railroad line. After descending from this bridge, it intersects with a brief concurrency with CR 252, Between the end of this concurrency and 144th Street, it curves straight north again. Within the historic City of Live Oak the road is named Ohio Avenue, and continues to run in a straight south-to-north line. But at 111th Street, hidden SR 249 is officially joined by SR 51, which also includes a multiplex with CR 136\\\\. It is at this point the street begins to shift to the northeast. Roughly two blocks later, the road encounters CR 10A(Helvenston Street Southeast). Further downtown it becomes the location for the Old Live Oak Post Office, and later, the Suwannee County Courthouse. The official end of the US 129/SR 51/SR 136/SR 249 concurrency is at US 90(hidden SR 10), where SR 249 joins westbound US 90 for four blocks until it reaches Houston Avenue. As with Trenton, the intersection serves as the city's four corners, because US 129's name changes from South Ohio Avenue to North Ohio Avenue, and US 90's name changes from West Howard Street to East Howard Street. One block later, it crosses the railroad tracks where the historic Union Depot and Atlantic Coast Line Freight Station can be found, and the Old Live Oak City Hall can be found on the next block. It is here where the concurrency with SR 136 ends at West Duval Street Northeast. Before leaving the city limits, the road finally becomes four lanes wide and eventually gains a divider. By this point, a series of motels, restaurants, and other travel facilities serve as an indicator that this area is designed to accommodate motorists from Interstate 10 (I-10), and sure enough the road finally approaches a diamond interchange with I-10 at Exit 283. The four lane divided segment finally ends north of there, although a right-of-way for a future northbound lane can be seen on the east side of the road for the equivalent of several blocks. The only intersection of note in this area is with the western terminus of CR 136A, a suffixed alternate of SR 136, which is also named \\"County Road 136 Scenic.\\" The road enters Suwannee Springs, where it meets the intersection with CR 132, and secretly takes it north. Just before crossing over the Suwannee River bridge and entering Hamilton County, not only does a former segment of the road veer off to the right and lead to an abandoned 1931-built bridge,Suwannee Springs Bridge - Built 1931 by Ben Tate (Panoramio) but a pair of truck weigh stations can be found on both sides of the road. US 129 winds to the left of the old bridge and then curves right over the river as it enters Hamilton County. =Hamilton County to the Georgia State Line= Unlike in Suwannee County, only a hint of the right-of-way of the former segment of US 129 can be found before the road turns straight north before letting go of its multiplex with CR 132, which runs east. Further north it enters the unincorporated community of Marion, where it serves as the eastern terminus of CR 158, but a far more important route is coming next. Though nowhere near as travel- convenient as near I-10, US 129 does approach a truck stop and a pair of quarter-cloverleaf interchanges on the southeast and northwest corners above I-75 at Exit 451. Beyond that, it passes through Hillcoat, which is the site of Hamilton County High School and later where US 129 joins US 41/hidden SRs 25 and 100. The newly concurrent routes briefly run straight north before making a reverse curve around the left side of Roberts Pond and Shaky Pond before entering the City of Jasper. US 41-129-SR 100 turns west onto SR 6(Hatley Street), which becomes CR 6 east of the intersection, while hidden SR 51 becomes CR 51 (Second Avenue Northeast) north of the same intersection. After Fifth Avenue, the road begins to curve to the northwest, and by 15th Avenue, the concurrency with US 41 and SRs 6 and 25 ends as those routes move to the west while US 129 curves off to the northwest, taking SR 100 away from US 41\\\\. Resuming its northward agenda, which US 41 will do further on, US 129/SR 100 runs through the forests of northern Florida interrupted by the occasional private house and farmland. The only real intersection of any significance it encounters is CR 148 in Rawls, where it also crosses the same Georgia Southern and Florida Railway line that followed US 41 from Lake City. North of there, farm fields become a more common site. Whatever farmland exists disappears near the intersection of a dirt road named Northwest 25th Drive, and the rest of the journey becomes pure forest land with occasional local dirt road intersections. This trend continues until one clearings near Northwest 13th Street. One more paved road intersects with US 129 in the form of CR 150 near Avoca, and just north of there the road crosses a bridge over Alligator Creek, and one last named intersection with Northwest 86th Avenue. After passing by one last farm field, the surroundings become quite wooded and picturesque. Two last unnamed dirt roads intersect US 129 before the road prepares to curve straight north one last time and upon completing the turn finally crosses the Florida‚ÄìGeorgia State line where SR 100 comes to an end, and Georgia State Route 11 begins. The border is defined by an intersection with an unnamed dirt road on the east side. History A US 129 shield used in Florida prior to 1993 Always a spur of US 29, which begins much further west in Pensacola, US 129 entered Florida in 1941 in Jasper. By 1948, it went further south along US 41 to Hillcoat, where it branched off toward Live Oak and Branford, where it turned right along a brief wrong-way concurrency with US 27 over the Suwannee River and then turned south towards its former terminus at Old Town. Eleven years later, the segment south of Branford would be rerouted in the proper direction along US 27 and make a right turn along SR 49 toward Trenton and Chiefland, while the old US 129 would become US 129 Alternate (see below). The 1931-built Suwannee Springs Bridge was abandoned in 1971, and replaced with the current bridge when US 129 was realigned.Suwannee Springs Bridge (Bridgehunter.com) Until US 27 Alternate was widened and the intersection with US 19-98 was redesigned in the early 21st century, US 129 also intersected with the south end of the US 19-98-27 ALT concurrency, as well as the west end of SR 500\\\\. Major intersectionsRelated routes U.S. Route 129 Alternate (US 129 ALT) was a former segment of US 129 that ran from Old Town to Branford, almost entirely on the west side of the Suwannee River. The road began at US 19-98-27 ALT in Old Town and ran north to US 27(SR 20) in Grady, where it turned east as both roads crossed the Suwannee River. US 129 ALT terminated at US 129, which joined US 27 until it reached Hildreth. Today the segment between Old Town and Grady is SR 349, while the segment between Grady and Branford is simply US 27\\\\.

It runs from Perry northwest to the Georgia State Line in Taylor, Madison and Jefferson Counties. The entire route is inventoried by FDOT as the northern section of unsigned State Road 55. A short overlap with US 90 exists in Greenville. Route description U.S. Route 221 begins in the City of Perry at the intersection of US 19-98-Alt 27 at the northern terminus of CR 361A. US Truck Route 221 also begins at this intersection, but runs along US 19-98-ALT 27. North of the terminus of CR 335, the road narrows down to two lanes at the intersection of US 27, which includes another leg of the truck detour. North of US 27, Route 221 crosses a bridge over Spring Creek and then meets a pair of at-grade crossings with railroad line owned by Georgia and Florida Railroad, which leads to a branch of the Georgia Southern and Florida Railway further north. Nearby it passes by a former Live Oak, Perry and Gulf Railroad station and then the Perry City Hall, and more than several blocks north of that point crosses another bridge over Pimple Creek just south of the intersection of County Road 356 (Ash Street). Intersections north of the city limits include County Road 359A, which is also the northern terminus of US Truck Route 221, and later County Road 361. The aforementioned G&F; Railroad line meets up with the west side of US 221, but runs parallel with it throughout Taylor County, even as they both approach CR 14 (an extension of SR 14) in Shady Grove. US 221 and the G&F; Railway Line continue to run parallel to each other as they cross the Taylor-Madison County Line, and for the most part tends to intersect only local and private roads of no importance, until it approaches the western terminus of CR 360 (Moseley Hall Road). A local street named Open Sands Loop terminates at both ends of US 221, but the road moves away from the railroad line curving to the northeast just south of the northern terminus of this street. North of the western terminus of Former State Road 158, the road turns back north as becomes a divided highway where it meets the interchange with Interstate 10 at Exit 241, running beneath the interstate. As one would expect, the divided highway ends north of this interchange, and the road continues to wind through the woods of the panhandle of Florida. The brown US 221 shield used in Florida prior to 1993 Just before entering the Greenville Town Limits US 21 intersects with County Road 150. US 221 then crosses a former Seaboard Air Line Railroad line that was used by Amtrak Silver Meteor until 2005. The former SAL freight depot lies just to the east of the railroad crossing. As the road approaches the historic Bishop- Andrews Hotel, US 221 turns west onto US 90\\\\. Together US 90-221 passes by some local industry and the Haffye Hays Park, a local park that contains a memorial to Ray Charles. The routes cross the G&F; Railroad line it ran next to in Perry and Taylor County on the east side of Leggett Street, and a block later US 221 finally leaves US 90 to run north as it is intended to do. One last moderate intersection can be found outside of the town limits in the form of the southern terminus of County Road 140 (Old Equipment Road). North of there. CR 140 is encountered again, but it crosses the road heading to the east toward some cemeteries near CR 150. Upon crossing the Madison-Jefferson County Line, US 221 changes from the westernmost US route in Madison County, to the easternmost in Jefferson County. The only community resembling a major municipality within the county though is Ashville, and the only major street within the county is the eastern terminus of CR 146, but not the eastern terminus of Ashville Highway, which crosses over into Madison County. One last intersection with a private road north of Ashville can be found before US 221 finally crosses the Georgia State Line, where the road continues onto Georgia State Route 76, while hidden State Road 55 terminates.

It runs from Panama City north to the Alabama State Line in Bay and Jackson Counties. The entire route is also unsigned State Road 75 (SR 75), and is a four-lane highway throughout the state whether the road is divided or not. Route description=Panama City and Bay County= Looking south at US 231 north of Panama City U.S. Route 231 begins in Panama City at US Business Route 98 (Sixth Street) as a continuation of Harrison Avenue, which spans as far south as the Panama City Marina. Harrison Avenue runs straight north and south as far south as Fourth Street and serves as the point in the city where intersecting west-to-east streets change their names from \\"West ?th Street,\\" to \\"East ?th Street.\\" After crossing U.S. Route 98 (15th Street), US 231 intersects an at-grade railroad crossing with the Atlanta and Saint Andrews Bay Railway and moves onto a four-lane momentarily divided highway that runs parallel to that very crossing, while Harrison Avenue becomes State Road 391. For the rest of its journey through the state US 231 runs as a four-lane divided highway, except in specific towns and cities. After US 231 leaves Harrison Avenue, the tracks that run alongside the northbound lane are hidden by small trees. Sparse development exists on the opposite side which increases as the road moves north. One other intersection (East 19th Street) can be spotted between some shopping centers, and the first major intersection since Harrison Avenue which is State Road 77 (North Cove Boulevard), the northeast corner of which is occupied by the Panama City Mall. After this it intersects Edwards Drive, which while only a local road leading to an industrial area across the tracks, also has an intersection with Industrial Drive which is the address of the headquarters of Bay Line Railroad the company that inherited the A&SAB; railroad line running along US 231. North of there and some more local intersections it has an at-grade interchange with State Road 368 (East 23rd Street). Continuing at the same trajectory and intersecting another group of local streets, it briefly enters Hiland Park where it intersects SR/CR 389 and just north of this, the eastern terminus of County Road 2312 (East Baldwin Road), the. It is only after this point that the road becomes a divided highway, but remains along the same trajectory, and runs along that same railroad line even as it enters a formerly incorporated town known as Cedar Grove, where it becomes slightly less urban and eventually serves as the eastern terminus of State Road 390, and shortly after this, the southern terminus of County Road 2321 (formerly SR 77A). Still along the same trajectory, it has a short concurrency with County Road 2293 between Titus Road and John Pitts Road, the latter of the two which also contains County Road 2315 (former State Road 719). The road and the tracks cross bridges over Bayou George and enter the community named after the waterway. The closest road resembling a major intersection there is County Road 2301 (formerly State Road 167). Later Route 231 dips below the level of the railroad tracks around Wendy Street, but returns to the same level. Later it passes by an unfinished industrial park which includes such sites as the Coastal Helicopters Incorporated Heliport.Coastal Helicopters, Incorporated (Official Site) Bay County Correctional Facility can also be found near here. Further northeast the area becomes more rural, surrounded by much more forestland interrupted at first by a power line right-of-way and later by scattered local businesses dot the road further northeast. Around Nixon the road begins to curve more to the north, and the A&SAB; railroad tracks still remain parallel to the northbound lane. Most of the road at this point is surrounded by forests, farms, farm- related businesses, and small dirt roads. Though the intersection with Scotts Ferry Road is touted as a major intersection on Google Maps, in reality it is only another dirt road. US 231 remains a four-lane divided highway until it reaches Youngstown, and becomes a four-lane undivided highway with a continuous center-left-turn lane. The few intersections within this segment are local streets, one of which leads to a local FDOT facility. The closet thing resembling a major intersection within Youngstown is the eastern terminus of County Road 388, the vicinity of which is a school zone for a school along CR 388. The divider begins again at a dirt road named Pamela Lane that momentarily runs parallel to US 231 before making a right turn in front of a local lumber store. Surprisingly relevant to this, the rest of the journey is almost entirely timber country until a small truck stop and fast food restaurant can be spotted along the southbound lane in Fountain where the road intersects State Road 20. North of there, the A&SAB; railroad line branches away from US 231 to the northeast, but is encountered again as it makes a reverse curve over a pair of bridges over the tracks. This track runs parallel to a former segment of the road and returns to ground level at the Pine Lake RV Park.Pine Lake RV Park The former segment ends just south of the intersection with County Road 167 (formerly State Road 167) in Betts. CR 167 provides one last chance to enter neighboring Calhoun County. All other intersections at this point are local streets and dirt roads. The road moves northeast as it inches closer to the Bay-Calhoun County Line, but instead crosses the Bay-Jackson County Line just north of a power line right-of-way. =Jackson County= Whereas US 231 runs along the northeastern edge of Bay- Calhoun County Line as it left Bay County, it runs along the western edge of the Washington-Jackson County Line county as it enters Jackson County. What would appear to be a former segment of the road can be found between Freeman Road and Lakepoint Road, as it curves far away from Compass Lake, only to run along the east side of the same A&SAB; railroad line it ran along the west side of in most of Bay County. The north end of Lakepoint Road can be found at the shared intersection with Pikes Pond Road. North of there, the road moves away from the tracks again near a side road and former segment called \\"Blossom Loop\\" on the southbound side and enters Round Lake where the divider ends again. Blossom Loop ends at US 231 just south of the intersection with Felix Street, but another former segment named \\"Dryer Street\\" begins on the northbound side just north of the same intersection, although this former segment is shorter than the latter. Between Reddy Creek Road and Shores Road, the lake the community is named for is found on the east side of the road and the tracks move back to the west side of the road. The divider is revived again north of Estelle Street as the road leaves Round Lake. The surroundings in this segment are a repeat of the one south of Round Lake, but the divided section is short-lived however as it eventually approaches a bridge over Stump Creek entering Alford where the divider ends and the road becomes Georgia Street. Compared to the other communities north of Panama City, Alford is more developed and has more paved intersections, among them County Road 1656 (formerly State Road 276A). Three blocks later, the first of which includes the Alford Post Office, the concurrency with County Road 276 begins at the Park Avenue/Park Road intersection. The divider begins again at Little Valley Road. After curving away from the tracks across from Rowell Road, US 231 enters the community of Steele City, and CR 276 turns east onto Kynesville Road which becomes State Road 276 near Marianna. North of this is the eastern terminus of the western segment of County Road 280 (Corbin Road), which leads into Washington County. A surprisingly unusual full traffic signal can be found at the intersection of Green Circle Parkway, formerly Farren Ranch Road, a local street converted to the entrance to the Green Circle Bio-Energy Plant.Green Circle Bio Energy, Incorporated (Official Site) The tracks return to the west side of the road just south of Dilmore Road, and the northeast corner is the site of two major gas stations and truck stops meant for travelers on Interstate 10 at Exit 130 which is a quarter-cloverleaf interchange on the east side of the road, due to the presence of the A&SAB; railroad line that branches away again on the north side of this interchange. The road officially enters Cottondale just south of the intersection of Obert Road, the northwest corner of which also contains a dirt driveway to Cottondale Airport. Further north into Downtown Cottondale, the speed limit is reduced and the divider ends once again as the road becomes Main Street, although it remains four-lanes wide just south of the intersection of U.S. Route 90. North of US 90, the road runs briefly through a school zone and four blocks later intersects an at-grade crossing with the CSX P&A; Subdivision, which is just east of a junction with the A&SAB; railroad line. A block north at Front Street, the Cottondale Post Office is on the northwest corner. Roughly around Milton Street, the area becomes surprisingly residential with random local businesses such as farm stands churches. Just after Dogwood Drive, plastic pylons run along the double-solid line along the left-turn lane for County Road 169 then US 231 becomes a divided highway north of the city limits and curves to the northeast again. After an intersection with the entrance to a trailer park along the southbound lane, the road encounters two intersections with County Road 164 (Lovewood Road), the first of which is paved, and the next which is a dirt road, but nevertheless becomes a multiplex with numerous major highways in Marianna and points east. As the road descends slightly it crosses a power line right-of-way, the east side of which contains the end of an intersection that's not so important until you consider the fact that it has a connection with the next road. The right-of-way to an abandoned segment of US 231/SR 75 branches off to the northeast just south of the intersection with the northern terminus of State Road 73, then the road curves to the left and is reunited with the former right-of-way of US 231/SR 73 behind a ramshackle church made out of trailers and sheds. Farmland becomes more prevalent at this point than forest land. The farmland is briefly suspended just north of the intersection of Springfield Road, but begins to return to the area on the southeast corner of the intersection with County Road 162 (Main Street/Jacob Road), and opens up once again, although occasionally this farmland is interrupted by small random parcels of woodland. Between Misty Trail and New Bethel Road, Route 231 curves to the west where the divided highway ends just before another bridge over the A&SAB; railroad line as it enters Campbellton. Returning to ground level, the road then curves north as it approaches State Road 273. and a former section of State Road 2, both of which have local extensions cut off on the opposite sides of the intersections1953 Topographical Map of Campbellton, Florida (Historical Aerials Online) that were cut off at Route 231 and converted into dead end streets. Merely yards later in front of a large farm and feed warehouse, the road intersects State Road 2, the northwest corner of which contains the local post office. North of Campbellton, the road divides again for one last time north of Dothan Street as it curves around the west bank of Brantley Pond then returns to the same alignment after the intersection of Rambo Road. Though a Florida Welcome Center exists on the southbound lane which can also be accessed from the northbound lane, two last intersections exist in Florida; Dionne Road, a narrow dirt road that can only be accessed from the northbound lane, and A.M.E. Road, a paved intersection that runs west from same lane along the Florida-Alabama border. US 231 crosses the Alabama State Line a mere 144 feet north of that intersection,Google Map of US 231; A.M.E. Road to Florida-Alabama State Line which is also the northern terminus of State Road 75 and southern terminus of Alabama State Route 1. Major intersectionsHistory A US 231 shield used in Florida prior to 1993 US 231 was established in Florida in 1926, but the original southern terminus was in Marianna where the west end of the US 90/SR 73 concurrency is today. This would change in 1954 when it was rerouted to Panama City. Beginning in 1956, signs for U.S. Highways in Florida had different colors for each highway. The shield for US 231 was yellow with black lettering and a white outline, until the state was forced by the federal government to conform to standards that required consistent black-and-white signs in 1993. In the 1990s and early 21st Century, residents of Dothan, Alabama across the state line sought to transform US 231 into a spur of an interstate highway. This same proposal also included the upgrading of US 231 in Florida. The proposal was never implemented.

Route description=Sarasota through Hillsborough County= Looking north towards the US 41/301 concurrency in Sarasota US 301 begins its northward journey at an intersection with U.S. Route 41 along Washington Boulevard in Sarasota. The first state highway it intersects with is SR 780. On the Sarasota-Manatee County line, it also intersects with CR 610, which takes commuters from Ringling College of Art and Design, University of South Florida's Sarasota/Manatee Campus, New College of Florida, and Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport to Interstate 75. The next major intersection is SR 70, and after this, the road curves northwest before it eventually joins US 41(Hidden SR 55) again in southern Bradenton where they briefly overlap each other as they cross the Manatee River. US 301 makes a sharp right turn onto SR 43 at a diamond interchange, then crosses I-75 in Ellenton at Exit 224. Just north of the intersection of State Road 62, the road passes by the Florida Gulf Coast Railroad Museum and then intersects CR 683 (Moccasin Wallow Road). After the road crosses the Manatee-Hillsborough County Line, it passes by the Little Manatee River State Park, then intersects State Road 674, and shares a brief overlap with CR 672 between Balm Road and Big Bend Road. North of the intersection with Gibsonton Drive, and over the Alafia River in Riverview, Route 301 makes another turn to the northwest, where it crosses I-75 again near Brandon at Exit 254. Beyond that, all access to I-75 is available from roads that cross US 301 in one way or another, the nearest of which being the Lee Roy Selmon Expressway. Between I-75 and the Lee Roy Selmon, though US 301 serves as the eastern terminus of SR 676 (Causeway Boulevard), which takes motorists to US BUS 41. The first major intersection north of the Selmon Expressway though is SR 60. At Six Mile Creek, an overpass takes US 301 over the tracks of CSX's \\"A-line\\", one of the railroad company's main lines through Florida (also used by Amtrak's Silver Star passenger trains), and CR 574, which is only accessible from local connecting roads. It then crosses the first bridge over the Tampa Bypass Canal before intersecting SR 574 in East Lake-Orient Park. At the Florida State Fairgrounds, US 301 has an parclo interchange with Interstate 4 and U.S. Route 92 (SR 600). A reconstruction project took place in the early-2000s with provisions for a future ramp from westbound US 92, that are currently being obstructed by the Tampa Bypass Canal and land owned by the Vandenberg Airport. Near the northern end of Vandenberg Airport, US 301 crosses over a flood channel that runs between the Hillsborough River and Tampa Bypass Canal on the southern border of Temple Terrace. Between Temple Terrace and Thonotosassa, the hidden SR 43 leaves US 301 and joins County Road 580 at Harney Road, and the new hidden road becomes SR 41. Former sections of Harney Road are on hills on the northwest and northeast corners, both of which were designed to go around a former railroad bridge for a line that no longer exists. After crossing under I-75 with no access for the last time, and the Tampa Bypass Canal again shortly afterwards, US 301 encounters the eastern terminus of SR 582 and its hidden County extension, County Road 582. County Road 43 ends at US 301 in Thonotosassa along Harney Road, and US 301 loses more of its easterly trajection. Here, it serves as the northern terminus of Mango Road, and later Stacy Road, Sargeant Wilderness Memorial Park, and extension of Hillsborough River State Park. After passing by a field used for the Tampa Machinery Auctions, Route 301 officially runs along the eastern end of Hillsborough River State Park, which it will eventually enter. The same former railroad line that was encountered near Harney Road is visible along the east side of US 301 throughout the park and beyond. The last moderate intersection US 301 encounters before finally entering the park is the northern terminus of McIntosh Road. One residential area can be found on a minor side road off to the left, but the rest of the road is surrounded by parkland. US 301 leaves the park almost as instantly as it crosses the Pasco County line. =Pasco County= After US 301 enters Pasco County, a slight curve to the right is a clear indication that 301 is entering Zephyrhills. Here, the road is known as Fort King Highway and Gall Boulevard depending on the location. Across from the fields of Festival Park, US 301 serves as the eastern terminus of SR 56, and the first major intersection in Pasco County. The next intersection is with Chancey Road which eventually becomes County Road 535. SR 39 intersects with US 301 from the southeast. However, instead of terminating at Route 301, it becomes a hidden route north of the intersection and both roads head straight north again. This trajectory is short lived though when some local traffic is rerouted along 7th Street, and both roads intersect South Avenue before moving slightly northwest. On top of the hills between Dade City and Zephyrhills Downtown Zephyrhills is where US 301 serves as what would appear to be the eastern terminus of SR 54, even though Fifth Avenue continues east of SR 54. Originally SR 54 extended east of US 301 along Fifth Avenue and then to 12th Street before turning back east again at Eiland Boulevard. In more recent times however, some maps have indicated that it serves as a third hidden route along US 301. Southbound motorists on US 301 have been encouraged to access SR 54 through 6th Street in recent years. After North Avenue, US 301 curves to the northeast as SR 41 leaves Route 301 to the northwest as County Road 41, along Fort King Road. The rest of 301 is known as Gall Boulevard until it moves deep into Dade City. After the curve to the northeast ends the road intersects County Road 54, a county bypass and extension of SR 54 that leads to US 98 (SR 700) on the Pasco-Polk County line. From there, US 301 runs along a series of steep hills as a four-lane divided highway with median openings that lack left-turn lanes until it reaches US 98 and the US 98-301 overlap begins. Immediately after this, the road intersects County Road 52 Alternate in Clinton Heights (near Dade City). While some of the median openings are still missing left-turn lanes, and is briefly replaced by a center left-turn lane, the road becomes much more level at this point. In February 2007, US 98-301 was realigned to the former truck route, which is two lanes wide as of this writing. Efforts to widen the road to four lanes has met stiff opposition from both the public and the city. The former truck route and old US 98-301, which is now SR 39 as well as hidden state routes hidden SRs 35‚Äì700, split from each other at an at-grade interchange. A local east-west street takes motorists to southbound County Road 35 Alternate. At the intersection of ALT CR 35 itself, the road moves from northeast back to northwest again, and runs along the CSX S-Line, where it encounters the eastern terminus of SR 52 and the Dade City Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Depot. Owensboro Junction Trailhead US 98 & 301 reunite with the former route, near a former citrus plant. The first intersection after this is eastern County Road 578 and the next one is at the northern border of the former citrus plant that leads to the Pioneer Florida Museum. As with the segment between Zephyrhills and Dade City, the road is a hilly four-lane divided highway with median openings that lack left-turn lanes, but the hills aren't as steep, and the road isn't as straight. After passing by the drive-in movie theater, US 98-301 intersection with Payne Road which was part of the former County Road 35B, There are some trailer parks, a golf course, and small motels in this segment. A sure sign the segment is about to end, is when it passed by the Owensboro Junction Trailhead, of the Withlacoochee State Trail. This was once a former junction between the Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line Railroads, until both were merged into the Seaboard Coast Line and the segments that crossed Routes 98 & 301 were abandoned. US 98 leaves US 301 in Trilacoochee, veering to the northwest and taking hidden State Roads 39 and 700 with it. State Road 35 becomes the sole hidden state route as the road narrows down to two lanes before approaching State Road 575 and CR 575 in Lacoochee. It remains a two-lane road even after it crosses the border with Hernando County, Florida and over the Withlacoochee River. =Hernando to Marion counties= Withlacoochee River, forming the Hernando/Pasco County line US 301 two miles north of Florida's Turnpike Wildwood, looking south at the bridge over the CSX rail tracks Stone posts that say \\"Welcome to Sumter County\\", by US 301 at the Marion-Sumter county line In Hernando County, US 301 continues its two-lane rural surroundings until it approaches SR 50 in Ridge Manor, which while hardly urban, contains some local businesses, and a large gas station, convenience store and car wash on the northeast corner. North of the Whispering Oaks Country Club, a gated community near SR 50, US 301 passes by random intersections of dirt roads, many of which are part of local deed- restricted communities. US 301 enters Sumter County by crossing over the Little Withlacoochee River, where it shortly enters the unincorporated community of Croom-a-Coochee, runs parallel to the CSX's S-Line, and intersects with County Road 675. In St. Catherine, 301 intersects with CR 673, which leads to local campgrounds before reaching I-75, and almost instantly CR 478, which leads to Webster and Center Hill. In Bushnell, US 301 becomes Main Street. The first main intersection there is County Road 476 (Seminole Avenue), a road that runs from northwestern Hernando County to north of Webster. CR 48 shares a hidden concurrency with US 301, that's not so hidden when it turns onto CR 476. Sumter County Road 48 runs north towards West Belt Avenue, taking the DeSoto Trail with it, while US 301 turns east on East Noble Avenue, and crosses CSX's S-Line, where it once shared a brief concurrency with CR 48 until that designation turned south onto Florida Avenue on its way to Lake County. From there, Route 301 shares an even shorter concurrency with County Road 476, until it curves back north. US 301 passes by the ground of Lake-Sumter Community College's Sumter Campus in Sumterville. Shortly after this, US 301 intersects County Road 470, and both roads share a concurrency. The north end of SR 471 is encountered after this, and then the concurrency with County Road 470 breaks away to head east towards Okahumpka. In Coleman US 301 intersects with an abandoned railroad right-of-way that carried the SAL/Amtrak Silver Meteor until 1988. At this point, the road is briefly named South Commercial Street until it intersects with Warm Springs Avenue (County Road 514) and then heads east along Warm Springs Avenue. The road curves north again at the intersection of County Road 468. Before US 301 enters Wildwood, signs give advanced warnings of the road's approach to the next to last interchange for Florida's Turnpike. Prior to this interchange, US 301 becomes a four-lane highway, which is sometimes divided. The next major intersection is SR 44, and both lead to I-75. Wildwood has also been referred to as \\"The Crossroads of Florida\\" due to this as well as the former Wildwood Amtrak Station, which now serves as a CSX maintenance yard. North of Wildwood, US 301 narrows back down to a two-lane highway with a right-of-ways for future expansion on either sides, although after entering Marion County, it briefly turns into a divided highway at County Road 42 in Dallas, only to return to the two-lane road it was before. The stretch along the Marion-Sumter county line serves as the unofficial western boundary of The Villages, the large Central Florida retirement community. North of Summerfield, the road takes a slight curve to the northwest and then becomes a divided four-lane highway before curving back north again. The road remains no less than four lanes wide throughout the rest of Marion County, although just as in Pasco County, the median is missing left-turn lanes at many of the intersections. Within Belleview, the road curves more to the west and after the intersection with US 27‚Äì441 (SR 25‚Äì500) is co-signed with these routes for a few blocks. However SR 35 turns right at the current eastern terminus of CR 484, and US 27-301-441's new secret route becomes SR 25‚Äì500. After that the road curves more to the north again. Near the right of way for the formerly proposed Cross Florida Barge Canal, the median for the road widens, but narrows back down to normal again. Before it does, however, it intersects CR 328, where a police station exists between the median. Supports for a bridge that was intended to run over the canal exist behind the police station. To the west of this intersection is the Santos Trailhead of the Cross Florida Greenway. =Ocala and points north= Before US 27-301-441 enters Ocala, it veers off to the left at an intersection with County Road Old 441 (Southeast Lake Weir Avenue), a former segment of US 441 that eventually leads to Ocala Union Station. The first major intersection after this is 31st Street. Then it crosses under a railroad bridge before reaching the City Limits and the intersections with the northern terminus of CR 475 and crossing SR 464 (17th Street). US 27-301-441 intersects with SR 200 (becoming the new hidden state road until US 301 reaches US 1-23). The highway reaches the heart of Ocala at the intersection with SR 40 (West Silver Springs Boulevard). After this, the road crosses a railroad bridge west of Ocala Union Station. Five blocks later, US 27 leaves the US 301-441 overlap and takes SR 500 with it as they head northwest towards Williston, Perry, Tallahassee, and points north. Before US 301-441 leaves Ocala, it has an intersection with County Road 200A (Northwest 20th Street), which runs east and then north. This road was the former State Road 200A and decommissioned U.S. Route 301 Alternate. Another county alternate of a state highway that the road intersects with is CR 25A (Northwest Gainesville Road), which runs northwest through towns such as Zuber, Lowell, and Reddick. East of Zuber, the road intersects SR 326, which originally had a short concurrency, but now directly crosses US 301-441. South of the intersection with CR 329 is an interchange with U.S. Route 441 near Sparr, where the US 301-441 concurrency ends. US 441 moves northwest towards Gainesville, while US 301 moves northeast. CR 318 intersection in Citra In Citra, US 301 intersects with the north end of CR 200A (Northeast Jacksonville Road), but another short former segment (Northeast 19th Terrace) appears on the opposite side before the road passes by the historic Melton-Shands House and intersects with CR 318. After US 301 crosses the Alachua County Line it runs along a four-lane causeway through marshland before entering Island Grove, where the road intersects with another former section (Southeast 201st Terrace) and CR 325, which leads to Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings Historic State Park. From there, the road makes a slight curve to the right to cross over the railroad line. Both the tracks and the road run along the east coast of Lochloosa Lake in Lochloosa. The interchange with SR 20 in Hawthorne, also includes the side road Southeast 221st Street / Johnson Street, as well as the previously mentioned railroad line in between that side road and US 301. Intersections with CR 1474 in Campville and SR 26 in Orange Heights are at-grade interchanges, and the railroad line breaks away from the road moving straight north. US 301 would head back to the northwest in Shenks, where it would otherwise take drivers straight into Lake Altho and those tracks can be found again, beneath the interchange with SR 24 in Waldo. Since US 301 is a popular short cut between Northeastern Florida and the Gulf Coast region, a number of towns along the road have been notorious speed traps. The speed limit drops from 65 mph to 30 mph in a matter of a few hundred feet. Many have accused the police in Waldo, Starke, Lawtey, and others of giving tickets simply to raise money.CBS News. \\"Florida town infamous for speed traps disbanding police force\\".

Retrieved on May 10, 2015. North of Waldo, US 301 crosses Bradford County Line. The first moderate intersection the road encounters is the southern terminus of County Road 221, which northbound traffic can access from a connecting ramp. East of Hampton Lake, it intersects CR 18 between Hampton and Hampton Beach. Upon entering Starke, US 301 gains the name Walnut Street; after it crosses a set of railroad tracks, it crosses over onto Temple Avenue. From there, the road intersects SR 100 (Madison Street), and a block later the unmarked SR 230 (Call Street), where it passes the Old Bradford County Courthouse, and serves as part of the boundary for the Call Street Historic District. The next major intersection in Starke is SR 16 (Brownlee Street). Old Bradford County Courthouse along US 301 in Starke A Starke Bypass was proposed for construction by the FDOT for the year 2010, and has been completed late summer of 2019Starke U.S. 301 Corridor Study (Florida Department of Transportation)DOT considering bypass for downtown Starke The interchanges that already exist with US 441 near Sparr, SR 20 in Hawthorne, and SR 24 in Waldo could also be used if the state were to upgrade the road as a freeway. The next town over is Lawtey, which contains intersections with the eastern terminus of County Road 225 and then crosses County Road 125. =Metropolitan Jacksonville to Georgia= US 301 cuts through the northwest corner of Clay County with only one moderate intersection; County Road 218. After this, the road enters Duval County and the city of Jacksonville. As the road enters Maxville, it shares a brief concurrency with SR 228. After passing through Fiftone the road encounters a large railroad yard on the east side before the partial-cloverleaf interchange with I-10. In Baldwin US 301 crosses railroad tracks that serve the suspended Amtrak Sunset Limited before making a right turn at a concurrency with US 90 for several blocks. This concurrency may become history if the Florida Department of Transportation decides to build the proposed Baldwin Bypass around the western edge of town.US 301 Expansion; Baldwin Bypass (FDOT, Region #2) Immediately after another railroad crossing, both US 90 and 301 narrow down to two lanes at the east end of this concurrency. US 301 remains a two- lane rural highway until it reaches Callahan where it crosses over a railroad bridge and gets the name West First Avenue, although this segment is planned to be widened to four lanes by FDOT.US 301 Expansion in Duval and Nassau Counties (FDOT, Region #2) US 301 becomes East First Avenue at Booth Street before the intersection with US 1/23. Here, SR A1A/200 continue running along East First Avenue toward Fernandina Beach, while US 301 becomes part of a three route overlap with US 1-23 between Callahan, and Folkston, Georgia. History A US 301 shield used in Florida prior to 1993 US 301 first entered Florida in 1949, terminating in Tampa. It was rerouted along the 'old US 41' route to Palmetto in 1952, bypassing Tampa, and extended in 1953 to its current southern terminus of Sarasota. From 1956 until 1993, US 301 signs in Florida featured black numbering on a yellow shield. The \\"color-coding\\" of U.S. Routes by the Florida Department of Transportation was stopped when the state could no longer use Federal funds to replace the signs with anything but the standard black-and-white version. Some yellow US 301 signs may still remain. Around 1985, U.S. 301 was realigned in southern Manatee County between the Sarasota County Line and U.S. 41 to its current alignment along a former Atlantic Coast Line Railroad corridor. U.S. 301 previously ran to the west along 15th Street and 301 Boulevard.

It runs from Miami in South Florida northwest to the Georgia border north of the Lake City area. Like all AASHTO designated highways in Florida, US 441 always carries a FDOT designated hidden state road number: *State Road 7 (SR 7) from the US route's southern terminus at US 41/SR 90 in Miami to Southern Boulevard (US 98/SR 80) in Royal Palm Beach. *State Road 80 from SR 7 in Royal Palm Beach to Main Street (SR 15) in Belle Glade. *State Road 15 from Hooker Highway (SR 812/SR 80) in Belle Glade to Narcoosee Road (County Road 15 or CR 15) in St. Cloud. *State Road 500 from the intersection with Irlo Bronson Memorial Highway (US 192) in Holopaw to Bonnie Heath Boulevard (US 27/SR 492) in Ocala. *State Road 25 from North 14th Street (US 27) in Leesburg to the junction with US 41/US 441 Truck in Columbia County, with the following exception: **State Road 25A between the junctions of CR 25 north in Lady Lake and SR 25 south in Belleview. *State Road 25A from US 41/US 441 Truck to CR 25A north in Five Points. *State Road 47 from Duval Street (US 98/SR 10) in Lake City to Georgia State Route 89 at the Georgia state line. Concurrences with U.S. routes include US 98 from Royal Palm Beach to Okeechobee, within the vicinity of Lake Okeechobee, US 192 between Holopaw and Kissimmee, US 17-92 from Kissimmee to Orlando, SR 44 from Mount Dora to Leesburg, US 27 from Leesburg to Ocala, US 301 from Belleview to near Sparr, and US 41 from High Springs to Lake City. Route description=Miami to Kissimmee= The southern terminus of US 441 in Miami US 441 begins northbound at Southwest 7th Street, which is westbound U.S. Route 41, and ends southbound on Southwest 8th Street, which is eastbound U.S. Route 41 in the eastern \\"Little Havana\\" neighborhood of downtown Miami (both are one-way streets). 441 runs along SW/NW 8th Ave. till it crosses the Miami River; then it runs along NW 7th Ave. till the Golden Glades interchange; then it runs along NW 2nd Ave. till the Miami-Dade/Broward county line. The route is concurrent with SR 7 from its southern terminus and parallels Interstate 95 (I-95) north out of Miami to western Aventura, where I-95 heads northeast to access Fort Lauderdale and the remainder of the eastern Florida coast. However, the route is soon joined by the tolled Florida's Turnpike and I-95 (Exits 12 and 12C), which follows US 441 north to Royal Palm Beach (ten miles west of West Palm Beach). In between, the route interchanges with the Turnpike at exit 62 via State Road 870 (Commercial Blvd.) in Tamarac. Additionally, US 441 meets Interstate 595 (Exits 8 and 8B) west of Fort Lauderdale and the tolled State Road 869 in Coconut Creek. At Royal Palm Beach, US 441 intersects U.S. Route 98, ending the concurrency with SR 7, and overlaps the highway through central Palm Beach County, along with hidden State Road 80. Near Twenty Mile Bend SR 700 branches off to the northwest, which is where U.S. Routes 98 and 441 split until 2007. US 98-441 continues west to Belle Glade at the intersection of State Road 15, along the eastern shore of Lake Okeechobee, where SR 80 turns south and US 98-441 turns north to follow the shoreline to Pahokee. Just north of Pahokee in Canal Point, SR 700 rejoins US 98-441 and remains concurrent with US 441 along the eastern edge of the lake. North of Lake Okeechobee in Okeechobee, US 98 splits away from US 441 making a left turn at State Road 70, shortly afterwards the Okeechobee Amtrak station can be found. US 441 continues north, meeting the Turnpike at Yeehaw Junction in Osceola County (via State Road 60). It passes through the community of Kenansville prior to intersecting U.S. Route 192 at Holopaw. US 441 turns west onto US 192, forming an overlap into Kissimmee. U.S. 192 intersection in Holopaw =Kissimmee to Mount Dora= At Kissimmee US 441 separates from US 192 and joins US 17/92, here known as the Orange Blossom Trail or OBT. The OBT starts on US 17/92 at the Polk County/Osceola County line a few miles south of Kissimmee. These names are used throughout Central Florida for the length of US 441 within the region. Due to its proximity with Walt Disney World and affiliated resorts as well as Sea World, Universal Studios, and others, US 17/US 92/US 441 intersects many toll roads between Kissimmee and Orlando, the first of which is the partially tolled and partial limited-access Osceola Parkway in Kissimmee. Immediately after entering Orange County, it intersects SR 417 (Central Florida GreeneWay) at exit 11\\\\. Just north of the intersection the Central Florida Parkway leads to Sea World. Neither of these intersections or interchanges however, compare to the combined interchanges of Florida's Turnpike and SR 528 (Beachline Expressway), in Sky Lake, which contains a series of convoluted interchanges and partial ramps from side roads. North of this interchange, the road passes west of The Florida Mall and intersects SR 482\\\\. In Holden Heights, US 441 has an interchange with I-4 (Exit 80). Eastbound access from I-4 comes from partial cloverleaf ramps, and westbound access comes from a left-turn ramp between the two carriageways that runs under the eastbound lane and merges with the east to southbound ramp before merging with southbound OBT. The interchange provides no south to east access and no west to north access, but such access can found from the intersection with West Michigan Street. Further north the road heads into Orlando and comes to the interchange with SR 408 (East-West Tollway) at exit 9, which is a diamond interchange. After curving around Givens Street and Springdale Road, both of which can only be accessed from West Concord Street, OBT moves closer to a parallel railroad freight line and meets the intersection of SR 50 (Colonial Drive) northwest of downtown. Here, US 17/92 turns east onto State Road 50 while US 441 continues north on the Orange Blossom Trail. North of downtown, US 441 encounters intersections with State Road 438, then State Road 416, and after running along the western edge of Lake Fairview, an intersection with State Road 423 which changes from the north-and-south John Young Parkway to the east-and-west Lee Road. The road moves away from the freight line north of SR 423, but in Lockhart it runs over a bridge for that line again between Rose Avenue and Beggs Road. Further northwest it runs beneath an interchange with State Road 414, then cuts through a corner of Seminole County and re-enters Orange County in Apopka where it meets the northern terminus of West Orange Trail and the tolled State Road 429 before leaving the Orlando area. This road was intended to be part of the Central Florida GreeneWay loop around the Orlando Metropolitan Area. The road cuts through Plymouth and back to Apopka again, but the last sites in Apopka are Orlando Apopka Airport along the west side and Zellwood Cemetery on the east side before entering Zellwood, Florida. Intersections here include Ponkan Road and then Jones Avenue which lead to another airport known as Bob White Field The road takes a slight reverse curve before the intersection with Sadler Avenue (CR 448), and then approaches Lake Ola in Tangerine, where the road turns straight north. At the junction with County Road Old 441 (former State Road 500A), US 441 finally loses its designation as the Orange Blossom Trail, then crosses the Orange-Lake County Line and enters Mount Dora. CR Old 441 remains a local downtown street in Mount Dora, but US 441 continues as a rural at-grade four-lane divided highway, with the exception of an un-numbered diamond interchange with State Road 46 and CR 46. =Mount Dora to Sparr= Continuing with the rural surroundings, US 441 maintains its straight north and south position until it curves to the northwest between Lincoln and East Pine Avenues. Approaching Loch Leven, it turns straight west, and then State Road 44 joins US 441 after having run west from New Smyrna Beach and DeLand. This intersection is also shared with County Road 44B, which takes motorists to Downtown Mount Dora. In southern Eustis, US 441-SR 44 encounter another un- numbered interchange with State Road 19 and County Road 19A, taking SR 19 in a wrong way concurrency until it reaches a wye in Tavares, where SR 19 heads south toward Howey-in-the-Hills and Groveland, and County Road Old 441 rejoins US 441. From here, US 441-SR 44 is a six-lane highway with bicycle lanes that squeezes between Lake Harris and Lake Eustis where it crosses over the Dead River on a bridge between the two lakes. The road passes by Leesburg Municipal Airport, then serves as the western terminus of County Road 44, all the while winding around the northern shores of Lake Harris. In Leesburg, SR 44 leaves US 441 heading toward Wildwood, Inverness, and Crystal River, while US 441 curves to the northwest, then intersects U.S. Route 27 in another concurrency, and as a result, the hidden state routes are officially SR 25-500. The concurrency with SR 25 is short-lived, because in Lady Lake, SR 25 branches away as County Road 25. This once served as the southern terminus of the US 27-441 Alternate Route around Lake Weir into Belleview, but still remains a scenic route. Golf cart bridge over US 27/US 441, in The Villages A surviving support for a never-completed bridge that was part of the Cross Florida Barge Canal project, in the US 441 median in Santos. Around the Lake-Marion county border, US 27-441 enters a retirement community known as The Villages. Because of the frequent use of street-legal golf cars in the community, bridges and tunnels for these carts can be found throughout the road. US 27-441 leaves The Villages as it approaches County Road 42, a bi-county east-west scenic route through Central Florida. North of here, it serves as the eastern terminus of a newly constructed bypass to CR 484 in Summerfield. Within Belleview, the road encounters two somewhat important intersections; County Road 25A, and then State Road 35. SR 35 joins US 27-441 in a wrong-way concurrency with SR 500 as the road curves more to the west, until it reaches the intersection with US 301, where SR 35 turns south, and SR 500 becomes the hidden state road for US 27-301-441 for a few blocks. However SR 25 reunites with the triplex at the former eastern terminus of CR 484, and shares a concurrency with SR 25, and US 27-301-441's new secret route becomes SRs 25-500 once again. After that the road curves more to the north again. Near the right of way for the formerly proposed Cross Florida Barge Canal in Santos, the median for the road widens, as it contains supports for a bridge that was never completed once the Canal project was cancelled. Before the median narrows back down to normal again, it intersects CR 328, where a police station exists in the median. To the west of this intersection is the Santos Trail System trailhead of the Cross Florida Greenway. Before US 27-301-441 enters Ocala, it veers off to the left at an intersection with County Road 464A (Southeast Lake Weir Avenue), a former segment of US 441 that eventually leads to Ocala Union Station. The first major intersection after this is 31st Street. Then it crosses under a railroad bridge before reaching the City Limits and the intersections with the northern terminus of CR 475 and crossing SR 464 (17th Street). US 27-301-441 intersects with SR 200 (becoming the new hidden state road until US 301 reaches US 1-23). The highway reaches the heart of Ocala at the intersection with SR 40 (West Silver Springs Boulevard). After this, the road crosses a railroad bridge west of Ocala Union Station. Five blocks later, it reaches the intersection of SR 492 (Northwest 10th Street) only to move in the opposite direction, leaving the US 301-441 overlap and taking SR 500 with it as they head northwest towards Williston, Perry, Tallahassee, and points north. Before US 301-441 leaves Ocala, it has an intersection with County Road 200A (Northwest 20th Street), which runs east and then north. This road was the former State Road 200A and decommissioned U.S. Route 301 Alternate. After County Road 464A (North Magnolia Avenue) terminates at the southeast corner of the intersection of US 301-441 and Northwest 28th Street, another county alternate which was a former section of US 441-SR 25 begins on the opposite side. This road is CR 25A (Northwest Gainesville Road), which is also the decommissioned U.S. Route 441 Alternate, and runs northwest through towns such as Zuber, Lowell, and Reddick. East of Zuber, the road intersects SR 326, which originally had a short concurrency, but now directly crosses US 301-441. South of the intersection with CR 329 is an interchange with U.S. Route 441 between Sparr and Lowell, where the US 301-441 concurrency ends. US 301 moves northeast towards Waldo, Starke, and Jacksonville taking SR 200 with it, while US 441 moves northwest. =Reddick to the state line= US 441 in McIntosh, looking south In Reddick US 441 continues to the northwest, serving as the northern terminus of CR 25A. From there it intersects CR 318, which provides access to I-75 in Irvine to the west and Salt Springs in Ocala National Forest to the east. The road then runs through communities such as Orange Lake and McIntosh, where it passes through the McIntosh Historic District before crossing the Marion-Alachua County Line near the town of Evinston. It passes by a turnoff to Cross Creek before entering Micanopy, then runs across Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park and goes through Gainesville as 13th Street, serving as the eastern edge of the University of Florida campus. After intersecting SR 331 and later SRs 24A-226, State Road 24 joins US 441 in a brief concurrency until it reaches State Road 26 and turns east. US 441 continues north as it becomes the western terminus of State Road 120, then intersects State Road 222 before curving to the northwest and finally joining State Road 20, thereby converting it into an additional hidden state road. At the intersection of SR 121, the DeSoto Trail moves from SR 121 to US 441. In Alachua, US 441 intersects with SR 235, and then runs under an interchange with Interstate 75 (Exit 399), with quarter-cloverleaf interchanges on the northeast and northwest corners. Just as it did in Leesburg, US 441 in High Springs curves to the right while a state road becomes independent, specifically SR 20, which runs west only to join US 27 as they head towards Perry, Tallahassee, and Niceville. Meanwhile, as it did with US 27 in Leesburg, US 441 joins US 41 north, but here it also serves as the northern terminus of hidden SR 45. US 41-441 crosses the Santa Fe River then runs north passing by O'Leno State Park and River Rise Preserve State Park, near which it shares a brief concurrency with State Road 18. It then runs through Ellsville, where it has another interchange with I-75 (Exit 414), just south of the western terminus of State Road 238. Entering Lake City, US 441 splits from US 41 onto State Road 25A south of the city. The routes remain parallel, and at the US 90 Lake City Truck Route, Route 441 is joined by State Road 47 which was signed as terminating at US 41. The first intersection within this new hidden route is at U.S. Route 90 (where the DeSoto Trail heads west) to the northern extents of Lake City. Past Lake City, SR 25 branches off to the northwest as County Road 25A, which also shares intersections with CR 250 to the east and Northeast Double Run Road to the northeast. US 441 has an interchange with Interstate 10 (Exit 303), then skirts the western edge of the Okefenokee Swamp and east bank of the Suwannee River as it enters Georgia. History A US 441 shield used in Florida prior to 1993 From 1956, signs for U.S. Highways in Florida had different colors for each highway. The \\"shield\\" for US 441 was brown, until the state was forced by the federal government to conform to standards that required consistent black-and-white signs in 1993. Between 2007 and 2011, the Florida Department of Transportation rebuilt the NW 7th Avenue Bridge over the Miami River.

There are regional variations of this story. The first part deals with the hero's wooing, the second (much longer) with the vicissitudes which he undergoes as a result of attempting to assist his father-in-law and his return home after seven years just as his wife is about to be forced to marry a usurper.Karl Reichl, Das usbekische Heldenepos Alpomish: Einfuhrung, Text, Ubersetzung, (Turcologica 48.). Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2001. Pp. 311. . DM 98. Reviewed by Stephanie West, Hertford College, Oxford University The Kongrat tribe, which is the tribe that Alpamys belongs to, is currently within a Uzbek nation. Belonging to a certain tribe was and remains to be an essential part of nomadic self-identification, which is proven by the fact that the Alpamys poem begins with following words: Brief synopsis of the story=Part 1 = The first part tells about Alpamys and his bride Barchin (sometimes known as Gulibairsen in the Siberian and Mongolian variants), with whom he has been engaged since childhood. Their fathers, Bayburi and Baysari, were from the Konirat tribe and were childless for a very long time, until their pleas were heard by God, and Baysari had one daughter, whilst Bayburi had a daughter and a son. After an argument, Baysari and his family moved to the Kalmyk country. There Barchin, by then a very pretty young lady, attracted the attention of the pehlivans (strongmen) of Kalmyk shah, Taycha-khan. In order to avoid an involuntary marriage to any of the hated by her pehlivan, Barchin declares that she will marry anyone, who wins all four contests: horse race (\\"bayga\\"), archery skills, target shooting from a bow, and wrestling. Baychin is secretly hoping that the winner will be her beloved Alpamys, after whom she sends several people (ambassadors). One of the Kalmyk pehlivans, Karajan, turns from an opponent and enemy to a friend of the hero. Karajan outruns all the competitors on Alpamysh's horse, Baychibare, despite all the tricks by Kalmyks, who initially tie him in ropes and maim his horse by inserting nails into the horse's hooves. Karajan enters the wrestling competition with Kalmyk pehlivans, after which Alpamysh emerges victorious by beating the strongest of pehlivans, Kokaldash. Together with Barchin, who is now his wife, they return to Konirat. The only person to stay in Kalmyk country is Baysari, who is still angry at Bayburi. =Part 2= In the second part, Alpamysh, finding out about the hardships caused to Baysari by the Taycha-khan, once again travels to the Kalmyk country, and falls captive to his tricky enemies. He then spends seven years in the dungeon of the Kalmyk khan. He is being fed by a choban (shepherd) Kaykubat, who accidentally discovered his location. The daughter of the Kalmyk khan visits Alpamysh in his cell, falls in love with him and helps to free him from captivity. The freed Alpamysh then confronts Taycha-khan, kills him, and puts shepherd Kaykubat on the throne. During his seven-year absence, the leader of the Kongrat tribe becomes his youngest brother Ultantaz. The new ruler is persecuting his people, dishonors the old father of Alpamysh, and harasses the young son Yadgar, whilst forcing Barchin to marry him. Alpamysh, by switching clothes with his old shepherd servant Kultay, undetected, comes to the marriage celebration of Ultantaz, frees his wife Barchin and kills Ultantaz. The epic ends with Barchin's father, Baysari, returning from voluntary exile and re-unification of the previously divided Kongrat tribe under the leadership of heroic Alpamysh. The Siberian Turkic nations' version of the epic can be summarized as follows: > \\"Alpamis, recounts the story of its hero‚Äôs life and the events before his > birth with rich description and intriguing stories. Its basic plot, however, > can be classified into four parts. First, Alpamis‚Äô parents pray for a son, > make a pilgrimage, and experience the miraculous pregnancy of Alpamis‚Äô > mother. Alpamis is eventually born and grows up. Second, Alpamis marries the > beauty Gulibairsen after a heroic battle. Third, after returning home with > his wife, Alpamis fights his enemy Taishik Khan, who has ransacked his herds > and property; Alpamis kills him and recovers everything that was lost. > Fourth, after returning home again, Alpamis conquers Urtan‚Äîa very > destructive demon and son of the charwoman of Alpamis‚Äô family‚Äîwho attempted > to possess his wife Gulibairsen.\\" =Sequel= There is also a lesser-known sequel to Alpamish, about the heroic adventures of Yadgar (Yadigar), the son of Alpamish and Barchin (Gulibairsen).

It enters the state from Missouri on the Poplar Street Bridge near East St. Louis and runs to U.S. Route 41 (US 41, Lake Shore Drive) near downtown Chicago where the highway ends, a distance of . The Road also runs through the cities of Springfield, Bloomington, and Joliet. The section in DuPage County is officially named Joliet Freeway or Will Rogers Freeway and in Cook County is officially named the Stevenson Expressway. Route description I-55 within Illinois carries heavy traffic, with an average of more than 20,000 vehicles per day for most of its length. Significant portions of I-55 contain six lanes (three lanes in each direction) and are heavily used by commuters. I-55 in Illinois begins in East St. Louis on the Poplar Street Bridge over the Mississippi River at the Missouri‚ÄìIllinois state line and runs southwest to northeast through the state, ending in Chicago at US 41 (Lake Shore Drive). Along the way, it goes through four metropolitan areas in the state: the Illinois portion of the St. Louis metropolitan area, the Springfield metropolitan area, the Bloomington-Normal metropolitan area, and the Chicago metropolitan area (also known as Chicagoland). I-55 enters the Chicago metro area as the Stevenson Expressway and provides easy access to downtown Chicago via both the I-90/I-94 (Dan Ryan Expressway) interchange and US 41 (Lake Shore Drive) at the northern terminus of I-55, near Cermak Road and the lakefront. History I-55 in Illinois is the fourth road to connect St. Louis and Chicago. The first was the Pontiac Trail in 1915. This was largely improved and paved as the new Illinois Route 4 (IL 4) by 1924. In 1926, IL 4 was designated as the route of the new U.S 66, and a new section of US 66 was built to bypass slower sections of IL 4 south of Springfield by 1930. Through the 1950s US 66 was continually widened, straightened, and improved to handle its growing traffic, until its entire length was four lanes wide by 1957. The roots of I-55 could be traced back to the need of a national highway system. President Dwight D. Eisenhower saw the need of a national network of highways that would help with the mobilization of the army. He had been impressed with the autobahn he saw in Germany during World War II. In 1956 he signed the Federal Aid Highway Act into existence. Although the act provided for a highway replacing Route 66, it was spared destruction for a while because of it being more modern than other routes at the time. Illinois would build its first new Interstate highways on other routes such as I-80, I-57, and I-70, before turning its attention once again to the St. Louis-to- Chicago route. However, during the 1970s, Route 66 was finally replaced by I-55 as the fourth St. Louis-to-Chicago highway, serving most of the same communities along the way as the original Pontiac Trail. It was built in sections across Illinois, often on the original Route 66 roadbed. A common construction tactic where Route 66 was already four lanes wide, was to build new southbound lanes for I-55 west of the original road, then rebuild the original southbound lanes of US 66 to be the new northbound lanes for I-55, leaving the original northbound lanes of old US 66 as a two-way frontage road. One can find many signs posted for Historic US 66, especially where it deviates from I-55. The earliest stretch of I-55 was a portion of US 66 which had already been built as a freeway between Gardner and I-294 (Tri-State Tollway) in Indian Head Park, and which was added to the Interstate system by simply erecting new signs in 1960. Later portions of the highway were built in the 1960s between East St. Louis and Hamel, as bypasses of Springfield and Bloomington-Normal. The rest of the road was completed in the 1970s. Countryside, heading southwest The Stevenson Expressway opened on October 24, 1964 as the Southwest Expressway. It was renamed after Adlai Stevenson, the former governor of Illinois, on September 1, 1965, a month and a half after his death. The Stevenson's original termini were US 66 in DuPage County to the west, and the Dan Ryan Expressway to the east. In 1999‚Äì2000, the expressway was completely rebuilt from Central Avenue north to Lake Shore Drive, including the ramps to the Dan Ryan. The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) was criticized at the time for not adding a fourth lane in each direction to the highway. In 2017, the Illinois General Assembly voted to rename approximately of I-55 from the Tri-State Tollway (I-294) to Pontiac in honor of Barack Obama. =Upgrades and current construction= Because of the heavy traffic on I-55, IDOT spends millions of dollars per year maintaining the roadway, adding lanes, and replacing bridges to increase the capacity of the highway. In northeastern Illinois near Joliet, a widening project that expanded I-55 from two to three lanes in each direction between I-80 (exit 250) and Weber Road (exit 263) was completed on October 29, 2008. In the 2000s decade, the Damen Avenue (exit 290) and Pulaski Road (exit 287) interchanges were rebuilt as a single-point urban interchange (SPUI) configuration; in 2014 reconstruction as a SPUI was completed for the Central Avenue (exit 285) interchange. The Arsenal Road (exit 245) interchange was under complete rebuilding and reconfiguration as of 2012, and the deteriorated overpass at IL 129 (exit 238) was removed in 2012 in anticipation of future construction of a full interchange, temporarily leaving the IL 129 interchange with only a northbound exit and northbound entrance. At St. Louis, the Stan Musial Veterans Memorial Bridge carrying I-70 across the Mississippi River, and costing $667 million, was completed in 2014 to relieve congestion on I-55's Poplar Street Bridge. Future In early 2016, Governor Bruce Rauner, as well as IDOT, made a proposal to explore expanding a portion of I-55 (from I-355 to I-90/94) by adding an additional lane in each direction to ease congestion. Under their proposal, toll lanes would be constructed and operated through a potential private-public partnership. Noise walls would also be constructed as part of the project. Exit listRelated routes=Auxiliary routes= I-55 has three auxiliary routes in Illinois: *: A spur from I-55 in Lincoln to I-74 just east of Peoria. *: The eastern third of the beltway around the St. Louis Metro Area (with I-270 forming the other two- thirds) *: The Veterans Memorial Tollway, serving the western and southwestern suburbs of Chicago, running from I-80 in New Lenox to I-290 in Addison =Springfield business loop= Business Loop 55 refers to a major arterial surface street that serves downtown Springfield, Illinois. It runs north from the intersection of Interstates 55 and Interstate 72 through downtown to Illinois Route 4 (Veterans' Parkway). It then runs northeast to Sherman. All of Business Loop 55 was part of U.S. Route 66 at some point. Major junctions =Lincoln business loop= The Lincoln business route services the downtown of Lincoln, Illinois. It begins southwest of Lincoln and follows the former US 66 to Fifth Street. It then turns east on Fifth Street, southeast on Clinton Street, and northeast on Kickapoo Street at the city's center. The route continues northeast to rejoin the former routing of US 66 northeast of town near the Logan County Airport, at which point it continues along that route to end at I-55 further northeast of Lincoln. =Bloomington‚ÄìNormal business loop= The routing of the Bloomington-Normal business loop is known for its entire length as Veterans Parkway. It is a divided, limited-access highway bypassing the Bloomington-Normal area to the south and east. The route's north-south portion largely passes through a retail core, including Eastland Mall and The Shoppes at College Hills. The is also the recommended route from I-39, I-55 and I-74 to Central Illinois Regional Airport via IL 9\\\\.

History  The Cedryn quarry is first recorded in 1827. The output of this remote site was initially taken by horse pack to the quays on the River Conwy at Dolgarrog. A 5 mile long tramway was constructed in the period 1861‚Äì1863. The gauge was approximately narrow gauge and was built using wrought iron T section rails. Some time before 1866 this tramway was extended a further mile to Cwm Eigiau Quarry, and the name \\"Cwm Eigiau Tramway\\" largely became synonymous with that of the Cedryn Tramway. The Caedryn [sic] Slate Quarry Co. Ltd of 1863 became in 1874 the Caedryn [sic] & Cwm Eigiau Slate Co. Ltd, but was dissolved just 11 years later, the slate being of a poor quality. By 1907, when the route was used for a new tramway to assist in the building of the dam at Llyn Eigiau, all rails had been removed. This new tramway, the Eigiau Tramway, was initially built to the wider standard gauge, and used steam engines. It followed the route of the Cedryn Tramway except that the small incline above Coedty was by-passed to the north.  Route  The tramway started at the foot of the quarry exit incline and passed over the Afon Eigiau on a wooden trestle. It crossed the Eigiau again at Bont-y-Cedryn and then skirted the site of what is now the Eigiau Reservoir. Passing the col at Hafod-y-Rhiw the line ran along a series of low stone embankments to the top of a short incline above Coedty. Below Coedty, and just before the top of the Dolgarrog inclines, the line passed the point where the Cowlyd Tramway was later to branch off. The line continued to the top of the Dolgarrog escarpment which it descended via three steep inclines. These were later used as locomotive access by the Eigiau and Cowlyd Tramways, and are today utilized by the two large pipes which carry water to the aluminum works. The lowest incline passed through a short tunnel under the main road at Tyddyn Isaf, and this former incline and tunnel can be seen today adjacent to the former (wooden) community centre. From here the tramway continued across the marshland to the edge of the River Conwy at Porth Llwyd wharf. The lowest incline was later abandoned in favour of a new incline built slightly to the north, and today the pipelines take this newer route.

Complement factor I (factor I) is a protein of the complement system, first isolated in 1966 in guinea pig serum, that regulates complement activation by cleaving cell-bound or fluid phase C3b and C4b. It is a soluble glycoprotein that circulates in human blood at an average concentration of 35 Œºg/mL.  Synthesis  The gene for Factor I in humans is located on chromosome 4. Factor I is synthesized mostly in the liver, but also in monocytes, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and endothelial cells. When synthesized, it is a 66kDa polypeptide chain with N-linked glycans at 6 positions. Then, factor I is cleaved by furin to yield the mature factor I protein, which is a disulfide-linked dimer of heavy chain (residues 19-335, 51 kDalton) and light chain (residues 340-583, 37 kDalton). Only the mature protein is active.  Structure  Factor I is a glycoprotein heterodimer consisting of a disulfide linked heavy chain and light chain. The factor I heavy chain has four domains: an FI membrane attack complex (FIMAC) domain, CD5 domain, and low density lipoprotein receptor 1 and 2 (LDLr1 and LDLr2) domains. the heavy chain plays an inhibitory role in maintaining the enzyme inactive until it meets the complex formed by the substrate (either C3b or C4b) and a cofactor protein (Factor H, C4b-binding protein, complement receptor 1, and membrane cofactor protein). Upon binding of the enzyme to the substrate:cofactor complex, the heavy:light chain interface is disrupted, and the enzyme activated by allostery. The LDL-receptor domains contain one Calcium-binding site each. The factor I light chain contains only the serine protease domain. This domain contains the catalytic triad His-362, Asp-411, and Ser-507, which is responsible for specific cleavage of C3b and C4b. Conventional protease inhibitors do not completely inactivate Factor I but they can do so if the enzyme is pre-incubated with its substrate: this supports the proposed rearrangement of the molecule upon binding to the substrate. Both heavy and light chains bear Asn-linked glycans, on three distinct glycosylation sites each. Crystal structure the crystal structure of human Factor I has been deposited as PDB: 2XRC. Clinical Significance Dysregulated factor I activity has clinical implications. Loss of function mutations in the Complement Factor I gene lead to low levels of factor I which results in increased complement activity. Factor I deficiency in turn leads to low levels of complement component 3 (C3), factor B, factor H and properdin. In blood, due to unregulated activation of C3 convertase, and to low levels of IgG, due to loss of iC3b and C3dg production. In addition to the following diseases, low factor I is associated with recurrent bacterial infections in children. Age-Related Macular Degeneration Research suggests that mutations in the CFI gene contribute to development of age-related macular degeneration. This contribution is thought to be due to the dysregulation of the alternative pathway, leading to increased inflammation in the eye. Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is caused by complement overactivation. Heterozygous mutations in the serine protease domain of the CFI gene account for 5-10% of cases.

Davis High School is a high school in Yakima, Washington, serving students in grades 9-12. It is part of the Yakima School District and has approximately 2,600 students. History North Yakima High School (which was renamed Davis High School in 1957 when Eisenhower High School became the second senior high school in Yakima) began classes in 1884, and was housed in the Columbia Building. By 1896, the school's enrollment reached 40 students and classes were relocated to the Central School Building. With an ever- increasing student body, in 1900, the school was once-again relocated to the Lincoln School. In 1905, land was procured on South 7th Avenue and Walnut, with plans to build a new, larger high school. As it turned out, that foresight was well thought out, because after the Lincoln School burned on Jan. 6, 1907, the high school took up temporary residence at the Methodist Church on Fourth Street.Yakima Centennial Commission. Yakima: A Centennial Perspective. Franklin Press: Yakima, p.60 The new school building, which began construction in 1905, was completed in 1908. The new building cost $84,980, had 23 classrooms and increased capacity to 690 students.

Every year over one hundred students participate in the International Baccalaureate program at the school. The most involved students take 6 to 7 IB classes their junior and senior years to earn the IB diploma, strengthen their educational background, and earn college credit. However, students can take any number of IB classes related to their educational and personal interests. IB course offerings include: Music, Art, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematical Methods, Mathematical Studies, History of the Americas, Spanish B (for non-native speakers), Spanish A (for native speakers), French B (non-native speakers), Theory of Knowledge, and English A (for native speakers). Each of these courses lasts for 2 years with the exceptions of Theory of knowledge (2 trimesters) and Physics (1 year). A plurality of IB students opt to attend the University of Washington, the most academically selective public university in the state, which ranks Davis 19th out of 231 private and public Washington high schools. Every year some students go further afield to attend top-ranked institutions including Ivy League and Stanford Universities. Study abroad and foreign exchange programs are also popular options for graduating seniors. Students who opt not to participate in the IB program have a myriad of other educational opportunities and career paths. Davis students often participate in the Running Start program at Yakima Valley Community College to earn their high school diploma as well as their associate degree prior to graduation.

She has two daughters, Michelle Salas (b. 1989) and Camila Valero (b. 1997). Life and career Salas made her show business debut singing at age eight alongside her mother on the show Noche a noche hosted by Ver√≥nica Castro. She later joined the cast of Vaselina, the Spanish-language state production of Grease, alongside Timbiriche. At age 16 she was asked to join the cast of the telenovela El precio de la fama by producer Ernesto Alonso. In 1992 Salas starred alongside Bibi Gayt√°n, Paulina Rubio and Eduardo Capetillo in the popular telenovela Baila Conmigo. She sang several songs on the musical oriented youth soap. Her most popular was the song \\"Tonterias\\". This led to her signing a contract with Televisa owned label Melody. That same year Salas released her debut album, entitled Ave Mar√≠a. The title track (written by Lolita De La Colina) became a huge hit in Mexico and in parts of Latin America. Produced by Oscar L√≥pez, the album went on to achieve gold status in Mexico. Salas's follow-up came in 1994 wit La raza humana. This album received critical praise, though compared to its predecessor it was not a huge commercial success. However, the album did receive the prestigious Palmas de oro which is given to the year's best in music by Mexican music critics. Of note were the songs \\"Coraz√≥n\\", which saw Salas dabble in house music, and \\"Nube\\", which was inspired by Nirvana leader Kurt Cobain's untimely death. This album also featured many collaborations with Salas's partner Pablo Valero (former member of Santa Sabina), with whom she had her youngest daughter, Camila. For the latter part of the 90s Salas took time off to raise her two daughters. While she was pretty dormant on the music front, she did find time to continue acting. She left Televisa briefly and participated in several telenovelas for competing network TV Azteca such as El candidato and Agua y aceite. Salas participated in the Spanish language version of Eve Ensler's Vagina Monologues. The Mexican production of this play has been running for over seven years, has toured all of Mexico, and has been performed over 3,500 times. Her other theatrical productions include Mame, Mi vida es mi vida, and El protagonista. Having not released any music since 1994, Salas returned to the music scene in late 2006 with a new project entitled Tuna. She and musician Pepe Acosta,Tuna, disco independiente, pero pop: Stephanie Salas released their self-titled debut on the Mexican independent label MW Records. The band was previously named \\"Tinta\\" but had to change its name due to legal issues.

This genus is monotypic; the only species in it is Dicathais orbita, common name the white rock shell or cart-rut shell, found round the coasts of Australia and New Zealand. Description The white rock shell is large with a strong shell usually about long, but occasionally growing to twice this size. It shows great variation in its shell sculpture across its range. In eastern Australia there are seven to nine deeply indented ribs in each whorl with clefts of a similar width between them, sculptured with further fine riblets. This gives a fluted edge to the lip and the grooves can also be seen on the interior surface of the shell. The central column or columella is smooth and the interior of the shell is white. The western Australian form has a row of well marked nodules rather than ridges and an unindented lip while the southern Australian form has much less distinct ridges and a nearly smooth lip. At one time it was thought that these different forms were distinct species but it has now been established that the variations in sculpture are a function of different living conditions. Specimens gathered from New South Wales with deep ridges were kept in a still water aquarium for three years during which time the new shell growth was at first shallowly indented and later was smooth. The colour of the shell is generally creamy white or grey, often with a thin yellowish line round the margin of the lip. Juveniles have thinner shells and are often brown. Distribution and habitat This snail is plentiful in the intertidal zone and sublittoral zone on rocks and among seaweed around the coasts of Australia (New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia), New Zealand, Kermadec islands and Lord Howe Island. Biology The white rock shell is a predator, cannibal and scavenger. It uses its radula to bore a hole in the shell of a barnacle or mollusc and then sucks out the contents. Prey species include the sea snails Lunella torquata, Cronia avellana and Pyrene bidentata, and the mussel Septifer bilocularis. As the tide rises, the white rock shell makes foraging expeditions up the beach, travelling far away from the sheltered niches to which it retreats at low tide. This is in contrast to the mulberry whelk Morula marginalba which shares the same habitat but remains in an area where there are both crevices in which to hide and prey species on which to feed. The sexes are separate in the white rock shell. The eggs that develop in the female gonoduct are wrapped in a number of membranes to form an egg capsule. Several of these are joined together in an egg mass and attached to the substrate. Different precursors of the pigment Tyrian purple have been found in the male and female gonoducts and in the egg capsule. Early development of the larvae takes place inside the capsule which contains yolk granules on which they feed. When they have developed to the veliger stage, the larvae emerge from the capsule and become planktonic. After drifting with the currents for a while, these settle on the seabed, undergo metamorphosis and become juvenile snails. References * Gmelin J.F. 1791. Caroli a Linn√©.

It is approximately long and wide and is surrounded on its east, south and west sides by dangerous shoals. It is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean and is the biggest of a group of five islands which extend north for .Seal Island, Nova Scotia It is the second southernmost point of land of Nova Scotia. The southern tip of nearby Cape Sable Island is farther south than the southern tip of land on Seal Island.  History  During the American Revolution, Noah Stoddard's vessel the Scammell was commissioned in April 1782. Soon after, he rescued the 60 American prisoners on board H.M.S. Blonde, who were stranded on Seal Island after hitting Blonde Rock, Nova Scotia. Stoddard allowed the British crew to return to Halifax.Sacking of Lunenburg. Saga of the Seas, Archibald MacMechan, 1923 The island was settled in 1823 by two families from the Barrington area, the Hitchens and the Crowells. They used the island as a fishing base and provided shelter to survivors of the many ships wrecked at the island and on nearby reefs. A campaign led by Mary Hitchens resulted in the construction of a lighthouse in 1831 which still stands, one of the oldest wooden lighthouses in Canada. Seal Island lightkeepers continued to rescue many shipwreck victims, most notably in 1843 when they saved all the crew and passengers of RMS Columbia, one of Samuel Cunard's first ocean liners. The Seal Island settlement eventually contained two small villages, The East Side and The West Side. The East Side has historically been inhabited by descendants of the original settling families who owned the island, and the West Side by local fishermen. Today there is a fishermen's Reserve protecting access to this historic fishing ground. The communities shared a post office, church and a lobster cannery (this ceased operations in the 1950s). Year round habitation ceased in 1990 but both villages host summer residents, most of whom have families who once lived on the island. The island became known for birding in the early 1900s. Groups of birders would visit seasonally, and eventually they wanted a permanent base on the island. An old cookhouse, referred to as North Home, standing in the woods near the West Side, was purchased by a group of birders in the 1960s. The property has been restored in recent years, primarily by two descendants of the original birding families. The East Side has lost its wharf, but retains the Seal Island Church of All Faiths and the East Side village.Seal Island Village http://www.nslps.com/lights/lighthouse_page_01.asp?ID=362&SP;=5&M;=The%20Light%20Today Walter W.

This is especially true in marriage and in formal ministry positions within certain Christian denominations, churches, and parachurch organizations. Many leadership roles in the organized church have been prohibited to women, but the majority of churches now hold an egalitarian (men and women‚Äôs roles equal) view regarding women‚Äôs roles in the church. In the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches, only men may serve as priests, elders, or decons; only males serve in senior leadership positions such as pope, patriarch, and bishop. Women may serve as abbesses. Most mainstream Protestant denominations are beginning to relax their longstanding constraints on ordaining women to be ministers, though some large groups, most notably the Southern Baptist Convention, are tightening their constraints in reaction. Most all Charismatic and Pentecostal churches were pioneers in this matter and have embraced the ordination of women since their founding. Christian traditions that officially recognize saints as persons of exceptional holiness of life do list women in that group. Most prominent is Mary, mother of Jesus who is highly revered throughout Christianity, particularly in Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, where she is considered the \\"Mother of God\\". Both the apostles Paul and Peter held women in high regard and worthy of prominent positions in the church, though they were careful not to encourage anyone to disregard the New Testament household codes, also known as New Testament Domestic Codes or Haustafelen. There were efforts by the apostles Paul and Peter to encourage the brand new first-century Christians to obey the Patria Potestas (lit., \\"Rule of the Fathers\\") of Greco-Roman law.Powell, Mark A. Introducing the New Testament. Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Academic. 2009. p.337. The New Testament written record of their efforts in this regard is found in , , , and , , , , and .Stagg, Evelyn and Frank Stagg. Woman in the World of Jesus. Westminster Press, 1978. As may be seen throughout the Old Testament and in the Greco- Roman culture of New Testament times, patriarchal societies placed men in positions of authority in marriage, society and government. The New Testament only records males being named among the 12 original apostles of Jesus Christ. Yet, women were the first to discover the Resurrection of Christ. Some Christians believe clerical (clergy) ordination and the conception of priesthood post-date the New Testament and that it contains no specifications for such ordination or distinction. Others cite uses of the terms presbyter and episkopos and or . The early church developed a monastic tradition which included the institution of the convent through which women developed religious orders of sisters and nuns, an important ministry of women which has continued to the present day in the establishment of schools, hospitals, nursing homes and monastic settlements. Theology Mary the Mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene, Mary of Bethany and her sister Martha have been among the women identified as having been key to the establishment of Christianity. Karen L. King, Harvard Professor of New Testament Studies and the History of Ancient Christianity, writes that the history of women in ancient Christianity has been almost completely revised in the last twenty years. Many more women are being added to the list of women who made very significant contributions in the early history of Christianity. The new history comes primarily from recent discoveries of biblical text that had been neglected through the ages.King, Karen L. \\"Women In Ancient Christianity: The New Discoveries\\". Accessed 30 July 2015>. The belief that Mary Magdalene was an adulteress, the wife of Jesus, and a repentant prostitute can be traced back at least as far as the fourth century. Because of that opinion's acceptance in an influential homily of Pope Gregory the Great in about 591Biblical Archaeology Society Staff, \\"Was Mary Magdalene Wife of Jesus? Was Mary Magdalene a Prostitute?\\", .the historical error became the generally accepted view in Western Christianity. In his homily, the Pope mistakenly identified Magdalene not only with the anonymous sinner with the perfume in Luke's gospel, but also confused her with Mary of Bethany, the sister of Martha and Lazarus. Karen King concludes that the discoveries of new texts by biblical scholars, combined with their sharpened critical insight, have now proved beyond any doubt that the disreputable portrait of Mary Magdalene is entirely inaccurate. Mary Magdalene was a prominent disciple and significant leader in the early Christian movement. Her designation as the very first apostle of Jesus has helped promote contemporary awareness of the leadership of women in Christianity. The New Testament Gospels, written toward the last quarter of the first century CE, acknowledge that women were among Jesus' earliest followers. * From the beginning, Jewish women disciples, including Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Susanna, had accompanied Jesus during his ministry and supported him out of their private means. * Jesus spoke to women both in public and private, and allowed them to set examples of faith. According to two gospel accounts, an unnamed Gentile woman understood and was praised by Jesus when arguing that his ministry is not limited to particular groups and persons, but belongs to all who have faith.; * A Jewish woman honored him with the extraordinary hospitality of washing his feet with perfume. * Jesus was a frequent visitor at the home of Mary and Martha, and was in the habit of teaching and eating meals with women as well as men. * When Jesus was arrested, women remained firm, even when his male disciples fled into hiding. Women accompanied him to the foot of the cross. * It was women who were the first witnesses to the resurrection, chief among them being Mary Magdalene. These gospel accounts reflect the prominent historical roles that women played in Jesus' ministry as disciples. In one of her several books, Linda Woodhead notes the earliest Christian theological basis for forming a position on the roles of women is in the Book of Genesis where readers are drawn to the conclusion that women are beneath men and \\"that the image of God shines more brightly\\" in men than women\\". The following New Testament passages and more recent theological beliefs have contributed to the interpretation of roles of women in Christianity through the centuries: * \\"Women will be saved through bearing children, if she continues in faith and love and holiness, with modesty.\\" * \\"The rule remains with the husband, and the wife is compelled to obey him by God‚Äôs command. He rules the home and the state, wages wars, and defends his possessions.... The woman, on the other hands, is like a nail driven into the wall. She sits at home.... She does not go beyond her most personal duties.\\" (Luther, Lectures) * \\"Properly speaking, the business of woman, her task and function, is to actualize the fellowship in which man can only precede her, stimulating, leading, inspiring.\\" (Karl Barth, Church Dogmatics) = Biblical authority and inerrancy = In general, all evangelicals involved in the gender debate claim to adhere to the authority of the Bible. Egalitarians typically argue that the dispute has arisen because of differences in interpretation of specific passages. Nevertheless, Wayne Grudem and other complementarians have accused egalitarians of adopting positions which deny the authority, sufficiency and inerrancy of scripture. =Church practice= Christian leaders through history have been patriarchal, taking names which underscore male leadership in the church. These include \\"father\\", \\"'abbot' (abba = father)\\", and \\"'pope' (papa = father)\\". Linda Woodhead notes that \\"Such language ... excludes women from the exercise of such roles\\". She also notes a sentiment in 1 Corinthians which \\"exemplif[ies] a pattern of Christianity of all varieties\\", where Paul \\"explains that women should be veiled in church to signal their subordination to men because ‚Äòthe head of every man is Christ and the head of a woman is her husband‚Äô, and that ‚Äòwomen should keep silence in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be subordinate, as even the law says.'‚Äù However some Christians disagree with the idea that women should not have leadership positions, popular female preachers like Joyce Meyer, Paula White and Kathryn Kuhlman have had or have leadership roles in Church. It is mentioned in the Old Testament that women such as Deborah and Huldah were Prophets. In the New Testament Philip was said to have four daughters who prophesied. = Biblical hermeneutics = The egalitarian and complementarian positions differ significantly in their approach to hermeneutics, and specifically in their interpretation of biblical history. Christian egalitarians believe that male and female were created equally without any hierarchy of roles.Walther, Emily, and George H. Walther. \\"Celebrating Our Partnership.\\" Priscilla Papers, Autumn 1991 Volume 5, Issue 4. God created both woman and man in his own image and likeness. God made the first couple equal partners in leadership over the earth. Both were jointly commissioned to \\"be fruitful and multiply...to fill the earth...subdue the earth...and rule over it.\\" At the Fall, God prophesied to Eve that one result of sin entering the human race would be that her husband would \\"rule over\\" her. Conservative Christian theologian Gilbert Bilezikian points out that throughout the Old Testament era and beyond, just as God had prophesied, men continued to rule over women in a patriarchal system which he sees as being a \\"compromise\\" or \\"accommodation\\" between sinful reality and the divine ideal. The coming of Jesus is understood as moving forward from Old Testament patriarchy, re-instituting full equality of gender roles, as succinctly articulated in .Doug Heidebrecht. \\"Distinction and Function in the Church: Reading Galatians 3:28 in Context.\\" Direction. Direction Journal, Mennonite Brethren New Testament passages, such as \\"22Wives, be subject to your husbands, as to the Lord. 23For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior. 24As the church is subject to Christ, so let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands\\" which teaches submission of wives to husbands, are typically understood by egalitarians as a temporary accommodation to a harsh 1st century culture where Roman law Patria Potestas gave fathers enormous power over the familia which included wife, children, slaves, and adult dependents. That power give the father/husband the right to kill his wife under a variety of circumstances. Gilbert Bilezikian writes that \\"the poison of hierarchy generated by the fall (of mankind) had permeated relationships to such an extent that those very disciples Jesus was training in the ways of servanthood insisted on substituting hierarchy for servanthood. They kept competing among themselves for the highest status and for positions of preeminence.\\" Bilezikian continues: \\"To settle the issue once for all times, Jesus sharply delineated the basic difference between social organization in the secular world and in the Christian community\\". He concludes that \\"Consequently, there is no mandate and no allowance in the New Testament for one adult believer to hold authority over another adult believer. Instead, the overall rule calls for mutual submission among all believers out of reverence for Christ\\". The Christian egalitarian hermeneutic has received a highly systematic treatment from William J. Webb, professor of New Testament at Heritage Theological Seminary, Ontario, Canada. Webb argues that a major challenge is determining which biblical commands are \\"transcultural\\" and therefore applicable today, versus those which are \\"cultural\\" and therefore only applicable to the original (1st century) recipients of the text. His \\"redemptive movement\\" hermeneutic is justified using the example of slavery, which Webb sees as analogous to the subordination of women. Christians today largely perceive that slavery was \\"cultural\\" in biblical times and not something that should be re-introduced or justified, although slavery was (a) found in the Bible and (b) not explicitly banned there. Webb recommends that biblical commands be examined in light of the cultural context in which they were originally written. According to the \\"redemptive approach\\", slavery and women's subordination are found in the Bible; however, the same Scriptures also contain ideas and principles which, if developed and taken to their logical conclusion, would bring about the abolition of these institutions.Webb, William J. Slaves, Women & Homosexuals: Exploring the Hermeneutics of Cultural Analysis. InterVarsity Press, 2001. . Webb understands biblical issues of slaves and women to be cultural principles, applicable to that culture, but the biblical principles about homosexuality to be transcultural. According to that ideal, biblical patriarchy should be replaced by the \\"all one in Christ Jesus\\" proclamation of which says \\"There is no Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.\\" Some other New Testament instructions that are almost universally considered \\"cultural\\" and therefore only applicable to the original (1st century) recipients of the text are for women to wear veils when praying or prophesying, Christians to wash each other's feet (a direct command from Jesus in the Upper Room discourse), the instruction, appearing five times in the New Testament, to greet one another with a holy kiss, , , , and ‚Äîamong others. In contrast to egalitarian teaching, complementarians teach that male priority and headship (positional leadership) were instituted prior to the Fall and that the decree in merely distorted this leadership by introducing \\"ungodly domination.\\" Complementarians teach that the male leadership seen throughout the Old Testament (i.e., the patriarchs, priesthood and monarchy) was an expression of the creation ideal, as was Jesus' selection of 12 male apostles and New Testament restrictions on church leadership to men only. Complementarians criticize Webb's hermeneutic. Grudem argues that Webb expects Christians to pursue a \\"superior ethic\\" to that found in the New Testament, therefore undermining the authority and sufficiency of Scripture. He claims that Webb and some other evangelicals misconstrue the biblical teaching about both slavery and women, and inappropriately confuse the two. He writes that slavery is tolerated in Scripture but never commanded but in some cases is criticized, whereas wives are explicitly commanded to submit to their husbands and male leadership is never criticized. Additionally, Grudem believes that Webb's \\"redemptive-movement\\" hermeneutic (itself a variation of the \\"trajectory\\" hermeneutic commonly employed by egalitarians) ultimately relies on subjective judgments that are incapable of producing certainty about ethical views. =Gender and the Image of God= Complementarians have traditionally held that Christian ministers ought to be men, because of the need to represent Jesus Christ, who was the \\"Son\\" of God, and incarnate as a male human being. A related position is that while both male and female were made in the image of God, the woman shares in the divine image through the man because she was created out of him, and is his \\"glory.\\" Christian egalitarians respond by arguing that God is not gendered, and that males and females image God equally and without any differences. In addition, terms such as \\"Father\\" and \\"Son\\", used in reference to God, should be understood as analogies or metaphors used by the biblical authors to communicate attributes about God in a culture where men had social privilege. Similarly, Christ became a male not because it was theologically necessary, but because 1st-century Jewish culture would not have accepted a female Messiah. Wayne Grudem takes exception to these egalitarian arguments, insisting that Christ's maleness was theologically necessary; he also alleges that egalitarians are increasingly advocating that God should be thought of as \\"Mother\\" as well as \\"Father\\", a move which he sees as theologically liberal. The Christian doctrine of the Trinity has become a major focus of the contemporary gender debate, specifically in relation to . In 1977, George W. Knight III argued in a book about gender roles that the subordination of women to men is theologically analogous to the subordination of the Son to the Father in the Trinity. Australian theologian Kevin Giles has more recently responded that complementarians have \\"reinvented\\" the doctrine of the Trinity to support their views of men and women, suggesting that some complementarians have adopted a heretical view of the Trinity similar to Arianism. A vigorous debate has ensued, with some egalitarians moving towards the idea that there is \\"mutual dependence\\" within the Trinity, including \\"subordination of the Father to the Son\\", which must be reflected in gender role relations. Wayne Grudem has countered this by asserting that mutual submission in the Trinity cannot be supported by scripture and church history. =Relationship between ontology and roles= Modern complementarians argue that and establish the full equality of males and females in terms of status, worth and dignity. Complementary roles in marriage and church leadership, including the primary authority of men and the submission of wives, are not thought to contradict this principle of ontological equality. The equation of role or functional subordination and ontological inferiority is considered to be a category confusion. Egalitarian author Rebecca Merrill Groothuis has objected to this position. She argues that \\"woman‚Äôs spiritual and ontological equality with man rules out the sort of subordination prescribed by gender traditionalists‚Ä¶. It is not logically possible for woman to be essentially equal to man, yet universally subordinate to man on the basis of an essential attribute (i.e., femaleness).\\"Rebecca Merrill Groothuis, The Bible and Gender Equality, Christians for Biblical Equality 2005.  Prominent women in the Old Testament  The Fall of Adam and Eve, depicted in the Sistine Chapel by Michelangelo. Christianity developed as a sect of Judaism in the first century AD. It therefore inherited the depictions of women already existing within the Hebrew Bible (known to Christians as The Old Testament). In the Book of Genesis, the first creation story created man and woman at the same time, the second story of creation names Adam and Eve as the first man and the first woman; in the narrative, Adam was created first, and Eve from Adam's rib. Some commentators have suggested that Eve being God's second Creation indicated female inferiority, but in calling Eve \\"flesh of my flesh\\" others say a relationship of equality is implied. Some women were praised in the Books of Ruth and Esther. The Book of Ruth is about a young Moabite woman's loyalty to her Jewish mother-in-law and her willingness to move to Israel and become a part of their culture. The story ends with her praise and blessing as she is married to an Israelite, who announces that he will now take care of her, and subsequently King David comes from her lineage. In the Book of Esther, a young woman named Esther of Jewish lineage is praised for her bravery as the queen of Persia who saved many from being killed by her pleas to the king.The Bible, Book of Ruth and Book of Esther  Women in the New Testament Church  The New Testament sets a values describes Jesus setting a values standard regarding attitudes toward and treatment of women.Bilezikian, Gilbert. Beyond Sex Roles (2nd ed.) Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker, 1989 = Jesus and women = As the founder of Christianity, Jesus never taught nor approved of any kind of subordination of one of his followers over another. Instead, he expressly forbade it in any Christian relationship. All three Synoptic Gospels record Jesus teaching his disciples that any subordination of one to another, both abusive and customary, is a pagan practice‚Äînot something to take place among his followers. Having issued his strong prohibition against subordination of others, he prescribed the Christian alternative to subordination as being the exact opposite: profound service to others, extending even to making the ultimate sacrifice of giving one's life if necessary: His first phrase, \\"lord it over\\", described the Roman dictators who wielded ultimate and unlimited power. His second phrase, \\"high officials\\", referred to lesser Roman officials who, having some limitations of power, \\"exercised authority\\" (not necessarily abusive power) over their citizens. In the nearly identical passages in all three Synoptic gospels, Jesus sternly commanded his disciple that \\"It shall not be so among you\\", clearly forbidding both abusive extreme \\"lording it over\\" others, and even more moderate, ordinary \\"exercise (of) authority\\" over others. Egalitarian Christians consider that this teaching of Jesus to the men who were the 12 Apostles trumps any subsequent teachings of Paul and Peter that Complementarians interpret as establishing \\"Husband-Headship\\" requiring \\"Wife-Submission\\", or denying women opportunities to serve in any leadership position within the Church. Authors Marsh and Moyise also understand this teaching of Jesus to forbid any hierarchy in all Christian relationships, even when there is no connotation of abuse of authority.Marsh, Clive, Steve Moyise. Jesus and the Gospels. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006. The New Testament of the Bible refers to a number of women in Jesus' inner circle‚Äînotably his Mother Mary and Mary Magdalene who is stated to have discovered the empty tomb of Christ and known as the \\"apostle to the apostles\\" since she was the one commissioned by the risen Jesus to go and tell the 11 disciples that he was risen, according to the Gospels. Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery Hermitage Museum, Russia. According to the New Testament, Christ saved a woman accused of adultery from an angry mob seeking to punish her, by saying: \\"He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her\\". Christ in the House of Martha and Mary, Diego Vel√°zquez, 1618. Unusually for his epoch, Jesus is said to have provided religious instruction to women. The Gospel of John‚Äì provides an account of Jesus directly dealing with an issue of morality and women.The passage describes a confrontation between Jesus and the scribes and Pharisees over whether a woman, caught in an act of adultery, ought to be stoned. Jesus shames the crowd into dispersing, and averts the execution with the words: \\"Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.\\" According to the passage, \\"They which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last,\\" leaving Jesus to turn to the woman and say, \\"Go, and sin no more.\\" Another Gospel story concerns Jesus at the house of Martha and Mary where the woman Mary sits at Jesus' feet as he preaches, while her sister toils in the kitchen preparing a meal. When Martha complains to Mary that she should instead be helping in the kitchen, Jesus says that in fact, \\"Mary has chosen what is better\\". The story of Mark 5:23‚Äì34, in which Jesus heals a woman who had bled for 12 year suggests not only that Jesus could cleanse his followers, but this story also challenges Jewish cultural conventions of the time. In Jewish law, women who were menstruating or had given birth were excluded from society. Therefore, the woman in Mark was ostracized for 12 years. Jesus healing her is not only a miracle, but by interacting with an unclean woman, he broke from the accepted practices of the time and embraced women. Both complementarians and egalitarians see Jesus as treating women with compassion, grace and dignity. The gospels of the New Testament, especially Luke, mention Jesus speaking to or helping women publicly and openly., , , Martha's sister Mary sat at Jesus' feet being taught, a privilege reserved for men in Judaism. Jesus had female followers who were his sponsors, and he stopped to express concern for the women of Jerusalem on his way to be crucified. Mary Magdalene is stated in the Gospels to be the first person to see Jesus after his resurrection. In the narratives, Jesus charged her to tell others of what she had seen, even though the testimony of a woman at that time was not considered valid. The historian Geoffrey Blainey wrote that women were more influential during the period of Jesus' brief ministry than they were in the next thousand years of Christianity. Blainey points to Gospel accounts of Jesus imparting teachings to women, as with a Samaritan woman at a well, and Mary of Bethany, who rubbed his hair in precious ointment; of Jesus curing sick women and publicly expressing admiration for a poor widow who donated some copper coins to the Temple in Jerusalem, his stepping to the aid of the woman accused of adultery, and to the presence of Mary Magdalene at Jesus' side as he was crucified. Blainey concludes: \\"As the standing of women was not high in Palestine, Jesus' kindnesses towards them were not always approved by those who strictly upheld tradition.Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011; pp 19-20 According to Blainey,Geoffrey Blainey; A Very Short History of the World; Penguin Books, 2004 women were probably the majority of Christians in the first century after Christ. =Apostle Paul and women= In his writings, the Apostle Paul included various commentaries on women. In his Letter to the Galatians, the Apostle Paul emphasized that Christianity is a faith open to everyone: The letters of St. Paul‚Äîdated to the middle of the 1st century AD‚Äîand his casual greetings to acquaintances offer information about Jewish and Gentile women who were prominent in early Christianity. His letters provide clues about the kind of activities in which women engaged more generally. *He commends with great affection to the Roman community Phoebe, a deaconess of the church at Cenchreae, for she had been the patron of many, including himself. *He greets Priscilla whose formal Latin name was (Prisca), Junia, Julia, and Nereus' sister. * When Paul refers to Priscilla and Aquila,Acts 18:18-19, Acts 18:26, Romans 16:3-4 he lists Priscilla first in 5 of the 7 times they are referred to by their couple name, suggesting to some scholars that she was the head of the family unit. # : There he (Paul) met a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to see them, and because he was a tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them. # : Paul stayed on in Corinth for some time. Then he left the brothers and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. #: They arrived at Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. # : He (Apollos) began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more adequately (·ºÄŒ∫œÅŒπŒ≤Œ≠œÉœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ). # : Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus. They risked their lives for me. Not only I but all the churches of the Gentiles are grateful to them. # : The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house. # : Greet Priscilla and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus. *He praises Junia (or Junias) as \\"prominent among the apostles\\" (NRSV) or \\"well known to the apostles\\" (ESV), who had been imprisoned for their labor. Some theologians understand the name to be that of a woman, suggesting that Paul recognised female apostles in the Church.Wallace, Daniel B. \\"Junia Among the Apostles: The Double Identification Problem in Romans 16:7\\" *Tryphena of Rome, Mary and Persis are commended for their hard work. *Euodia and Syntyche are called his fellow-workers in the gospel. Some theologians believe that these biblical reports provide evidence of women leaders active in the earliest work of spreading the Christian message, while others reject that understanding. There are also Bible verses from Paul's letters which support the idea that women are to have a different or submissive role to men: *\\"A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. But women will be saved through childbearing‚Äîif they continue in faith, love and holiness with propriety.\\" *\\"Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy,\\" *\\" 3But I want you to realize that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. 4Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. 5But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head‚Äîit is the same as having her head shaved. 6For if a woman does not cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head. 7 A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. 8For man did not come from woman, but woman from man; 9 neither was man created for woman, but woman for man. 10It is for this reason that a woman ought to have authority over her own head, because of the angels. 11Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. 12For as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God. 13Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 14Does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, 15but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering. 16If anyone wants to be contentious about this, we have no other practice‚Äînor do the churches of God.\\" *‚ÄúAs in all the churches of the saints, the women should keep silence in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak but should be subordinate, as even the law says. If there is anything they desire to know, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.‚Äù Women in church history=Apostolic age= From the very beginning of the early Christian church, women were important members of the movement, although some complain that much of the information in the New Testament on the work of women has been overlooked.MacHaffie, Barbara J. Her story: women in Christian tradition. Fortress Press, 2006. . Some also argue that many assumed that it had been a \\"man's church\\" because sources of information stemming from the New Testament church were written and interpreted by men. Recently, scholars have begun looking in mosaics, frescoes, and inscriptions of that period for information about women's roles in the early church. The historian Geoffrey Blainey wrote that the early Christian texts refer to various women activists in the early church. One such woman was St. Priscilla, a Jewish missionary from Rome, who may have helped found the Christian community at Corinth. She traveled as a missionary with her husband and St Paul, and tutored the Jewish intellectual Apollos. Others include the four daughters of Philip the Evangelist, from Caesarea, Palestine, who were said to be prophets and to have hosted St Paul in their home.Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011 =Patristic age= From the early patristic age, the offices of teacher and sacramental minister were reserved for men throughout most of the church in the East and West. Tertullian, the 2nd-century Latin father, wrote that \\"It is not permitted to a woman to speak in church. Neither may she teach, baptize, offer, nor claim for herself any function proper to a man, least of all the sacerdotal office\\" (\\"On the Veiling of Virgins\\"). Origen (AD 185-254) stated that, > Even if it is granted to a woman to show the sign of prophecy, she is > nevertheless not permitted to speak in an assembly. When Miriam the > prophetess spoke, she was leading a choir of women ... For [as Paul > declares] \\"I do not permit a woman to teach,\\" and even less \\"to tell a man > what to do.\\"Origen, Fragmenta ex commentariis in epistulam i ad Corinthios In early centuries, the Eastern church allowed women to participate to a limited extent in ecclesiastical office by ordaining deaconesses. St. Helena, mother of the Emperor Constantine, whose conversion to Christianity changed the course of world history. Women commemorated as saints from the early centuries of Christianity include several martyrs who suffered under the Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire, such as Agnes of Rome, Saint Cecilia, Agatha of Sicily and Blandina. The passion of Saints Perpetua and Felicity, written by Perpetua during her imprisonment in 203, recounted their martyrdom. The passion is thought to be one of the earliest surviving documents to have been written by a woman in early Christianity. In late Antiquity, Saint Helena was a Christian and consort of Emperor Constantius, and the mother of Emperor Constantine I. Similarly, Saint Monica was a pious Christian and mother of Saint Augustine of Hippo. In the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Church, the priesthood and the ministries dependent upon it such as Bishop, Patriarch and Pope, were restricted to men. The first Council of Orange (441) forbade the ordination of women to the diaconate. = Middle ages = A knight being armed. Catholic Europe developed the refined warrior code of chivalry during the Middle Ages. Medieval views of women as found in Thomas Aquinas were based on earlier Aristotelian thinking: the male \\"principle\\" sought to reproduce itself and females were considered imperfect \\"defective\\" males. Because women were \\"incomplete\\" they were lustful, seeking fulfillment in sexual intercourse with men. Conversely, men were intellectual and in control of their passions.Church Mother, The Writings of a Protestant Reformer in 16th Century Germany by Katharina Sch√ºtz Zell, 2006 As Western Europe transitioned from the Classical to Medieval Age, the male hierarchy with the Pope at its summit became a central player in European politics. Mysticism flourished and monastic convents and communities of Catholic women became institutions within Europe. With the establishment of Christian monasticism, other influential roles became available to women. From the 5th century onward, Christian convents provided opportunities for some women to escape the path of marriage and child-rearing, acquire literacy and learning, and play a more active religious role. In the later Middle Ages women such as Saint Catherine of Siena and Saint Teresa of Avila, played roles in the development of theological ideas and discussion within the church, and were later declared Doctors of the Roman Catholic Church. The Belgian nun, St Juliana of Li√®ge (1193-1252), proposed the Feast of Corpus Christi, celebrating the body of Christ in the Eucharist, which became a major feast throughout the Church. In the Franciscan movement of the thirteenth century, religious women like St. Clare of Assisi played a significant part. Later, Joan of Arc took up a sword and achieved military victories for France, before being captured and tried as a \\"witch and heretic\\", after which she was burned at the stake. A papal inquiry later declared the trial illegal. A hero to the French, sympathy grew for Joan even in England. Pope Benedict XV canonized Joan in 1920. The historian Geoffrey Blainey, writes that women were more prominent in the life of the Church during the Middle Ages than at any previous time in its history, with a number of church reforms initiated by women. In the 13th century, authors began to write of a mythical female pope‚ÄîPope Joan‚Äîwho managed to disguise her gender until giving birth during a procession in Rome.Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011; p 152. Blainey cites the ever-growing veneration of the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene as evidence of a high standing for female Christians at that time. The Virgin Mary was conferred such titles as Mother of God and Queen of Heaven and, in 863, her feast day, the \\"Feast of Our Lady\\", was declared equal in importance to those of Easter and Christmas. Mary Magdalene's Feast Day was celebrated in earnest from the 8th century on and composite portraits of her were built up from Gospel references to other women Jesus met.Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Penguin Viking; 2011; pp 155-159. St Olga of Kiev was the first Rus ruler to convert to Christianity. Saint Jadwiga of Poland is the patron saint of queens in the Catholic Church. Other than the institution of the convent, monarchy was the major European institution allowing women an alternative to marriage and child rearing. Female monarchs of this period include: Olga of Kiev, who around AD 950, became the first Russian ruler to convert to Christianity; Italian noblewoman Matilda of Tuscany (1046-1115), remembered for her military accomplishments and for being the principal Italian supporter of Pope Gregory VII during the Investiture Controversy; Saint Hedwig of Silesia (1174-1243), who supported the poor and the church in Eastern Europe; and Jadwiga of Poland, who reigned as monarch of Poland and, within the Catholic Church, is honoured as the patron saint of queens and of a \\"united Europe.\\" Saint Elisabeth of Hungary (1207-1231) was a symbol of Christian charity who used her wealth to establish hospitals and care for the poor. Each of these women were singled out as model Christians by Pope John Paul II in his Mulieris Dignitatem letter on the dignity and vocation of women. =Post Reformation= Queen Elizabeth I was a key figure in the consolidation of Protestant Christianity in England. The Reformation swept through Europe during the 16th century. The excommunication of Protestants by leaders of the Roman Catholic Church ended centuries of unity among Western Christendom. The religion of an heir to the throne became an intensely important political issue. The refusal of Pope Clement VI to grant an annulment in the marriage of King Henry VIII to Catherine of Aragon saw Henry establish himself as supreme governor of the church in England. His female Protestant successors have served as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Rivalry between Catholic and Protestant heirs ensued. Protestantism was consolidated in England by Henry's daughter, Elizabeth I, who influenced the development of Anglicanism through cultivation of an Elizabethan religious settlement with the publication of the Book of Common Prayer. The religion of an heir or monarch's spouse complicated intermarriage between royal houses through coming centuries. Consorts of the Holy Roman Emperors were given the title of Holy Roman Empress. The throne was reserved for males, thus there was never a Holy Roman Empress regnant, though women such as Theophanu and Maria Theresa of Austria, controlled the power of rule and served as de facto Empresses regnant. A liberal-minded autocrat, she was a patron of sciences and education and sought to alleviate the suffering of the serfs. She kept Catholic observance at court and frowned on Judaism and Protestantism. She reigned for 40 years, and mothered 16 children including Marie-Antoinette, the ill-fated Queen of France. With her husband she founded the Catholic Habsburg- Lorraine Dynasty who remained central players in European politics into the 20th century. One effect of the Reformation in the Reformed areas was to bring an end to the long tradition of female convents which had existed within Roman Catholicism, and which the Reformers saw as bondage. By shutting down female convents within the movement, Protestantism effectively closed off the option of a full-time religious role for Protestant women, as well as one which had provided some women a life in academic study. However, some convents (such as Ebstorf Abbey near the town of Uelzen and Bursfelde Abbey in Bursfelde) adopted the Lutheran faith. Many of these convents in eastern Europe were closed by communist authorities after the Second World War. They are sometimes called damenstift. One notable damenstift member was Catharina von Schlegel (1697-1768) who wrote the hymn that was translated into English as Be still, my soul, the Lord is on thy side. However, other convents voluntarily folded during the Reformation. For example, following Catherine of Mecklenburg's choice to defy her Catholic husband and smuggle Lutheran books to Ursula of Munsterberg and other nuns, Ursula (in 1528) published 69 articles justifying their reasons to leave their convent. Martin Luther himself taught that \\"the wife should stay at home and look after the affairs of the household as one who has been deprived of the ability of administering those affairs that are outside and concern the state‚Ä¶.\\"Luther, Martin. Lectures on Genesis 3:11. Among the many nuns who chose the domestic life over the monastic life was the wife of Martin Luther, Katherine von Bora. In 1569 Lutheran Magdalena Heymair became the first woman ever to have her writings listed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. She published a series of pedagogical writings for elementary- age teaching and also wrote poetry. Calvinist Anne Locke was a translator and poet who published the first English sonnet sequence. In 1590, Christine of Hesse published the Lutheran psalm-book Geistliche Psalmen und Lieder. John Calvin noted that \\"the woman's place is in the home.\\" The majority of Protestant churches upheld the traditional position,Chrysostom, John. The homilies: Of S. John Chrysostom, archbishop of Constantinople, on the first epistle of St. Paul the apostle to the Corinthians (Library of Fathers of the holy Catholic church). Volume 2. Pub: F. and J. Rivington (1845) Web: 17 Jan 2010. and restricted ruling and preaching roles within the Church to men until the 20th century, although there were early exceptions among some groups such as the Quakers and within some Pentecostal holiness movements. John Knox (1510‚Äì1572) also denied women the right to rule in the civic sphere, as he asserted in his famous First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regimen of Women. Baptist theologian Dr. John Gill (1690‚Äì1771) comments on , stating > () \\"thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.\\" By > this, the apostle signified that the reason women were not to speak in the > church, or to preach and teach publicly, or be concerned in the ministerial > function was that in the Roman Empire, those were considered to be acts of > power and authority, of rule and government, and thus contrary to that > subjection which God in his law requires of women unto men. The > extraordinary instances of Deborah, Huldah, and Anna, must not be drawn into > a rule or example in such cases. Methodist founder John Wesley (1703‚Äì1791) and Methodist theologian Adam Clarke (1762‚Äì1832) both upheld male headship, but allowed that spiritual Christian women could publicly speak in church meetings if they \\"are under an extraordinary impulse of the Spirit\\" (Wesley), and that such were to obey that influence, and that \\"the apostle lays down directions in chap. 11 for regulating her personal appearance when thus employed.‚Äù (Clarke) Puritan theologian Matthew Poole (1624‚Äì1679) concurred with Wesley, adding, > But setting aside that extraordinary case of a special afflatus, [strong > Divine influence] it was, doubtless, unlawful for a woman to speak in the > church.Poole, Annotations upon the Holy Bible (1852) Matthew Henry (1662‚Äì1714) in his commentary, entertains allowing ‚Äúpraying, and uttering hymns inspired‚Äù by women, as such ‚Äúwere not teaching‚Äù. Within the Church of England, King Henry VIII's dissolution of the religious houses swept away the convents which had been a feature of Christianity in England for centuries. Anglican religious orders and Sisterhoods were later re-established within the Anglican tradition however. In Europe, Portugal and Spain remained Catholic and were on the cusp of building global empires. As sponsor of Christopher Columbus' 1492 mission to cross the Atlantic, the Spanish Queen Isabella I (Isabella the Catholic) of Castille was an important figure in the growth of Catholicism as a global religion, for Spain and Portugal followed Columbus' route to establish vast Empires in the Americas. Her marriage to Ferdinand II of Aragon had ensured the unity of the Spanish Kingdom and the royal couple agreed to hold equal authority. Spanish Pope Alexander VI conferred on them the title \\"Catholic\\". The Catholic Encyclopedia credits Isabella as an extremely able ruler and one who \\"fostered learning not only in the universities and among the nobles, but also among women\\". Of Isabella and Ferdinand, it says: \\"The good government of the Catholic sovereigns brought the prosperity of Spain to its apogee, and inaugurated that country's Golden Age\\". In seventeenth-century Massachusetts, Anne Hutchison, a successful preacher and teacher was exiled because she usurped male authority.Canadian Woman Studies: an introductory reader, Ed. Medovarsky, A & Cranney, B., p. 1 Toronto, Canada: Inanna publications and education Many women were martyred during the Counter-Reformation, including the Guernsey Martyrs, three women martyred for Protestantism in 1556. One woman was pregnant and gave birth while being burned, the child was rescued but then ordered to be burned as well. Still other women, such as those living in the Defereggen Valley, were stripped of their children so they could be raised in Catholic in an institution. = Modern times = Anglican and nurse, Florence Nightingale. Christian women played a role in the development and running of the modern world's education and health care systems. President Ronald Reagan of the United States presents Mother Teresa with the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a White House ceremony, 1985 Anti-Death Penalty crusader Sister Helen Prejean in 2006. Amidst the backdrop of Industrial Revolution and expanding European Empires during the 17th-19th centuries, Christian women played a role in developing and running of many the modern world's education and health care systems. However, women \\"still had to work under the nominal control of a man\\" for missionary work as late as the end of the 19th century. Outside of these positions, \\"women were denied other influential public roles in the churches\\". The roles that women began taking began expanding. Catholic religious orders like the Sisters of MercyWikisource:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Sisters of Mercy the Little Sisters of the Poor Sisters of St. Joseph of the Sacred Heart were founded around the world and established extensive networks of hospitals and schools. The Anglican Florence Nightingale was influential in the development of modern nursing. While most Christian denominations did not allow women to preach during the nineteenth century, a few more evangelical Protestant denominations did permit women's preaching. In early-nineteenth- century Britain, the Bible Christians and Primitive Methodists permitted female preaching, and had a significant number of female preachers, particularly among the rural and working-class populations. Some of them emigrated to British colonies, and preached to settlers in colonies including early Canada. By the second half of the nineteenth century these denominations became more institutionalized, and thus less open to women's preaching, although a few women continued to preach in these denominations until the early twentieth century.Deborah Valenze, Prophetic Sons and Daughters (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985); Pamela Walker, \\"Women, Preaching and Spiritual Authority\\", in Women, Gender and Religious Cultures in Britain, 1800-1940, Sue Morgan and Jacqueline deVries, eds., (Routledge 2010) Later in nineteenth-century Britain the Salvation Army was formed, and from the beginning it permitted women to preach on the same terms as men. These \\"Hallelujah Lasses\\", many of whom were working class, were very popular, often drawing huge crowds in Britain as well as in North America.Lillian Taiz, Hallelujah Lads and Lasses, Remaking the Salvation Army in America, 1880-1930 (University of North Carolina Press, 2001), Lynne Marks, \\"Hallelujah Lasses: Women in the Salvation Army in English Canada\\", Gender Conflicts, Franca Iacovetta and Mariana Valverde, eds (University of Toronto Press, 1991) Nonetheless, these denominations remained a minority, and in most Christian churches women remained barred from the ministry into the twentieth century. For much of the early twentieth century, Catholic women continued to join religious orders in large numbers, where their influence and control was particularly strong in the running of primary education for children, high schooling for girls, and in nursing, hospitals, orphanages and aged care facilities. The Second Vatican Council of the 1960s liberalised the strictures of Catholic religious life, particularly for women in holy orders. However, in the latter half of the 20th century, vocations for women in the West entered a steep decline. In spite of that, the Catholic Church conducted a large number of beatifications and canonisations of Catholic women from all over the world: St. Josephine Bakhita was a Sudanese slave girl who became a Canossian nun; St. Katharine Drexel (1858-1955) worked for Native and African Americans; Polish mystic St. Maria Faustina Kowalska (1905-1938) wrote her influential spiritual diary; and German nun Edith Stein was murdered by the Nazis at Auschwitz. Three Catholic women were declared Doctors of the Church, indicating a re-appraisal of the role of women within the life of that Church: the 16th-century Spanish mystic, St. Teresa of √Åvila; the 14th-century Italian mystic St. Catherine of Siena and the 19th-century French nun St. Th√©r√®se de Lisieux (called Doctor Amoris or Doctor of Love). The 19th century saw women begin to push back on traditional female roles in the church. One was Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815‚Äì1902) who worked to \\"liberate women from their traditional shackles\\": > \\"[O]ne of her first projects was a Woman‚Äôs Bible in which the passages used > by men to keep women in subjection were highlighted and critiqued. Although > some early campaigners for female emancipation belonged to the churches, and > though some church-related movements helped nurture women‚Äôs entrance onto > the public stage, the campaigners who embraced the feminist cause most > wholeheartedly nearly always made a break from Church and Biblical > Christianity.‚Äù While Catholicism and Orthodoxy adhered to traditional gender restrictions on ordination to the priesthood, Ordination of women in Protestant churches has in recent decades become increasingly common. The Salvation Army elected Evangeline Booth as its first female General (worldwide leader) in 1934. New Zealander Penny Jamieson became the first woman in the world to be ordained a bishop of the Anglican Church in 1990 (although the queens of England have for centuries inherited the position of the Supreme Governor of the Church of England upon their ascensions to the throne). In the developing world, people continued to convert to Christianity in large numbers. Among the most famous and influential women missionaries of the period was the Catholic nun Mother Teresa of Calcutta, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her work in \\"bringing help to suffering humanity\\". Much admired by Pope John Paul II, she was beatified in 2003, just six years after her death. Many Christian women and religious have been prominent advocates in social policy debates‚Äîas with American nun Helen Prejean, a Sister of Saint Joseph of Medaille, who is a prominent campaigner against the death penalty and was the inspiration for the Hollywood film Dead Man Walking.  Modern views  Linda Woodhead states that, \\"Of the many threats that Christianity has to face in modern times, gender equality is one of the most serious\\". Some 19th-century Christian authorsFor example, Katharine Bushnell, L.A. Starr, Charles H. Pridgeon, Phoebe Palmer, A. J. Gordon, Frances Willard, and many others began codifying challenges to traditional views toward women both in the church and in society. Only since the 1970s have more diverse views become formalized. In addition to non-Christian perspectives, four of the primary views inside Christianity on the role of women are Christian feminism, Christian egalitarianism, complementarianism, and Biblical patriarchy. =Secular criticism= Representing an atheist perspective, author Joshua Kelly argues that the Christian Bible, in this view a creation of ancient authors and medieval editors reflecting their own culture and opinions and not the declarations of a supernatural being, describes and advocates for sexist norms, which should be rejected by modern people. Kelly points to the requirement for women to subordinate themselves to their husbands espoused in the New Testament book of Ephesians, the classification of women as property along with oxen and slaves throughout the Torah, and the permission given by the Book of Exodus for a man to sell his daughter as a slave. = Christian feminism = Christian Feminists take an actively feminist position from a Christian perspective.See Recent generations have experienced the rise of what has been labeled by some as \\"Christian feminism\\" ‚Äîa movement that has had a profound impact on all of life, challenging some traditional basic Christian interpretations of Scripture with respect to roles for women. However, Christian feminism represents the views of the more theologically liberal end of the spectrum within Christianity. In contrast to the more socially conservative Christian egalitarians, Christian feminists tend to support LGBT rights and a pro-choice stance on abortion. The Evangelical and Ecumenical Women‚Äôs Caucus, a major international Christian feminist organization, values \\"inclusive images and language for God\\". = Egalitarian view = Christian Egalitarians' interpretation of Scripture brings them to the conclusion that the manner and teachings of Jesus, affirmed by the Apostle Paul, abolished gender-specific roles in both the church and in marriage. ;Official statement Men, Women and Biblical Equality was prepared in 1989 by several evangelical leaders to become the official statement of Christians for Biblical Equality (CBE). The statement lays out their biblical rationale for equality as well as its application in the community of believers and in the family. They advocate ability-based, rather than gender-based, ministry of Christians of all ages, ethnicities and socio-economic classes. Egalitarians support the ordination of women and equal roles in marriage, and are more conservative both theologically and morally than Christian feminists. ;Christian egalitarian beliefs: *Both women and men were created equal by God *Neither man nor woman was cursed by God at The Fall of Man‚Äî\\"So the Lord God said to the serpent, 'Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life.' The human couple were warned by God in a prophetic sense what would be the natural consequences of sin having entered the human race. The natural consequences of sin mentioned by God in the Creation account included increased pains in childbearing, and the husband will rule over you. *Jesus' radical \\"new Covenant\\" view was correctly articulated by the Apostle Paul when he wrote that \\"...there is no male nor female, for you are all one in Christ.\\" A scripture passage they consider key to the advocacy of full equality of responsibility and authority for both women and men is contained in a Pauline polemic containing these three antitheses: Christian Egalitarians interpret this passage as expressing that the overarching teaching of the New Testament is that all are \\"one in Christ.\\" The three distinctions, important in Jewish life, are declared by Paul to be invalid in Christ. Therefore, among those \\"in Christ\\" there must be no discrimination based on race or national origin, social level, or gender. They respect the natural biological uniqueness of each gender, not seeing it as requiring any dominant/submissive applications of gender to either marriage or church leadership. David Scholer, New Testament scholar at Fuller Theological Seminary, affirms this view. He believes that is ‚Äúthe fundamental Pauline theological basis for the inclusion of women and men as equal and mutual partners in all of the ministries of the church.‚ÄùScholer, David M. ‚ÄúGalatians 3:28 and the Ministry of Women in the Church,‚Äù Theology, News and Notes. Pasadena: Fuller Theological Seminary, June 1998 Galatians 3:28 represents \\"the summation of Paul's theological vision,\\" according to Pamela Eisenbaum, professor at Iliff School of Theology, who is one of four Jewish New Testament scholars teaching in Christian theological schools.Eisenbaum, Pamela. \\"Is Paul the Father of Misogyny and Antisemitism?\\" Cross Currents, Association for Religious and Intellectual Life. Winter 2000-2001, 50:4 Christian Egalitarianism holds that the submission of the woman in marriage and womanly restrictions in Christian ministry are inconsistent with the true picture of biblical equality. The equal-yet- different doctrine taught by Complementarians is considered by them to be a contradiction in terms.Strauch, Alexander. Men and Women, Equal Yet Different: A Brief Study of the Biblical Passages on Gender. Lewis & Roth Publishers, 1999. Linda Woodhead claims that the modern > \\"egalitarian emphasis is contradicted by a symbolic framework that elevates > the male over the female, and by organizational arrangements that make > masculine domination a reality in church life. Theological statements on the > position of women from down the centuries testify not only to the assumption > that it is men who have the authority to define women, but to the > precautions that have been taken to ensure that women do not claim too much > real equality with men ‚Äì in this life at least\\". In their book Woman in the World of Jesus, Evelyn Stagg and Frank Stagg point out that in the Bible the only God-ordained restrictions on the genders is that \\"only the male can beget, and only the female can bear\\". Gilbert Bilezikian, in his book Beyond Sex Roles‚ÄîWhat the Bible Says About a Woman's Place in Church and Family,Bilezikian, Gilbert. Beyond Sex Roles. Baker Books, 1989. argues that the New Testament contains evidence of women apostles,cf. prophets,cf. teachers,cf. deacons, and administrators. Baptist theologian Roger Nicole, considered an expert in Calvinism, is a Christian Egalitarian and a Biblical Inerrantist. He recognizes that biblical egalitarianism is still viewed by many as inconsistent with biblical inerrancy, although he disagrees. He writes that \\"the matter of the place of women in the home, in society, and in the church is not an issue that can be conclusively determined by a few apparently restrictive passages that are often advanced by those who think that subordination represents God‚Äôs will for women.\\"Nicole, Roger. \\"Biblical Egalitarianism and the Inerrancy of Scripture.\\" Priscilla Papers, Vol. 20, No. 2. Spring 2006 A limited notion of gender complementarity is held and is known as \\"complementarity without hierarchy.\\" David Basinger, a doctor of philosophy, says that Egalitarians point out, \\"Few Christians [...] take all biblical mandates literally.\\" Basinger goes on to cite John 13:14 and James 5:14 as commandments prescribed by the Bible which are seldom followed by Christians. Basinger says that this logic indicates that traditional views \\"cannot be argued [...] solely because Paul and Peter exhorted the woman of their day to submit in the home and be silent in the church\\". = Complementarian view = Complementarians believe that God made men and women to be equal in personhood and value but different in roles. They understand the Bible as teaching that God created men and women to serve different roles in the church and the home.Koessler, John. \\"Wounds of a Friend: Complementarian.\\" Christianity Today June 2008, Vol. 52, No. 6. In the 1991 book Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, leading Complementarian theologians outlined what they consider to be biblically sanctioned definitions of masculinity and femininity: : \\"At the heart of mature masculinity is a sense of benevolent responsibility to lead, provide for and protect women in ways appropriate to a man's differing relationships. : \\"At the heart of mature femininity is a freeing disposition to affirm, receive and nurture strength and leadership from worthy men in ways appropriate to a woman's differing relationships.\\" ;Official statement The Danvers Statement on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood was prepared by several evangelical leaders at a Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood (CBMW) meeting in Danvers, Massachusetts, in December 1987. The statement lays out their biblical rationale for male priority and female submission in the community of believers and in the family. Additionally it cites a set of concerns shared by complementarians over other contemporary philosophies about gender: *A growing threat to Biblical authority *Ambivalence about motherhood and homemaking *Claims of legitimacy for illicit sexual relationships and pornography *Cultural uncertainty and confusion over complementary differences between masculinity and femininity *Emergence of roles for men and women in church leadership seen as nonconforming to Biblical teaching *Increasing attention given what they termed to be feminist egalitarianism *Nontraditional reinterpretation of apparently plain meanings of Biblical texts *Unraveling marriages *Upsurge of physical and emotional abuse in the family They attribute these ills to the \\"apparent accommodation of some within the church to the spirit of the age at the expense of winsome, radical Biblical authenticity which‚Ä¶may reform rather than reflect our ailing culture.\\" ;Interpretation of Scripture Complementarians tend to be biblical inerrantists who take a more literal view of biblical interpretation. They disagree with Christian Egalitarians on theological positions related to gender, such as in holding that: *Man was created with \\"headship\\" over the woman by being created first. *Female exclusion from leadership over men is also justified due to her deception by the devil, which resulted in The Fall, for which Adam is also, or primarily, culpable. *Both Old and New Testaments set a pattern of male leadership; for instance the priestly and kingly offices of the Old Testament were restricted to males; the Apostles of Jesus were all male; and Paul's instructions regarding church eldership in the epistles 1 Timothy and Titus appear to restrict this position to men. Primary texts in the New Testament which they believe support male headship include these: : But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. : But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness. : Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. In , Complementarians believe that the Apostle Paul is establishing that all believers, no matter what their racial, social, or gender status, share the same spiritual status in their union with Christ. However, they do not believe that or any other scriptures put an end to positional and functional distinctions based on gender, which they see as being clearly stated and upheld in the New Testament, as a matter of Christian principle. Complementarians' understanding is that both Old and New Testaments do prescribe a male-priority based hierarchy and gender roles in the church and in marriage, where women have equal dignity with men but subordinate roles. = Biblical patriarchy view = Biblical patriarchy as expressed by the Vision Forum is similar to Complementarianism in that it affirms the equality of men and women, but goes further in its expression of the different gender roles. Many of the differences between them are ones of degree and emphasis. While Complementarianism holds to exclusively male leadership in the church and in the home, biblical patriarchy extends that exclusion to the civic sphere as well, so that women should not be civil leaders and indeed should not have careers outside the home. Thus, William Einwechter refers to the traditional Complementarian view as \\"two point complementarianism\\" (male leadership in the family and church), and regards the biblical patriarchy view as \\"three-point\\" or \\"full\\" complementarianism, (male leadership in family, church and society). In contrast to this, John Piper and Wayne Grudem, representing the Complementarian position, say that they are \\"not as sure in this wider sphere which roles can be carried out by men or women\\".John Piper and Wayne Grudem, \\"An Overview of Central Concerns,\\" in Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood: A Response to Evangelical Feminism (Wheaton: Crossway, 1991), 89. Grudem also acknowledges exceptions to the submission of wives to husbands where moral issues are involved. Terminology Although much of the contemporary literature settles on the terms Complementarianism and Christian Egalitarianism, a number of other more pejorative terms are frequently encountered. *In Complementarian literature, the term \\"Christian feminism\\" is sometimes incorrectly used synonymously with \\"egalitarianism.\\" For examples, see books by Wayne Grudem on the topic. Christian Egalitarians generally object to being labeled \\"feminist\\" or \\"evangelical feminist.\\" Their belief in biblical equality is said to be grounded in the biblical teaching that all believers have been given authority in Christ. Conversely, feminist ideology is derived from cultural factors and philosophies. Christian Egalitarian author Rebecca Groothuis writes, \\"Like most cultural systems of thought, feminist ideology is partly true and partly false‚Äîalmost entirely false at this point in history.\\" *In Christian Egalitarian literature, the terms \\"gender traditionalist,\\" \\"patriarchalist\\" and \\"hierarchicalist\\" are sometimes used with reference to Complementarians. The use of these terms in egalitarian literature is defended in . \\"‚Ä¶it is probably most fitting to refer to those who believe in restricting leadership to men as simply advocates of male leadership, or patriarchalists‚Ä¶ traditionalists‚Ä¶ or hierarchicalists.\\" William J. Webb describes himself as a \\"complementary egalitarian.\\" He defines this as \\"full interdependence and 'mutual submission' within marriage, and the only differences in roles are 'based upon biological differences between men and women'.\\" He uses \\"Complementarianism\\" to describe what he calls \\"a milder form of the historical hierarchical view.\\" Complementarian scholar Wayne A. Grudem objects to Webb's use of \\"complementary\\" and \\"egalitarian\\" together to describe a thoroughly egalitarian position. Calling the terminology \\"offensive and confusing,\\" he reasons that doing so simply confuses the issues by using the term \\"complementary\\" for a position totally antithetical to what complementarians hold. Grudem finds Webb's use of the term \\"patriarchy\\" to be especially pejorative because of its connotations in modern society. He also rejects the term \\"hierarchicalist\\" because he says it overemphasizes structured authority while giving no suggestion of equality or the beauty of mutual interdependence.Grudem, Wayne A. \\"Should We Move Beyond the New Testament to a Better Ethic?\\" Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society (JETS), 47/2 (June 2004) 299‚Äì346  See also  *Katharine Bushnell, pioneer Christian feminist *Christians for Biblical Equality, an egalitarian organization *Female disciples of Jesus *Women in the Bible **List of women in the Bible *Threads of Wisdom, book published in January 2018 of the collective wisdom and journeys to marketplace leadership of 10 Christian Women Leaders *List of Christian women of the patristic age *Feminist theology **Women as theological figures *Women and religion **Women in Buddhism **Women in Hinduism **Women in Islam **Women in Judaism **Women in Church history **Impact of Women in the Early Christian Church *Catharism#Role of women and gender *Quaker views of women *Woman's Bible *African and African-American women in Christianity *Cahill, Lisa Sowle.

Although according to the 2001 census they numbered 436, the settlement of Germans in Bulgaria has a long and eventful history and comprises several waves, the earliest in the Middle Ages. Early settlement Many Germans passed through Bulgaria during the eastern Crusades, as Bulgaria lies on the direct land route from Western and Central Europe to the Levant and the Holy Land. They were usually met with hostility as they were negatively disposed to the Orthodox population of the Byzantine Empire (which ruled Bulgaria at the time of the First and Second Crusades) and the Second Bulgarian Empire. Crusaders led by the Frankish noble Renier of Trit established the short-lived Duchy of Philippopolis around what is today Plovdiv, but in 1205 the Latins were routed by Kaloyan of Bulgaria in the Battle of Adrianople, their emperor Baldwin IX of Flanders was captured by the Bulgarians and died in Tarnovo. Kaloyan's daughter Maria was betrothed to the second Latin Emperor, Henry of Flanders, who she is thought to have poisoned. Groups of Saxon ore miners (called —Å–∞—Å–∏, sasi in Bulgarian) are known to have settled in the ore-rich regions of Southeastern Europe. In the 13th-14th century, Germans from the Upper Harz and Westphalia settled in and around Chiprovtsi in modern northwestern Bulgaria (then part of the Second Bulgarian Empire) to extract ore in the western Balkan Mountains, receiving royal privileges from Bulgarian tsar Ivan Shishman. According to some theories, these miners established Roman Catholicism in this part of the Balkans before most of them left following the Ottoman conquest, the rest being completely Bulgarianized (by marrying Bulgarian women) and merging with the local population by the mid-15th century.A hint at their assimilation is the presence of German names with Slavic suffixes in the registers at the time. Along with spreading Roman Catholicism, the Saxons also enriched the local vocabulary with Germanic words and introduced a number of mining techniques and metal-working instruments to Bulgaria. Germans are also thought to have mined ore in the Osogovo and Belasica mountains (between Bulgaria and North Macedonia), as well as around Samokov in Rila and various parts of the Rhodope Mountains and around Etropole, but were assimilated without establishing Catholicism there. After their expulsions from Hungary (1376) and Bavaria (1470), Germanic-speaking Ashkenazi Jews settled in the Bulgarian lands. For their history, see History of the Jews in Bulgaria. Liberated Bulgaria (post‚Äì1878) Following the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878 and its restoration as a sovereign monarchy, all four Bulgarian monarchs were of German descent: Prince Alexander I of Battenberg, as well as Ferdinand, Boris III and Simeon II, all three of Saxe- Coburg and Gotha. German intellectuals, such as architects Friedrich Gr√ºnanger and Viktor Rumpelmayer, arrived in Bulgaria to foster its cultural development. Until World War II, there also existed a small but notable rural German population in several villages scattered in northern Bulgaria. Banat Swabians (part of the larger group of the Danube Swabians) from Austria- Hungary began to settle in the village of Bardarski Geran, Vratsa Province, beginning with seven families in 1893, with their total number later exceeding 90 families. In 1936, they numbered 282. In Bardarski Geran, the Germans built a separate Neo-Gothic Roman Catholic church around 1930 due to conflicts with the local Banat Bulgarians, who had founded the village in 1887. In 1932, a German school was established in Bardarski Geran. In its peak year, 1935, it had a total of 82 students, of whom 50 Germans and 32 Bulgarians. Other Danube Swabian colonists from the Banat settled in another Banat Bulgarian village, Gostilya, Pleven Province, as well as in Voyvodovo, Vratsa Province, which they shared with Evangelist Czechs, Slovaks and Banat Bulgarians. Another notable German colony was Tsarev Brod (old name Endzhe), Shumen Province, founded before 1899,Sorge, Die einstige deutsche Kolonie‚Ä¶ where the Germans lived with many other nationalities and had a private German school. In the beginning of the 20th century, it was inhabited by around 70 German families, and consisted of Dobrujan Germans, Bessarabia Germans and Banat Swabians.Petersen, Handw√∂rterbuch‚Ä¶ On the eve of World War II, Germans in Tsarev Brod constituted the bulk of the village's 420 Catholic parishioners. A German community was also present in Southern Dobruja, a region before 1913 and since 1940 part of Bulgaria, and particularly in the village of Ali Anife (Kalfa), today Dobrevo, Dobrich Province, which was inhabited by Dobrujan Germans since 1903 and in 1943 still had 150 Catholics. It was briefly named Germantsi (‚ÄúGermans‚Äù) in the 1940s. German sources list its population in 1939 as 285, of whom 129 Germans. Those colonists came from Kherson and Crimea (see Crimea Germans) in modern Ukraine. They built a church described as a \\"magnificent Catholic place of worship unmatched in the district\\"; the church was inaugurated on 23 October 1911. Besides rural populations, Germans also settled in Bulgaria's larger cities as part of the group of the so-called \\"Lower Danubian Levantines\\", the Western and Central Europeans in the vibrant port and merchant cities of northern Bulgaria, such as Ruse, Varna, Veliko Tarnovo, Svishtov and Vidin. In the 1860s and 70s, the Austrian citizens in Ruse numbered 200‚Äì300. The first Bulgarian census in 1883 counted 476 Germans in Ruse alone, making them the fifth-largest ethnic group in that city. The bulk of the German population in Bulgaria was resettled within the borders of the Third Reich according to Hitler's Heim ins Reich policy. As a result, 2,150 ethnic German Bulgarian citizens were deported from the country in 1943, including 164 from Bardarski Geran and 33 from Gostilya.–ù—è–≥—É–ª–æ–≤, p. 125. Only a handful of Bulgaria's rural German population remained: for example, in 2003 there were only two elderly German women remaining in Bardarski Geran, Maria Dauerbach and Franziska Welsch; they had not been deported because they had married local Bulgarians.

Plot Pregnant photographer Emma Sloan (Anne Ramsay) arrives at a photo shoot for singer Tyson Ritter of The All- American Rejects, but she quickly realizes there is something wrong when she cannot read the writing on a chalk board on the set. She quickly checks if her smile is crooked, which it is; whether she can hold her arms straight, which she cannot; and whether her speech is slurred, which it is. Realizing what is happening, she tells the stunned people watching her that she is having a stroke before collapsing. House comes in to visit Emma, who is checked in at the hospital. She reveals that she learned the way to self-diagnose a stroke from her baby's gay father which interests House. He runs some tests and determines her kidneys have shut down, and resolves to find the underlying cause of the stroke. Emma is interested in taking photos of House, and the staff is interested in House's photo. House has the staff run tests to determine if she has a blood clot in her heart, while he discusses his vacation plans. Cameron wonders why House did not say anything about seeing her and Chase together. They confirm House's diagnoses and prepare to put in a balloon to clear the clot. Cameron finds House relaxing in a hyperbaric chamber in an attempt to build up his tolerance for high altitude (by reducing the pressure in the chamber instead of the usual increase, effectively making it into a hypobaric chamber), for his upcoming vacation. Cameron confronts him about telling Cuddy about her and Chase. He ducks the matter while Cuddy tells Emma about the treatment they have planned to relieve the pressure on the fetus's urinary bladder. Cuddy then finds House in her office where he questions her diagnosis of urinary bladder blockage, warning the first two tests will be inconclusive. He suggests that Cuddy is sympathizing with Emma as they are both older women having a baby through artificial insemination. Cuddy decides to hand the case back to House. The third test proves positive and Chase gives the results to Emma, who is thankful things will turn out okay. Emma notices that Chase is in love with Cameron when he looks at a picture that Emma took of Cameron that makes him smile, and Emma takes a picture of Chase. The doctors prepare to treat the fetus but discover that Emma is jaundiced and her liver is shutting down. House believes the fetus \\"lied\\" and the urinary tract obstruction is just a sign of something else. With time running out, House suggests there is only one sure cure: to abort the fetus at 21 weeks. House breaks the news to Emma and she wants to wait two weeks until the fetus is viable, but House warns she will not last two days. She refuses to have an abortion and demands House fix it so they can both live. House goes to Cuddy who refuses to go to Emma. It's back to a differential diagnosis with Cuddy running the board. Cuddy suggests that they go through the veins in the neck to get to the liver. House mentions Cameron and Chase are dating, much to Foreman's surprise. Cuddy suggests that an unenthusiastic House go on vacation. Chase and Foreman go ahead with the procedure, but the fetus' heart rate drops and Emma goes into pre-term labor. They manage to stop the contractions, but warn they'll have to remove the fetus. Cuddy insists on finding the problem and suggests they have to check the undeveloped lungs. Cuddy suggests they use steroids to increase the lung growth, yet the staff refuses. Cuddy goes off to do it and Emma has another seizure. Wilson goes in to suggest it's time to terminate and Cuddy tells him to either help or get out. Later, a concerned Cuddy goes to Wilson and admits that everyone was right all along and Emma's lungs are shutting down. She asks him what House would do if he was in her position, and Cuddy concludes that Emma does not need her lungs because she's on a respirator anyway, so she's put the fetus back on steroids. Cuddy goes to House's apartment while he is packing up for his vacation and agrees to look at the tests now that the fetus's lungs have expanded. They go back to the hospital and try to figure out a way to examine the lungs more thoroughly. They finally decide to do exploratory surgery and explain things to Emma. She agrees and they take her into surgery where House and Cuddy assist the operation. During the operation, the fetus's hand emerges weakly and grasps House's index finger. House, in response, pauses for a moment, reacting by touching the tiny hand with his thumb. House stares at the phenomenon in awe, but Cuddy reminds him to proceed, and he snaps back to reality. They find lesions in the fetus's lungs but Emma goes into ventricular fibrillation. House prepares to cut the umbilical cord but Cuddy insists on applying the paddles until Emma is revived, once threatening to electrocute House. Cuddy succeeds, allowing Emma and her son to live. House informs Emma that the baby is now fine and Emma notes that he now calls the child a \\"baby\\" instead of a \\"fetus\\" before thanking him. House tells her to thank Cuddy rather than him because he would have \\"killed the kid\\". Chase meets with Cameron who notices a photo that Emma took of him, one that shows him \\"glowing\\", from earlier when he was looking at a picture of Cameron. Chase refrains from telling this, and when asked by Cameron, simply replies, \\"I always glow\\". Cuddy gives House a ticket for a vacation to Vancouver Island saying that its nice to feel like him by being right, while House counters stating that his solution (abortion) would solve the case ten times out of ten while Cuddy's solution just worked in one out of one hundred cases, saying that she just got lucky. Cuddy is fine with her decision and tells him to go get happy. House goes home and rips up the ticket, then takes the phone off the hook and settles down for a night of television and Vicodin. He is deep in thought as he stares at the finger where the fetus touched him. In a flash-forward, Emma is seen hanging up photos of Cuddy and House's staff though no pictures of House himself are shown. She lifts up her baby son, smiling and mouths \\"Greg\\".

W. F. Hegel's dialectical philosophy into his systematic theology. He regarded his philosophical theology as grounded as well in the works of William Blake and considered his theology to have come into its own with his extended study of Blake's radical visionary thinking: The New Apocalypse: The Radical Christian Vision of William Blake (1967); indeed he regarded himself as the first and only fully Blakean theologian. Education Altizer was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1927,Encyclopedia Britannica article on Thomas J. J. Altizer and grew up with two sisters in Charleston, West Virginia. He attended St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland, and the University of Chicago, from which he received his bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees. His 1951 master's thesis examined the concepts of nature and grace in Augustine of Hippo. His doctoral dissertation in 1955, under the direction by historian of religions Joachim Wach, examined Carl Gustav Jung's understanding of religion. He was assistant professor of religion at Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana, from 1954 to 1956. He went on to become an associate professor of Bible and religion at Emory University from 1956 to 1968. He was professor of Religious Studies at the Stony Brook University from 1968 to 1996. Until his death in 2018, he was Professor Emeritus of Religious Studies at the university. \\"Death of God\\" controversy During Altizer's time at Emory, two Time magazine articles featured his religious views‚Äîin the October 1965 and April 1966 issues. The latter issue, published at Easter time, put the question on its cover in bold red letters on a plain black background: \\"Is God Dead?\\" Altizer repeatedly claimed that the scorn, outcry, and even death threats he subsequently received were misplaced. Altizer's religious proclamation viewed God's death (really a self-extinction) as a process that began at the world's creation and came to an end through Jesus Christ‚Äîwhose crucifixion in reality poured out God's full spirit into our world. In developing his position Altizer drew upon the dialectical thought of Hegel, the visionary writings of William Blake, the anthroposophical thought of Owen Barfield, and aspects of Mircea Eliade's studies of the sacred and the profane. In the mid-1960s Altizer was drawn into discussions about his views with other radical Christian theologians such as Gabriel Vahanian, William Hamilton, and Paul Van Buren, and also the rabbi Richard Rubenstein. Those religious scholars collectively formed a loose network of thinkers who held different versions of the death of God. Altizer also entered into formal critical debates with the evangelical Lutheran John Warwick Montgomery, and the Christian countercult movement apologist Walter Martin. The evangelical theologians faulted Altizer on philosophical, methodological and theological questions, such as his reliance on Hegelian dialectical thought, his idiosyncratic semantic use of theological words, and the interpretative principles he used in understanding biblical literature. In Godhead and the Nothing (2003), Altizer examined the notion of evil. He presented evil as the absence of will, but not separate from God. Orthodox Christianity‚Äîconsidered nihilistic by Nietzsche‚Äînamed evil and separated it from good without thoroughly examining its nature. However, the immanence of the spirit (after Jesus Christ) within the world embraces everything created. The immanence of the spirit is the answer to the nihilistic state that Christianity, according to Nietzsche, was leading the world into. Through the introduction of God in the material world (immanence), the emptying of meaning would cease. No longer would followers be able to dismiss the present world for a transcendent world. They would have to embrace the present completely, and keep meaning in the here and now. Beginning in 1996 Altizer lived in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania. His 2006 memoir is entitled Living the Death of God. See also * Christian atheism * Christian heresy in the modern era#Thomas J. J.

Later that season he made his championship debut against Limerick. He became the first-choice centre-back the following year, however, Tipperary lost a second successive Munster final to Cork. In 2008 Tipp remained undefeated in the National League before meeting Galway in the final. In an exciting game Tipp emerged victorious by 3-18 to 3-16 and O'Mahony collected his first National League winners' medal. Tipperary later reached the Munster final where they defeated a resurgent Clare team by 2-21 to 0-19. It was O'Mahony's first Munster winners' medal. Tipperary were subsequently defeated in a tense All-Ireland semi-final by Waterford on a scoreline of 1-20 to 1-18. In spite of falling short O'Mahony was later presented with his first All-Star award. O'Mahony won his second Munster medal in 2009 as Tipp defeated Waterford by 4-14 to 2-16. After a six-week lay-off and a facile semi-final win over Limerick, Tipp qualified for an All-Ireland final meeting with Kilkenny. For much of the match it looked as if Tipp would pull off a shock and deny 'the Cats' a record-equaling four-in-a-row. Two quick goals in the space of a minute, one from a penalty by Henry Shefflin, sealed a 2-22 to 0-23 victory and defeat for Tipperary. O'Mahony later collected a second All-Star award. After surrendering their Munster title to Cork at the first hurdle in 2010, Tipperary regrouped in the qualifiers and reached a second successive All-Ireland decider. Kilkenny, a team chasing a fifth successive championship, provided the opposition and a great game was expected. Tipperary got off to a great start which was bolstered by an early Lar Corbett goal. He subsequently completed a hat-trick of goals and Tipperary had a fourth by Noel McGrath to deny Kilkenny's drive-for-five and secure a remarkable and convincing 4-17 to 1-18 victory. It was O';Mahony's first All- Ireland medal in any grade. Tipperary returned as provincial kingpins once again in 2011. A 7-19 to 0-19 trouncing of Waterford in the southern decider gave O'Mahony a third Munster medal. For the third successive year, Tipperary faced off against Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final, however, on this occasion Kilkenny were slight underdogs going up against the new champions. Kilkenny started quickly and never surrendered the lead in the 2-17 to 1-16 victory. In spite of an indifferent National League campaign, Tipperary were regarded as potential All-Ireland champions once again. A 2-17 to 0-16 defeat of Waterford in the provincial decider gave O'Mahony a fourth Munster medal in five seasons. Tipperary later faced a humiliating 4-24 to 1-15 defeat by eventual champions Kilkenny in the All-Ireland semi-final. O'Mahony retired from inter- county hurling in November 2015. =Inter-provincial= O'Mahony has also lined out with Munster in the Inter-provincial Championship. He won his sole Railway Cup medal as a non-playing substitute in 2007 as Munster defeated Connacht.

Proposed by the coalowners but underwritten by the wealthy Barry Railway Company, it opened in 1897 from near Bridgend to Barry, in Wales. It immediately suffered a major subsidence on Porthkerry Viaduct and was closed; a temporary by-pass line enabled reopening until the viaduct was partly reconstructed in 1900. After 1923 the mineral traffic declined slowly, followed by a loss of passenger and general merchandise business. Passenger trains were discontinued from 15 June 1964. In 1979, the Ford Bridgend Engine Plant was established at Bridgend, served by a private siding off the line. On 10 June 2005, a passenger train service was reinstated, serving Rhoose for Cardiff Airport and Llantwit Major only. Early transport needs The area known as the Vale of Glamorgan, the tract of land close to the north bank of the Bristol Channel between Cardiff and Ogmore-by-Sea was largely agricultural in the early nineteenth century, and it became by-passed when the South Wales Railway built its main line between Cardiff and Swansea. System map of the Vale of Glamorgan RailwayMuch of the mineral wealth of the South Wales Valleys‚Äîmostly coal but also iron ore and smelted iron and iron products‚Äîwas taken to Bristol Channel ports for onward transport. Newport, Cardiff and Swansea were dominant in these activities. There were other small harbours but they had limitations which had discouraged development as industrialisation gathered pace.Colin Chapman, The Vale of Glamorgan Railway, Oakwood Press, Usk, 1998, The Cowbridge Railway opened in 1865, giving a branch line connection to the market town of Cowbridge from Llantrisant station.Colin Chapman, The Cowbridge Railway, Oxford Publishing Company, Poole, 1984, The Cowbridge Railway merely gave a railway connection to the market town, and it fell to the Ogmore Dock and Railway Company to get an Act for a mineral connection, on 20 August 1883. However the prospective company needed substantial Great Western Railway support and this was not forthcoming, so that the scheme eventually foundered. Barry Railway At Cardiff the volume of minerals transported increased beyond expectation, and quickly overwhelmed the capacity of the dock installations to handle them. Moreover the railway connections to them also were soon heavily congested, and this led to dissatisfaction among the coalowners and other industrialists who used them.D S Barrie, The Barry Railway, Oakwood Press, Usk, reprinted 1983, In 1884 the Barry Dock and Railway Company (later simply the Barry Railway) was incorporated, with the intention of building new dock facilities with modern mechanical handling equipment at Barry, and building a new railway to bring coal and other minerals from the Rhondda down to Barry. It opened its main line in 1889. The Barry Railway was soon successful, and built extensions to the docks and new connecting lines to existing railways. Collieries and their traffic Colonel John North acquired six collieries in the valleys immediately north of Bridgend, and in 1889 he established a company, North's Navigation Collieries (1889) Limited, to manage them. Like other coal owners in the Llynvi, Garw and Ogmore Valleys, his company used Porthcawl to load to shipping, but the harbour there had very limited capacity. The alternative was over the Llynvi and Ogmore Railway and to Barry via Peterston and the spur to Drope Junction, or of course to Penarth or Cardiff. The GWR made some improvements to the L&OR; lines, but the very severe gradients limited the value of this line. It was felt by North and others that the GWR was obstructing the development of their traffic; meetings with the GWR requesting a reduction in the carriage rate had met with refusal. At the same time as North was establishing his company, he and others engaged in the trade met together and decided that the solution was a new railway to the Barry. They approached the Barry Railway, which agreed to work the line when built, for 60% of gross receipts. Vale of Glamorgan Railway proposed They promoted the Vale of Glamorgan Railway in the 1889 session of Parliament, and it received the Royal Assent on 26 August 1889. Authorised capital was ¬£360,000; it was to build from a junction at Coity Lower on the Llynvi & Ogmore line, a little north of Bridgend, to Barry, a distance of 21 miles; in addition there was to be a branch to the Great Western Railway station at Bridgend, and running powers into the station were included. The Vale of Glamorgan Railway shared many directors with the Barry Railway Company. However the VoGR company found it difficult to raise the capital it needed to build its line: by 15 July 1890 less than half, at ¬£171,000, had been subscribed for. The company approached contractors to see if they would build the line and take shares in payment, but this was unsuccessful. Time went by without further progress, until on 2 December 1892 the VoGR directors met the Barry Railway Board again to discuss a way forward. The Cowbridge and Aberthaw Railway had opened to passenger traffic on 1 October 1892, and this company was in the rival Taff Vale Railway camp. The Barry Railway was anxious to secure its western flank against the rival, and keeping the VoGR scheme alive was strategically important. Working arrangements with the Barry Railway were arrived at, by which the Barry Railway guaranteed a dividend of 4% on the capital of the VoGR. This immediately secured the willingness of investors to take VoGR shares. The Barry Railway made this offer conditional on its taking full control of the VoGR. The arrangement was authorised by the Barry Railway Act of 24 August 1893, and ratified by the proprietors of both companies on 28 May 1894. North's colliery company undertook to send 360,000 tons of coal annually over the line, and the Ocean Coal Company promised half of its output from the Garw Valley. A tender of Pethick Brothers to construct the Barry to Ewenny section for ¬£182,444 was quickly approved. Three successive extensions of time had to be sought from Parliament because of the delay. The local geology was limestone and much of the construction involved excavating the rocky material.D S M Barrie, revised Peter Baughan, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 12: South Wales, David St John Thomas, Nairn, 1994, When the VoGR line had been designed, it was expected that the Ogmore Dock and Railway Company would construct a line diverging from the L&OR; line from Tondu to Bridgend, and passing east of Bridgend and running south-west to a new dock at Ogmore. The VoGR would have passed to the west of Bridgend to join the Tondu line, with a spur to the OD&R; and a south-to-east curve to enter Bridgend station from the west. The OD&R; proposals had in fact been withdrawn and its authorisation was abandoned, so that this complex arrangement was now unnecessary. The alignment of the VoGR was therefore altered to approach the Tondu line by passing Bridgend on the east side, with a short spur to enter Bridgend station from the east. This arrangement was cheaper, and it was authorised by Act of 20 June 1895.Clive Smith, Railways of the Llynfi Valley, Alun Books, Port Talbot, 1985, Incidentally, running powers had been south to Tondu in the authorising Act but this had been refused, obliging the company to exchange mineral traffic at Coity Junction. It had been originally intended to construct the line as single track, taking land for subsequent widening to double track. In August 1894 it was decided to make the track in Porthkerry Tunnel double track, and on 5 October the Board decided on double track from Barry to Rhoose. By 7 June the decision was made to construct in double track throughout the line, in view of the heavy mineral traffic expected to be running. In 1895 additional capital for this work was authorised by Act of Parliament. During the construction work, pier no 10 of Porthkerry Viaduct, near the Barry end, subsided by several feet on 18 August 1896; it was followed by a major settlement of pier no 11, and later no 12. Stabilisation measures were put in hand, but this was a sign of future trouble. Nevertheless the line was considered to be ready towards the end of 1897 and Colonel Yorke of the Board of Trade visited on 6 November 1897 to assess the line for passenger operation. He expressed himself very dubious of the stability of Porthkerry Viaduct, but he permitted the operation of passenger trains for a period of three months, subject to further appraisal then. Meanwhile speed on the line as a whole was to be limited to 25 mph and over the viaduct to 20 mph; a watchman was to be employed at the viaduct. Watchmen were to be posted around the clock, and to examine the viaduct over and under after the passage of every train; special signals were provided so that they could stop traffic if necessary.Evidence given to Lt-Col H A Yorke, reported to the Board of Trade on 6 April 1898 The line was accordingly opened to passenger traffic on 1 December 1897, although it is known that two special passenger trains ran over the line prior to that date. There were further signs of ground movement at Porthkerry on 16 December 1897, and on 10 January 1898 there was a very serious slip at pier 13, the easternmost pier, closing the line. On 3 February 1898 the Board approved construction of a temporary loop line by-passing the viaduct, at a cost of ¬£5,647. It made a large sweep to the north following the contours of the ground, although it had a maximum gradient of 1 in 40. It was single track, 2 miles 44 chains in extent. There was a 10 mph speed restriction on it. Colonel Yorke visited on 19 April 1898 and passed it for passenger operation, and it opened on 25 April 1898. Reconstruction of the failed viaduct arches was paid for by the Barry Railway, the VoGR Act of 1899 authorising ¬£120,000 of additional capital. It was discovered that the piers had been founded on rock that was not bedrock, but in fact a layer of stone on shale and silt. The reconstruction involved the demolition of the affected piers and the sinking of new foundations down to rock. The eastern abutment was moved back and two new spans with their own piers were constructed. The process took until early 1900, when the viaduct was reopened for goods trains on 8 January 1900, Colonel Yorke reinspected the viaduct on 13 March 1900 and was satisfied with the remedial measures, and the viaduct reopened for passenger traffic on 9 April 1900. The expenditure in building the line was \\"close on ¬£700,000\\" according to the Barry Railway General Manager, Edward Lake.G A Sekon, Illustrated Interview with Mr Edward Lake, General Manager of the Barry Railway, in the Railway Magazine, October 1906 London and South Wales Railway The Great Western Railway had long been the monopoly carrier of traffic by rail from South Wales to London, and dissatisfaction with the GWR had been a continuing issue for many. In 1895 a proposed London and South Wales Railway was put forward, to build a new line from Cogan on the Barry Railway approaching Cardiff, and running to join the Metropolitan Railway north of London. The Barry Railway was the prime mover in this, and at the same time the Vale of Glamorgan Railway, under the control of the Barry, submitted a Bill for a westward extension of the VoGR to Swansea, building a new line from Ewenny through Porthcawl to join the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway. Together the two schemes would provide a new line from Swansea to London. D S Barrie said, \\"Beyond all reasonable doubt, the real object of the London & South Wales promoters was to force the Great Western Railway to carry out its South Wales Direct Line, and to make certain concessions to the South Wales coal trade. \\" This motivated to GWR to build its long-planned South Wales Direct Line, from Wootton Bassett to Patchway via Badminton. When the GWR gave definite undertakings to do so, the London and South Wales Railway scheme and the VoGR Swansea scheme were withdrawn.B G Wilson, The London & South Wales Railway, in the Railway Magazine, October 1956 Amalgamation with the Barry Railway considered The Vale of Glamorgan Railway Company had been under the control of the Barry Railway from the outset, and from time to time full amalgamation was considered; specifically in August 1898 and November 1902. In those cases it was not considered to be an auspicious time for the merger, and in fact the VoGR remained nominally independent. Motor Cars (Steam Railmotors) In the 1900s many railway companies experimented with Steam railmotors or Motor Cars as they were known in South Wales, passenger coaches with integrated small steam engines. The intention was to provide passenger calls at places where the traffic did not justify construction of a full station, and often the railmotor stopping places were rudimentary very short ground level platforms. The Barry Railway adopted this system on its main line from Barry to Pontypridd, but after a month they were withdrawn, following complaints; as well as public dissatisfaction they were unable to cope with the gradients on that line. Two railmotors were redeployed to the VoGR line, operating between Barry and Llantwit Major. New halts were authorised by the Board on 2 June 1905, to be built at Fontigary, Llandow and St Brides Major. In fact these were never built, and the Barry Railway experiment with railmotors was unsuccessful.>H Morgan, South Wales Branch Lines, Ian Allan Limited, Shepperton, 1984, Peter Dale, Glamorganshire's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing Ltd., 2014, Limestone and cement The construction of the Vale of Glamorgan Railway had been made more difficult by the existence of limestone ground conditions that were prevalent in the area. The traffic arising from the areas served by the line was agricultural and rural, but in December 1888 there was a limestone works at Aberthaw, but it had become disused by the time the VoGR was opened for traffic. Lime works were opened later at a number of points along the line, and large scale industrial portland cement operations were started at Rhoose in 1911 and at Aberthaw in 1913, initially by different companies but later to become Aberthaw & Bristol Channel Portland Cement Company Limited. Grouping of the railways In 1922 most of the railways of Great Britain were compulsorily restructured into one or other of four new large concerns, following the Railways Act 1921. The new Great Western Railway was one of the groups, and the Barry Railway, as well as the old Great Western Railway, were constituents of it. The Vale of Glamorgan Railway Company was of course only a financial entity. It was absorbed as a subsidiary of the new Great Western Railway from 1 July 1922. Its issued capital was recorded as ¬£660,000, and its net income in 1921 was ¬£27,440, paying a dividend in 1921 of %. Its route length was miles.Peter Semmens, History of the Great Western Railway: 1: Consolidation, 1923 - 1929, George Allen and Unwin, London, 1985, Studio Editions reprint 1990, After 1923 At this time the coal industries of South Wales had passed the peak (which had been in 1913) and coal traffic on the line was declining. Passenger and general merchandise too was seeing the effects of road competition, which appeared in many cases to be more convenient. During World War II a number of ordnance depots were built in South Wales. One was at Brackla Hill, with a rail connection from the line between Coity Junction and Cowbridge Road Junction; another was at Tremains on the Great Western Railway main line immediately east of the point where the VoGR line to Coity Junction crossed. A south-to-east spur was built, giving access from the VoGR line in to the Tremains depot sidings. From 1948 Nationalisation of the railways took place at the beginning of 1948, from which time the VoGR network was part of British Railway. A coal fired power station was constructed at Aberthaw; it started generating on 7 February 1960; it had a branch line access from the VoGR line, which was miles in length; the branch was fully commissioned in 23 July 1961. Southerndown Road station was located remote from any centre of population, and passenger carrying had always been minimal; the station was closed on 23 October 1961; on 16 June 1962 the passenger service throughout the VoGR line was reduced considerably, with the Sunday service being discontinued. This only delayed the total closure of the passenger service, which took place on 15 June 1964. The mineral traffic from the Tondu line had also collapsed by this time and the Cowbridge Road Junction to Coity Junction section was closed on the same day, except for half a mile serving Bridgend and Coity goods until 28 November 1977. The line remained open for freight traffic, chiefly concerned with Aberthaw power station. During engineering work on the main line between Cardiff and Bridegnd the line was frequently used for diversionary purposes. Revival from 1968 A second power station was constructed at Aberthaw, opening as Aberthaw \\"B\\" on 10 December 1968, and bringing further coal traffic to the line. The Ford Motor Company established the Ford Bridgend Engine Plant in 1979. Although it was close to the South Wales Main line it proved more convenient to provide a railway connection two miles long from the VoGR line; this was commissioned on 15 January 1980. A new siding layout for Aberthaw cement works was provided from 16 October 1980. Rhoose cement works closed in 1987 and has since been demolished along with the former Turner's Asbestos works alongside it and the land has been considerably remodelled some of which is now occupied by new housing along with that of housing in the former main quarry. Aberthaw \\"A\\" power station closed in 1996. There had long been calls for the line to be reopened for passenger services, and on 12 Nune 2005 this happened. An hourly local service has since operated between Bridgend and Barry, continuing to Cardiff and Abdrdare. Intermediate stations were reopened at Llantwit Major and Rhoose, now renamed Rhoose Cardiff International Airport. The present day At present (2017) the line carries a weekday hourly and two-hourly Sundays passenger service from Bridgend to Barry, continuing to Aberdare of Merthyr generally. The political imperative of a rail connection to Rhoose for the airport is significant. The Ford Motor Company traffic continues as do coal deliveries to Aberthaw \\"B\\" power station (2017). Following a previous break, in 2017 rail cement traffic was occasionally run from Aberthaw Cement works (now a laFarge Tarmac Company, part of the CRH Group).

About In 2007, Asia Press began publishing a magazine entitled Rimjin-gang: News from Inside North Korea in Korean and Japanese. It was started by a Japanese and Korean co-joint editorial group, a chief editor and Japanese journalist, Jiro Ishimaru, and a Korean representative editor, Choi Jin I, author and North Korean defector. Rimjingang secretly operates with journalists and reporters hidden within North Korea. The magazine aims to bring outside news to the people of North Korea. The reporters, North Korean civilians and defectors who receive media training in China from the Asia Press North Korea reporting team, are able to use techniques such as hidden cameras to create their articles. Reporters learn journalistic principles as well as personal computer skills. After the fourth issue of the Korean edition was released, Choi Jin I left the group and began releasing her own periodical called Imjingang in the Korean language in Seoul in April 2009. One of the major reasons for the \\"divergence\\" was said to be that Imjingang intended to be rather a communication tool for defectors and North Koreans while Rimjingang aspires to be a project purely for journalistic activities and to foster journalists and journalism in North Korea. Since then, Choi Jin I has made Imjingang a completely independent magazine, which is no longer connected with Asia Press. Rimjingang, published in Japanese/English, in Japan and Imjingang published in South Korea are no longer related. Rimjingang's reports are smuggled out of North Korea via China and printed in Japan. Their pictures and footage have been delivered to major newspapers and magazines all over the world, such as The Washington Post, The Economist, The Nation, The Wall Street Journal, and the Japan Times. Rimjingang's reports were quoted by the New York Times and Newsweek magazine. For TV, it was aired on various stations such as BBC (UK), Channel 4 (UK), KBS (South Korea), ARD (Germany), Al-Jazeera (Arabic Satellite), ABC (Australia), TBS and TV-Asahi (Japan), PBS (United States), etc. In 2010, the magazine published a video of a woman foraging for food in North Korea which received worldwide attention.https://www.youtube.com/user/ASIAPRESSrimjingang#p/u/1/Xh4CtTGAzKw Currently, the Japanese edition of the magazine is published periodically. In October 2010, Rimjingang released its first English hardcover edition.http://www.asiapress.org/rimjingang/english/cover/index.html The name Rimjingang is also the North Korean name for the Imjin River, which crosses the demilitarized zone and flows into South Korea from the North. One of the magazine's North Korean journalists chose this name to symbolize sending the thoughts of the North Korean people to their brothers and sisters in the South.

The adult beetles are relatively large, ranging between two and four centimeters long, and are usually a rusty red colour‚Äîbut many colour variants exist and have often been classified as different species (e.g., Rhynchophorus vulneratus). Weevil larvae can excavate holes in the trunk of a palm trees up to a metre long, thereby weakening and eventually killing the host plant. As a result, the weevil is considered a major pest in palm plantations, including the coconut palm, date palm and oil palm.Rhynchophorus ferrugineus at North American Plant Protection Organization (NAPPO) Originally from tropical Asia, the red palm weevil has spread to Africa and Europe, reaching the Mediterranean in the 1980s. It was first recorded in Spain in 1994,Ferry & G√≥mez. 2002. The red palm weevil in the Mediterranean. Vol. 46, No 4, Palms (formerly Principes), Journal of the International Palm Society. link http://www.palms.org/palmsjournal/2002/redweevil.htm link and in France in 2006. Additional infestations have been located in Malta, Italy (Tuscany, Sicily, Campania, Sardinia, Lazio, Marche, Puglia and Liguria), Croatia and Montenegro. It is also well established throughout most of Portugal, especially in the South.\\"As palmeiras ainda podem ganhar a guerra contra o escaravelho-vermelho\\" Article in publico.pt, February 9th, 2014 It also has established in Morocco, Tunisia, and other North African countries. CABI fact Sheet The weevil was first reported in the Americas on Cura√ßao in January 2009\\"Biologische bestrijding Red Palm Weevil\\" Ben Kleine, March 28th, 2009 on Amigo.com and sighted the same year in Aruba.2010 California Farmer periodical \\"World's worst palm pest in state\\" Richardson It was reported in the United States at Laguna Beach, California late in 2010 Orange County Register, \\"Destructive exotic beetle found in Laguna Beach.\\" CDFA; Red Palm Weevil, Worst Known Pest of Palm Trees Detected in Laguna Beach but this was a misidentification of the closely related species, Rhynchophorus vulneratus, and it did not become established.Hoddle et al. (2017) The palm weevil Rhynchophorus vulneratus is eradicated from Laguna Beach. California Agriculture 71(1): 25-29 Larvae of Rhynchophorus ferrugineus are considered a delicacy in Southeast Asian cuisine. In some regions, however, larvae farming is strictly prohibited to prevent the potential devastation of plantation crops.Direction 01-2015-CT-UBND that prohibits the cultivation of Asian palm weevil at Ben Tre, Vietnam (in Vietnamese) Taxonomy Primarily due to the existence of numerous color forms across their ranges, the taxonomy and classification of red palm weevils has undergone a number of changes in understanding and circumscription. As such, the information in the literature should be viewed as a compilation of data which may apply to both species, depending primarily upon the biogeography; accordingly, the vast majority of publications presumably do refer to R. ferrugineus rather than vulneratus, as the former is by far the most widely invasive. The most recent genus-level revision in 1966Wattanapongsiri, A. 1966. A revision of the genera Rhynchophorus and Dynamis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Department of Agriculture Science Bulletin 1: 1-328 recognized two species of red palm weevil, ferrugineus and vulneratus, and for decades these were interpreted as separate taxa. A genetic study in 2004Hallett, R.H., Crespi, B.J., Borden, J.H. 2004. Synonymy of Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier), 1790 and R. vulneratus (Panzer), 1798 (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Rhynchophorinae). J. Nat. Hist. 38:2863-2882 concluded that vulneratus was not distinct from ferrugineus, and treated them as synonyms, a view that was accepted until 2013, when yet another genetic study came to the opposite conclusion, based on more comprehensive geographic sampling. Accordingly, the \\"red palm weevil\\" species that appeared in the US was vulneratus rather than ferrugineus, though the latter is the invading species in all of the other global introductions. Distribution=Range= The native range of this species is considered to include Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Laos, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, and Vietnam; records from Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, and Thailand largely or exclusively refer to R. vulneratus. R. ferrugineus has now been reported and confirmed from Albania, Algeria, Aruba, Bahrain, Croatia, Cura√ßao, Cyprus, Egypt, France (incl. Corsica), Greece, Israel, Italy (incl. Sicily and Sardinia), Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Portugal (incl. Madeira), Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Spain (incl. the Balearic and Canary islands), Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, and United Arab Emirates. Records from Australia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu have not been confirmed and are likely to be specimens of Rhynchophorus bilineatus, a closely related species indigenous to the region. =Hosts= This species of red palm weevil is reported to attack 19 palm species worldwide. Although the weevil was first reported on coconut in Southeast Asia, it has gained a foothold on date palm over the last two decades in several Middle Eastern countries, and then expanded its range to Africa and Europe.Malumphy, C; Moran, H. 2007. Red palm weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus. Plant Pest Notice, Central Science Laboratory (50): 1-3. This expansion has been due to the movement of infested planting material from contaminated to uninfected areas. In the Mediterranean region, the red palm weevil also severely damages Phoenix canariensis. Currently, the pest is reported in almost 15% of the global coconut-growing countries and in nearly 50% of the date palm-growing countries.A review of the issues and management of the red palm weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Coleoptera: Rhynchophoridae) in coconut and date palm during the last one hundred years. J.R. Faleir The list of known hosts includes: Areca catechu, Arenga pinnata, Borassus flabellifer, Caryota maxima, C. cumingii, Cocos nucifera (coconut palm), Corypha gebanga, C. elata, Elaeis guineensis, Livistona decipiens, Metroxylon sagu, Oreodoxa regia, Phoenix canariensis, P. dactylifera (date palm), P. sylvestris, Sabal umbraculifera, Trachycarpus fortunei, Washingtonia spp. FDACS Pest Alert Lab studies have reared the insect on diets of Agave americana and Saccharum officinarum, but these findings have not been observed in the wild. There is evidence that the weevil prefers the 'Sukkary' cultivar of date palm to other cultivars.Al- Ayedh, H. 2008. Evaluation of date palm cultivars for rearing the red date palm weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Coleoptera: Curculonidae). Florida Entomologist, 91(3): 353 - 358. The palm species Washingtonia filifera and Chamaerops humilis may be resistant to the red palm weevil. Life cycle This weevil usually infests palms younger than twenty years.Abraham, V.A., Al- Shuaibi. Mahmood, J.R., Faleiro, R.A. Abozuhairah and P.S.P.V. Vidyasargar. 1998. An integrated approach for the management of red palm weevil, Rhyncophorus ferrugineus Oliv. - A key pest of date palm in the Middle East. Sultan Qaboos University Journal of Scientific Research, Agricultural Science, 3: 77-83. While the adult causes some damage through feeding, it is the burrowing of the larva into the heart of the palm that can cause the greatest mortality of trees. The adult female lays approximately two hundred eggs on new growth in the crown of the palm, at the base of young leaves, or in open lesions on the plant. The egg hatches into a white, legless larva. The larva will feed on the soft fibres and terminal buds, tunneling through the internal tissue of the tree for about a month. The larvae can occasionally grow to a length of six to seven centimeters. At pupation, the larva will leave the tree and form a cocoon built of dry palm fibers in leaf litter at the base of the tree. The total life cycle takes about 7‚Äì10 weeks. =Oviposition= After fertilization, the adult female can lay between 300 and 500 eggs. They lay in holes they produced while searching for food, or take advantage of the cracks or wounds in a recently cut palm. At oviposition, females bend upward and the tarsi are anchored to the tissue with the spines of the third pair of legs to push the ovipositor into the tough palm tissue. After laying, the female protects and secures the eggs with a secretion that rapidly hardens around the eggs. On average, females produce 210 eggs per clutch, most of which hatch over a period of 3 days. The eggs are white, cylindrical, glossy, oval shaped, and measure 1 to 2.5 mm. The back of these eggs possess special 'gill cover' structures that provide the developing insect with oxygen. =Larvae= The neonate larvae are yellow-white, segmented, legless, and have a chitinous head capsule that is a darker brown than the rest of the body. They have powerful horizontal conical jaws which they use to burrow from the axils of the leaves to the crown, where they feed voraciously. Upon completion of larval development, the larva will sometimes emerge from the trunk of the tree, and build a pupal case of fiber extracted from the galleries inside the palm. The larva will then undergo metamorphosis into an adult. The larva will also weave a pupal case at the base of the palm fronds within the frond itself or at the centre of the base of the plant. =Adult= The adult insect is an excellent flier and is able to travel great distances. While they prefer to attack palms that are already infested or weakened by other stresses, they will colonize healthy palms.

The biology and life history of the weevil have been investigated on five diets, including banana, sugarcane, squash fruit, apple, and palm crown. The rate of development showed great variation depending on the host used. Developmental time was shortest on palm crown, followed by banana, and then squash fruit and apple, and longest on sugarcane. Egg production was the highest on palm crown, being 338 ¬± 37.24 eggs/female followed by banana, squash fruit, and apple, and the lowest (117. ¬± 18.9 eggs/female) on sugarcane. Studies show that this insect is attracted by ethyl acetate, 2-methoxy.4.vinylphenol, gamma-nonanoic lactone, 4SSS-ferrugineol, 50H and 4me-9-5Kt. Symptoms of infestation The infestation of the pest can result in yellowing and wilting of palms, that may lead to the death of the affected plant. The crown wilts first, and lower leaves will follow, due to damage to vascular tissue. Major symptoms such as crown loss or leaf wilt are usually only visible long after the palm has become infested. Secondary infections of opportunistic bacteria and fungi may occur within damaged tissues, accelerating decline. By the time these external symptoms are observed, the damage is usually sufficient to kill the tree, and the infestation may have been present for six months or longer. In high- density infestations, sounds of the larvae burrowing and chewing can be heard by placing one's ear to the trunk of the palm. Recent research has been conducted using electronic listening devices or dogs trained to recognize the scent of weevils or palm decay to detect infestations at low densities earlier in the process.

Image:WeevilStrickenDatePalm-in-Kfar Saba-RJP.jpg A date palm that was killed by the pest, in Kfar Saba, Israel. Control The main control method is through the application of a systemic insecticide. Insecticide is usually applied through a funnel about 5 cm above the infested area of the trunk. The red palm weevil can be monitored using pheromone lures and alternative forms of control use field sanitation and mass trapping with traps baited with pheromone and plant derived semiochemicals. New alternative technologies using semiochemicals and bioinsecticides are being developed to attract the weevils to a point source and kill them. Another management technique is to drench the base of palm fronds with the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae, or Beauveria bassiana.R. El-Sufty, S.A. Al-Awash, Abdul Al-Amidi, Abdul Al- Amidi, S.A.

For early detection, bioacoustic analysis may be implemented by inserting sensitive microphone into the tree and recording any produced sounds.Walid Barakat Hussein, Mohamed Ahmed Hussein, and Thomas Becker (2009) APPLICATION OF THE SIGNAL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY IN THE DETECTION OF RED PALM WEEVIL. Proceedings of the 17th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 2009) Glasgow, Scotland, August 24-28, 2009 These sounds are analyzed by digital signal processing and artificial intelligence to decide whether they are generated by palm weevils. Prevention As the weevil prefers to lay its eggs in softer tissues, avoiding mechanical damage to plants can help to reduce infestation. Tarring wounds after pruning a plant of dead or old leaves can also reduce the probability of infestation. The movement of plant material such as husks, dead leaves, or untreated coir from infested to uninfested areas is not recommended. Culinary uses The larval grub is considered a delicacy in Vietnam. In Vietnam, the larvae are usually eaten alive with fish sauce. Other methods of cooking include toasting and steaming. They are eaten with sticky rice and salad or cooked with porridge. The larvae are known in the Vietnamese language as ƒëu√¥ng d·ª´a (\\"coconut beetle-larva\\"). \\"Sago worms\\" reported from other countries (e.g., Malaysia, New Guinea) refer to different, related species of Rhynchophorus.

The fourth hurricane of the season, the cyclone was first observed on September 12 about 550 miles (885 kilometres) northeast of Antigua. It moved quickly westward, then later turned to the north-northwest, steadily strengthening to reach a peak intensity of 100 miles per hour (155 kilometres per hour), a Category 2 on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson scale. The hurricane weakened slightly before striking near Atlantic City, New Jersey, on September 16 with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). It weakened over Pennsylvania and became an extratropical cyclone over western New York on September 17. Rough surf and moderate winds from the hurricane capsized several ships along the East Coast of the United States; 30 people were left missing and presumed killed from a shipwreck in Chincoteague, Virginia. Along the coast, 57 people died due to the storm. In New Jersey, the hurricane caused heavy damage, particularly near the coast and in Atlantic City. Dozens of buildings were damaged or destroyed, and damage across the state totaled $8 million (1903 USD). In New York City, high winds disrupted traffic, closed businesses, and overturned wagons, with many windows and roofs damaged. On Long Island, President Theodore Roosevelt directly experienced the effects of the hurricane while on a yacht. The life of the president was briefly threatened by the rough conditions, though none on board the yacht suffered any problems from the hurricane. Meteorological history The genesis of the storm is unknown; it was first observed on September 12 as a 70 mph (120 km/h) tropical storm about 550 miles (885 km) northeast of Antigua in the Lesser Antilles. On that day, the storm appeared on weather maps, and subsequently was tracked by ship reports as a small system. The storm tracked quickly northwestward, followed by a turn to the west-northwest. Around 18:00 UTC on September 13, the storm passed about 270 mi (435 km) south of Bermuda. Its exact track and intensity is unknown, though it is estimated the storm attained hurricane status late on September 14 about 360 mi (580 km) west-southwest of Bermuda. The hurricane steadily intensified as it curved northward, and attained an estimated peak intensity of 100 mph (155 km/h) late on September 15 about 110 mi (190 km) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. By late on September 15, the hurricane was beginning to affect the North Carolina coastline. The high winds near the center prompted the United States Weather Bureau to issue storm warnings on the morning of September 16 into the next day. Turning northward, the hurricane weakened slightly and made landfall near Atlantic City, New Jersey, shortly before 12:00 UTC on September 16\\\\. The estimated barometric pressure was , suggesting hurricane-force winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) at landfall. This made it the first and only known hurricane to strike New Jersey since the Atlantic hurricane database's beginning in 1851. The storm structure broadened after landfall, and the Weather Bureau assessed one center splitting off and tracking north-northeastward into New York and Connecticut. The main center continued northwestward, weakening into a tropical storm near Trenton, New Jersey. After crossing northeastern Pennsylvania, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone near Syracuse, New York on September 17\\\\. The extratropical remnant persisted for another six hours before losing its identity over eastern Ontario. Impact thumb Overall, the hurricane killed 57 people during its passage through the Mid-Atlantic states. Winds of over affected large portions of the coastline from New Jersey to southern New England. The hurricane first brought rainfall to coastal parts of Georgia and South Carolina. Strong winds were reported along coastal areas of North Carolina, with sustained winds peaking at 72 mph (116 km/h) at Kitty Hawk. Winds reached 54 mph (87 km/h) at Cape Henry, Virginia, and the combination of the winds and rough surf washed some boats ashore. The schooner Beatrice was lost near Chincoteague with a crew of 30; 28 people on board were killed. A squall line destroyed the front mast of a schooner near Cape Henry. Several boats broke free from their moorings near Salisbury and were subsequently destroyed after passing downstream. The schooner Hattie A. Marsh encountered strong winds from the hurricane along the Delaware coast, while strong waves washed it ashore the rocky coastline. The boat was wrecked and the rooms on board were washed overboard, killing five members of the crew. Two people were rescued after conditions calmed, one of whom was injured and taken to a hospital. A flock of birds encountered the hurricane over eastern Virginia; hundreds of birds were killed and fell to the ground near Old Point Comfort, many stripped of their feathers. The outer rainbands of the storm produced heavy amounts of precipitation near Washington, D.C., canceling a baseball game between the Detroit Tigers and the Washington Senators after the field was flooded. In Ocean City, Maryland, the hurricane was considered the worst in 40 years. The hurricane produced 80 mph (130 km/h) winds and rough waves along the Delaware Capes, indicating hurricane-force winds affected the state. It was one of only two storms on record to produce such winds in the state. Three barges and a steamer capsized in the Delaware Bay, while onshore, the winds of the hurricane destroyed the roofs of four houses in Laurel. The winds downed many trees and destroyed several chimneys near Lewes. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, winds reached , which damaged telegraph and phone lines, knocked down several trees, and damaged the roof of Pennsylvania Railroad's Broad Street Station. Described by the Weather Bureau as \\"a most unusual tempest,\\" the storm was one of only four to produce hurricane-force winds in New Jersey. The storm's strong surf destroyed several boats along the coastline, including 34 in Waretown. Less than 10% of the people in Atlantic City evacuated, and after the storm, many people visited the city to observe the storm damage described in newspapers. High winds disrupted 800 telephone lines in Atlantic City, and most communications were cut from the Jersey Shore to the Philadelphia region. Initial damage reports were provided by trains, although there were severe transportation delays due to ongoing flooding. The disrupted communications sparked \\"wild rumors that the great resort had been entirely washed away,\\" according to The New York Times. Monetary damage in Atlantic City was estimated around $1 million (1903 USD). Atlantic City's power was deliberately shut off to prevent accidents. In the city, the roof of one hotel and the porch of another were destroyed. Trees and awnings were damaged, and thousands of windows were damaged. The winds destroyed the roofs of an estimated 50 to 60 cottages. The surf damaged or destroyed most fishing piers and oceanfront pavilions in the Atlantic City area, with tons of debris dispersed across the beach. The strong winds, combined with heavy rainfall, resulted in one indirect fatality when a man, unable to see owing to the hurricane, drove into a train in Cape May. In Asbury Park, the storm wrecked the roofs of six hotels. High waves damaged the boardwalks at Belmar and Allenhurst. High winds heavily damaged fruit crops in Monmouth, Middlesex, and Hunterdon counties. Fruit trees were uprooted in Vineland, and in Flemington, about 75% of apples and pears were lost. Damage across the state was estimated at $8 million (1903 USD); the worst of the damage occurred in Atlantic City, though moderate damage extended from Cape May northward through Asbury Park. In New York, the outer periphery of the storm produced 2.4 inches (61 mm) of rain in Central Park, where dozens of trees were knocked down or damaged. High tides peaked at , which inundated Battery Park and made ferry passage difficult. Winds in New York City reached 65 mph (105 km/h), reaching along the coast, with tropical storm force winds extending into Maine. The winds were the strongest in the city since August 1889, lasting about four hours at its peak. Funneled by the streets and tall buildings of New York, the high winds swayed buildings, spires, and bridges, overturning wagons on the Brooklyn Bridge. The shape of the Flatiron Building tossed horse-drawn carriages, and two people were injured when a wagon of furniture was overturned. The rains and winds knocked down signs and awnings while wrecking dozens of windows, chimneys, and roofs, causing residents to evacuate buildings and damaging several storefronts. One woman was hospitalized after being struck by an airborne sign. The high amount of damage led to the greatest number of inspectors of the New York City Department of Buildings to determine which buildings were safe. In Brighton Beach, the roof of the Ocean Hotel was completely blown off, and a similar fate befell the top of the Steeplechase Tower in Coney Island resort area, which sustained considerable damage. In Brooklyn, church steeples were dislodged or blown off, and many homes in the borough were flooded or damaged. Construction work on the Williamsburg Bridge was halted during the storm. On Staten Island, the winds blew off the roof of a school. The hurricane also left businesses and the stock market quiet for the day, owing to the threat of blowing debris. Trees and signs were blown down in the New York suburbs. One person died in New York City due to the storm. The high waves and winds caused the greatest marine damage in a decade around New York City. More than 100 boats were overturned or beached in Jamaica Bay, and another 150 boats were wrecked between Hell Gate and the west end of Coney Island. At least ten houseboats were damaged or sank, with boaters injured and requiring rescue. A man attempting to row ashore near Point O' Woods required rescue amid strong winds. Passengers swam safely ashore after their boat capsized in Hell Gate. President Theodore Roosevelt directly experienced the effects of the hurricane while vacationing on the naval yacht Sylph along Long Island. Also on the yacht were Roosvelt's wife, son, his secretary, several friends and members of the press association. The yacht experienced gusty winds and heavy rainfall, along with rough seas, and witnessed a boat capsizing in Hell Gate. Passengers left the deck of the yacht for safety while their belongings were secured. After the President was considered to be in danger, the yacht headed for land, and instead of embarking toward Ellis Island as originally planned, the yacht landed at Brooklyn Navy Yard. Farther north, high winds downed many trees along coastal Connecticut, which cut telegraph and telephone lines in Bridgeport. A boy was killed in Hartford after stepping onto a downed power line. Several boats were washed ashore along the Connecticut coast. Farther inland, winds disrupted power in Leicester and damaged crops.

Parts of the castle date from before 1566, though most dates from 1580 or later. The chapel was rebuilt in 1650. The interior of the castle was substantially renovated in the 1960s, with additional major renovations to the castle interiors and chapel in the early 2000s. The estate is in private ownership and not available for public tour.  Architecture  The castle is a fortified house (fortalice) designed on a Z-plan running east-west, with square towers at the north-west and south-east corners, each containing a circular staircase.MacGibbon, D. and Ross, T.

Stairs lead down to three vaulted basement chambers. The western chamber included stocks and branks, but the room has since been converted to a wine cellar. A rogue's collar or jougs hangs near the front entrance to the castle. The first floor contains the Great Hall to the west; the great stone fireplace has a cast iron grate and stone surround.

It is not known when the original castle structure was constructed, but the main entrance tower is believed to date from the 1400s. James Henderson, 3rd of Fordell, started to extend the castle in 1566.See Laing (1865) p. xli; Gifford (1992) p. 226.

Author James Henderson CBE (no relation), purchased the estate in 1953. He restored the castle to a good standard and it was inhabited for the first time since 1726. Fordell was acquired in 1961 by the controversial lawyer and Conservative politician Sir Nicholas Fairbairn (1933-1995). The castle was restored and used as a private residence by Sir Nicholas and his wife Lady Sam Fairbairn.Inglis (2011) pp. 191-193 (citing Fairbairn, Nicholas (1987) \\"A Life is Too Short\\" pp. 164-167).

About 1995, the property was acquired by Dr. Lorraine Inglis and her husband, local veterinarian Bill Inglis. About 1999, the property was purchased by Andrew Berry, a businessman who made extensive, high-quality restorations of the castle, chapel, and grounds.\\"Estates in Scotland\\" (Aug 16, 2007), countrylife.co.uk retrieved 2017-11-25.

The remains of one of Scotland's oldest railways runs 400 m to the east of the Castle. The Fordell railway route took coal from the Fife coalfields to the ships in St David's Bay, now part of the Dalgety Bay settlement.

Located in New Brunswick, Moncton's motto is Resurgo, which is Latin for I rise again. This motto was originally chosen in celebration of the city's rebirth in 1875 after the recovery of the economy from the collapse of the shipbuilding industry. The city again lived up to its motto in more recent times, when the economy of the city was devastated once more during the 1980s as a result of the city's largest employers (the CN repair shops, the Eaton's catalogue division, and CFB Moncton) all departing the city in short order. The city has since rebounded due to growth in the light manufacturing, technology, distribution, tourism, and retail sectors of the economy and is now the fastest growing city in Canada east of Toronto. Aboriginal period The original aboriginal inhabitants of the Petitcodiac river valley were the Mi'kmaq. Moncton is situated at the southern end of a traditional native portage route between the Petitcodiac River and Shediac Bay on the nearby Northumberland Strait. Acadian settlement Led by Joseph Broussard, a number if Acadians from the Petitcodiac and Memramcook valleys waged a guerilla campaign against the British after they began to expel the Acadians from the area. The head of the Bay of Fundy was first settled by French Acadians in the 1670s. Early settlement was centered on the region of the Tantramar Marshes but there was gradual expansion of the settled areas towards the west during the succeeding decades. The first reference to the \\"Petcoucoyer River\\" was on the de Meulles Map of 1686. The Chipodie Acadian settlement was established at the mouth of the Petitcodiac River in 1700. Settlement then gradually extended up the Petitcodiac and Memramcook River valleys, finally reaching the site of present-day Moncton (50 km inland) in 1733. The first Acadians settlers at Moncton established a marshland farming community and named it Le Coude (The Elbow). In 1755, the Petitcodiac River valley fell under British control after the capture of nearby Fort Beaus√©jour by forces under the command of Lt. Col. Robert Monckton. This was one of a series of conflicts between the French and English prior to the Seven Years' War being declared. The Acadian population of the region was deported later that year by order of Nova Scotia Governor Charles Lawrence but some of the inhabitants of the Petitcodiac and Memramcook valleys were able to escape into the woods and, under the leadership of Joseph Broussard, sustained guerilla warfare against the British occupiers until 1758 when Broussard was wounded in action. The Acadian settlement of Le Coude subsequently remained empty until after the end of the Seven Years' War. American settlement In June 1766, Captain John Hall arrived from Pennsylvania armed with a land grant and a charter from the Philadelphia Land Company (one of the principal investors of which was Benjamin Franklin to establish Monckton Township on the site of the previous Acadian settlement of Le Coude. On Captain Hall's ship, the \\"Lovey\\", captained by Nathaniel Shiverick, were eight immigrant Pennsylvania \\"Deutsch\\" families. The Settlers included Heinrich Stief (Steeves), Jacob Treitz (Trites), Matthias Sommer (Somers), Jacob Reicker (Ricker), Charles Schantz (Jones), George Wortmann (Wortman), Michael Lutz (Lutes) and George Copple. There is a plaque dedicated in their honour at the mouth of Hall's Creek. They named their new settlement The Bend of the Petitcodiac, or simply The Bend. There is one surviving building in the city dating from this era; the \\"Treitz Haus\\", which has been dated by architectural styling and dendrochronology to have been built in the early 1770s. It has recently been renovated as a downtown tourist information centre. Fort Cumberland in 1755 (then called Beausejour), located on the Isthmus of Chignecto near Moncton. Subject to an American attack in 1776, it was repelled by British reinforcements. The American Revolution had virtually no effect on The Bend. The Deutsch settlers were apolitical, mostly concerned with simply surviving in their new homeland and had no interest in the revolutionary cause. There was however an important rebel attack on nearby Fort Cumberland (the renamed Fort Beausejour) in 1776. This attack was led by the American sympathizer Jonathan Eddy and was supported by local Yankee settlers and some Acadians from the Memramcook Valley. The attack was intended to encourage Nova Scotia to join the revolution and although the fort was partially overrun by the rebels, the attack was ultimately unsuccessful due to the timely arrival of British reinforcement forces from Halifax. Early 19th century The Bend initially was, and remained for a long time, an agricultural community. Growth was extremely slow for the first 75 years of the community's existence. In fact, The Bend lagged significantly behind neighbouring towns such as Sackville, Shediac and even Dorchester. In 1788, there were only 12 families in the township and even by 1836, The Bend had only 20 households. It was at about this time that things began to change for the community. Communication with other Maritime communities and the rest of the world had been mostly a seaborne enterprise until the middle part of the 19th century. While roads did exist, they were often poorly maintained Corduroy roads and it wasn't until 1836 that the Westmorland Road became passable year-round and regular stage coach and mail service between Halifax and Saint John could begin. The Bend was strategically located at a point along the road where a layover and transfer point could be established. This proved to be a significant impetus to the future growth of the community. Lumbering became important to the local economy of Moncton Township by the 1840s and in the latter part of that same decade, Joseph Salter arrived from Saint John and built a major shipyard at The Bend. Within a few years, over 1000 workers were employed at the shipyard and the sleepy community that had formerly been The Bend would never be the same again. The Bend developed a service based economy to support the shipyard and gradually began to acquire all of the amenities of a growing town. In particular, as the economy strengthened, an important financial institution (the Westmorland Bank) opened and this in turn was able to finance further expansion of the shipbuilding industry. First incorporation The prosperity engendered by the wooden shipbuilding industry allowed The Bend to incorporate as the town of Moncton in 1855. The first mayor of Moncton was the shipbuilder Joseph Salter. The town was named after Lt. Col. Robert Monckton, the British military commander who had captured Fort Beaus√©jour a century earlier. A clerical error at the time the town was incorporated resulted in the misspelling of the community's name which has been perpetuated to the present day. Two years later on August 20, 1857 the European and North American Railway opened its line from Moncton to the nearby Northumberland Strait port of Shediac; this was followed by the E&NA;'s line from Moncton to Sussex and on to Saint John opening in 1859. The arrival of the railway initially didn't have a significant impact on Moncton as the E&NA; was headquartered in Shediac, where it maintained its locomotive shop. Recession and resurrection Map of Intercolonial Railway of Canada lines in 1877. Moncton's economy was revitalized when it was selected as the railway's headquarters. At about the same time as the arrival of the railway, steam-powered ships began to replace clipper ships on the ocean's sea routes and this forced an end to the era of wooden shipbuilding. The industrial collapse that developed from this, as well as the associated bankruptcy of the Westmorland Bank caused Moncton to surrender its civic charter in 1862. Moncton's economic depression did not last long and a second era of prosperity came to the area in 1871 when Moncton was selected to be the headquarters of the Intercolonial Railway of Canada. The ICR merged the existing E&NA; and the Nova Scotia Railway into its system and Moncton would become the hub of the ICR with the following rail lines connecting to the city: * The E&NA; system merged into ICR, containing the Moncton-Saint John and Moncton-Shediac routes. * A newly built ICR line was constructed between Truro and Painsec Junction (east of Moncton on the E&NA;'s line to Shediac). This connected to the NSR at Truro which went to Halifax and to Pictou. * A newly built ICR line was constructed from Moncton north to Newcastle, Bathurst, Campbellton and on into Quebec to link with the Grand Trunk Railway at Rivi√®re-du-Loup, Quebec. It was the construction of this route which cemented Moncton's place as the most important economic centre for servicing northern New Brunswick - a relationship which continues to this day. The coming of the ICR to Moncton was a seminal event for the community. For the next 120 years, the history of the city would be inextricably intertwined with that of the railway. Second incorporation, growth, and prosperity With the arrival of the Intercolonial Railroad, Moncton was able to reincorporate as a town in 1875 with the motto \\"Resurgo\\" (I rise again). One year later, the ICR line to Quebec was opened. The railway boom that emanated from this and the associated employment growth allowed Moncton to achieve city status on April 23, 1890. A major fire at the ICR's riverfront railyard and shops in 1906 was very nearly disastrous for the local railway industry. Fearing that the shops might be relocated to Halifax or Rivi√®re-du-Loup, Henry Robert Emmerson, (a Moncton native and federal Minister of Railways and Canals) quickly petitioned Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier to have the shop facilities rebuilt and expanded. His lobbying was successful and a larger locomotive shop facility was subsequently built northwest of the downtown and the future of the community was preserved. The Eaton's catalogue warehouse in 1927. The company built the warehouse as Moncton was a centre for railways and shipping. Moncton grew rapidly during the early part of the 20th century, particularly after provincial lobbying saw the city become the eastern terminus of the massive National Transcontinental Railway project in 1912; this line would link Moncton with Edmundston, Quebec City, and on to Winnipeg where the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway continued to Saskatoon, Edmonton, and Prince Rupert. The First World War brought a halt to the era of railway expansion but the city would become an important trans-shipment point for materiel funnelling onwards to the port of Halifax. In 1918, the ICR and NTR (then autonomous companies grouped under the Canadian Government Railways) were merged by the federal government into the newly formed Canadian National Railways (CNR) system. The ICR shops would become CNR's major locomotive repair facility for the Maritimes and Moncton became the headquarters for CNR's Maritime division. Reflecting the city's importance as a railway and logistics/shipping hub, the T. Eaton Company's catalogue warehouse located to the city in the early 1920s, employing over five hundred people. Meat packing plants and light manufacturing also contributed to the local economy. As the city grew, it began to draw upon its hinterland for population growth. Much of the surrounding countryside to the east and the north of the city was (and is) inhabited primarily by French-Acadians who were descendants of the refugees that had returned to the region following the deportation of 1755. For the 150 years between its founding by the Pennsylvania Dutch in 1766 and the 1920s, the city of Moncton itself had been an English speaking community but the influx of francophone Acadians seeking employment beginning in the early 20th century would result in a major demographic and cultural shift for the community. Scoudouc. It was constructed in an aircraft hangar, part of an abandoned World War II air base. O-I was the latest in a long list of owners of the glass manufacturing plant, which was closed in 2008. Moncton continued to develop as a regional distribution and transportation hub during the Second World War. The Royal Canadian Air Force established two air bases in the area for training and for operational squadrons. RCAF Station Moncton was located at the pre-existing Moncton airport and RCAF Station Scoudouc was constructed in nearby Scoudouc. The Canadian Army also built a large military supply base along the railway mainline near the CNR shops facilities northwest of downtown; this facility was used to sort much of the materiel heading on to the ports of Halifax, Saint John and Sydney, as well as to supply army facilities throughout the Maritimes. Following the war, RCAF Station Moncton would revert to a purely civilian airport while RCAF Station Scoudouc was transferred to the provincial government for use as an industrial park. The army continued to use the supply base (CFB Moncton) to service its large military establishment in Atlantic Canada. Railway employment in Moncton at the height of the steam locomotive era peaked at about six thousand workers before starting a long decline following the Second World War. This was because the new diesel locomotives and longer trains that were introduced in the early 1950s required fewer employees for operation and maintenance. A regional road network expanded from the city through the 1950s. The latter part of that decade also saw CNR begin development of a major railway hump yard in the city's west end. Further changes saw the downtown railyard modified and the historic passenger station demolished in favour of a small modern structure. This was followed by development of the Highfield Square shopping centre and several office buildings (CN Terminal Plaza) in the early 1960s. Moncton was placed on the Trans-Canada Highway network in the early 1960s after Route 2 was built along the northern perimeter of the city. Subsequent development saw Route 15 built between the city and nearby Parlee Beach at Shediac and on to Port Elgin. At the same time, the infamous Petitcodiac River Causeway was constructed. Acadian \\"Renaissance\\" The Universit√© de Moncton (pictured in 2002) was founded in 1963. Its foundation spurred a larger Acadian \\"renaissance,\\" as municipal services were introduced for the French-speaking Acadian population. The Universit√© de Moncton was founded in 1963. This began an Acadian \\"renaissance\\" which was in large measure encouraged and supported by university faculty who had been trained in Quebec during the founding years of the \\"Quiet Revolution\\". U de M, the renaissance, and the election of premier Louis Robichaud and his program of \\"equal opportunity\\" all led to increasing demands by the francophone populace for municipal services in French and led to tension between the Acadian minority and the anglophone majority during the latter part of the 1960s and early 1970s. The Acadian population began to become more prosperous and influential during the 1980s as linguistic tensions began to relax (although not disappearing entirely). The anglophone population of the city generally began to accept the principle of bilingualism and enrollment in French Immersion classes in public schools became popular. Bilingualism would ultimately become one of the strengths of the community. Second recession The late 1970s and the 1980s again saw a period of economic hardship hit the city as several major employers closed or restructured. The Eatons catalogue division closed in 1976 and CN closed its locomotive shops facility in 1988, throwing thousands out of work and forcing the federal and provincial governments to step in with economic restructuring packages to diversify the Moncton economy. CFB Moncton was also closed at about this time due to defence cutbacks resulting from the end of the Cold War. Moncton became so despondent during the late 1980s (prior to economic restructuring having a positive impact) that the city's promotional slogan would become the rather lacklustre Moncton - We're OK. \\"Moncton Miracle\\" Diversification in the early 1990s saw the rise of information technology, led by call centres which made use of the city's bilingual workforce. Bilingualism was heavily promoted by premier Frank McKenna's government to attract the call centre industry in order to provide a temporary employment \\"bridge\\" for the city as it transitioned from the old economy to a more modern one. By the late 1990s, retail, manufacturing and service expansion began to occur in all sectors and within a decade of the closure of the CN locomotive shops, Moncton had more than made up for its employment losses. This turnaround in the fortunes of the city has been termed the \\"Moncton Miracle\\". Recent history In 1998, Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien used the city's growing French community to political advantage when he selected a Canadian site to host the Francophonie Summit in 1999 (it rotates among member nations). Following the near disaster of the 1995 Referendum on Quebec sovereignty, Chr√©tien felt it more appropriate to host the summit someplace other than Quebec and he decided that the time had come to honour Canada's Acadian population. Moncton became the choice, partly because francophone Acadians consider the city to be their \\"capital\\" and also because Chr√©tien had briefly represented the neighbouring federal district of Beaus√©jour and wanted to show his appreciation to the area. The summit was held in early September 1999 and was the largest conference ever held in the city, with heads of state and delegations attending from 54 nations around the world. The fifth Gunningsville Bridge on the left, next to its fourth iteration, on the right. Crossing over the Petitcodiac River, the fourth bridge was demolished shortly after the completion of the fifth, in 2005. Following the World Trade Center attacks of September 11, 2001, United States airspace was abruptly closed by the FEderal Aviation Administration. Over a dozen flights with about 2,500 passengers were diverted to the Greater Moncton International Airport as part of Operation Yellow Ribbon. The Moncton Coliseum was turned into a temporary refugee camp for the stranded passengers but the citizens of the city opened their hearts and every passenger that wanted to was able to find billets in private homes. A few months later, the name of the road adjacent to the Coliseum was renamed \\"September 11 Ave\\" in memory of all that occurred. The growth of the community has continued unabated since the 1990s and has been accelerating. The confidence of the community has been bolstered by its ability to host major events such as the Francophonie Summit in 1999, a Rolling Stones concert in 2005 and the Memorial Cup in 2006. Recent positive developments include the Atlantic Baptist University achieving full university status and relocating to a new campus in 1996, the Greater Moncton Airport opening a new terminal building and becoming a designated international airport in 2002, and the opening of the new Gunningsville Bridge to Riverview in 2005. In 2002, Moncton became Canada's first officially bilingual city. In the 2006 census, Moncton was officially designated a Census Metropolitan Area and became the largest metropolitan area in the province of New Brunswick. 2014 police shooting On June 4, 2014, five officers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) were shot by Justin Bourque, three of them fatally. A manhunt for the suspect, identified as 24-year-old resident Justin Bourque, was launched and continued overnight into June 5. The Pinehurst Park area of the town was subsequently locked down, with residents being asked to stay in their homes; public transit being suspended; and schools, government offices, stores, and business being closed.\\"Moncton shooting: City on lockdown during manhunt\\", BBC The suspect was later apprehended without incident two days later, later being charged with three counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder.

The story was adapted by Monja Danischewsky. Plot A timid accountant in a Scottish Tweed weaving company (Sellers) cleverly bests the brash modern American efficiency expert (Cummings) whose ideas threaten his way of life. The film opens with Martin (Sellers) in Edinburgh buying whisky and cigarettes on the Royal Mile. We then see him at work as a head accountant in a very old-fashioned firm in the New Town. The Justerini & Brooks premises in George Street serves as their shop in the film. Martin is called to the death-bed of the owner, old MacPherson, at Moray Place. He is offered a whisky and declines. Old MacPherson drinks both and promptly dies. The new owner of the Tweed company, played by Robert Morley, is enamoured of a zealous American woman who is an efficiency expert and who wants to turn her hand to revolutionise the very traditional company. She insists on visiting \\"the factory\\" on the island, only to discover the task is done by old couples, on crofts where they spin the wool. She plans to replace the 700 weavers, dotted across the islands, with a single large factory. Whilst being driven through the city she even says the company should change to synthetic fibres, causing the chauffeur to drive into the back of a brewer's dray in the Grassmarket. Martin watches a Sherlock Holmes film at the cinema and is inspired to kill Mrs Barrows. As he is a non-smoker and a non- drinker, he decides he should mislead any future investigation by smoking and drinking at the scene of the planned crime. He buys a half-bottle of whisky and packet of Capstan cigarettes. In her flat though, after a series of botched attempts his conscience gets the better of him and he cannot kill her. He tries to remove all evidence when Mr MacPherson appears suddenly, and manages to avoid detection. Back in the office MacPherson interrogates Martin and finds his denial more plausible than Mrs Barrows's claims. She cannot take any more, accusing them all of being mad, and she leaves for good. Thus Mr Martin wins his battle of the sexes. However, seeing her crying at the station he is moved to buy her a flower. He may have won the battle, but he hasn't won the war.

His career winning percentage of .611 was a 19th-century record, and remains the second highest by any major league manager with at least 500 wins, trailing only Joe McCarthy's mark of .615. Mutrie, nicknamed \\"Smilin' Jeems\\" and \\"Truthful Jim\\", was born in Chelsea, Massachusetts, and grew up playing cricket, first playing baseball at age 16. He played in the minor leagues from 1877 to 1879.\\"Jim Mutrie Minor League Statistics & History\\". baseball-reference.com. Retrieved April 16, 2012. In 1880 he moved from New England to New York, where he obtained financial backing from August Belmont and John B. Day to start the independent New York Metropolitans. At the end of the 1882 season, Day and Mutrie accepted offers from both the American Association and the National League to enter a New York team; they met their double commitment by entering the Mets in the American Association, and acquiring most of the players from the Troy Trojans to form the New York Gothams for the National League. Mutrie managed the New York Metropolitans from 1880-1882 in the Eastern Championship Association and League Alliance, and winning both of those leagues in 1881 and 1882 respectively. The Metropolitans' record in 1882 was 101-57-3 and they easily won the League Alliance pennant. From 1880-1882, Mutrie managed the New York Metropolitans to a 201-136-7 record. Mutrie managed the Metropolitans in 1883 and 1884, leading them to the 1884 World Series the latter year. In the 1884 World Series, Mutrie faced off against his former manager Frank Bancroft. Bancroft was the manager of the New Bedford Whalers of the New England League in 1878 when Mutrie played for the Whalers. The Whalers won the New England League pennant in 1878. In 1885, Mutrie switched to managing the Gothams, and is credited with giving them their nickname, the Giants. With star players such as Buck Ewing, Tim Keefe and Roger Connor, the Giants won National League pennants and World Series titles under Mutrie in 1888 and 1889. Ewing, Keefe and many other players defected to the Players' League's New York Giants in 1890, and the National League Giants under Mutrie slumped to sixth and then third place. When the Giants were reorganized after the 1891 season under new ownership, Mutrie was not retained as manager. After leaving baseball, Mutrie operated a hotel in Elmira, New York and a newsstand on Staten Island. He died of cancer on Roosevelt Island in New York City at age 86.

In June 2017, Centrica Storage Ltd announced that gas injection and storage would cease. History Easington gas terminal. From here the gas flow in and out of the Rough Field is managed. Production licences for the Rough field were given in 1964, and gas was first brought ashore to Easington gas processing terminal in 1975. In 1980 BG Corporation (which became British Gas plc in 1986 following privatisation) purchased the Rough field with one third of reserves depleted, with the intention of converting the field into a gas storage facility to manage seasonal trends in the supply and demand of gas in the UK. In 1983 BG Corporation made the final decision to convert Rough into a natural gas storage facility which became operational in 1985 as the largest gas storage facility built in the UK continental shelf. The break-up of BG Corporation in 1997 into BG Group and Centrica meant that BG Storage was created as a standalone business, for competition reasons. In 2001, BG Storage sold the Rough facility to Dynegy. In 2002, Centrica bought the plant back from Dynergy for ¬£304 million during its period of near-bankruptcy. The purchase of Rough led to the Competition Commission requesting certain undertakings being put in place due to Centrica's control of the Morecambe Bay gas fields which at the time were providing 10‚Äì15% of the UK's gas supply. In 2003 Centrica provided DECC with a set of undertakings and Centrica Storage Ltd (a wholly owned subsidiary of Centrica Plc) was formed. Centrica Storage Ltd still operates the Rough facility in accordance with the undertakings. In June 2017, Centrica announced the closure of the Rough gas storage site due to safety concerns. The rundown of the plant will take up to four years to complete. Operation The facility consists of a partially depleted gas field (the Rough field) in the Southern North Sea, approximately 18 miles off the east coast of Yorkshire, together with an onshore gas processing terminal at Easington, approximately 27 miles southeast of Hull. The Rough processing terminal forms a part of the larger Easington Gas Terminal which can inject upwards of 125 million cubic metres per day (approximately 40% of the daily UK supply). The Rough facility is operated by Centrica Storage Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Centrica. Nearly 200 staff and contractors are employed within the operation, both onshore and offshore. It had a storage capacity of 3.31 billion cubic metres which was approximately 70% of the UK's gas storage capacity (approximately nine days' supply). Rough could supply 10% of the UK's peak gas demand and thus was an important part of the UK's gas infrastructure. Operational problems lead to a partial shutdown in 2016, requiring increased imports during that winter. At the time of the announcement of the rundown of the facility in June 2017, Rough was the only depleted UK offshore gas field reservoir used for gas storage and retrieval. Several projects have been proposed to use other depleted offshore fields but none have proved to be economically viable; two examples are the Baird and Deborah gas storage projects.

The largest populations occur on the Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge. It is a member of the celery family, the Umbelliferae, and has yellow flowers. Technical description *Plant perennial, long-lived, usually over 10 cm tall, glabrous, somewhat caulescent at the base. *Root tuberous, thick. *Leaves green, shiny, ternate, with ternate-pinnately dissected leaflets, the ultimate segments numerous and small (<1 cm); petiole dilated (flared out) and sheathing at the base. *Scapes (peduncles) ascending, arcuate (curved), 15‚Äì20 cm long. *Involucels with slender bractlets. *Flowers yellow, aging to whitish. *Fruit only very narrowly laterally winged; dorsal ribs wingless. Distribution, habitat, and ecology The range of adobe parsley is extremely limited: it is known only from Washoe County in Nevada and nearby places in southeastern Oregon, where it has possibly already been extirpated. It is also suspected to exist in Humboldt County, Nevada. Fewer than 20 known populations exist, though these can be large. Adobe parsley lives in loose, rocky habitat. Specifically, it prefers dry basalt talus scree overlying clay soils. It associates with the low sagebrush community, and specific associates include Artemisia arbuscula, Poa secunda, Elymus elymoides, Arenaria aculeata, Phlox spp., Erigeron linearis, etc. The fire ecology is unknown for members of this genus. The low sagebrush community type within which adobe parsley lives generally lacks enough fuels to carry a fire. When it does burn, these non-fire adapted shrubs are usually killed and replaced by medusahead and cheatgrass, and re-establish low sagebrush vegetation through time (2 to 5 years) via seeds. Conservation status and threats *U.S. Forest Service: Pacific Southwest Region Sensitive Species *California Native Plant Society: Not Listed (not known from California) *Nevada Natural Heritage Program: Sensitive Plant *NatureServe Nevada State Rank: S2S3; Global Rank: G2 Field identification Adobe parsley occurs between and above sea level. It flowers and may be most easily recognized in early spring, i.e., between April and June. It stands out because of its tuberous root, yellow flowers, and green shiny leaves. It resembles L. hendersonii, which is found farther north, but is more robust (larger) and somewhat caulescent.

Established in 1989, it was part of the International Rescue Committee (IRC) until the summer of 2014 when it became a legally separate entity. Through research and fact-finding field missions, the organization identifies critical problems that affect displaced women, children and young people, including gaps in lifesaving reproductive health care, lack of dignified livelihoods for refugees and, in the U.S., the treatment of asylum-seekers. The Women's Refugee Commission documents best practices and proposes solutions, and develops innovative tools to improve the way humanitarian assistance is delivered in refugee settings. On Capitol Hill, at the United Nations and with humanitarian organizations, governments and donors, the organization pushes for improvements in refugee policy and practice until measurable long-term change is realized. Programs=Adolescent girls= The Women's Refugee Commission illuminates and addresses the critical needs of adolescent girls in crisis settings to ensure that they stay safe and make positive changes in their lives. We identify and promote ways that girls can protect themselves, access healthcare, complete school, build leadership skills and be seen as a valued part of their families and communities. =Detention and asylum= The Women's Refugee Commission, Detention & Asylum Program (DAP) advocates for legislation and policy that would ensure the safety and well-being of migrant women, families and unaccompanied children. DAP works with the Obama administration, the U.S. Congress and the Department of Homeland Security, including its various agencies, to institutionalize these important safeguards. =Disabilities= To address the gap in knowledge on the issue and to place refugees with disabilities higher on the international agenda, the Women‚Äôs Refugee Commission undertook a six-month research project in 2008 to assess the situation of those living with disabilities among displaced and conflict- affected populations. Using our field research in five countries‚ÄîEcuador, Jordan, Nepal, Thailand and Yemen‚Äîwe sought to document existing services for displaced persons with disabilities, identify gaps and good practices and make concrete recommendations on how to improve services, protection and participation for this neglected population. =Fuel and firewood= The collection, supply and use of firewood and alternative energies in humanitarian settings has been associated with a variety of harmful consequences, including but not limited to: rape and assault during firewood collection, environmental degradation and respiratory and other illnesses caused by the indoor burning of biomass materials. The Women's Refugee Commission 2006 report, Beyond Firewood: Fuel Alternatives and Protection Strategies for Displaced Women and Girls, helped place this crucial health, environmental and security issue on the humanitarian agenda. We worked with key partners throughout the humanitarian system to create the InterAgency Standing Committee Task Force on Safe Access to Firewood and alternative Energy in Humanitarian Settings (IASC Task Force SAFE). =Gender-based violence= The Women‚Äôs Refugee Commission has been a leading proponent of efforts to promote women‚Äôs empowerment, gender equality and protection against gender-based violence. We have advocated for the passage of landmark Security Council resolutions on the protection of women and children. Our groundbreaking 2002 report If Not Now, When? documented the shortcomings of previous efforts to address GBV. =Livelihoods= The Women‚Äôs Refugee Commission researches and develops guidelines on appropriate livelihoods for displaced women and youth that recognize their skills, experience and capacity. Livelihoods are targeted towards local markets, are comprehensive in approach, and promote self-reliance that is both dignified and sustainable. =Sexual and reproductive health= Family planning saves lives, yet it is often neglected in areas affected by conflict or disaster. According to research the Women‚Äôs Refugee Commission conducted in five countries: Djibouti, Jordan, Kenya, Malaysia and Uganda, access to and use of family planning tends to be even lower among refugees than among those living in surrounding communities. To address this, the Women's Refugee Commission has developed informational materials using pictures that clearly explain how family planning works, what its benefits are and where it can be obtained. These materials can be adapted to different cultural contexts. =Women, peace and security= The Women's Refugee Commission works for full implementation of the Women, Peace and Security agenda at the UN. It undertakes advocacy to ensure that the UN and its members support and recognize the work of women, who are the linchpins of their communities and whose contributions are key to putting their countries back on the path to peace and security. =Youth= The Women's Refugee Commission works to ensure that displaced youth have opportunities to learn and grow so they can contribute to their communities and one day be able to support themselves and their families.

The reason WIMP interfaces have become so prevalent since their conception at Xerox PARC is that they are very good at abstracting work- spaces, documents, and their actions. Their analogous paradigm to documents as paper sheets or folders makes WIMP interfaces easy to introduce to other users. Furthermore their basic representations as rectangular regions on a 2D flat screen make them a good fit for system programmers, thus favoring the abundance of commercial widget toolkits in this style. However, WIMP interfaces are not optimal for working with complex tasks such as computer- aided design, working on large amounts of data simultaneously, or interactive games. WIMPs are usually pixel-hungry, so given limited screen real estate they can distract attention from the task at hand. Thus, custom interfaces can better encapsulate workspaces, actions, and objects for specific complex tasks. Applications for which WIMP is not well suited include those requiring continuous input signals, showing 3D models, or simply portraying an interaction for which there is no defined standard widget. Interfaces based on these considerations, now called \\"post-WIMP\\", have made their way to the general public. Examples include the interface of the classic Music player iPod and a bank's automated teller machine screen. Meanwhile, average desktop computers are still based on WIMP interfaces, and have started undergoing major operational improvements to surpass the hurdles inherent to the classic WIMP interface. These include the exploration of virtual 3D space, interaction techniques for window/icon sorting, focus, and embellishment. The seminal paper for post-WIMP interfaces is \\"Non Command User Interfaces\\" by Jakob Nielsen 1993, followed by \\"The Anti-Mac Interface\\". Updated proposals are discussed in \\"Post-WIMP user interfaces\\" by Andries van Dam. Michel Beaudouin- Lafon subsequently proposed a framework called instrumental interaction, that defines a design space for Post-WIMP interaction techniques and a set of properties for comparing them.

According to Stoic philosophy, humans (and all living beings) must act in accordance with Nature, which is the primary sense of kathƒìkon.  Kathƒìkonta and katorth≈çmata  According to Stoic philosophy, each being, whether animate or inanimate (plant, animal or human), carries on fitting actions corresponding to its own nature. They distinguished between \\"kathƒìkonta\\" and \\"katorth≈çmata,\\" a perfect action derived from the \\"orthos logos\\" (reason) (also \\"teleion kathƒìkon\\": a perfect, achieved kathƒìkonStobaeus, in Long, A.

They said that the wise person, or sage, necessarily carried out katorth≈çmata, that is, virtuous kathƒìkon, and that what distinguished both was not the nature of the act, but the way it was done. Thus, in exceptional circumstances, a sage (a state of being which in Stoic philosophy is nearly impossible to achieve) could carry out a katorth≈çma which, according to ordinary standards, would be deemed monstruous (for example, having sexual intercourse with one's daughter, if the destiny of humanity is at stake, or mutilating oneself.Diogenes La√´rtius, Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, VII, 108-109 (SVF III, 495, 496; transl. in Long, A.

But, according to the Stoic strict moral ideas, the acts of a layperson are always misguided (·ºÅŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒÆŒºŒ±œÑŒ± hamartƒìmata \\"mistakes,\\" or peccata), while the acts of the rare sage are always katorth≈çmata, perfect actions. The sage acts in view of the good, while the ordinary being (layperson, animal or plant) acts only in view of its survival. However, both act according to their own nature.  Indifferent things  Stoic philosophers distinguished another, intermediary level between kathƒìkonta and katorth≈çmata: mesa kathƒìkonta, or indifferent actions (which are neither appropriate, nor good). A list of kathƒìkonta would include: to stay in good health, to respect one's parents, etc. Para to kathƒìkon, or actions contrary to befitting actions, would be the reverse of this type of actions (to insult one's parents, etc.) Intermediary actions refers to \\"indifferent things\\" (·ºÄŒ¥ŒπŒ¨œÜŒøœÅŒ± -- adiaphora), which are in themselves neither good nor bad, but may be used in a convenient way or not. Such \\"indifferent things\\" include wealth, health, etc. These are not excluded from the domain of morality as one might expect: Cicero thus underlined, in De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (About the Ends of Goods and Evils, III, 58-59), that when the wise person acts in the sphere of \\"indifferent things,\\" he still acts conveniently, according to his own nature.  Intentionality and perfection  Intentionality is crucial in Stoic ethics: the morality of the act resides not in the act itself, but in the intentionality and the way in which it is realized, in other words, in the moral agent itself. Stobaeus defined kathƒìkonta as probable actions (probabilis ratio in Latin), or everything done for one reason (eulogos apologia in Greek). Cicero wrote: \\"quod autem ratione est, id officium appellamus; est igitur officium eius generis, quod nec in bonis ponatur nec in contrariis, in De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum, III, 58. Another distinction between kathƒìkon and katorth≈çmata has been to say that katorth≈çmata were kathƒìkonta which \\"possessed all the numbers\\" (pantas apechon tous arithmous),Review of Keimpe Algra, Jonathan Barnes, Jaap Mansfeld, Malcolm Schofield, The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999. Pp. xix + 916. . a Stoic expression meaning perfection.According to Long & Sedley, the origin of this image of containing all numbers should be researched in musical harmony, Long & Sedley, 1987, 59K Such a katorth≈çmata is done in harmony with all virtues, while the layperson may only act in accordance with one virtue, but not all of them. Stoics believe that all virtues are intertwined and that the perfect act encompasses all of them.Plutarch, On Stoic Self-Contradictions, in Moralia, 1046 E-F (SVF III, 299, 243 - see Long & Sedley, 1987, 61F)  References  Bibliography  *Long, A.

They folded in 1993. In 2011, the Seagulls were re-formed as a recreational ice hockey team, playing home games at the Sub Zero Ice Rink in Cleveleys. History=Early years= The Seagulls were formed in 1951 and played in the Midland Intermediate League from 1951 to 1955. In the 1955‚Äì56 season they lost just one match all year. In the 1960s with no official leagues in the UK, \\"non-league\\" ice hockey continued with mini-tournaments competed for at the ice rinks of Blackpool, Brighton Tigers, Durham Wasps, Southampton Vikings and Whitley Warriors and also included some teams who did not have a \\"home ice\\" at the time such as Harringay Racers, Richmond Flyers and Streatham Redskins. =Southern League= From 1970 to 1978 they played in the Southern League which was then the top-flight ice hockey league in England. Forward Brian Singer was named in the Southern A League, Midland Section, All-Star Team in 1975‚Äì76, and goaltender Dave Cartmell won the same honour for two consecutive seasons in 1977‚Äì78 and 1978‚Äì79. =English League North= When the top flight was split into two regional competitions in 1978 they joined the newly formed English League North. They were the English League North Champions two seasons running ‚Äì 1980‚Äì81 and 1981‚Äì82. That season they also played in the English National League which had been revived, though it lasted just the one season. It was also one of the more successful seasons in the club's history as they reached the end-of-season British Championships as winners of the English League North alongside English League South champions, Streatham Redskins as well as the top two Scottish sides ‚Äì Dundee Rockets and Murrayfield Racers, with the Seagulls game being shown on ITV. In the 1981‚Äì82 four out of the six players in the English League North All-Star team were Blackpool Seagulls players ‚Äì goal tender Andy Sharples, defenceman Steve Currie and forwards (and twin brothers), Canadians Brian and Bruce Simms. =British Hockey League= In 1982 they joined the newly formed British Hockey League (BHL) which had replaced the three top flight regional leagues in the United Kingdom, to form one top-flight league. In 1982‚Äì83 they finished second in Section C behind Altrincham Aces. The Seagulls then joined the newly created second tier of the BHL, the British Hockey League Division One. In their first season in the First Division, 1983‚Äì84 they finished in sixth place out of eleven teams. The following season was more successful as the Seagulls finished in third place behind champions Peterborough Pirates and runners-up Solihull Barons. The 1986‚Äì87 season saw the Seagulls finish in the lower half of the Division One table, in 11th out of sixteen teams. For the 1987‚Äì88 season, Division One was split into two regional leagues, each with eight teams. Blackpool were placed in Division One South. However, they had a poor season, ending up in 7th place with only Aviemore Blackhawks, who lost every match they played all season, finishing below them. =Final years= In 1993, ice hockey came to an end in Blackpool after 42 years, because the rink at the Pleasure Beach was considered to be too small to host competitive ice hockey. For a short while the Seagulls name was retained as the club and some of its players moved to the Blackburn Arena. But within a couple of years the Seagulls name was dropped completely. =Return of the Seagulls= In 2011 the Seagulls name was revived, with a recreational team that includes former Seagulls import Dave Anthony, who first played for them in 1984, and with a number of former players in the squad. The Seagulls first home game was played on 25 February, against the UK Firefighters team.

Linear mappings \\\\tilde{e}_i, \\\\tilde{f}_i : M \\\\to M can be defined on M_\\\\lambda by :\\\\tilde{e}_i u = \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty f_i^{(n-1)} u_n = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty e_i^{(n+1)} v_n, :\\\\tilde{f}_i u = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty f_i^{(n+1)} u_n = \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty e_i^{(n-1)} v_n. Let A be the integral domain of all rational functions in \\\\Q(q) which are regular at q = 0 (i.e. a rational function f(q) is an element of A if and only if there exist polynomials g(q) and h(q) in the polynomial ring \\\\Q[q] such that h(0) e 0, and f(q) = g(q)/h(q)). A crystal base for M is an ordered pair (L,B), such that *L is a free A-submodule of M such that M = \\\\Q(q) \\\\otimes_A L; *B is a \\\\Q-basis of the vector space L/qL over \\\\Q, *L = \\\\oplus_\\\\lambda L_\\\\lambda and B = \\\\sqcup_\\\\lambda B_\\\\lambda, where L_\\\\lambda = L \\\\cap M_\\\\lambda and B_\\\\lambda = B \\\\cap (L_\\\\lambda/qL_\\\\lambda), *\\\\tilde{e}_i L \\\\subset L and \\\\tilde{f}_i L \\\\subset L \\\\text{ for all } i , *\\\\tilde{e}_i B \\\\subset B \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} and \\\\tilde{f}_i B \\\\subset B \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}\\\\text{ for all } i, *\\\\text{for all }b \\\\in B\\\\text{ and }b' \\\\in B,\\\\text{ and for all }i,\\\\quad\\\\tilde{e}_i b = b'\\\\text{ if and only if }\\\\tilde{f}_i b' = b. To put this into a more informal setting, the actions of e_i f_i and f_i e_i are generally singular at q = 0 on an integrable module M. The linear mappings \\\\tilde{e}_i and \\\\tilde{f}_i on the module are introduced so that the actions of \\\\tilde{e}_i \\\\tilde{f}_i and \\\\tilde{f}_i \\\\tilde{e}_i are regular at q = 0 on the module. There exists a \\\\Q(q)-basis of weight vectors \\\\tilde{B} for M, with respect to which the actions of \\\\tilde{e}_i and \\\\tilde{f}_i are regular at q = 0 for all i. The module is then restricted to the free A-module generated by the basis, and the basis vectors, the A-submodule and the actions of \\\\tilde{e}_i and \\\\tilde{f}_i are evaluated at q = 0. Furthermore, the basis can be chosen such that at q = 0, for all i, \\\\tilde{e}_i and \\\\tilde{f}_i are represented by mutual transposes, and map basis vectors to basis vectors or 0. A crystal base can be represented by a directed graph with labelled edges. Each vertex of the graph represents an element of the \\\\mathbb Q-basis B of L/qL, and a directed edge, labelled by i, and directed from vertex v_1 to vertex v_2, represents that b_2 = \\\\tilde{f}_i b_1 (and, equivalently, that b_1 = \\\\tilde{e}_i b_2), where b_1 is the basis element represented by v_1, and b_2 is the basis element represented by v_2. The graph completely determines the actions of \\\\tilde{e}_i and \\\\tilde{f}_i at q = 0. If an integrable module has a crystal base, then the module is irreducible if and only if the graph representing the crystal base is connected (a graph is called \\"connected\\" if the set of vertices cannot be partitioned into the union of nontrivial disjoint subsets V_1 and V_2 such that there are no edges joining any vertex in V_1 to any vertex in V_2). For any integrable module with a crystal base, the weight spectrum for the crystal base is the same as the weight spectrum for the module, and therefore the weight spectrum for the crystal base is the same as the weight spectrum for the corresponding module of the appropriate Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra. The multiplicities of the weights in the crystal base are also the same as their multiplicities in the corresponding module of the appropriate Kac‚ÄìMoody algebra. It is a theorem of Kashiwara that every integrable highest weight module has a crystal base. Similarly, every integrable lowest weight module has a crystal base. =Tensor products of crystal bases= Let M be an integrable module with crystal base (L,B) and M' be an integrable module with crystal base (L',B'). For crystal bases, the coproduct \\\\Delta, given by :\\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta(k_{\\\\lambda}) &= k_\\\\lambda \\\\otimes k_\\\\lambda \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Delta(e_i) &= e_i \\\\otimes k_i^{-1} + 1 \\\\otimes e_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Delta(f_i) &= f_i \\\\otimes 1 + k_i \\\\otimes f_i \\\\end{align} is adopted. The integrable module M \\\\otimes_{\\\\Q(q)} M' has crystal base (L \\\\otimes_A L',B \\\\otimes B'), where B \\\\otimes B' = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ b \\\\otimes_{\\\\Q} b' : b \\\\in B,\\\\ b' \\\\in B' \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. For a basis vector b \\\\in B, define :\\\\varepsilon_i(b) = \\\\max \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ n \\\\ge 0 : \\\\tilde{e}_i^n b e 0 \\\\right \\\\\\\\} :\\\\varphi_i(b) = \\\\max \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ n \\\\ge 0 : \\\\tilde{f}_i^n b e 0 \\\\right \\\\\\\\} The actions of \\\\tilde{e}_i and \\\\tilde{f}_i on b \\\\otimes b' are given by :\\\\begin{align} \\\\tilde{e}_i (b \\\\otimes b') &= \\\\begin{cases} \\\\tilde{e}_i b \\\\otimes b' & \\\\varphi_i(b) \\\\ge \\\\varepsilon_i(b') \\\\\\\\\\\\ b \\\\otimes \\\\tilde{e}_i b' & \\\\varphi_i(b) < \\\\varepsilon_i(b') \\\\end{cases} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\tilde{f}_i (b \\\\otimes b') &= \\\\begin{cases} \\\\tilde{f}_i b \\\\otimes b' & \\\\varphi_i(b) > \\\\varepsilon_i(b') \\\\\\\\\\\\ b \\\\otimes \\\\tilde{f}_i b' & \\\\varphi_i(b) \\\\le \\\\varepsilon_i(b') \\\\end{cases} \\\\end{align} The decomposition of the product two integrable highest weight modules into irreducible submodules is determined by the decomposition of the graph of the crystal base into its connected components (i.e. the highest weights of the submodules are determined, and the multiplicity of each highest weight is determined).

History The present Little Rock station opened August 1, 1921, having been constructed by the Missouri Pacific Railroad after a fire destroyed the prior station on April 7, 1920. The structure used existing foundations, some exterior walls and the clock tower of the previous station, which had survived the fire. The station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as \\"Mopac Station\\". Although known as Union Station, this particular structure was used by only a single railroad, Missouri Pacific. Prior structures on this site were served by two additional railroads, Memphis & Little Rock (1874‚Äì1893) and St. Louis Southwestern Railroad (known as the 'Cotton Belt'). (ca. 1892‚Äì1910). The present (1921) structure was predated by a large wooden structure erected in 1874, and a brick station that opened in 1909 and burned in 1920. The main entrance to Union Station was located on the Markham Street level, and waiting rooms, ticket office and a restaurant were located on this level. The upper two floors housed the railroad's train dispatchers and offices of the freight and passenger departments, American Refrigerator Transit, and the Pullman Company, which staffed the sleeping and dining cars of passenger trains. The basement (track level) held extensive mail and Railway Express Agency facilities, a baggage room, and a small dining car commissary. Passenger access to the tracks was via an open air midway extending from the north side of the building, with stairways and three umbrella sheds extending in each direction at track level. This midway structure was original to the 1908 station, having survived the 1920 fire. Missouri Pacific passenger service to Little Rock ended just after midnight on May 1, 1971. The remaining umbrella sheds and midway were dismantled in October 1973, less than six months before Amtrak began a new passenger route through Little Rock. Amtrak continued to use the original waiting room and ticket office area until July 1992. The waiting area and ticket offices were relocated to a newly renovated area of the station located at track level.

The school has close connections to companies in France. Its Office of Career Services provides students with a range of internships and job offers. There are over 2500 offers of internships and jobs from companies and other organisations on the CELSA web site for students to choose from. Many students are hired by the company, agency or regional authority where they do their final internship. The Alumni Association organises monthly meetings and other events and publishes a directory of its 800 members.  Fields of study  Journalism \\\\---- Founded in 1979, the journalism section admits students with a three-year post-secondary school qualification. It is one of the most selective and prestigious programmes in journalism in the country. Each year, around 850 candidates apply for admission, though only 25 are offered a place (2006). It offers a two-year programme accredited by the French journalism profession, which prepares students for all branches of the media and offers no specialisation. It is a highly practical professional course taught mostly by senior journalists from national radio and television stations, daily newspapers and press agencies. Other practical aspects of the programme include three internships: the first internship is in a local or regional newspaper where students cover local news and publish articles. This gives them practical experience in the workings of a press organisation. The second and third internships take place during the summer break and can be done in any of the media, in France or abroad. There is a professional assignment each year for a media publication or radio station. As part of their curriculum, students are also required to do coursework to obtain a French 'Master Professionnel' degree in journalism. CELSA's alumni work for highly regarded French media institutions, such as TF1, France 2, France 3, Canal Plus, France 24, Arte (TV); Le Monde, Le Figaro, Lib√©ration (print) or Radio France Internationale, RTL, Europe 1 (radio)... Corporate and institutional communication \\\\---- This is the study of the practices involved in managing and improving the reputation, visibility and image of organisations, and the issues involved in this process. It is the study of the process of explanation of the organisation's strategy to a wide variety of audiences from staff, shareholders and clients to opinion makers such as journalists and elected representatives. It highlights the strategic role of communications in an organisation and offers an understanding of the contexts within which communications campaigns are necessary. The programme introduces students to all the facets of organisational and institutional communications as well as to the tasks carried out by the different practitioners in this field. It provides thorough training to students in the analytical methods and tools needed to plan and undertake major assignments. The course prepares students for a wide variety of careers, and requires students with a solid general knowledge and an ability both to sum up situations and offer suitable responses. Marketing, advertising and communication \\\\---- This section trains students who want to become executives in advertising or market research, or who want to specialise in brand management, rather than in pure marketing. It gives students a thorough training in implementing a brand strategy. It teaches students to master the main qualitative and quantitative tools of analysis used in communications. The curriculum includes a series of courses taught by academic staff in fields such as semiology, thus enhancing students' promotion potential in the marketing sector. Other lessons are taught by executives from French and international communications agencies and companies, who provide students with practical information on topics ranging from strategic planning to the legal environment, as well as the latest trends in brand management. Human resources management \\\\---- The human resource management section trains students to manage a company's most valuable resource, its people, and to reconcile the organisation's objectives with the needs of employees. The section offers courses in three broad fields. Firstly, an understanding of organisations and their goals. In order to understand the context within which all human resource policies operate, there are lectures on the French and European socio-economic environment. Secondly, the social sciences are taught - sociology, psycho-sociology and employee relations - to broaden students' understanding of the relations between the individual and the group. Finally, the programme introduces students to the more practical aspects of human resource management such as labour law, recruitment, career management, earnings policy and employee communication. The section has recently created an option dealing with the application of information technology to human resource management. Intercultural management and communication \\\\---- The Magist√®re in communications offers students the widest training in the social sciences, from sociology to ethnology and psycho-sociology. The aim is to enable them to analyse effectively a wide range of behavioural phenomena as well as understand the communications problems and challenges that firms and organisations face today, and to give them the potential to evolve to senior positions quickly. In particular, the program trains students to deal with situations involving cultural and employee diversity, as well as corporate situations with departments having different management cultures. Communication, media, and media transformation \\\\---- The emergence of digital communications has changed the information and communication practices of organisations and firms. This section addresses students interested in the general question of the transformation information undergoes between an institution and its public. The teaching is centred on the analysis, setting- up and management of media systems in the communication strategy of organisations. The first year covers the different theories of information and communication, the history, sociology and economics of the media. The second- year offers an in-depth analysis of different media devices (semiology, media consumption, different styles of writing and reading) and the communication strategies which accompany them. The courses offer a thorough grounding in the entire range of media production (from in-house magazines to institutional web sites) and the vertical production chain within the media. This section trains professionals who will be responsible in the future for media messages in all sectors, from NGOs to public sector bodies, more particularly in digital communications, which predominates at the moment. The students also explore emerging models of communications and new media linked to the internet.  Student Associations Two associations have been created by CELSA students. They contribute to the school's general atmosphere and to its students' well- being. POP'COM is the Student Bureau. Its main objective is to liven up students' cultural, recreational, sportive, social and humanitarian activities, to favour strong ties between students and to contribute to our students's richness inside and outside the CELSA. Each year several events are organized: a freshers' integration week-end, parties, and a Gala. JUNIOR COMMUNICATION is the Junior Achievement group. Junior Communication's programs focus on work readiness, entrepreneurship, and financial literacy, and teach CELSA students important skills to help them become economically empowered. Their missions are suggested to communication agencies looking for such services.

He was killed in April 2004 in Chechnya by the Russian federal forces. Al-Walid was one of the most prominent Arabs fighting in Chechnya. In 2002 he took over as emir (commander) of an autonomous unit, composed mostly of non-Chechen mujahideen, following the death of Ibn al-Khattab on 20 March 2002. Abu al-Walid was accused by Russians of terrorist attacks on civilians, and alleged to be an agent of Saudi intelligence, the Muslim Brotherhood, or Bin Laden's al-Qaeda. He never responded or admitted to any of the charges, but condemned abuses by Russian forces in Chechnya.\\"Russia warned of new attacks\\", Al Jazeera  Identity  During his lifetime, al-Walid stayed out of the spotlight. His predecessor, Ibn al-Khattab (more commonly known as Khattab), was known to have a personal camera crew of two who followed him into combat. Speculation arose about al- Walid's identity, whereabouts and actions, and occasionally there were rumours of his death. A persistent rumour was that he had drowned in June 2002, carried off on his horse after trying to ford a river. Russian officials announced his death at least seven times.\\"Chechnya's Abu Walid and the Saudi Dilemma\\", The Jamestown Foundation; At one point, even his very existence was deemed doubtful. On 23 June 2002, his family gave an interview to the Saudi newspaper Al-Watan, telling much about his background.\\"Interview with Abu Al- Walid's family\\", Al-Watan, 23 June 2002 (Arabic) They said his full given name was Abd Al-Aziz Bin Ali Bin Said Al Said Al-Ghamdi.  Biography = Early life = Al-Walid was raised in the village of al-Hal, near the city of Baljorashi in Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Al Bahah Province. In his native village, his father was a well known imam. The boy was born into a large family as one of eleven sons. His brothers claimed that in his youth, al-Walid had enjoyed acting, reading religious books and studying the Quran. = Afghanistan, Bosnia and Tajikistan = In 1986, when he was 16 years old, al-Walid obtained his parents' permission to participate in jihad in Afghanistan. He soon left for the country to join the mujahideen in their fight against the Russian forces during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War. The next two years he spent training at the Maktab al-Khidamat, an organization created by Abdullah Azzam and Osama bin Laden. They trained the international volunteers and distributed funds to Islamic groups. Upon completing his training, al-Walid was assigned to a combat unit where he started fighting. On two occasions he briefly returned to Saudi Arabia, once to have an injury to his left hand treated. After the end of the Afghan War, al-Walid went on to fight in other conflicts in Europe and Asia. In the 1990s, the movement would lead him to the Balkans, where he fought alongside the Bosnian Muslims in the Bosnian War; Tajikistan, where he assisted Muslim rebels in the Tajik Civil war; and eventually to Chechnya, where he joined the band called the Arab mujahideen. This group had been organized by and was being led by Ibn al-Khattab. = First Chechen War = In the First Chechen War, al-Walid served as a Naib (deputy) in Khattab's unit. He participated in the numerous raids and ambushes that were executed by the IIB, including the April 1996 Shatoy ambush, in which they attacked and destroyed a large Russian armoured column. = Interwar period and Dagestan War = After the war, he remained in Chechnya along with most of the battalion It concentrated on setting up a network of camps in the mountainous South of the country, in which they trained Islamist rebels from throughout the region, and recruits from abroad. He married a Chechen woman. They had two children together. On 22 December 1997 al-Walid participated in a surprise attack on the base of the 136th Armoured Brigade of the Russian Army, stationed in Buynaksk, Dagestan.Chechen Gunmen Attack Russian Army Unit in Dagestan This raid contributed to the growing tensions between Moscow and the newly formed government of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. In 1999 he participated in the Islamic International Peacekeeping Brigade‚Äôs invasion of Dagestan, which helped catalyze the Second Chechen War. During this conflict, Khattab's first deputy Hakim al-Medani was killed. Analysts believe that after al-Medani's death, al-Walid was promoted to the position of first deputy. Before the events of 1999 in Dagestan, al-Walid was a relatively unknown figure outside of Chechnya. After his incursion, his notoriety began to rise in Islamist circles abroad. = Second Chechen War = In the Second Chechen War, al-Walid continued as Khattab‚Äôs deputy to participate in raids and ambushes. In the spring of 2000, he achieved his most important military victories. On 29 February, he led the Battle of Ulus-Kert. His forces engaged and surrounded an entire company of the VDV 76th Guards Air Assault Division from Pskov. The battle lasted for several days and eventually resulted in the total annihilation of the Russian company. The separatist news agency Chechenpress reported that only 12 Chechen rebels had been killed in the battle, while Russian sources estimated their losses at up to 300 men. In April 2000, al-Walid successfully attacked the VDV 51st Guards Parachute Landing Regiment from Tula. In the summer of 2001, the late Aslan Maskhadov, then president of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, appointed Abu al-Walid commander of the Eastern front. After Khattab‚Äôs death on 20 March 2002, al- Walid assumed command of the IIB. Soon afterwards he released an article through the foreign Mujahideen‚Äôs official website al-Qoqaz, in which he explained the circumstances surrounding Khattab‚Äôs death. The release of this article also confirmed that he had taken command of the IIB. Later he also issued a video-statement, in which he commented on the death of his predecessor. On 9 April 2002, al-Walid announced that his forces had shot down the Mil Mi-24 ‚ÄòHind‚Äô gunship and taken its three-man crew prisoner. It had been reported missing for two months. He released the serial number of the helicopter and detailed information about the crew members. On 16 May he issued an ultimatum to the Russian military authorities: threatening to kill the three prisoners if the Russians failed to release 20 Chechens being held in Russian prisons. The Russians did not comply. The online Chechen Islamist news agency, Kavkaz Center, claimed it has unconfirmed information that the crew had been executed. = Death = Al-Walid was killed by members of Sulim Yamadaev‚Äôs Special Battalion ‚ÄúVostok‚Äù (East) in Chechnya on 16 April 2004. Although there are several versions of the circumstances, the most extensive account is derived from a letter written by Abu Hafs al-Urduni, who assumed command of the Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya. He said that al-Walid was ‚Äúon tour to all regiments to task them with operations and logistical plans.\\" Members of his party were captured in the village of Tsa-Vedeno, and pro-Moscow security forces determined \\"his position in a nearby forest.‚Äù After heavy bombardment of the area, snipers ambushed and killed al-Walid. Abu al-Walid's brother Ali Al Ghamdi said that Abu al-Walid was ambushed and shot by the Russian Special Forces in the forest near the village of Tsa-Vedeno. Ali said that Abu al-walid's companions were able to hide his body from the Russian forces in the forest then buried him later. He also said that the information about Abu Al-Walid's being betrayed were wrong and that his brother was shot in a fight with the Russian forces. Abu al-Walid's will was not to be filmed after his death. Vladimir Putin rewarded Yamadaev as a Hero of the Russian Federation at the Kremlin in the summer of 2005.  Allegations of terrorism  Russian authorities often accused Khattab, al-Walid and other Arabs fighting in Chechnya, of involvement in terrorism. According to the FSB, Al- Walid was responsible for several terrorist attacks, including the 1999 apartment bombings, the 2002 Kaspiysk bombing, and planned but never executed bacteriological attacks on Russia. He and Shamil Basayev were also accused of organizing the suicide-bombing of the Chechen Republic's Government headquarters in Grozny on 27 December 2002. Only Basayev claimed responsibility for the latter attack, but Russian officials asserted that the ‚ÄúArab methods‚Äù suggested that it was done by ‚ÄúArab militants trained in Afghanistan‚Äù. Al-Walid has been accused of being an agent of al-Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood, and Saudi Intelligence. He never responded to such allegations, and never claimed responsibility for any of these terrorist attacks. He never admitted to being a member of al-Qaeda, the Muslim Brotherhood, or Saudi Intelligence. Al-Walid did comment on other acts of terrorism. On 11 June 2003, the London-based Arabic newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat reported on a statement he had released through the al-Qoqaz News Agency. He encouraged the Iraqi insurgents to carry out suicide operations. He was quoted as saying; ‚ÄúAccording to [my] experience in the Caucasus, such operations will have an effect on American and British troops.‚Äù Abu al-Walid issuing a video statement on Al Jazeera On 19 November 2003, the Qatar-based Arabic television network Al-Jazeera broadcast a video statement in which al-Walid commented on suicide bombings by Chechen women; he claimed the attacks were motivated by fear of rape and brutality by Russian soldiers. A translation of this statement is available on BBC Monitoring; he was quoted as saying; > ‚ÄúThese women, particularly the wives of the Mujahideen who were martyred, > are being threatened in their homes, their honour and everything are being > threatened. They do not accept being humiliated and living under occupation. > They say that they want to serve the cause of Almighty God and avenge the > death of their husbands and persecuted people.‚Äù On 13 March 2004, one day > before the Russian presidential election, al-Walid released another video > statement broadcast by Al-Jazeera. He commented on the Russian strategy of > dropping mines in the forested areas from which the Chechen insurgents are > carrying out their guerrilla war against the Federal Armed Forces and their > Chechen collaborators. He was quoted as saying the following; > >> ‚ÄúThe enemies of God drop mines in the forests and God willing, we will return them to the Russians and they will find them on their land and in the midst of their families. (‚Ä¶) But perhaps we may wait a little to see the upcoming elections. If they elect someone who declares war on Chechnya, then the Russians are declaring war against the Chechens and by God we will send them these [mines]... Not only these but also things that did not cross their minds. (‚Ä¶) We will return these to you [Russians]‚Ä¶ You will, God willing, see hundreds of people crippled.‚Äù The Amirs of the Arab mujahideen in Chechnya have helped acquire and distribute funds provided by wealthy, Salafist charities, such as al-Haramein. But there has not been solid evidence of links to al-Qaeda or other international terrorist organizations.

Originally designated in the genus Chryseomonas, the species has since been reassigned to the genus Pseudomonas. Morphology Pseudomonas luteola is a Gram-negative, motile aerobe. Its motility is created by multitrichous flagella. They grow as rods of 0.8 Œºm to 2.5 Œºm.http://www.tgw1916.net/Pseudomonas/luteola.html Colonies produce a yellow- orange pigment. Optimal temperature for growth is 30 ¬∞C. Importantly for classification, it grows best on heart infusion agar supplemented with 5% horse blood. It is also able to grow on TSA, Nutrient Agar, Mac Conkey or CASA Agar. Biosorption Pseudomonas luteola can absorb certain heavy metals such as Cr(VI) and Al(III). Both ions are found in industrial wastewaters. These metals are specifically targeted by P. luteola strain TEM05. Under relatively acidic conditions (pH: 4 and 5 for each ion respectively). Experiments indicated a maximum adsorption capacity of 55.2 mg g‚àí1 for Al(III) and 3.0 mg g‚àí1 for Cr(VI). This same strain is also known to produce an exopolysaccharide (EPS) utilized in the adsorption of nickel and copper. In order to adsorb Ni and Cu at significant levels, the strain must be immobilized in a calcium alginate beads. With this enhancement, maximum adsorption capacities range from 45.87‚Äì50.81 mg g‚àí1 and 52.91‚Äì61.73 mg g‚àí1, respectively. Pathenogenicity The pathogenic form of Pseudomonas luteola is a saprophyte. It is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause bacteremia, meningitis, prosthetic valve endocarditis, peritonitis in humans and animals. P. luteola is registered by the CDC as group Ve-1. Most strains are susceptible to broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as cephalosporins, aminosids, and ciprofloxacin. However, infections associated with foreign material are highly resistant, and infected prostheses have to be removed if possible.

They can be distinguished from other nonfermenters by their negative oxidase reaction and aerobic character. This organism can infect individuals that have major illnesses, including those undergoing surgery or with catheters in their body.Lejbkowicz et al., \\"Bacteraemia and Sinusitis due to Flavimonas oryzihabitans Infection,\\" Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Diseases 35 (2003): 411-414 Based on the 16S RNA analysis, these bacteria have been placed in the Pseudomonas putida group. History Part of the genus Pseudomonas, originally described in 1894, these bacteria were first identified in urine and gastrointestinal specimens in 1928 by two scientists, E.G. Dresel and O Stickl.Lucas et al., \\"Sepsis Caused by Flavimonas orzyhabitans,\\" Medicine 73 (1994): 209-214 At first, this organism was named Chromobacterium typhiflavuum because it closely resembled the bacteria that caused enteric fever. The name change to Pseudomonas oryzihabitans occurred in 1985 after scientist Kentaro Kodama and his team isolated the bacteria from a rice field and found that it had a phenotypic similarity to the pseudomonas organisms. This organism has also been isolated in the hospital environment from a wide variety of sites such as wounds, eyes, skin, ears, and several other places, although they can be found in damp environments as well.Giacometti et al., \\"Unusual Clinical Presentation of Infection due to Flavimonas oryzihabitans,\\" European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases 17 (1998): 645-648 As of today, there is little known about the pathogenic qualities of P. oryzihabitans, so possible virulent strains cannot be described or identified absolutely. Pathogenesis Pseudomonas oryzihabitans, although an uncommon pathogen, is able to cause infections in individuals that usually have compromised immune systems. While most strains of this bacteria do not cause infections, the patients that acquire P. oryzihabitans most likely have an underlying disease, and it spreads while the patients are hospitalized. This includes patients that have recently undergone surgery and also those affected by diseases such as AIDS, leukemia, and other illnesses that have a detrimental effect on the immune system.Dussart-Baptista et al., \\"Recurrent recovery of Pseudomonas oryzihabitans strains in a karstified chalk aquifer,\\" Water Research 41 (2007): 96-102 From several studies involving cases of P. oryzihabitans, research reveals that there is a close relationship between infection, underlying disease, and the presence of catheters in patients. This means that infections occur most in people that have debilitating disease and have artificial material located in their bodies. Along with catheters, P. oryzihabitans are most commonly found at sites involved with respiratory equipment and devices for continuous ambulatory dialysis, and these bacteria can spread through contaminated fluids and unsterilized or defiled medical tools. If this is the case, it is important for hygiene to be maintained internally and externally to help stop the spread of the bacteria and prevent infectious disease. Infections can be either nosocomially acquired, which means that the bacteria originated during a patient's duration in the hospital forty-eight hours after admittance, or they are community-acquired, which means that the patient had evidence of infection before admission or during the first forty-eight hours in the hospital. Most infections result in bacteraemia in patients that are extremely sick or peritonitis in individuals that undergo ambulatory peritoneal dialysis consistently. Several reports of infections these bacteria cause are correlated with patients who have AIDS. P. oryzihabitans is increasingly identified as a cause of opportunistic infections, taking advantage of weak immune systems in people. However, it is rare for the infection to escalate into sepsis, but there have been cases where patients have acquired the disease. Although these bacteria are able to cause infections, its role as a pathogen is questionable since this does not happen very often. Diagnosis/symptoms Symptoms of an infection of P. oryzihabitans are actually quite vague and similar to the signs that can indicate other illnesses or diseases, so it is relatively difficult to identify when only looking at symptoms. However, in several cases, these infections result after an individual's immune system has been weakened, so it is likely to occur in recovering or ill patients. Most patients, after receiving treatment for another disease or during recovery from surgery, experience chills and increase in body temperature. While these symptoms could mean a variety of things, it is clear that the patient's recovery is halted and that there is an infection of some sort. In an example where a woman developed an infection of P. oryzihabitans from a case of sinusitis, she experienced the same chills and elevated temperature, but also nasal discharge containing pus, right facial pain, and a fever. To establish that these patients are infected with Pseudomonas oryzihabitans, blood samples are collected for tests and sent for cultures to be identified. Since the presence of these bacteria may not initially be known by any symptoms, having it identified in a lab will help with treating it. In certain situations, its role as a pathogen is also identified through evidence of pulmonary signs and symptoms, radiograph findings, and positive blood cultures. Treatment In the past reported cases of P. oryzihabitans, the patients were given antibiotics to treat the infection. These bacteria are fairly easy to treat, with a range of antibiotics that they are susceptible to. The antibiotics that the infectious disease responded to are gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, carbapenems, cephalosprins, aminoglycosides, and quinolones. While there are several kinds of medicines that can treat P. oryzihabitans, the carbapenem displayed the best results against infections. In a study where cultures of these bacteria were grown, tests showed that all the isolates were susceptible to carbapenem antibiotics, however, the vulnerability to other medicines differed among the groups. Past studies also revealed that P. oryzihabitans were susceptible in vitro to antipseudomonal penicillins. Treatments for the bacteria differ and depend on the host and the different strains of P. oryzihabitans. =Resistance= The types of antibiotics that P. oryzihabitans are resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and cefazolin.Marin et al., \\"Infection of Hickman Catheter by Pseudomonas (formerly Flavimonas) orzyhabitans Traced to a Synthetic Bath Sponge,\\" Journal of Clinical Microbiology 38 (2000): 4577-4579 Since these bacteria are not as harmful or virulent to the host, antibiotics should clear up the infection, although in some cases, since they can be found around the sites of prosthetic material, catheter removal is required.Esteban et al., \\"Pseudomonas orzyhabitans Peritonitis on a Patient on Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis,\\" Clinical Microbiology and Infection 8 (2002): 607-608 =Prevention= In order to prevent an infection from these bacteria, good hygiene is required, especially when foreign materials or objects like catheters are in the body. However, even this cannot completely prevent P. oryzihabitans because of environmental contamination that could lead to acquirement of this organism. In cases of patients with indwelling catheters, special care should be taken so that a community-acquired infection does not occur. It is recommended that these people should avoid the use of bath sponges and wet items for skin care, as these can be sites of growth and contamination of the bacteria. Ecology By studying the environments in which P. oryzihabitans are found, scientists are able to get a clearer picture on how infections occur and how these bacteria may be found on individuals outside hospitals. Although the bacteria can be nosocomially acquired, the environment must be taken into account as a host for them. These bacteria, while observed in hospital sites, can originally be found in damp environments such as locations with water, stagnant or running, and soil. Data indicates that environmental sources could be a reason for the development of an infectious disease, as well as the presence of foreign objects in the body. These bacteria were first studied in depth and identified after they were isolated from a rice paddy.Kodama et al., \\"Two New Species of Pseudomonas: P. oryzihabitans Isolated from Rice Paddy and Clinical Specimens and P. luteola Isolated from Clinical Specimens,\\" Int J Syst Bacteriol 35 (1985): 467-474 In one study, researchers found that P. oryzihabitans contaminated drinking water supply and questioned whether or not these bacteria are commonly found in naturally distributed water. The water supply systems were in contact with an object that is directly connected to sinkholes, which are known sites for the bacteria to linger. Since sinkholes are large underground cavities, they have enough room to foster water, making this environment an ideal place for P. oryzihabitans to grow. These bacteria are able to persist in biofilms where they are relatively protected from chlorine disinfection. Their presence in drinking water is attributable to this fact. When an infection caused by P. oryzihabitans was reported in a patient with AIDS and an indwelling catheter, scientists took samples from the man's home to see where these bacteria were located and to find out a possible explanation for his infection. The patient claimed that he followed the strict hygienic guidelines pertaining to catheters, so an environmental factor is responsible for the infection. They ended up tracing the origin of the bacteria to a bath sponge. In order for researchers to validate these findings, they also tested bath sponges from other households and found P. oryzihabitans in some separate samples as well. This suggests that the water could be contaminated with these bacteria, which in turn, could lead to potential infections in certain individuals. Clinical significance Infections from P. oryzihabitans are increasingly associated with catheter- related bacteremia, peritonitis, wound infections, and meningitis (after surgery), mostly in patients with diseases that significantly weaken the individual. Foreign material present in the body predisposes patients to infections, as well as those with severely weakened immune systems. Most cases are nosocomially acquired, however, there are infections detected upon admission to a hospital. There are also cases where P. oryzihabitans was a causation of sepsis in some people. The only other oxidase negative Pseudomonas is P. luteola. Physiology The cells of Pseudomonas oryzihabitans are rods with rounded ends. These Gram-negative bacteria are able to move due to a flagellum, and the cells occur singularly and very rarely in pairs. Strains of these bacteria produce a yellow water-insoluble pigment in their cells. Their metabolism is restricted to an aerobic respiratory system. They are oxidative but not fermentative, and when isolated and cultured, their growth occurs on MacConkey agar and SS agar.

His book, now in its seventh edition, is a comprehensive source of information on the origins and history of Oregon place names. It is a standard reference book in libraries throughout Oregon and the Pacific Northwest. Tam McArthur Rim in the Cascade Mountains is named in his honor. Personal life McArthur was born on April 27, 1883, in The Dalles, Oregon. He grew up on a farm near Rickreall. His family later moved to Portland, where he attended Portland Academy. His family had long been associated with Oregon history and government. His paternal grandfather, Navy Lieutenant William P. McArthur, had conducted the first survey of the Pacific Coast for the United States Coast Survey in 1849 and 1850. His maternal grandfather, James W. Nesmith, arrived in Oregon in 1843 and played an important role in territorial and early state government, serving as one of Oregon‚Äôs United States Senators from 1861 to 1867 and as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1873 to 1875. His father, Lewis Linn McArthur, served as a justice of the Oregon Supreme Court from 1870 to 1878 and then as the United States Attorney for the State of Oregon. His mother, Harriet Nesmith McArthur, organized of the Oregon Historical Society and served on its board from 1898 until 1924.\\"Notable Oregonians: Lewis A.

McArthur, Oregon Geographic Names (Seventh Edition), Oregon Historical Society Press, Portland, Oregon, 2003, Preface vii. McArthur attended University of California, graduating in 1908. During his college years, he worked for The Oregonian newspaper during the summer. After graduation, he got a job with the Oregon Electric Railway. In 1910, McArthur went to work for the Pacific Power and Light Company, as one of its first employees. By 1923, he was appointed vice- president and general manager. He continued with the company until his retirement in 1946. McArthur also served as president of the Oregon Historical Society from 1937 until 1945. He died in Portland on November 8, 1951. Geographic historian McArthur's official connection with Oregon geography began when Governor Oswald West appointed him to the Oregon Geographic Board (now the Oregon Geographic Names Board) in 1914. Two years later, he was elected board secretary. He served in that position until 1949, when he resigned after 35 years on the board. McArthur‚Äôs position on the Oregon Geographic Board allowed him the opportunity to research the history of Oregon place names using a wide range of sources. He studied the journals of early explorers, read pioneer diaries, browsed newspapers archives, researched government documents, and thoroughly reviewed every book on Oregon history he could find. He also conducted personal interviews with pioneer Oregonians who were still living at the time.Vaughan, Champ Clark, \\"The Oregon Geographic Names Board One Hundred Years of Toponymic Nomenclature\\", Oregon Historical Quarterly (Volume 109, Number 3), Portland, Oregon, Fall 2008. The Oregon Historical Society published his research in eight issues of the Oregon Historical Quarterly in the early 1920s. In 1928, McArthur paid to have the first edition of Oregon Geographic Names published. The book was quickly recognized as the authoritative source for information regarding the origins and history of Oregon place names. A second edition was published in 1944. In that edition, McArthur added a great deal of new information about Oregon post offices and abandoned settlement sites. The book‚Äôs third edition was published in 1951, shortly after his death. Legacy Today, Oregon Geographic Names remains the authoritative source for information on the origins and history of Oregon place names. After McArthur‚Äôs death, his son, Lewis L. McArthur, continued his work, publishing the fourth through seventh editions of his book. The seventh edition of Oregon Geographic Names was published by the Oregon Historical Society in 2003. It contains information on over 6,200 Oregon geographic features and communities throughout the state including early settlements that no longer exist.Murphy, Alexander B., \\"Oregon Geographic Names, seventh edition\\" , Oregon Historical Quarterly (Volume 106, Number 1), Portland, Oregon, Spring 2005.Payne, Roger L., \\"Oregon Geographic Names\\", Oregon Historical Society, Portland, Oregon, 2008. After his death, the United States Board on Geographic Names named Tam McArthur Rim in his honor. The rim is a prominent ridge with a high cliff face located on the east side of the Cascade Mountains in Deschutes County, Oregon.

The Arkansas-Texas border bisects the structure; the eastern part, including the waiting room and ticket office, are in Texarkana, Arkansas, but the western part is in Texarkana, Texas, meaning stopped trains span both states. The station was built in 1928 and was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1978.  History  Texarkana Union Station was constructed and operated by Union Station Trust, a subsidiary organization created as a joint effort between the Missouri-Pacific, Texas & Pacific, Cotton Belt and Kansas City Southern railroads. E. M. Tucker, chief architect for Missouri Pacific, designed the building with a track layout and overhead concourse reminiscent of the style he had used when rebuilding Little Rock Union Depot after a 1921 fire. The present structure replaced an earlier Texarkana station on the same site, and was opened for business on April 17, 1930, with a large celebration and dedication held on May 12, 1930, according to Missouri Pacific Lines Magazine, June 1930. The station and the federal courthouse anchor the south and north ends of State Line Avenue, the dividing line between Arkansas and Texas. In 1876, Congress mandated that the Texarkana railroad station would straddle the state line, and the building has entrances and exits into both states. Missouri Pacific and Texas and Pacific, the two carriers with the most passenger trains serving Texarkana Union Station, were able to operate through the facility without a backup move. Kansas City Southern and Cotton Belt passenger trains both made back-up moves to access the station. Provisions were made in the original station design for a restaurant, but as a result of the Great Depression, the only food service was provided by a snack bar and news stand. The station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

The nine-storeyed mill is 80 ft (24.4 metres) to the curb and 100 ft (29.6 metres) to top of the ogee cap. In full working order again with its (or her) four patent sails on, Moulton mill is the tallest working windmill in Great Britain and one of the tallest worldwide. (The 9-storey tower windmill at Sutton, near Stalham, Norfolk has about 67 ft 6 in to the curb, 79 ft 6 in to the top of the Norfolk boat-shaped cap). The mill, built in c. 1822 by Robert King, was a fully functioning windmill, grinding wheat and other products. However, on 20 December 1894, the sails were damaged in a harsh gale and were removed in 1895. Soon afterwards, a steam system was installed to power the mill. A. W. Tindall leased it from the King family from 1890 until 1921. The Biggadike family, who took over tenancy of the mill in 1924 continued to mill, albeit small quantities of animal feed, until 1995. A local campaign was established to restore the Grade I listed mill to full working condition. In 2003, the mill featured on the first series of BBC2's Restoration with Tim Wonnacott as its Celebrity Advocate. The project won a large Heritage Lottery Fund grant, which, along with many fundraising events has meant that the \\"Friends of Moulton Mill\\" campaign has succeeded in raising enough money to restore and refurbish the mill's structure and add a new cap. The new white ogee cap, (which weighs 14 ton) is visible for miles across the flat Fenland landscape. A caf√© and shop has also been built, and the mill has disabled access, allowing disabled visitors to see some of the mill's inner workings.

Life Born on 4 February 1896 to John Ernest Phythian and Ada Crompton Prichard in Crumpsall, Manchester, the then Mabel Phythian's father was a solicitor, local politician and a lay preacher, with a great interest in the arts and education. She attended the University of Manchester, where she was commonly known as \\"Phiz\\". She was on the (Manchester) Committee of the Free German League of Culture in Great Britain, founded by published by German and Austrian refugee organisations and supportive British groups, including Albert Einstein, the artist Oskar Kokoschka, writer Thomas Mann and actress Sybil Thorndike. The League had its own publishing company, Inside Nazi Germany, and a major artist, John Heartfield, producing most of its illustrative material. Tylecote served as a Manchester City Councillor, and stood as a Labour Parliamentary candidate on several occasions. In later years, her husband, Dr. Frank Edward Tylecote, a physician and early researcher into the link between smoking and lung cancer, also served as a City Councillor as a Conservative. This was Frank's second marriage, following the death of his first wife; Mabel became stepmother to his son and daughter, and the couple later had a son also. Tylecote was made a DBE in 1966. Mabel Tylecote Building The Mabel Tylecote Building was a Manchester Metropolitan University building on the University's All Saints Campus. It housed teaching and learning space for the Department of Languages and the MMU School of Theatre as well as academic and administrative staff offices. This included the Capitol Theatre, a performance space for MMU theatre and acting students. It was also the location of the Manchester Philosophy Society offices, the Green Room Refectory, and an open-air walk-through art gallery. The building was opened by Manchester City Council in 1973 as a purpose-built adult education college. After the college closed in 1991, MMU (then Manchester Polytechnic) took over the building and renamed it in Dame Tylecote's honour. The unusual design, featuring windows only on the upper floors, derives from the City Council's long-term plan during the 1970s to connect all the education buildings along Oxford Road with a first-floor level pedestrian walkway. This would have linked the Manchester University Precinct Centre, Manchester Business School, Royal Northern College of Music, Mabel Tylecote Building and MMU's All Saints Building at the first floor. However, only the sections between MBS, the Precinct Centre and RNCM were ever completed. The building was demolished in 2017. Personal papers Her personal papers are located at the John Rylands Library, Manchester. They relate to her career in the Labour Party, Manchester local politics, and adult education. The collection comprises: general correspondence, both personal and official; letters of congratulation and condolence; files relating to particular topics such as adult education, by-elections and general elections, her career in Manchester politics and Mechanics' Institutes; Phythian family correspondence; letters to Lucile Keck of Chicago, from Tylecote and others; Sidebottom family correspondence, including earlier letters from A. J. Balfour (1888, 1893), John Bright (1848, 1864) and Richard Cobden (1864); personal diaries; and photograph albums.

The game is rated for all-ages, and contains themes which revolve around romance and relationships. The game was later published and released in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Mainland China by T-Time Technology. Symphonic Rain was released twice more in Japan, first on June 24, 2005 as a collector's edition, and again on November 22, 2007 as a popular edition at a reduced price. Gameplay Similar to other visual novels, Symphonic Rain is highly text-based and most of the game requires little player interaction apart from clicking a few options presented to the player, usually dealing with where he wishes to head to after school. At certain points during the course of the story, the game switches into a \\"song-playing mode\\" where the player is required to hit keys to the beat of a background music track, usually sung by one of the heroines of the game, guided by different-colored musical notes scrolling from the right of the screen to the left. Each one of the notes are inscribed with a letter on the keyboard, which the player has to press when the note reaches a boxed-up region beside the treble clef. Points are awarded for the accuracy of keyboard input, starting with zero points for an inaccurate attempt, eight points for being slightly off, and thirty-five points for being exact. The value of each exact attempt increases as the player successfully creates chains of such accuracy, breaking the chain when an error is made or becomes slightly off. Exact attempts also raise the evaluation meter at the bottom left corner of the screen by a single point each (marked by a small ring, which lights up with every point earned). When ten of these rings are lit, a large circular lamp directly above lights up while the rings revert to their darkened state. Similarly, an inaccurate attempt will darken a ring or a lamp should there be no lit rings. A minimum of four lit lamps are required for the song to be evaluated as a \\"pass\\", and this directly affects the story in a usually positive way. Players who are not proficient with this \\"song-playing mode\\" can switch on the autoplay function in the menu to enable the computer to hit all the notes. However, in this mode, the score will remain at zero. There are a total of six good endings and three bad endings. The player would have to complete the three main heroine's story (also known as the Da Capo scenario) before the Al Fine scenario is made available. In Al Fine, the world is shown through the perspective of Tortinita Fine, and many questions about the story are finally answered by the end of the scenario. Chris, the original protagonist, is voiced in this scenario while Tortinita is not. Da capo and al fine are actual music terms and are both appropriate names for the story's parts in relation to the game's nature, as the story has to be repeated three times (one for each heroine) before ending with Al Fine's part of the story. After going through both the possible endings for Al Fine, players who return to Da Capo will make available Phorni's scenario (the \\"true end\\" of the game). The events that make up this scenario highlight the truth about Phorni and finally tie up all the loose ends of the story. Plot Symphonic Rain takes place in a fictional city of Italian heritage named Piova where rain falls everyday. The locals there have adapted to this peculiar phenomenon, and carry on with their lives as if the rain were never there. No one uses umbrellas, or rain coats. The main character of the story is seventeen-year-old Chris, a Fortelle student of the famous Piova Communal School of Music (Scuola Comunale di Musica Piova, in Italian). Separated from his childhood sweetheart Arietta when he left his home town for the city, he keeps in touch with her through weekly letters. Penning their thoughts on these letters, Chris treasures and keeps her weekly writings, for he had promised her that should his drawer become totally filled with them, he would return to her. The story begins during Chris's third year as a student, a few months before he has to take the school's final graduation examination: a stage performance. As an instrumentalist, he is required to search for a vocalist partner before he is eligible for the examination. Characters=Main characters= ; : (in Al Fine only) :The main protagonist of the game, whom you play as. A seventeen- year-old who came to the town with his childhood friend Tortinita to attend the music school. He is a third-year student of the keyboard-like instrument Fortelle, and dreams to become an accomplished musician. Apart from Tortinita and Asino, he virtually has no other friends at the school. A laid-back person, he is very talented at music. ; : :A seventeen-year-old childhood friend of Chris who is likewise attending the music school, and arguably the leading female of the cast. The younger twin of Arietta, she is an active girl with a strong personality. Tortinita is a third year vocalist student of the school, and as such has the option of being able to give a solo performance for her graduation performance. Her nickname is Toruta. She has liked Chris ever since they were young, but since Chris chose Arietta, she decided to hide her feelings even though she started liking Chris before her sister did. They eat lunch together in the school cafeteria almost everyday. ; : :The elder twin sister of Tortinita. She stayed in her hometown while her sister and Chris went to attend the music school, seemingly because she lacked the ability and talent. A quiet girl who's good at cooking and domestic work, she is introduced at the beginning as Chris' girlfriend, and they communicate every week by sending letters to each other. Her nickname is Arie. ; : :The former president of the student's council, Falsita is a talented third year vocalist student who's searching for a Fortelle-playing partner for her graduation concert at the end of the year. She appears to be a gentle and graceful girl, but is known to be highly calculative and demanding, and is popular with the students of the school. She often does favors for people (such as writing a speech for the teacher), and works part-time at a restaurant, making her very busy. Her nickname is Fal. ; : :A fifteen-year-old Fortelle student who loves to sing. She is the daughter of the famous Fortelle player Grave Cesarini and hence is constantly pressured by her father to follow in his footsteps. She is a shy girl who hides in the abandoned school building to practice her singing in secret, away from her father's notice. Her nickname is Lise. ; : :A small, fairy-like creature no taller than 14 cm and possessing tiny, translucent, fluttering wings. But, even though she is so small, she can sing and speak at a normal person's volume. Despite having wings, she cannot rise above a certain height. Phorni is the self-declared, 'fairy of music' who shares the room with Chris ever since he moved in. Apart from Chris, no one is able to hear her, see her, or touch her. She enjoys singing (which she is very good at), and would pester Chris into playing the Fortelle so that she can sing along. She has a habit of saying \\"miyah\\" when she is surprised. =Supporting characters= ; : :Chris' best and only male friend, he supports Chris from the side and seems to be very popular with girls. He had originally planned to partner with Falsita, but it is later revealed that she was only using him to obtain information about Chris and dumped him soon after. ; : :Cordell is a strict but impartial teacher of great repute in the school. She is liked by many of the students there. ; : :A nobleman who is both Liselsia's father and a famous Fortelle player. He looks at his daughter's efforts in singing with great disdain and frustration, and this has resulted in him employing rather drastic means to force his daughter to follow in his footsteps. ; : :The grandmother of the Fine twins, she chose to live in the city because of her love for music. She lives together with Tortinita and gives much moral support to her. She is quite fond of Chris. Although nearly blind, she is very good at cooking.

Located in the un air-conditioned Adobe House, which at the time served as a community center, the library was originally open for only two hours, two mornings a week, and its collection consisted of 300 donated books. In 1959 the Friends of the Library, a non-profit, community organization made up entirely of volunteers, was organized to support and fund-raise for the library. In 1960 the City of Scottsdale assumed responsibility for the library and hired the first professionally trained librarian. Later, the City hired additional paid staff to keep up with the demands of the community and, in 1968, opened a new main library. Much has changed since the library‚Äôs conception in 1955: four branches have been added, buildings and services have been renovated and expanded, staff and volunteers have come and gone, and technology has been upgraded with the times. The days of card catalogs may be over, but the library still plays a vital role in the lives and education of Scottsdale residents. Branches The Scottsdale Public Library system has five locations: a main library and four branches -- Mustang, Palomino, Arabian, and Appaloosa -- which, in keeping with the city's western culture, were named after horse breeds. Civic Center and Mustang Libraries are among 300 libraries in 23 states that have received the designation of Family Place Libraries‚Ñ¢ for their welcoming, child friendly environments. Family Place believes good health, early learning, parental involvement and supportive communities contribute to the growth and development of children. Designated libraries offer a five-week parent/child workshop, appropriate collections and space, as well as staff trained in family support. *Civic Center, the main library, is located in the Civic Center plaza in downtown Scottsdale. It is home to the Scottsdale Room which contains numerous books, maps, photographs, and pieces of artwork that focus on Scottsdale, Arizona and the surrounding area. *Mustang library, opened in 1987, is the first and the largest of the Scottsdale branches. At the time of its opening, it was the largest branch library in the state. *Palomino library, opened in 1995, is a shared-use facility located on the campus of Desert Mountain High School and serves both the public and the school‚Äôs students and staff. *Arabian library opened in 1996 as a shared-use facility located on the campus of Desert Canyon Elementary and Middle Schools. In 2007 the Arabian library separated itself from the schools and re-opened in a new building across the street from its original location. For its unique design, this library won the 2008 International Interior Design Association/Metropolis Smart Environments Award.Arabian Library *Appaloosa library opened on November 4, 2009 on the grounds previously occupied by the Rawhide Wild West Town.http://library.ci.scottsdale.az.us/main/appaloosa_facts.cfm It is a LEED Gold Certified building and winner of multiple architecture awards.http://libraryarchitecture.wikispaces.com/Appaloosa+Public+Library%2C+Scottsdale%2C+Arizona+%28building%29 File:Civic Center Library entrance, Old Town Scottsdale AZ.JPG  Civic Center Library File:Mustang Library front entrance Scottsdale AZ.jpg  Mustang Library File:Palomino Library in Scottsdale AZ.JPG  Palomino Library Image:Arabian Library - Entry - 2008-08-01.JPG  Arabian Library Image:Appaloosa Library - Entry - 2009-10-18.JPG  Appaloosa Library ReferencesExternal links *The Scottsdale Public Library Web site Category:Public libraries in Arizona Category:Buildings and structures in Scottsdale, Arizona Category:Education in Scottsdale, Arizona Category:Tourist attractions in Scottsdale, Arizona ","title":"Scottsdale Public Library"},{"id":"10331356","text":"Mandritsara is a city and commune (commune urbain, ) in northern Madagascar.

The Association for Promoting the Discovery of the Interior Parts of Africa (commonly known as the African Association), founded in London on 9 June 1788,Geo. Cawthorn, The Modern Traveller Vol. II, Travels of Ledyard, Lucas, and Sonnini, London: British Library, 1800. was a British club dedicated to the exploration of West Africa, with the mission of discovering the origin and course of the Niger River and the location of Timbuktu, the \\"lost city\\" of gold. The formation of this group was effectively the \\"beginning of the age of African exploration\\".Frank T. Kryza, The Race for Timbuktu: In Search of Africa‚Äôs City of Gold, New York: HarperCollins, 2006, p. 11. Organized by a dozen titled members of London's upper-class establishment and led by Sir Joseph Banks, the African Association felt that it was the great failing of the Age of Enlightenment that, in a time when men could sail around the world, the geography of the Dark Continent remained almost entirely uncharted. The Ancient Greeks and Romans knew more about the interior of Africa than did the British of the 18th century.Kryza p. 12. Motivated by sincere desires for scientific knowledge and the abolition of the slave trade, yet not averse to gaining opportunities for British commerce, the wealthy members each pledged to contribute five guineas per year to recruiting and funding expeditions from England to Africa.  Background and incentives  The Mali Empire, from the 13th to 15th centuries, dominated the region which stretched from the West African coast between the Gambia and Senegal rivers almost to Sokoto in the east, and from north of Timbuktu to the headwaters of the Niger.Peter Brent, Black Nile: Mungo Park and the Search for the Niger, London: Gordon & Cremonesi, 1977, p. 45. From Timbuktu flowed exports of gold and slaves in such quantities that the city took on the reputation in the outside world of possessing endless wealth. To Europeans fascinated by the discovery of new worlds, Timbuktu was too great a temptation to resist. The Scotsman James Bruce had ventured to Ethiopia in 1769 and reached the source of the Blue Nile. His account of his travels provoked enthusiasm for further exploration into Africa by Europeans, and the men of the African Association were especially inspired in their own goals.Brent, p. 26. The location and course of the Niger River were almost completely unknown by Europeans in the 18th century, and most of their maps charting it were mere guesses.Davidson Nicol, \\"Mungo Park and the River Niger\\", African Affairs 55, no. 218, January 1956, p. 47. According to Davidson Nicol, Almost all the European theories of the river's course hypothesized that it flowed east to west, which contradicted reality. Up to this point, no white man had ever seen the river itself. In fact, many Europeans were not even convinced of its existence, though it had been well-known and well-traveled by Muslims for hundreds of years.Brent p. 46. The Niger had long been the major highway of commerce between the kingdoms of Africa's interior and traders from as far away as Iraq, and offered significant trade opportunities for Europe. According to Peter Brent's Black Nile,  The explorers and expeditions =John Ledyard= The first explorer recruited for travel to Africa was an American named John Ledyard. He had traveled around the world with Captain Cook and been acquainted with Thomas Jefferson before attempting a voyage across Russia, Siberia, and North America. Having failed to complete his journey, he called on Sir Joseph and the African Association, who thought him a perfect fit for their enterprise.Kryza pp. 12-13. After setting sail from England on 30 June 1788 he arrived in August at Cairo. While preparing for his westward journey inland in search of the Niger, however, he fell ill and, trying to relieve his \\"bilious complaint\\", inadvertently poisoned himself with a fatal dose of sulphuric acid.Kryza p. 16. =Simon Lucas= While Ledyard was still traveling, the African Association had enlisted Simon Lucas to attempt a mission from the northern end of the continent, starting at Tripoli. He spoke fluent Arabic and, having spent time in Morocco, was already friendly with the Tripolitanian ambassador. After arriving in Tripoli in October 1788, Lucas found guides to take him across the Libyan Desert but their journey was continually delayed by tribal wars blocking the route. Soon his guides abandoned him, and he was forced to limp back to England. He had, however, acquired some valuable information about the southern Libyan region.Kryza p. 17. Henry Beaufoy, the Association's recordkeeper, wrote down in the Proceedings of 1790 what little information had been gleaned from these two ill-fated journeys: that the Niger was reputed to be practically non- navigable, and what was known about Bornu and the edges of the Sahara.Brent p. 28. The club's curiosity had been further stimulated and they quickly renewed their search for explorers. =Daniel Houghton= In autumn of 1790, an Irish major named Daniel Houghton was commissioned to proceed from the mouth of the river Gambia on Africa's western coast, moving inland towards (hopefully) the Niger. He penetrated farther into Africa than any European before him.Kryza p. 18. From the highest navigable point on the Gambia he continued on foot northeast toward Bundu, where the local authorities delayed his passage. Houghton eventually made his way as far as the north Saharan village of Simbing, north of the Niger and short of Timbuktu, but in September 1791, he was lured into the desert, robbed, and killed. In May 1792 the African Association decided to capitalize on their discoveries and enlisted the support of the British government. They authorized their committee to make \\"whatever application to Government they may think advisable for rendering the late discoveries of Major Houghton effectually serviceable to the Commercial Interests of the Empire.\\" Brent p. 32. A British presence on the Gambia would \\"strengthen the bonds of trade\\", so they proposed to install James Willis as consul in Senegambia. He was to develop good relations with the king of Bambouk by a gift of muskets, thereby opening up communication between the Niger and the Gambia and make inroads for trade with all the \\"gold-rich lands of the interior which undoubtedly lined the Niger‚Äôs banks\\".Brent p. 33. =Mungo Park= Mungo Park, a Scottish country doctor, was to travel with Willis to Senegambia, but when Willis‚Äô departure was held up by bureaucratic and logistical problems,Brent p. 34. Park left England on the trade ship Endeavour and arrived on the Africa coast on June 4, 1795.Kryza p. 19. Park followed Houghton's route along the Gambia, and after surviving near-fatal encounters in Muslim territory he reached the land of the friendly Bambara people, who helped guide him to the Niger. The doctor was the first European to lay eyes on the Niger and the first to record that it did in fact flow inland to the east. He vowed to follow the river until it led him to Timbuktu, but the intense heat and besetting of thieves stopped him, and he had to return to England. Upon his return he was an instant national hero, and membership in the African Association swelled dramatically.Kryza pp. 19-20. Mungo Park's travels and discoveries had the greatest impact upon Western knowledge of the African continent to that point. Frank T. Kryza (The Race for Timbuktu, 2006), writes: Park's expedition lasted two and a half years, and he published the account of the mission in his book, Travels into the Interior Districts of Africa (1799), which was devoured by readers across Europe. Park would take attempt a second expedition to find Timbuktu in 1805, but died before returning.Kryza pp. 40-42. The Niger had been found and its direction recorded, but its final termination had not been discovered. The \\"golden city\\" itself, was discovered by Park, but he died before he was able to share his discovery with the world and so it remained ‚Äòundiscovered‚Äô. =Friedrich Hornemann= During Park's first journey, Banks had recruited Friedrich Hornemann to make another trip to Africa. He left in summer of 1797 and planned to travel the Cairo path across the Sahara toward Timbuktu while disguised as a Muslim. After finally joining a caravan from Cairo in 1800, he was never heard from again. Nearly 20 years later other explorers learned that Hornemann had died of dysentery after apparently reaching the Niger.Kryza pp. 44-50. =Johann Ludwig Burckhardt= Refusing to give up their quest, the African Association sent out a Swiss explorer, Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in 1809, tasking him to follow the same route from Cairo. Under orders to maintain a Muslim appearance, Burckhardt spent eight years traveling in Syria, learning the language and customs while waiting for a caravan to form. Just as some Arab merchants were ready to depart for the interior in 1817, the perfectly disguised \\"Euro-Muslim\\" died of dysentery before leaving Cairo.Kryza p. 45. =Henry Nicholls= The most bizarre story of the African Association was that of Henry Nicholls in 1804. Kryza writes, \\"Having failed in assaults from the north (Tripoli), the east (Cairo), and the west (Gambia), the membership now proposed that an effort be made from the south. The site chosen from which to strike inland was a British trading post in the Gulf of Guinea\\".Kryza p. 46. In the cruelest of ironies, the river mouth that emptied into the Gulf, from whence Nicholls was to set out in search of the Niger, was precisely the end of the Niger itself‚Äîonly the Europeans did not know it yet. The starting point of the expedition was in fact its destination. By 1805 Nicholls had died, probably of malaria. Meanwhile, England was preoccupied with its rivalry with France, and the government decided to take on a larger role in Africa's exploration in order to establish a commercial dominance there before the French. Sir Joseph Banks was growing ill, and slowly the African Association's influence began to diminish. \\"The torch was passed from the private to the public sector,\\" though the Association continued its involvement in British exploration until it was absorbed by the Royal Geographical Society in 1831.  The Influence  No explorer sent expressly by the African Association ever did find Timbuktu, though it was a major in the Royal African Corps named Alexander Gordon Laing who finally walked through its gates in 1826.Kryza p. 229. The findings of the Association's recruits, however, accomplished much for European knowledge of Africa and its people. Peter Brent describes the common perception of Africa in the years preceding the African Association: In contrast, according to Brent, \\"the explorers themselves had no such view of Africans, no simple picture that rejected African reality and denied to Africans their full humanity.\\" Mungo Park's description in particular contributed to a balanced perspective. George Shepperson writes that, beyond Park's romanticized travel exploits, \\"his writing indicated that Africans were human beings with their own cultures and commerce (and not monstrous creatures), with whom constructive relations would be possible.\\"George Shepperson, \\"Mungo Park and the Scottish Contribution to Africa\\", African Affairs 70, no. 280, July 1971, p. 278. This \\"humanizing\\" of the African people in the minds of Europeans was no doubt a boon to the abolition of the slave trade, since many of the African Association's members were abolitionists and had ties to William Wilberforce. \\"By the beginning of the 19th century,\\" Brent wrote, \\"the attack on the whole appalling business had sharpened, and Africa had become the subject of the day. And still, despite everything, the European ignorance about most of the continent‚Äôs interior remained almost unaltered. It was a situation that had to be put right.\\"Brent p. 18.

The song also features fake lightning strikes during the transitions between the band's performance and the streets, and baseball bats striking melons in the air.

Plot Julie, a grief-stricken woman, announces she is leaving the city and buys a random train ticket. She bids farewell to her family and friends but gets off at the next station. She takes a room under an assumed name and erases all trace of her identity. Over the next two years, she appears in the lives of various men and kills them. Bliss, a well- off ladies' man, is celebrating his engagement as she crashes the party. Corey, another guest, tries to romance her, but she deflects his interest, and lures Bliss onto the balcony; when they are alone, she pushes him off and calmly leaves before anyone discovers what happened. Mitchell, a lonely romantic living in a squalid residential hotel, is drawn out by her mysterious charm and poisoned. Moran, a married businessman with a young son, is left alone with his child when his wife is decoyed out of town by a false telegram; Julie then shows up claiming to be the boy's kindergarten teacher and there to help the family, and then tricks Moran into going into a small closet which she then locks and blocks the cracks with putty, so he suffocates. She models for Ferguson, an artist, who is fascinated by her and has her pose as the goddess Diana. Corey, who had met her at Bliss' party, is a friend of Ferguson as well, and vaguely remembers her. He takes her to his apartment in an attempt to seduce her, but she finds his gun, and holding him at gunpoint, warns him to stay away from her. She departs, leaving the gun behind. Corey racks his brain and finally remembers where he met her, and realizes she is a murderess. He tries to call Ferguson to warn him, but she has already killed him with an arrow. Wanger, a police detective, has been following her crimes. Fascinated by the different method each time, her constantly changing appearance, and how she refuses to allow any innocent parties (especially women) take the blame for her crimes, he is determined to catch her. He and Corey eventually piece together that Bliss, Moran, and Ferguson had been members of an informal card club, the \\"Friday Night Fiends,\\" that met on Fridays in a bar, played cards, and then drove tipsily around the city in a car they owned together. Mitchell was their favorite bartender who joined them on their joyrides. Wanger tracks down the last member the group, Holmes, now a successful novelist. Julie infiltrates Holmes' house, disguised as a middle- aged typist. She attempts to booby-trap Holmes' favorite chair, but when he forces her to sit in it, she panics and reveals the plan. At this point it's revealed that Wanger had warned Holmes and had taken his place for the past few weeks, waiting for her. She reveals her story: that she had just married Nick Killeen, and they were leaving the church together, when the car driven by the Friday Night Fiends drove by, and Nick was shot and killed. She remembered the license plate number and tracked down the occupants from the records. Swearing vengeance, she killed the men she held responsible for Nick's murder. Wanger then reveals the truth: the men she murdered were innocent. The police had known all along that the shot had been fired from a window across the street; there were powder burns on the curtains and a spent casing found, but they kept the information to themselves in order to trap the real killer. The Fiends driving by was just a coincidence. Nick Killeen had been a criminal attempting to go straight for Julie, but he had been killed by his former associate, who feared that Nick could tip off the authorities and also wanted Nick's share of their money. The real killer was Corey, who hadn't known Julie, and whom she had never met. At first she doesn't believe him, but realizes he is right and is horrified, not only that she killed innocent men, but that she'd had a chance to kill the real culprit with the same gun he'd used to kill her husband, but let it slip through her fingers. She allows herself to be led away, defeated and demoralized. Corey has been under arrest for weeks and will be tried; she accepts that she has lost and has to pay for her crimes.

He made valuable contributions towards the establishment of free public education in the state of Texas. Early life Matthew Gaines was born on August 4, 1840 near Alexandria, Louisiana to a female slave owned by the Martin Despallier family. Gaines taught himself to read from a white boy who smuggled in books. This boy may have been young Blaz Philipe Despallier, who lived on the estate and who would later become the sole heir of Alamo hero Charles Despallier, his uncle. After being sold from the Despallier family, Gaines escaped from his new owner in Louisiana to Arkansas, and eventually made it to New Orleans, where he was captured and returned to his master. In 1859, Gaines was sold to Christopher Columbus Hearne, where he remained until 1863 when he tried to flee to Mexico. He was caught again and was forced to work as a runaway slave in Fredericksburg, Texas until the end of the war. Career After the 1863 emancipation was finally officially announced in Texas on June 19, 1865, Gaines settled in Washington County, where he established himself as a leader of the freedmen, both as a Baptist preacher and a politician. In 1869, Gaines was elected as a Senator of Texas's 16th district in the Twelfth Texas Legislature. He gained a reputation for being a guardian of the newly-won rights of the African-Texans. Throughout his term, he addressed the issues of public education, prison reform, the protection of black voters, and tenant farming reformation. Gaines actively supported the forward movement that established the first public school system for all Texans and assisted in allowing Texas to take advantage of the federal Grant College Act, also known as the Morrill Act. In 1870, Gaines played a strategic role in passing the Militia Bill, which created a state police force to combat lawlessness and to protect against voter intimidation. Gaines was elected to a six-year term to the Senate, but only served four years. In a politically-motivated trial he was convicted of bigamy in 1873. Despite the charge being overturned on appeal, his seat was challenged by Seth Shepard and he was removed from office on the grounds of being a convicted felon. In 1875, he was arrested for making a civil rights speech in Giddings. He told his audience that \\"in the eyes of God, blacks are as good as whites; they should have pride and hold their heads up even in troubled times.\\" Gaines continued to be active in politics and made his political views known in conventions, public gatherings, and from his pulpit. Death and legacy Gaines died in Giddings, Texas, on June 11, 1900. In 1998, activists on the campus of Texas A&M; University suggested Gaines should have his statue displayed prominently. The project was abandoned in the wake of the Aggie Bonfire tragedy in 1999. However, 19 years later, Texas A&M; students and other supporters pushed yet again for the establishment of a statue of Matthew Gaines on the Texas A&M; College Station campus. On June 19th of 2020, the donation goal of the ‚ÄúMatthew Gaines Initiative‚Äù was surpassed. , the statue is in the process of being designed and placed on the campus. In 2016, his great-granddaughter Lori Bartley ran unsuccessfully for US Congress against Sheila Jackson Lee. ReferencesExternal links *Sen.

History Battery Chamberlin This Endicott-era battery was built in 1904 with four six-inch rifled guns mounted on disappearing carriages and was intended to protect underwater minefields laid outside the Golden Gate during the time of war. These guns had a maximum range of 7.5 miles, and crews were trained to fire two rounds per minute. The original guns were removed in 1917 for use in World War I. The battery received two six-inch guns on simple barbette carriages in 1920. During World War II, the Sixth Coast Artillery (Harbor Defense) Regiment, Battery \\"D\\", manned the two guns at Battery Chamberlin, living on-site until the end of the war. The battery was covered with camouflage netting to hide it from air attack. These guns were removed in 1948. In 1977, the National Park Service received 6-inch Gun M1905 (#9 Watervliet) on Disappearing Carriage M1903 (#2 Watertown, each listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places, from the Smithsonian Institution. The gun and carriage were installed at gun emplacement No. 4 at Battery Chamberlin and are the similar to those installed in 1904. This is one of about a score of disappearing guns in the world that still operates, moving from loading to firing position. Operation of the gun is open to the public, usually on the first full weekend of each month from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. An underground magazine contains photos and small exhibits on the harbor defenses of San Francisco.

He is most famous for his novel Ode to Lata published in 2002, that was adapted to a film in 2008 under the title The Ode. He has also published the novel The Two Krishnas in 2011, which was released as The Exiles in India. Early life Dhalla's great- grandparents were Ismailis who immigrated to Kenya from India. An only child, he was mostly raised by his mother's parents in Mombasa. He decided that he wanted to be a writer when he was five years old. The same year, his father was murdered, and his mother returned to Mombasa to be with her son.  Career  At 13 years old, the aspiring young novelist published his first article on infertility in a national magazine VIVA. Since then he's written for various publications including Instinct, Genre, Angeleno, Detour and Details and is the Editor of the upscale lifestyle E-zine IndulgeMagazine.com An excerpt from Ode to Lata was featured in the award-winning anthology Contours of the Heart: South Asians Map North America (Rutgers), which went on to win the 18th Annual American Book Award. The Los Angeles Times Book Review hailed Dhalla's debut as \\"an achievement\\" (Sunday, 24 March 2002) and Christopher Rice called it \\"a rare, great novel\\" (book jacket). Ode to Lata created milestones as the first South Asian gay novel ever to be reviewed by The Los Angeles Times and to be excerpted by Genre Magazine. It was also the first account of the South Asian gay experience from an author from the African continent. The cultural and academic impact of Dhalla's debut novel was further recognised when it was presented at the Between The Lines Festival at MIT (Boston) in 2004, and added to college syllabuses around the country like California State University. Ode to Lata was adapted for a motion picture, The Ode starring Sachin Bhatt, Wilson Cruz, and Sakina Jaffrey. Dhalla wrote, co-directed and produced the film. The Ode premiered at the Outfest Film Festival on 17 July 2008 to a sold-out audience. It was called \\"a beautiful portrait of the American experience for many first and second-generation Indian-Americans\\" (CineQueer, 18 July 2008) and a film with performances that are \\"memorable\\" and filled with \\"cinematic intensity\\" (Planet Homo, 19 July 2008). The UCLA Asia Institute praised it as a film that inspired \\"after-film contemplation\\" and boasted performances that are \\"noteworthy\\" (Asia Pacific Arts, 8 August 2008). Dhalla's follow-up novel, The Two Krishnas (Magnus Books, September 2011) draws from romantic Sufi poetry and archetypal Hindu mythology. It paints a picture of infidelity and political upheaval across three continents; exploring how, with a new world come new freedoms, and with them, the choices that could change everything we know about those we thought we knew‚Äîincluding ourselves. Some of Dhalla's influences are Dorothy Parker, Andrew Holleran, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and the poetry of Rumi. In January 2011, Dhalla wrote, directed and produced the film Embrace starring Rebecca Hazlewood, Ajay Mehta and Randy Ryan. Embrace is the first dramatisation of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks on record.  In popular culture  *East Indian in heritage and a passionate activist, Dhalla co-founded the South Asian program for the Asian Pacific AIDS Intervention Team (APAIT) which provides prevention, health and social services, community leadership and advocacy to over 10,000 individuals in Southern California.

It is an original mode of acquisition, since it involves deriving rights over objects that are subject to pre-existing rights of ownership. This may be compared with the original modes of acquisition, and other derivative modes of acquisition, such as accession. Specification occurs where new property rights are established as a result of some action upon existing property that results in a change of species.  Roman law specification  In Roman law, specification referred to the acquisition of a new species arising from a change of species. = When was a nova species created? = A nova species was created when the new thing had a new identity or name. NicholasNicholas, B. (1961). An Introduction to Roman Law, Oxford: Oxford University Press rationalises this rule by reference to the vindicatio which requires the vindicator to name the subject of the vindication. The rights over the old items became extinguished if one could not name the item and have the iudex recognise it in the thing. The tests mentioned by ThomasThomas, JAC. (1976). \\"Textbook of Roman Law\\", Juta Legal and Academic Publishers are: # If a thing belongs in a different commercial category e.g. marble blocks and marble statues # If the materials were still recognisable as what they had been. = Ownership of the nova species = The position in the Institutes of Gaius  In the Institutes of Gaius,De Zulueta, F. (1945). The Institutes of Gaius Gaius refers to a number of examples where this process occurs, and cites two conflicting schools of thought on the question of ownership. # Sabinus/Cassus - the manufactured article should be held to belong to the owner of the material substance. # Proculians - the manufactured article should be held to belong to the creator of the article. Nicholas and Thomas consider the philosophical background of the two doctrines. The Stoic view gave primacy to matter, whilst Aristotle considered that form or essence was what mattered most. Nicholas considers that the Aristotelian 'form' or 'essence' faces the same difficulty of definition as 'identity'. Andrew BorkowskiBorkowski, A. (2005). \\"Textbook on Roman Law\\", Oxford: Oxford University Press considers that the Proculians treated specificatio as a form of occupation. At the moment of its creation, a nova species was regarded as a res nullius open to the first occupier, and for that reason it should be held to belong to the creator.  The position in the Institutes of Justinian  The Thinker (bronze)The solution in Justinian's Institutes was a compromise measure, known as the media sententia (or middle way). The owner of the raw materials or substance would own the nova species where the nova species could be reduced to its former component parts or raw materials without excessive difficulty or expense. If the nova species was irreducible, it was held to belong to the creator. Where the creator contributed any substance, then the maker owned it as he would have contributed both parts and labour. The issue of good faith (bona fides) was irrelevant to ownership, only to compensation. Commentary on the media sententia Nicholas criticises the media sententia as it did not take into account the relative importance of the materials and the maker's skill. Borkowski suggests that the test was not feasible if there was nothing left of the original material, e.g. if the creator chipped away at bronze to make a statue. The French and German civil codes take such considerations into account, e.g. the French system gives the nova species to the owner of the substance unless the work exceeds the materials, and the Germans reverse this balance. In both cases, compensation must be made to the party who loses out. The classic example of the reducibility test failing is where there is a bronze statue and a marble statue. Moses (marble)  Compensation  According to both Nicholas and Thomas, the general principles were the same as those for accessio. In relation to the material owner, possession would grant the exceptio doli mali till the costs of materials were paid, whilst theft would grant an action of theft and a condictio furtiva. In relation to the creator who does not own through specificatio, possession would grant an exceptio to the vindicatio.

It was directed by Adrian Shergold and the screenplay was written by Simon Burke. Sally Hawkins stars as the protagonist Anne Elliot, while Rupert Penry-Jones plays Frederick Wentworth. Eight years prior to the film's beginning, Anne was persuaded to reject Wentworth's proposal of marriage. Now 27 and unmarried, Anne re-encounters Wentworth, who has made his fortune in the Napoleonic Wars and is looking for a wife--anyone but Anne, whom he has not forgiven for rejecting him all those years ago. Persuasion was one of three novels adapted in 2007 for ITV's Jane Austen season. It was the first of the three adaptations to begin development. The drama was co-produced by Clerkenwell Films and American studio WGBH Boston. Persuasion premiered on 1 April 2007 in the United Kingdom and was watched by 5.4 million viewers. Persuasion received positive reviews from television critics. Plot The Cobb harbour wall at Lyme The Elliot family faces financial difficulties from the imprudent spending of Sir Walter Elliot and his eldest daughter, Elizabeth. An advisor proposes the family estate of Kellynch Hall be leased to Admiral Croft, home from the Napoleonic Wars; Anne Elliot is distraught at the prospect. The admiral is married to the sister of Captain Frederick Wentworth, to whom Anne was engaged eight years earlier. Then-Commander Wentworth was penniless and without a ship at the outset of a very dangerous career, and the union was discouraged by Anne‚Äôs father and Lady Russell, a family friend who persuaded Anne to break off the engagement. Years later, Anne is seemingly past the age of desirability, while Wentworth has risen in the Royal Navy and is rich in prize money. Sir Walter and Elizabeth depart for Bath, leaving Anne to care for her younger sister Mary Musgrove in nearby Uppercross. There, Wentworth comes to visit his sister at Kellynch Hall, making friends with the Musgroves. Anne and Wentworth meet again, but he appears cold and distant and she is convinced he will never forgive her, nor love her again. Her disappointment is heightened by the attention the captain is paid by young Louisa and Henrietta Musgrove. Wentworth declares his intention to travel to Lyme to visit his friends, Captains Harry Harville and James Benwick, and they all decide to go. In Lyme, Benwick has been inconsolable since the death of his fianc√©e while he was away at the Cape, and spends his days reading dark poetry and lamenting his loss. A match for him in reading and familiar with loss and disappointment, Anne is able to encourage Benwick; though he warms in his outlook toward life and to Anne, her heart remains with Captain Wentworth. In a dangerous demonstration of steadfastness, Louisa jumps from the Cobb and strikes her head against the stones. Unconscious and bleeding, she is taken to Harville's home to recover. Wentworth, Anne, and Henrietta return to Uppercross to inform the Musgroves of Louisa's injury, and Anne and the captain bid each other a seemingly final farewell. Anne joins her father and sister in Bath to find her family have been receiving the attentions of Mr. Elliot, a distant cousin who will inherit the Elliot estate and title. He is wealthy and very gracious to the Elliots, and Anne finds herself the subject of his interest, but detects a false note in his manner. Hawkins in Bath during location shooting, 2006 While Louisa recovers, Wentworth realises his feelings towards Anne are unchanged, but Harville informs him that an attachment is assumed between Wentworth and Louisa. Dismayed, Wentworth takes Harville's advice to leave and visit his brother. Returning a few weeks later, he learns that Louisa and Benwick are engaged. Delighted at this turn of events, Wentworth goes to Bath under the pretext of visiting his sister. There, Captain Wentworth learns Mr. Elliot has been courting Anne. Having heard rumour of Mr. Elliot's proposal, Admiral Croft sends Wentworth to notify Anne that if she and her new husband desire to reside at Kellynch Hall, he would be happy to forego the lease. To Wentworth‚Äôs surprise, Anne tells him the Admiral is mistaken, as she has not consented to marry Mr. Elliot. They are interrupted by the arrival of Lady Russell and, in the confusion of new arrivals, are unable to speak. Wentworth slips away and writes Anne a note, confessing his long held love and his desire to marry her. Anne gets free and runs after the captain, but cannot find him. She meets her good friend Mrs. Smith, who informs her Mr. Elliot has been false: he desires the baronetcy and, once married to Anne, planned to establish Mrs. Clay as his mistress. This would prevent Mrs. Clay's marriage to Anne's father and the potential birth of a male heir which would cut off Mr. Elliot's inheritance. Anne comes across Captain Harvill, who passes her Wentworth's note. Running along the Royal Crescent, Anne finally finds Wentworth, and accepts his proposal. Wentworth asks if she is sure, and Anne replies that she has never been more determined in her life, and kisses him.

Elliot commented that the adaptations would be \\"important remakes for the new generation\\". He explained \\"About every 10 years, all the great stories need retelling. These films will be very much 2007 films... we've asked and pushed the production team to make them young.\\" Screenwriter Simon Burke created the convention of a diary to aide the audience in understanding the intense feelings of loss the outwardly reserved Anne Elliot was going through. Using small parts of Austen's narration, he placed it in the hand of Anne. After much reading and research, Hawkins came to view the character of Anne Elliot as a view of Jane Austen herself. With Hawkins over-voicing the diary entries the person of Jane Austen is brought to life. This, coupled with Director Adrian Shergold having Anne occasionally break the Fourth wall lent a sense of intimacy between the audience and the lead character, and with Jane Austen. Galer made Anne's outfits simple and basic because she does not join in Bath society. Elliott revealed that he had deliberately shied away from ordering adaptations of Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility to focus on Austen's lesser known works. Each of the three productions created during the Jane Austen Season were made by a different company, cast and director, so they each had \\"a distinct look\\". =Casting= Rupert Penry-Jones and Sally Hawkins during filming Karen Price from the Western Mail reported ITV had promised the \\"cream of British acting talent\\", while they were casting the three adaptations. Actress Sally Hawkins was asked to play Persuasion's protagonist Anne Elliot. Hawkins was familiar with Austen from school, and though flattered to be asked to play the role, she was initially hesitant about returning to Austen. \\"I re-read the books and fell in love with Jane Austen completely... I had been slightly dismissive, and the fact that I was dismissive is shameful to me now. It's like being dismissive of Dickens or Beckett. Her work had never really come into my world before and I'm so glad it has.\\" Having re-read all of Austen's works, she researched deeper, reading the author's personal letters and biographies. Speaking to The Independent's Amy Raphael, Hawkins explained \\"Jane was an incredible woman. She was only in her early forties when she died. I became convinced that Persuasion was about her own love life; Anne Elliot took the wrong advice and left the man who turned out to be the love of her life. She is the type of woman you'd like to be: reserved, refined, funny. I totally fell in love with her.\\" On 17 September 2006, the Western Mail's Nathan Bevan revealed that Spooks actor Rupert Penry-Jones had joined the cast as Captain Wentworth. The role was Penry-Jones' first lead part in a costume drama. He remarked, \\"In modern drama everything is so overt. In period drama it's all held in. You have to find ways to show the feelings straining beneath the surface.\\" The actor added that he enjoyed playing Wentworth \\"because, beyond his social grace and charm, there's a bitterness and sadness because the love of his life, Anne Elliot, rejected him.\\" Five days later, it was announced that Julia Davis and Anthony Head would be appearing as Elizabeth Elliot and Sir Walter Elliot respectively. =Costumes= The costume designer for Persuasion was Andrea Galer. Galer made Anne's outfits simple and basic because she does not join in Bath society. The designer explained \\"I wanted her to look in tune with nature. Because we were shooting in winter, I could go for faded autumnal colours for her. She gets Wentworth back just by her stillness and I wanted to reflect that in her wardrobe.\\" Galer designed a jacket for Hawkins to wear as Anne using a 19th-century shawl, which she mounted and patched together with a cross stitch. She used hand loom fabric from India and the Sri Lanakan crafted Beeralu lace to decorate some of the garments. In 2008, costumes from Persuasion went on display at the Jane Austen Centre in Bath. The exhibition included creations worn by Anne, Lady Russell and the Musgrove sisters. Four years later, many of the costumes from Persuasion and Miss Austen Regrets were sold in an online auction organised by the Jane Austen Centre. Galer admitted that while it was difficult to part with them, it was time to move on and she hoped they had been bought because of their association with the Austen films. Galer commented \\"It was difficult to do but I did it. I suppose the one outfit that did sell that I would've been happy if it hadn't was the Harris tweed jacket and dress worn by Sally Hawkins when she played Anne Elliot in Persuasion.\\" =Filming= Persuasion was the first of the three adaptations to begin development. For director, ITV hired Adrian Shergold, known for working on \\"gritty\\" films such as Pierrepoint (2005). Producer David Snodin explained, \\"Bringing Adrian on board is a statement in itself because he is not known for doing conventional versions of the classics. It is a lot to do with the way he likes the camera to move ‚Äì it's right in on people's faces ‚Äì and he is creating something much more contemporary than you'd expect.\\" Shergold agreed to direct Persuasion only after learning Hawkins' was playing Anne Elliot. He said, \\"She inhabits every inch of the characters she plays.\\" The film was scored by Martin Phipps. Promotion and broadcast ITV launched a nationwide campaign to promote its Jane Austen Season. The campaign included three television adverts and cinema, outdoor and press adverts. ITV Creative made the 20, 30 and 60 second promotional trailers, which began airing on ITV channels from 25 February 2007. The following day, adverts began appearing in selected national press publications. The outdoor and press adverts were created by M&C; Saatchi, while MindShare carried out the media buying. Persuasion was the third of the Austen adaptations to be shown in the UK. It was broadcast on ITV at 9:00 pm on 1 April 2007. The drama aired on the TVOntario channel in Canada on 30 December 2007. Persuasion was shown on 13 January 2008 on the US channel PBS as part of their Austen Masterpiece Theatre series. On 8 June, the film was broadcast on Australia's ABC1 channel. Reception The Royal Crescent, where Anne accepts the proposal of Captain Wentworth Persuasion was well received by audiences, attracting 6.2 million viewers and a 26.1% audience share upon its initial broadcast in the United Kingdom. 939,000 Australian viewers watched the drama when it aired on ABC1 in June 2008. Four newspaper publications selected the drama as their \\"Pick of the Day.\\" The period drama has an 80% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Critics compared the production with previous renditions of Persuasion and with other productions of well known Austen works. The Daily Post chose Persuasion as \\"the best of the three offerings in this series.\\" However, Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe opined that the adaptation \\"pale[d] in comparison with the extraordinary 1995 version.\\" David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle expressed strong dissatisfaction with the adaptation, especially when compared to the 1995 Pride and Prejudice series and the 1996 production of Emma. The performance by Hawkins was well received by most. Variety noted Persuasion \\"offers an appealing heroine, with Hawkins proving especially vulnerable as the passive Anne, who again risks letting a lifetime of happiness slip away from her.\\" Conversely, the Irish Independents John Boland called Hawkins the \\"crucial flaw\\" of the production. Boland continued, \\"She looked suitably guarded and gauche at the outset but then chose, and was allowed, to become increasingly gormless, so that long before the end you were left wondering what on earth Captain Wentworth had ever seen in this open- mouthed, inarticulate eejit. It was the worst piece of miscasting since Tom Cruise was asked to impersonate an icy hit-man in Collateral.\\" The Age thought Penry-Jones too handsome for the role of Captain Wentworth. The Independent reported that Janeites were \\"horrified by the inappropriate kissing\\" in the adaptation. =Awards and nominations= Persuasion garnered a nomination for Best Drama at the 2007 Prix Italia. For her portrayal of Anne Elliot, Hawkins was named Best Actress at the Royal Television Society Awards and she won the Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Film award at the Monte-Carlo Television Festival. Davis and Krige also received nominations in the same category, while Head and Penry-Jones were both nominated for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Film. At the 2007 RTS Craft & Design Awards, Kevin Horsewood won the Best Visual Effects ‚Äì Picture Enhancement award. Shergold earned a nomination in the Director of Fiction/Entertainment category at the 2008 British Academy Television Craft Awards.

The manor house was built in the late 15th century, and was originally located in the Irwell Valley at Agecroft, Pendlebury, then in the historic county of Lancashire, England, but by the 20th century it was unoccupied and in a state of disrepair. Mr. Thomas C. Williams, Jr. of Richmond, Virginia, a wealthy entrepreneur, purchased Agecroft Hall upon the advice of his architect, Henry G. Morse. During the Country Place Era, when many wealthy American families were building extensive country estates emulating those they had seen in Europe, Mr. Williams, whose business interests included tobacco, banking and shipping wished to build a true English manor house on his 23-acre estate overlooking the James River. The manor house was dismantled, crated, transported across the Atlantic, and reconstructed in Richmond's Windsor Farms neighborhood \\\\- then a fashionable new neighborhood being developed by Mr. Williams on the Williams' family farm site, which had long been known as 'Windsor.' The architect, Mr. Morse, was retained to oversee the reconstruction. The intention was not to replicate Agecroft as it had stood in Lancashire, but rather to create a functional and comfortable mansion reminiscent of its English predecessor. The original floor plan was abandoned and many 20th century conveniences were included. Reconstruction took two years and cost approximately $250,000, a considerable sum for that time. The project was completed during the spring of 1928. The following year Mr. Williams died, having stipulated in his will that upon his widow's death or relocation, Agecroft Hall would become a house museum.  History The original Agecroft Hall in Pendlebury, Lancashire. The hall was one of three manor houses owned by the Prestwich family from 1292 when Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster, granted land on the banks of the River Irwell in Lancashire to Adam de Prestwich. In 1350, Johanna de Tetlow, daughter of Alice de Prestwich and Jordan de Tetlow, married Richard de Langley of Middleton after the deaths of her parents and brothers ‚Äì possibly from the plague. The name \\"Agecroft\\", meaning \\"field of wild celery\\" (from ache and croft) was adopted circa 1376, the old name of Pendlebury being dropped for the manor but not for the village. Subsequently, the Langleys lived at Agecroft Hall until 1561 when the male line failed.The Story of Agecroft Hall, Home to the Lords of the Manor of Prestwich , Prestwich Guide. URL accessed December 18, 2006. The Langleys were a powerful local family for several centuries with major land holdings across the area. Robert Langley was the last male heir of the Langleys. The first Robert Langley (1379‚Äì1446) was a ward of John of Gaunt and later supported the claim of Gaunt's son as Henry IV in the overthrow of King Richard II. The second Robert Langley (1462‚Äì1547) supported Henry VII and received a lifetime annuity from him. And yet another Robert Langley (1506‚Äì1561) was granted a knighthood by Edward VI and later received a general pardon from Queen Elizabeth. By this time the Langleys were very prosperous and had intermarried with all the great Lancashire families. But Sir Robert and his wife Cecily de Trafford had no son and on his death the property was divided equally between his four daughters. Dorothy, the eldest, married James Assheton from Chadderton. Margaret married John Reddish of Reddish. Catherine married Thomas Legh, a younger son of Sir Piers Legh of Lyme. Anne, his third daughter inherited Agecroft Hall as part of her portion and subsequently married William Dauntesey. Richard Langley's brother, William (1315-1386) was Rector of Middleton. Another brother, was the grandfather of Bishop Thomas Langley who entered the service of John of Gaunt and became Lord Chancellor of England, Keeper of the Privy Seal and Bishop of Durham. He was also elected a Cardinal, but refused the appointment. Bishop Thomas paid for the rebuilding of St Leonard's Church, Middleton, which was reconsecrated in 1412. In the 1662 Hearth Tax returns, Agecroft Hall was recorded as having 11 hearths out of a total of 35 in the whole of Pendlebury. At the end of the 19th century, industrialisation swept through the Irwell Valley. Coal pits were opened all around Agecroft Hall, railway tracks were cut across the manor and mining subsidence above the Clifton Hall Colliery made a dirty lake on the edge of the estate. The house fell into disrepair and was sold at auction in 1925 to Mr & Mrs Thomas C. Williams. Today, Agecroft Hall stands re-created on the banks of the James River, in a setting chosen to be reminiscent of its original site at Agecroft near the River Irwell. Agecroft's grounds reflect English gardens with Elizabethan aromatics and were designed by Charles Gillette.  Babes in the Wood  The gatehouse, or lodge, is all that remains of the Agecroft Estate in the UK Cyril Bracegidle in his book Dark River: Irwell asserts that legend has it that the tale of the Babes in the Wood was inspired by an incident at the hall during the reign of Edward III. On the morning of the Feast of the Ascension (the 40th Day after Easter Sunday) in 1374, young Roger Langley and his sister escaped from the villainous Robert de Holland and his men and hid in the forest which covered the slopes of the Irwell Valley, cared for by loyal retainers, until their guardian, John of Gaunt, the first Duke of Lancaster, rescued them. However, other sources attribute the story to an incident in Wayland Wood, Norfolk.

(Ed.) (2006) British film posters: An illustrated history. London: British Film Institute, p. 132. The film was banned in the U.K. until 2001 for its graphic violence and considered a \\"video nasty\\". Plot Susan Stevenson (Ursula Andress) is trying to find her missing anthropologist husband, Henry (Tom Felleghy), in the jungles of New Guinea. She and her brother, Arthur (Antonio Marsina), enlist the services of Professor Edward Foster (Stacy Keach), who thinks her husband might have headed for the mountain Ra Ra Me, which is located just off the coast on the island of Roka. The locals believe that the mountain is cursed, and the authorities will not allow expeditions there, so the searchers surreptitiously enter the jungle to commence the search. They eventually make it to the island, and after a few run-ins with some unfriendly anacondas, alligators and tarantulas, they meet another jungle explorer named Manolo (Claudio Cassinelli) who has been staying at a nearby mission camp, who agrees to join them in their expedition. Matters become complicated when it becomes evident that all of them have their own private reasons for coming to the island, none of which include finding Susan's missing husband. Susan and Arthur are secretly looking for uranium deposits, and Foster reveals that he has come there because he had been on the island a few years previously, was taken captive by a tribe of primitive cannibals, and has only returned to wipe them out if they still exist. Foster later dies while climbing up a waterfall. Upon arriving at the mountain, Arthur is killed and Manolo and Susan are captured by the cannibals and taken to their camp. There they find the jungle natives worshiping the skeletal remains of Susan's husband. The natives can hear Henry's Geiger counter ticking and believe it to be his heart still beating. Susan is subsequently spared, and the cannibals feast on other human and reptile flesh. She is stripped naked, bound at the wrists to a pole, and smeared with an orange cream by two native girls. At first, it seems this is to be a session of honey torture, but instead Susan is turned into a living goddess. Manolo is tied up and tortured, while the others are eaten. One of the cannibals attempts to rape Susan while no one is looking, but is caught in the act and castrated as punishment. Manolo and Susan eventually escape, having endured their ordeals.

Critical reception  The Monthly Film Bulletin called it a \\"spiced up dish of left overs\\" plot-wise, but said the location filming gave it \\"authenticity\\". Allmovie gave the film a negative review, writing, \\"a graphic and unpleasant film, with all the noxious trademarks intact: gratuitous violence, real-life atrocities committed against live animals and an uncomfortably imperialist attitude towards underprivileged peoples.\\" Andrew Smith from Popcorn Pictures awarded the film a score of 4/10, writing, \\"Mountain of the Cannibal God merely goes through the usual Italian cannibal exploitation film motions, only this time with the bonus of a famous cast. More professionally made but lacking the raw, nihilistic punch of some of its counterparts, it's neither the best of this sub-genre, nor the worst either.\\" Anya Stanley from Daily Grindhouse called the film 'problematic\\", citing the film's depictions of animal cruelty and \\"imperialist attitudes towards indigenous populations\\". However, Stanley commended the film's occasionally beautiful cinematography, and called it \\"one of the more cohesive cannibal films, that utilizes the flesh feast as more of a flourish than a crutch\\". The film is often compared to H. Rider Haggard's novel The People of the Mist.

Two young runaways become boy actors, at first on the road and later in London, where they are befriended by William Shakespeare. They become aware of a plot against Queen Elizabeth's life and attempt to prevent it. Plot summary Peter Brownrigg, a 14-year-old boy who lives in Cumberland in the north of England, is involved in a night crime against the theft of his village's farmland by Sir Philip Morton. He leaves his village to escape prosecution for throwing a rock at Sir Philip Morton. He first goes to Penrith, but unexpectedly encounters Sir Philip at a performance of Richard III by a touring playing company. He hides from him in a prop coffin (supposed to contain the body of King Henry VI) which is later carried on to the company's cart. The players discover Peter hiding and the kindly Desmonds, who run the playing company, take him on as a boy actor. Another boy, Kit Kirkstone, also joins the company. Kit proves excellent at playing female roles while Peter acts as an understudy. After Peter's jealousy leads to a fight, he discovers Kit's secret. Kit is actually a girl in disguise, really called Katharine Russell, who is running away to avoid a forced marriage to Sir Philip, who is only interested in her inheritance. The company breaks up and the Desmonds promise to take Peter and Kit to a London theatre company. During their trip to London Mr. Desmond breaks his leg in a river accident and Kit almost reveals her true identity to a crowd of observers after swimming down the river to rescue Mr. Desmond, but Peter distracts everyone and saves her. Because of the results of Mr. Desmond's accident Peter and Kit carry on their journey alone. When they arrive in London they audition for Richard Burbage of the Lord Chamberlain's Men at The Theatre in Shoreditch, a neighborhood beyond the northern boundary of the City of London and outside of the jurisdiction of its civil authorities - and consequently an area notorious for licentious behaviour and gaming houses. After being initially turned away by Burbage, they are accepted as apprentices by the playwright William Shakespeare, who recognises Kit's acting ability and Peter's gift of mimicry. They perform in various plays and see Sir Philip in the audience during Romeo and Juliet. Peter's copy of Shakespeare's new play Henry V is stolen by the \\"Yellow Gentleman\\", and Kit and Peter worry that he plans to profit from the unpublished play. While stealing back the script, Peter overhears a discussion between the thief and another man, sounding very treasonous. He also notices an odd poem written on the script. They realise that some of the poem must be part of a code but have no idea how to decipher it. Peter and Kit take the poem to the Queen's secret service who decode the poorly written sonnet, discovering that the first letter of each line spells SEND NEWS BY PEEL. Peter immediately associate this message with Sir Philip's old peel tower. Peter and Kit set off with Tom Boyd, a member of the Queen's Secret Service. They travel back to Peter's village in disguise to see if Peter's theory about Sir Philip's peel tower is true. Tom is killed by the conspirators and Peter is captured but not before learning that John Somers, an actor in their company, is to shoot the Queen during the first performance of Henry V. This is part of a wider conspiracy to install a new regime in England, the rest of it is vague but they are evidently in league with Spain. Peter is taken for questioning to a deserted Ullswater islet but manages to knock out the guard. He swims to the mainland and narrowly escapes across the fells. Kit and Peter go to a local magistrate, but discover he is a part of the treasonous plan. They steal his horses, which are of exceptional quality, intending to ride to London to warn the Queen. Sir Philip and his associates give chase. On the road to London they are robbed of their horses, however, this is an unseen blessing because just then Sir Philip and his associates catch up and give chase to the horse thieves, thinking they are Peter and Kit. After walking on foot they meet Desmond and the rest of the company who are rehearsing Edward II. On hearing of the conspiracy, Desmond vows to stop Sir Philip. Knowing it is only a matter of time before Sir Philip realizes his error and returns the actors dress up in their soldier costumes and rig the horses to sound like an army ready to attack, with trumpets and drums behind. Kit and Peter pretend to be captives in order to make Sir Philip dismount. Sir Philip is fooled by the group's acting and he and his followers are then taken into custody by Desmond's men. Kit and Peter make a desperate dash back to London, and John Somers is captured by guards moments before he can shoot the Queen. Kit and Peter meet the Queen and tell her their adventures. In the last paragraph, Peter finishes writing the story and we learn that he and Kit are now married with sons and are living in a lakeside house in Cumberland which is Kit's inherited estate.

However, Cue for Treason was written fairly early in his writing career, and was in a sense his definitive work. As well as being his best known, it has been described as creating the template on which he wrote many of his later novels.Guardian obituary In particular, he has as his central character an adolescent male, who meets an adolescent female who proves a strong character in her own right. He also employs some plot devices which he sometimes used in his later works e.g. the heroine spends a large part of the story disguised as a boy, and to advance the plot the hero happens to overhear the villains talking. However, although in this case the hero and heroine marry at the end, he avoids this obvious ending in some of his later novels (e.g. The Hills of Varna, which otherwise shows some similarity to Cue for Treason). The novel is marked by a strong sense of place, particularly showing Trease's love of the Lake District, where he also set his Bannerdale stories, including No Boats on Bannermere. The politics of the Elizabethan era are mentioned in the novel: social concerns over enclosures and unemployment, and the state matters of rebellion and invasion. Forced marriage and the exclusion of women from the drama are touched upon. The values of patriotism, loyalty and independence are stressed. The motives of the conspirators are not examined, being assumed to be simply wealth and power; although historically religion would have been a factor, this is not mentioned beyond a casual reference to \\"old ways\\". The English Renaissance theatre is represented by its two extremes: a poor temporary company which tours around England, and the Lord Chamberlain's Men who perform for the Queen and her court.

Contemporary compositions, including Dave Williams' own songs, John Williams‚Äô \\"Theme From Schindler's List\\" and Fleetwood Mac's \\"Albatross\\" were integrated with classical works on the group's first self-titled LP. They have also released the Christmas album Adeste Fiddles (a play on Adeste Fideles) and a second album, Ivory Bow. Biographies=Dave Williams= After receiving a degree in Art and Design, Dave Williams began his musical career playing with best friend John Deacon, the bassist of Queen, in several different bands. When the magic of touring began to lose its charm Williams opened his own recording studio and became a songwriter for Warner/Chappell. Williams has created musical jingles for TV & Radio that can be heard all over the world including his first big time job, a radio jingle for Radio Rentals with session vocalist Tony Head (who later went on to work on Buffy the Vampire Slayer). Dave became the Music Director for the long running international smash hit Spirit of the Dance, which has four touring shows in the US and two international touring groups. Formed in 1996, Spirit of the Dance is a foot-stomping international production featuring a spectacular display of traditional Irish culture that has thrilled audiences all over the world. Williams's own compositions have most recently been performed by Oliver Lewis and broadcast to over two billion people in Asia. =Oliver Lewis= International violin virtuoso Oliver Lewis is hailed by the Guardian as \\"Magnificent talent, he took the audience into another world.\\" Even from a young age Oliver Lewis‚Äô talent for the violin was undeniable. As a child prodigy he was one of the first leaders of the National Children's Orchestra of Great Britain, making his concert debut at the age of twelve. Scholarships from the Purcell School of Music, the Guildhall School of Music and the Berne Conservatoire opened doors for Lewis, enabling him to be trained by great talents and educators of music. His professional career began as a concert soloist with the Berne Symphony Orchestra where he played Ravel's \\"Tzigane\\" and Bruch's \\"G Minor Violin Concerto.\\" This led him to be leader of the Heidelberg Chamber Orchestra, touring Europe and performing Vivaldi's \\"Four Seasons\\" over four hundred times. Although Lewis has proven himself a virtuoso of the classics, he also has mastered stylistic diversity. Star of the international smash hit Spirit of the Dance, he performed a spectacular display of traditional Irish culture that has thrilled audiences. Spirit of the Dance has become one of the most successful shows in the world, seen by millions of people. As an avid fan of new music, many modern day composers have written pieces specifically for him to play. These pieces include \\"Insomnia\\" by British composer John Pickard and Nicholas Brown's \\"Silence is Golden\\". With his piano trio he has recorded two new scores to the classic silent movies Lady Windermere's Fan and After Death, released worldwide by the British Film Institute. Lewis's concerts have taken him to Europe, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Asia, Brazil, and Trinidad, where he performed for the president of Trinidad and Tobago alongside Trinidad's soprano star Natalia Dopwell. Currently, Lewis plays regular recitals at the Wigmore Hall and with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, both of which are box office sellouts. He records extensively for Guild Music, winning the top double five-star award from Classic CD Magazine and he is sponsored by the leading American string manufacturer D'Addario. # \\"Really Big Swans\\" (Tchaikovsky \\"Four Little Swans\\") # \\"Tootin' Carmen\\" (Bizet \\"Habanera\\" from Carmen) # \\"Ladies on Lavender\\" (Nigel Hess \\"Ladies in Lavender\\") # \\"Deviations\\" (Paganini \\"24th Caprice\\") # \\"Tocata in Fog\\" - written by Dave Williams # \\"Les Belles\\" (Mike Oldfield \\"Tubular Bells\\") # \\"She Too\\" - written by Dave Williams # \\"Albert Ross\\" (Fleetwood Mac \\"Albatross\\") - written by Peter Green # \\"Medication\\" (Jules Massenet \\"Meditation\\" from Thais) # \\"Swan Fake\\" (Tchaikovsky \\"Swan Lake\\") # \\"The List\\" (John Williams \\"Schindler's List\\") # \\"Nuclear\\" - written by Dave Williams # \\"Dear Old Swanney\\" (Saint- Sa√´ns \\"The Swan\\") # \\"Frogger\\" (Harold Faltermeyer \\"Axel F\\") # \\"O2\\" (Jean Michel Jarre \\"Oxygene\\") # \\"Barking\\" (Bach \\"Presto\\" from Sonata in G minor) # \\"The Car Men\\" (Bizet \\"Carmen\\") Adeste Fiddles # The First Noel 4:00 # The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy 3:04 # Ave Maria 4:23 # God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman 3:36 # Favorite Things 3:12 # Silent Night 4:22 # Celtic Christmas 3:38 # We Three Kings 3:22 # Adeste Fiddles (Oh Come All Ye Faithful) 3:44 # I Saw Three Ships 3:10 # The Coventry Carol (Lu lay lu lah) 3:31 # The Holly and the Ivy 3:20 # Hark the Herald Angels Sing 2:51 # Here We Come A Wassailing 2:08 # Oh Holy Night 3:52 # Ding Dong Merrily On High 3:09 Ivory Bow # Pavanorama 04:42 # Celtic Frock 03:39 # Carmen Over To My Place 02:04 # Bolero 06:51 # Flight Of The Crimson Queen 03:27 # Arabian Knights 03:52 # Canned Rock 04:48 # The Ivory Bow 04:37 # Big Bad Bumble 02:03 # Edelweiss 03:08 # Carmen Electro 02:45 # The Lying King 04:13 # Camera Gazing 03:04 # Dance Of The Rude Peeps 03:14 # Oh, Eso Es Un Castillo Bonito 03:21 # Gypsy Cream 03:38 # Ave Maria 03:36 References Neurodisc Records Official Site External links * Deviations Project Myspace * Neurodisc Records Official Site Category:British electronic music groups ","title":"Deviations Project"},{"id":"10332214","text":"Michael Charles Prestwich OBE (born 30 January 1943) is an English historian, specialising on the history of medieval England, in particular the reign of Edward I.

The series consisted of 96 episodes, and saw the conclusion of the long-running storyline involving PC Des Taviner, who was believed to have been killed in an explosion in a gas tower in series 19. It also saw the conclusion of another long term storyline, Cathy Bradford‚Äôs crimes surrounding her obsession with colleague Brandon Kane. Other major storylines saw Gabriel Kent collude with a sniper to kill criminals, his own murder & rape of Kerry Young and Rob Thatcher‚Äôs determination to arrest the Radford family after the death of his father in the 1980s. This series continues to use the serialized format previously introduced by Paul Marquess during Series 18. As a celebration of the show's 21st anniversary, a special weekend of programmes were broadcast on UKTV Gold, including a special mocku- mentary which featured cast members, past and present, mulling over their time at Sun Hill during a quiet afternoon in the custody suite; as well several 'classic' episodes, past and present. ITV marked the anniversary with a special episode, which saw DCI Jack Meadows take a week's holiday to attend former DS Ted Roach's funeral - but, after suspecting Roach may have been murdered, he teams up with former Sergeants Alec Peters (Larry Dann) and Bob Cryer (Eric Richard) to find out the truth. Another spin-off from the show, The Bill: Uncovered, was also introduced; a series of four one-off documentaries narrated by their main star, telling the story of a particular character's path or journey throughout their time at Sun Hill. Episodes broadcast during this series include \\"Des' Story\\" and \\"Kerry's Story\\".

The series consisted of 106 episodes, making it the series with the highest number of episodes in the show's final decade. This series saw the programme change hands as executive producer of three and a half years, Paul Marquess, stepped down to make way for new producer Johnathan Young. Subsequently, this resulted in the removal of much of the 'soap' feel which was introduced by Marquess, and the main focus turning towards the actual policing aspect of the programme. The majority of this series however remained serialised, with the transition back to single-hander episodes being phased in slowly, following into Series 22. This series saw the second highest number of cast changes in a single series of the show, with 17 characters leaving, only beaten by the tally of 18 from series 18. This biggest of these departures was that of the show's longest serving cast member at that point, DC Jim Carver (Mark Wingett), who had been with the show since its pilot episode in 1983. As a dedication, a special half-hour 'two-hander' episode was recorded, featuring Carver and Sgt. June Ackland (Trudie Goodwin), who also appeared with Wingett in the show's pilot in '83. This series also featured the final episode of The Bill: Uncovered, a series of special documentaries following the lives and events of particular characters or groups of characters. This particular special, however, was never broadcast in the United Kingdom and was subsequently only shown on terrestrial television in Australia. The events of the second Sun Hill disaster were also covered in this series, in which three officers were killed after a petrol-laden van was driven into the front of the station by crazed PSCO Colin Fairfax. This series also introduced one of the show's longest running storylines, involving the investigation into gangster Pete Larson and Sgt. Smith's subsequent affair with his wife. This storyline was not concluded until Series 22. On 5 February 2014, the complete series was released on DVD in Australia as a Region 0, playable anywhere in the world.

The series consisted of 91 episodes, as two episodes from the series remain unaired after the master tapes were stolen in a robbery at the show's recording studios in November 2006. Under new producer Johnathan Young, this series saw the programme begin to step away from the serialised format, and return much of the focus to the actual policing aspect of the programme, removing the more 'soap' feel as previously introduced by Paul Marquess. Most episodes consist of two parallel stories running at the same time, much like the initial transition to hour episodes in 1998. However, some episodes feature entirely on one story, beginning the move back to single- themed episodes and the complete removal of serialisation in 2007. The series also saw one of the heaviest numbers of cast changes in later years of the show, with a number of characters previously introduced by Marquess being axed to make way for new blood. Young believed that several of the characters introduced by Marquess did not have the longevity of the more well-known characters in the show, and thus decided to give a number of highly recommended up-and-coming actors roles on the show, such as Kidulthood star Aml Ameen. One of the most prominent characters to leave was Superintendent Adam Okaro (Cyril Nri), whose promotion to Borough Commander saw his position replaced by new Superintendent John Heaton (Daniel Flynn). However, Young stated at the start of his tenure that he had no intention to axe any of the staple characters, such as June Ackland, Tony Stamp or Reg Hollis, who had been with the show for many years. It is also notable that several long- running story arcs introduced in this series were not concluded until nearly a year later in Series 23 ‚Äì the longest running storylines in the show's history. These included the disappearance of schoolgirl Amy Tennant, and the investigation into drugs baron Kristen Shaw. The series also saw veteran PC Roger Valentine diagnosed with Post-traumatic stress disorder, having been seriously injured during a major disaster at a nightclub. During a storyline that stretched almost 50 of the series‚Äô episodes, Roger had to fight his own skepticism and seek help.

The series consisted of 92 episodes, and saw the conclusion of the show's longest running-storyline, featuring the disappearance of schoolgirl Amy Tennant. This series saw the return of single- themed episodes, removing much of the serialiased format formally introduced in 2002 under producer Paul Marquess; episode titles also started appearing on screen again from Episode 20 onwards. This series also became the first series where episodes were aired out of production order, making the broadcast order significantly different to the production order. This series saw the return of several multi-part story arcs, the likes of which had last featured in the second half of Series 17. Again, several new characters were introduced into the show, including several semi-regular characters, such as non-operational police staff and crime scene examiners. The series also saw the departure of the show's longest-running cast member to date, with Trudie Goodwin leaving the role of June Ackland, and her final episode being broadcast on 8 March 2007. This was also the last episode not to feature an on-screen title. A new title sequence was introduced at the beginning of the series, however, the theme tune remained the same, albeit slightly re-arranged. Episodes 484 and 485 were the first episodes to be broadcast out of production order. Despite at the time not even being billed for broadcast, and the 'previously' and 'next time' segments not matching the episodes around them, the episodes were brought forward due to heavy demand from the British viewing public, who were on tenterhooks to see the conclusion of the long-running Zain Nadir and Kristen Shaw storyline. This also meant that the 'previously' and 'next time' segments on the subsequent episodes had to be re-edited to show this, and that two small additional scenes had to be recorded to be placed into Episode 480 to reference the death of Honey Harman. For the DVD release, to avoid confusion, these episodes have been re-numbered and now serve as 480 and 481, with the following four episodes re-numbered to 482‚Äì485 respectively. Several major storylines included the aforementioned June Ackland bringing down DAC Georgia Hobbs in a major corruption scandal, and PC Lewis Hardy infiltrating a major street gang that had a hold over his cousin Dominic as part of Aml Ameen's exit storyline. Superintendent John Heaton, introduced in the previous season, took centre stage in two major storylines; the first saw him clash with Ray Moore, a villain from his past played by Mark Bonnar. Later in the series he was the target of a rampaging gunman who killed two men and shot another. An episode in the series also highlighted Honour killing, with the episode it was featured in, To Honour and Obey, being broadcast out of order after its mastertape was stolen along with the one for the previous episode, Blood Money; the episodes were due to air in December 2006. On 2 April 2014, the complete series was released on DVD in Australia as a Region 0, playable anywhere in the world. The DVD release carries in the episodes in broadcast order, rather than production order; meaning that the DVD synopsis printed on the sleeve is heavily incorrect. The DVD synopsis also removes all titles (including those carried on screen), and continues to tally the episodes by number. The DVD release does not contain episodes 540‚Äì542, \\"Moving Target\\" Parts 1‚Äì3, due to licensing rights for these episodes not being available.

Not succeeding, he attempted to rape her, and failing in that, he stabbed her 14 times, mortally wounding her. While serving 27 years in prison for his crime, he reported seeing a vision of his victim in which she repeated to him how she had forgiven him on her death bed. From this point he was converted and became a model prisoner. Upon his release, he worked as a gardener and porter in a convent of Capuchin friars in the Marches. Goretti was later proclaimed a saint by the Roman Catholic Church. Early years Serenelli was born into a peasant family. His father, Giovanni, is often portrayed as an alcoholic, although Maria's mother said he rarely drank to the point of drunkenness. His mother died in a psychiatric hospital when he was a few months old, apparently after trying to drown Serenelli when he was a newborn. A brother of the young man committed suicide while studying in the seminary. His father worked as a coachman and a laborer but was unable to keep any job for a long time and moved to Paliano to work as a m√©tayage. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he attended school until the second grade, learning to read and write. Alessandro later worked as a longshoreman. At eighteen, his father called him to work with him in Paliano. Here, he knew the Goretti family with whom he established a relationship of cooperation and neighborliness. Crimes against Maria Goretti In 1902, twenty-year-old Serenelli, a virgin described by all as a very shy and quiet young man, began to harass Goretti, then eleven. In testimony given by him[Processum informativum, folio 160.] about his thoughts before the brutal incident he related: \\"After the second attempt, in my mind was formed more than ever the intention to succeed in the vent of my passion and I conceived the idea to kill her if she continued to resist my cravings.\\" On 5 July 1902, Serenelli returned to the house and threatened Goretti with death if she did not do as he said; he was intending to rape her. However she would not submit, protesting that what he wanted to do was a mortal sin and warning him that he would go to hell. She desperately fought to stop him from proceeding. She kept screaming, \\"No! It is a sin! God does not want it!\\" He first choked her, but when she insisted she would rather die than submit to him, he stabbed her eleven times. She tried to reach for the door, but he stopped her by stabbing her three more times before fleeing the scene. Ruef, Vinzenz. Die Wahre Geschichte von der hl. Maria Goretti, Miriam, Jestetten, 1992, p. 12 The psychiatric evaluation made during the process determined him to be mentally sane and therefore liable for his actions, but also acknowledged that his unfortunate youth, including multiple cases of mental disorders and alcoholism within his family, to some extent attenuated his responsibility. Imprisonment and redemption After due process, Serenelli was sentenced to 30 years in prison. He avoided life imprisonment because Italian law at that time set the age of majority at 21 and so he was not yet of age in order to be subject to that penalty. He was released from prison in 1929, after serving 27 years. Of the 30 to which he had been sentenced, one year was remitted by the general pardon to all prisoners after the Italian victory in World War I, and a further two were each in recognition of good behavior. On the night of Christmas 1934, Serenelli begged forgiveness on his knees from Assunta Goretti, Maria's mother. She forgave him asking how she could not when Maria had done so already on her death bed. Having worked sporadically as a farmer and laborer, Serenelli eventually retired to a monastery of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, where he served as their gardener and porter, eventually being accepted as a lay brother. On 24 June 1950, Pope Pius XII canonized Goretti as a saint, the \\"Saint Agnes of the 20th century.\\"Hoever, Rev. Hugo, ed. \\"Lives of the Saints, For Every Day of the Year\\", New York: Catholic Book Publishing Co., (1955) p. 259-60 Assunta was present at the ceremony, along with Maria's four remaining siblings. She was the first mother ever to attend the canonization ceremony of her child.Crusz, Noel. Maria Goretti - Saint Under Siege, 7 July 2002, The Sunday Times of Sri Lanka. Accessed April 11, 2010. Serenelli is reported on several Catholic websites to have also been presentSt Maria Goretti Biography at Mariagoretti.orgSt. Maria Goretti at Catholic.orgSt Maria Goretti at Catholicism.about.com however whether or not these reports are accurate has been questioned. An Associated Press article printed in The New York Times the next day reported that he was absent. Death and legacy Serenelli died on 6 May 1970 in a convent at Macerata from complications relating to a fracture of his femur following a fall. He was almost 88 years old. Around a decade earlier, he had written the following as part of his will: > I'm nearly 80 years old. I'm about to depart. Looking back at my past, I can > see that in my early youth, I chose a bad path which led me to ruin myself. > My behavior was influenced by print, mass-media and bad examples which are > followed by the majority of young people without even thinking. And I did > the same. I was not worried. There were a lot of generous and devoted people > who surrounded me, but I paid no attention to them because a violent force > blinded me and pushed me toward a wrong way of life. When I was 20 years- > old, I committed a crime of passion. Now, that memory represents something > horrible for me. Maria Goretti, now a Saint, was my good Angel, sent to me > through Providence to guide and save me. I still have impressed upon my > heart her words of rebuke and of pardon. She prayed for me, she interceded > for her murderer. Thirty years of prison followed. If I had been of age, I > would have spent all my life in prison. I accepted to be condemned because > it was my own fault. Little Maria was really my light, my protectress; with > her help, I behaved well during the 27 years of prison and tried to live > honestly when I was again accepted among the members of society. The > Brothers of St. Francis, Capuchins from Marche, welcomed me with angelic > charity into their monastery as a brother, not as a servant. I've been > living with their community for 24 years, and now I am serenely waiting to > witness the vision of God, to hug my loved ones again, and to be next to my > Guardian Angel and her dear mother, Assunta. I hope this letter that I wrote > can teach others the happy lesson of avoiding evil and of always following > the right path, like little children.

As such, it should not be considered in isolation. In order to get a broad overview of currency in the region, see the article British West Indies dollar. Even though Queen Anne's proclamation of 1704 brought the gold standard to the West Indies, silver pieces of eight (Spanish dollars and later Mexican dollars) continued to form a major portion of the circulating currency right into the latter half of the nineteenth century. Britain adopted the gold standard in 1821 and an imperial order-in-council of 1838 resulted in British sterling coinage being introduced to St. Vincent in the year 1839. However, despite the circulation of British coins in St. Vincent, the silver pieces of eight continued to circulate alongside them and the private sector continued to use dollar accounts for reckoning. The international silver crisis of 1873 signalled the end of the silver dollar era in the West Indies and silver dollars were demonetized in St. Vincent in 1879 for fear that the silver standard might return. Even though the British sterling coins were made of silver, they were fractional coins of the British gold sovereign and hence they maintained their gold value. This left a state of affairs, in which the British coinage circulated, being reckoned in dollar accounts at an automatic conversion rate of 1 dollar = 4 shillings 2 pence. From 1949, with the introduction of the British West Indies dollar, the currency of St. Vincent became officially tied up with that of the British Eastern Caribbean territories in general. The British sterling coinage was eventually replaced by a new decimal coinage in 1955, with the new cent being equal to one half of the old penny. Early history In 1797, coins were produced for 1 black dog, 1 stampee and ¬º and ¬Ω dollar. The black dog and stampee were made by counterstamping an \\"SV\\" monogram on French colonial coins, whilst the ¬º and ¬Ω dollar were made by cutting 8 reales coins (Spanish dollars) into four or two and stamping them with the \\"SV\\" monogram. Between 1811 and 1814 currency consisted of various counterstamped Spanish and Spanish colonial coins, some of which were cut or holed. The Spanish dollar was subdivided into bits, each worth 9 pence, 6 black dogs or 4 stampees. Before 1811, 1 dollar = 11 bits and the dollar equalled 8 Spanish reales. After 1811, 1 dollar = 12 bits and 1¬Ω dollars equalled 8 reales. 4¬Ω, 6, 9 and 12 bits coins were produced. The 4¬Ω and 9 bits were made from 2 and 4 reales coins. The 4¬Ω bits was counterstamped with \\"S\\", \\"IV¬Ω\\" and \\"B\\", whilst the 9 bits was counterstamped with \\"S\\" and \\"IX\\". To produce the 6 and 12 bits, 8 reales coins were holed. The central plug was stamped with \\"S\\" and \\"VI\\" to produce the 6 bits, whilst the ring (or holey dollar) was stamped with \\"S\\" and \\"XII\\" to make the 12 bits. The revolutions in Spanish America cut off the supply of the Spanish Dollars at a time when Britain had recently introduced a successful gold standard. As such, it became expedient to introduce British sterling coinage to all the colonies. Sterling coinage was introduced following an imperial order-in-council of 1825 which set ratings for sterling in relation to the Spanish dollar and some other major coinages which were in circulation at the time. Paper Money In 1882, the first private banknotes were issued, denominated in dollars. It was pegged to sterling with 1 dollar = 4 shillings 2 pence. In 1935, the British West Indies dollar was introduced, equal in value to all other dollars circulating in the British West Indies. Private banks continued to issue notes until 1941. The British West Indies dollar was replaced in 1965 by the East Caribbean dollar. =Banknotes= The Colonial Bank issued 5 dollars notes in 1882. Barclays Bank (which had taken over the Colonial Bank) issued 5 dollars notes between 1926 and 1941.

Early life Kitson was born in North Street, Audenshaw, Cheshire, England, the son of John Kitson from Manchester and Margaret, n√©e Neil, from Edinburgh, Scotland. On his father's side the family had been stonemasons, while his maternal grandfather was a Scottish Presbyterian minister. Albert's early childhood was spent in Nagpur in the Central Provinces of India where his family moved when he was a year old. Around 1876 they emigrated to Victoria. Here John and Margaret taught at a State School in the gold-mining settlement of Enoch's Point in the Victorian Alps before John was appointed as head teacher of the, recently created, North Winton State School near Benalla. John died of angina in 1879 and so until her death in 1898 Margaret took over the running of the school which was attended by both her surviving children ‚Äì Albert and his younger brother (John) Sidney. Career Albert Kitson joined the Public Service in Victoria in 1886 as a clerk. Whilst still employed in this function he also carried out geological field work. This fired a passion and encouraged him to take up part-time studies in geology at the Working Men's College (now the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) and subsequently at the University of Melbourne. By 1903, he had risen to become second-in-command of the Geological Survey of Victoria of which he subsequently became senior geologist and for a time acting director.

In 1907, Albert Kitson recommended that the Buchan Caves in Gippsland, Victoria be set aside as a reservation to protect them from vandalism.A.E. Kitson, 'Proposed reservation of limestone caves in the Buchan District, Eastern Gippland', Rec. geol. Surv. Vict., II(I), 1907, pp. 37‚Äì44.

After his initial work in Victoria, Kitson spent much of his subsequent professional life in Africa. Recognising his geological talents Professor J. W. Gregory recommended him for a post as Principal mineral surveyor in Southern NigeriaJohn Frederick Norman Green, 'Obituary: Albert Ernest Kitson', Geological Society, Quarterly Journal, no. 94, 1938, p. CXXVI where he went on to discover coalNATIONAL ARCHIVES ENUGU, Series number, File number CSO.29/1900-8/3/5, 'Mineral Survey Progress Report by M.A.E.

In 1909 he discovered black bituminous coal along the Enugu-Udi escarpment in Nigeria and high hopes were placed in such a potentially important coal deposit. The town of Port Harcourt was built in 1912 as an outlet for this Nigerian coal and was linked with Enugu via a railway line that extended northwards to Kaduna. The Enugu coal fields went into production in 1915 and caused an important immigration of population to Enugu earning the town the nickname of the \\"Coal City\\".Nigerians-Abroad ‚Äì South-East ‚Äì Feature: The changing face of Enugu The Nigerian coal turned out to be of poor quality and was used mainly for domestic consumption within the colonies, providing an important power resource for the railways and electricity.Maria Sophia Steyn, \\"Oil politics in Ecuador and Nigeria: a perspective from environmental history on the struggles between ethnic minority groups, multinational oil companies and national governments\\", Doctoral Thesis (History), University of the Free State Bloemfontein, South Africa, 2003, pp. 147‚Äì148. Although Kitson's mission was to discover mineral deposits which might be exploited by the British colonial authority he always combined this with a paternalistic concern to improve the material situation of the local populations. In 1912, after hearing a lecture by J. P. Unstead about the climatic conditions for wheat cultivation in North America, Kitson's response was to ask whether Unstead's findings might be applied to Nigeria. Kitson argued: \\"Could a wheat-growing industry be established it would be a great boon to the people of West Africa.\\" In paternalistic tones he went on: \\"It might in Northern Nigeria replace to a large extent the less valuable millet now grown there, while in Southern Nigeria it could materially supplement the staple foods- cassava, yams and maize\\".A. E. Kitson in response to J. F. Unstead, \\"The climatic limits of wheat cultivation, with special reference to North America\\", The Geographical Journal, Vol. XXXIX, No. 5, May 1912, p. 443. After Nigeria, Kitson continued his explorations in Africa, along with Edmund Thiele, working particularly in the Gold Coast (now Ghana) between 1913‚Äì30 where he was first Principal of the Mineral Survey and afterwards Director of the Geological Survey. Kitson travelled round the colony by train and bicycle and discovered sizeable mineral deposits including bauxite\\"A Special Correspondent\\", \\"The Volta River Project\\", African Affairs, Vol. 55, No. 221 (October 1956), pp. 287‚Äì293. See also Emmanuel Kwaku Akyeampong, Between the Sea and the Lagoon, James Currey, 2002, p. 164, which reveals that Kitson discovered extensive bauxite deposits on Mount Ejuanema in Kwahu. . and manganese.\\" He discovered Bauxite, the raw material of alumina, in the Atewa Range near Kibi in 1914. The first manganese ore which he discovered was in May 1914 when he found occurrences near the Sekondi-Kumassi Railway about from Tarkwa.African Affairs ‚Äì Sign In Page These deposits were important to Britain's war effort, as supplies of these minerals from other locations had become difficult. During the last year of the war 32 000 tons of manganese, used in munitions production, were shipped to Britain from the deposits Kitson had found in the Gold Coast. Then in February 1919, together with his colleague E. O. Teale (formerly Thiele), he discovered on the Birim River the first deposits of diamonds to be found in the Gold Coast.N. R. Junner & F. A. Bannister, The Diamond Deposits of the Gold Coast with Notes on Other Diamond Deposits in West Africa, GCGS, Gold Coast, 1943. The diamonds were of small size but high quality.J. W. Gregory, 'Survey of India General Report, 1924‚Äì1925', The Geographical Journal, Vol. 69, No. 2 (February 1927), p. 148. See also Eric Bruton, Diamentes,Edicions de la Universitat de Barcelona, 1983. Kitson observed that they were good crystals showing octahedron and dodecahedron.A. E. Kitson, Report on the Discovery of Diamonds at Abomosa, Northwest of Kibbi, Eastern Province, Gold Coast, Govt. Press, Accra, Gold Coast, 1919. This proved to be a particularly valuable source of diamonds and the exportation of diamonds grew spectacularly. In 1934 the of diamonds exported from the Gold Coast accounted for 39% of the world's supply that year.\\"Reviews of books on Africa\\", African Affairs, Volume 43, Issue 170, 1 January 1944, p. 46. Kitson is also associated with the development of hydro-electric power in the Gold Coast/Ghana.William M Adams, Green Development: Environment and Sustainability in the Third World, 2001, p. 320; James Pickett, Hans Wolfgang Singer, Robert Kweku Atta Gardiner (eds), Towards economic recovery in sub-Saharan Africa, London: Routledge, 1990, p. 66; Pierre Cappelaere, Ghana, les chemins de la d√©mocratie, Paris, 2007, p. 182; Philip Briggs, Ghana, Bradt Travel Guide, 4th edition, 2007, p. 245; Dominique Auzias (et al), Le Petit Fut√© Ghana, Paris, 2008, p. 127; see also: http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/IDA/USAID/RC/Guide_to_Electric%20Power_in_Ghana.pdf . See also In 1915 he was the first to recommend building a dam at Akosombo on the Volta River to generate hydro-electricity,African Affairs ‚Äì Sign In Page hoping to use this to process the bauxite deposits that he had discovered in the Kwahu plateau the previous year. It was not until 1965 that the idea of the dam was put into effect when Ghana's first black president, Dr Kwame Nkrumah, decided to generate hydropower as a means of modernizing the economy.. This development created Lake Volta, the largest man-made lake in the world. https://www.modernghana.com/news/254075/1/the-under-told-story-of- akosombo-the-gbedemah-fact.html Late life After his retirement from the Gold Coast in 1930 Kitson moved to Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, where he called his house \\"Benalta\\" (a reference to the original name of Benalla), as an indication of his enduring passion for Australia. Here he continued to be consulted on geological questions connected to Africa. In particular he reported on goldfields in Kenya during the so-called Kakamega Gold Rush of the early 1930s where gold-mining once again showed its disrespect for the rights of local communities and the environment.Priscilla M. Shilaro, \\"A Failed Eldorado: British Trusteeship, Luyia Land Rights and the Kakamega Gold Rush, 1930‚Äì1952\\", PHD (History), University of West Virginia, 2000, pp 154‚Äì6 & 180‚Äì186; see also: H. W. Tilman and Jim Perrin, H. W. Tilman: The Seven Mountain-Travel Books, 2004, p 71. See also: Marjorie R. Dilley, British Policy in Kenya Colony, London: Frank Cass, 1966, p. 265. In his report for the Colonial Office Kitson suggested that possibly as much as half of the gold being prospected was wasted by amateur techniques.John Frederick Norman Green, 'Obituary: Albert Ernest Kitson', Geological Society, Quarterly Journal, no. 94, 1938, p. CXXVII. In an article for the magazine The Spectator, Kitson compared the influx of amateur gold-prospectors to a similar situation in Klondike in Canada in 1897-8 : \\"The road to Kakamega now resembles a miniature 'trail of 98' without the snow. Old mining men, from ex-Klondyke Pioneers to Australian backwoodsmen, are hurrying to the spot\\".The Spectator, 12 December 1932. But it seems that Kitson's initial report had helped create the rush in the first place by highlighting the rich pickings available.Priscilla M. Shilaro, 'A Failed Eldorado: British Trusteeship, Luyia Land Rights and the Kakamega Gold Rush, 1930‚Äì1952', PHD (History), University of West Virginia, 2000, pp 180‚Äì182. As The Spectator noted: \\"Since the publication of Sir Albert Kitson's report, the population of the Kakamega goldfields had doubled\\". Kitson's article in this magazine merely fuelled the rush still further. Numerous honours came Kitson's way in recognition of his work. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1918 and Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1922. In 1927 Kitson was knighted for his services to geology. The Geological Society of London elected him as a fellow in 1897, awarded him the Wollaston fund in 1918 before honouring him with the very prestigious Lyell Medal in 1927, an annual award given to an outstanding Earth Scientist. In 1929 he was appointed as President of the Geology Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and, following his retirement, he became President of the Geologists' Association in 1934. Kitson was an official representative of the British Government at International Geological Congresses (four times) and at World Power Conferences (four times).\\"Kitson, Albert Ernest (Sir) (1868 - 1937)\\", Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria.

Kitson Avenue in Takoradi in modern-day Ghana is named in his honour as is Kitson Court in Benalla, Victoria, Australia and Kitson Place in the Florey suburb of Canberra, Australia. For his obituary the journal Nature wrote: \\"SIR ALBERT KITSON, whose death occurred on 8 March, was a geologist of world-wide repute, and the discoveries which he made and which are now being exploited in many parts of the world entitle him to be classed as one of the foremost economic geologists of his time.\\"Nature, 139, (3 April 1937) pp 576‚Äì577. For online version see: http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v139/n3518/abs/139576a0.html From his earliest age, Kitson took an interest in the natural world around him. Throughout his career he collected fossils which he would send to museums in Victoria and London. He was fascinated by the Victorian Lyrebird, publishing an article on it for the Smithsonian Institution.A. E. Kitson, 'Notes on the Victoria Lyre-Bird'. Smithsonian Institution, Annual Report, 1906, 363‚Äì374. In the Australian bush he learnt a facility to handle snakes and this would later earn him a reputation on the Gold Coast as a fetish priest. He was also a keen photographer. By the end of his first three years in the Gold Coast he had taken around 450 photos of the colony.A. E. Kitson, 'The Gold Coast', The Geographical Journal, vol. XLVIII, no. 5, November 1916. See also Many of these are preserved in Ghana's national archive (where they are wrongly attributed to E. A. Kitson). Kitson was also noted for his keen amateur interest in archeology, finding numerous artefacts which he made available to Museums in Africa and England.Peter Robertshaw, A History of African archaeology, London: James Currey Publisher, 1990, p. 138. Nicknamed \\"Kittie\\", Kitson was a very religious serious-minded man and a teetotaller. He was quite strict as J. N. F. Green makes clear: \\"Lifelong self-discipline gave Kitson exceptional powers of endurance and concentration in difficult and trying conditions. Somewhat of a driver in the field, he never spared himself, taking the heaviest burden.\\" L. J. Spencer, formerly keeper of minerals at the British Museum, described Kitson as \\"a most energetic little man; his constant companion was a small prospecting pan\\". Spencer remembered \\"a journey with him in 1924 in the mining districts of northern Ontario; at every halt of the train he was out with his little pan in any ditch he could find\\".L. J. Spencer, \\"Biographical notes of mineralogists recently deceased\\", The Mineralogical Magazine and Journal of the Mineralogical Society, no. 165, June 1939, Vol. XXV. At the award of his Lyell medal, Ormsby-Gore spoke of \\"his tireless energy, but his attractive and stimulating personality\\".Proceedings of the Geological Society, Volume LXXXIII, p. XLVI. In 1910 he married Margaret Legge, n√©e Walker (1870‚Äì1920). After her death he married Elinore Almond Ramage (1892‚Äì1963) in 1927. Like his mother she was the daughter of a Scottish Presbyterian minister, although she herself was born in Victoria, Australia. Despite their advancing years (the couple had a combined age of around 100) they had two children: (Ernest) Neil (1928‚Äì2009) and David (1935‚Äì2011). Albert Kitson died in Beaconsfield on 8 March 1937 of broncho- pneumonia and influenza. Sir Albert Kitson is sometimes wrongly referred to as Sir Arthur Kitson or Sir Alfred Kitson. He is also sometimes confused with his contemporary Albert Kitson, 2nd Baron Airdale (1863‚Äì1944) who does not appear to be related.
