The film features an ensemble cast including Krishna, Jagga Rao, Ramana Panthulu, R. Ranga Rao, Raja Babu, Vijaya Nirmala, Allu Venkateswarlu and Chalapathi Rao. It is based on Ramana's 1959 story of the same name which itself was inspired by the 1952 American film High Noon. In Sakshi, a naive and bucolic boatman is exploited by society and turns into a hard-hearted person. Sakshi, the directorial debut of Bapu (who also worked as art director), was the first Telugu film to be shot completely in outdoor locations, with filming taking place in Pulidindi, a village located on the banks of the Godavari River. It was the acting debut of Ranga Rao, who later prefixed the film's title to his name. The entire film was completed in less than 20 days. Sakshi was released on 1 July 1967. Although many people in the Telugu film industry believed the film would not run for even 20 days in theatres, it ran for almost a month and became a profitable venture, besides receiving critical acclaim. It was later screened at the Tashkent film festival in 1968, where it was also well received.  Plot  Kishtaiah is a naive and bucolic boatman living in Dachampaadu, an islet in the Godavari belt. In the same area lives Fakir, a dreaded criminal. The village head, known by his title Munasabu, hires Fakir as his lorry driver to transport coconuts to the town. The only person Fakir cares for in the village is his sister Chukka. He abandons Ratthi, a woman who was madly in love with him. Kishtaiah's uncle Gourayya and his fellow guard are murdered by Fakir when trying to stop him from stealing coconuts from Munasabus garden. As Kishtaiah is the sole witness to these murders, the village elders force him to testify against Fakir in court. Fakir is arrested, but vows revenge. He escapes from prison, and no villager gives Kishtaiah shelter. Chukka marries Kishtaiah, in the hope that her brother would not kill him. Fakir is unaware of this and attacks Kishtaiah, who eventually abandons his naive persona and kills Fakir. All the villagers who earlier shunned Kishtaiah now surround him, but Kishtaiah, disgusted with their selfish behaviour, leaves the village and surrenders to the police.  Cast  * Krishna as Kishtaiah * Jagga Rao as Fakir * Ramana Panthulu as Munasabu * R. Ranga Rao as Karanam * Raja Babu as Munasabus son * Vijaya Nirmala as Chukka * Vijaya Lalitha as Ratthi * Allu Venkateswarlu as Gopi * Chalapathi Rao as Gourayya  Production  = Development = Sakshi was a story written by Mullapudi Venkata Ramana and published in the 28 October 1959 issue of Andhra Patrika, a weekly newspaper. The story was inspired by the American film High Noon (1952), retaining the plot element of a man sending a dreaded criminal to prison, and the criminal vowing revenge. For his directorial debut, Ramana's friend Bapu decided to adapt Sakshi. The film adaptation was produced by Suresh Kumar and Seshagiri Rao under Nandana Films. P. N. Selvaraj was chosen as the cinematographer at Bapu's suggestion. Bapu also worked as art director alongside Bhavaraju Seetharamudu, an engineer who helped the unit by laying new roads. Ramana wrote the film's dialogue, with most of it being in Rajahmundry dialect. Satyam handled the editing. = Casting = Krishna was cast as the male lead Kishtaiah, Jagga Rao as the antagonist Fakir and Ramana Panthulu as Munasabu. R. Ranga Rao was cast as Karanam in his acting debut, and later became known as Sakshi Ranga Rao. Raja Babu was cast as Munasabus son. Krishna's future wife Vijaya Nirmala was cast as the female lead Chukka, and this was the first film where they acted together. Vijaya Lalitha was cast as Fakir's initial love interest Ratthi, Allu Ramalingaiah's son Venkateswarlu as Munasabu's grandson Gopi, and Chalapathi Rao as Kishtaiah's uncle Gourayya. = Filming = Before the commencement of principal photography, Bapu took lessons on how to deal with close-up, mid-close-up and long shots from Kabir Das. Sakshi became the first Telugu film to be shot completely in outdoor locations. Pulidindi, a village located on the banks of the Godavari River, was chosen as the shooting location. According to Nirmala, after each day's shoot ended, Bapu \\"used to draw lines of his next day's shooting. He always drew his thoughts on paper so that everyone was comfortable when the shooting started.\\" The scene depicting Kishtaiah and Chukka's marriage was shot at the Meesala Krishnudu temple of Pulidindi. The entire film was completed in less than 20 days.  Themes  The Encyclopaedia of Indian Cinema calls Sakshi \\"a rare instance of late 60s New Indian Cinema aestheticism in Telugu\\". According to The Hindus Srivathsan Nadadhur, \\"The film not only lays importance on the crime angle, but also emphasises the need for humans to stand up for each other in times of crisis.\\"  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by K. V. Mahadevan.  Release and reception  Sakshi was released on 1 July 1967. It was publicised via posters with the tagline \\"20 rojullo teesina chitram\\" (the film which was shot in less than 20 days), and rival producer Aluri Chakrapani caustically commented, \\"20 rojullo teeste 20 rojule aaduddi\\" (the film will only run 20 days), a view shared by many others in the Telugu film industry. Despite this, the film received critical acclaim and ran for nearly a month, recovering its investment and making a marginal profit. It was later screened at the Tashkent film festival in 1968, where it was also well received.

Tsuda is shown to be under immense stress due to having to support both himself and his fianc√©, Hizuru, who quit her job after they became engaged. One day, Hizuru invites Kojima into Tsuda's apartment. Kojima comes onto Hizuru, who rejects him. Still, Tsuda finds out and becomes enraged at Kojima, but Kojima beats Tsuda badly and humiliates him in front of Hizuru. Hizuru is intrigued by the animalistic Kojima, and, after a confrontation in a restaurant with Tsuda, breaks up with him and moves in with Kojima. She also starts to pierce herself and get tattoos. She wants to box, but is denied that life by the surprisingly cowardly Kojima, who says she is a scary freak of a woman. Tsuda still has feelings for Hizuru, and he keeps trying to win her back, leading to a confrontation where they bond by beating each other's faces to a pulp (Tsuda ends up badly mutilated in the process). In the end, Kojima and Tsuda have a sparring match in their boxing club, in which leads Kojima beats Tsuda to near death. Afterwards, Kojima goes on to fight a real boxing match while Tsuda is in the hospital being treated for wounds to his eye. Meanwhile, Hizuru has gone overboard with the piercings and has implanted several metal bars in her body. Kojima wins the match, but he has been pushed past his limit and his face is shown to be unrecognizable because of injuries.

Ancient Roman historiography and Italian historiography until the fascist period used to call the various processes the \\"civilizing of barbarians\\". Characteristics The Roman Empire at its greatest extent Acculturation proceeded from the top down, with the upper classes adopting Roman culture first and the old ways lingering for the longest among peasants in outlying countryside and rural areas.The identification of countryfolk as pagani is discussed at paganism. Hostages played an important part in this process, as elite children, from Mauretania to Gaul, were taken to be raised and educated in Rome.Leonard A. Curchin, The Romanization of Central Spain: complexity, diversity, and change in a Provincial Hintellrfreshsrland, 2004, p. 130. Ancient Roman historiography and traditional Italian historiography confidently identified the different processes involved with a \\"civilization of barbarians\\". Modern historians take a more nuanced view: by making their peace with Rome, local elites could make their position more secure and reinforce their prestige. New themes include the study of personal and group values and the construction of identity, which is the personal aspect of ethnogenesis. The transitions operated differently in different provinces; as Blagg and Millett point outT. F. C. Blagg and M. Millett, eds., The Early Roman Empire in the West 1999, p. 43. even a Roman province may be too broad a canvas to generalize. One characteristic of cultural Romanization was the creation of many hundreds of Roman coloniae in the territory of the Roman Republic and the subsequent Roman Empire. Until Trajan, colonies were created by using retired veteran soldiers, mainly from the Italian peninsula, who promoted Roman customs and laws, with the use of Latin. It has been estimated that at the beginning of the empire, about 750,000 Italians lived in the provinces.Scheidel, \\"Demography\\", 49-50, 64, 64 n. 114, citing P. A. Brunt, Italian Manpower 225 B.C.‚ÄìA.D. 14 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1987), 263. Julius Caesar, Mark Anthony and Octavian settled many of their veterans in colonies: in Italy, and the provinces. The colonies that were established in Italy until 14 BCE have been studied by Keppie (1983). In his account of the achievements of his long reign, Res Gestae Divi Augusti, Augustus stated that he had settled 120,000 soldiers in twenty colonies in Italy in 31 BCE, then 100,000 men in colonies in Spain and southern Gaul in 14 BCE, followed by another 96,000 in 2 BCE.Pat Southern - The Roman Army: A Social and Institutional History (2006/Oxford Uni.) Brian Campbell also states \\"From 49 to 32 BCE about 420,000 Italians were recruited\\", which would thus be the veteran (citizen) stock that was largely sent to the provinces (colonies) during Augustus. The Lex Calpurnia, however, also allowed citizenship to be granted for distinguished bravery. For example, the 1,000 socii from Camerinum after Vercellae 101 BCE (Plutarch Mar. XXXVIII) and the auxiliary (later Legio XXII Deiotariana) after Zela, got Roman citizenship. By the time of Augustus, the legions consisted mostly of ethnic Latins/Italics and Cisalpine Gauls.B. Campbell The Roman Army, 31 BC‚ÄìAD 337 p.9 However, Romanization did not always result in the extinction of all aspects of native cultures even when there was extensive acculturation. Many non-Latin provincial languages survived the entire period while sustaining considerable Latin influence, including the ancestor languages of Welsh, Albanian, Basque and Berber. Where there was language replacement, in some cases, such as Italy, it took place in the early imperial stage, while in others, native languages only totally succumbed to Latin after the fall of the Empire, as was likely the case with Gaulish. The Gaulish language is thought to have survived into the 6th century in France, despite considerable Romanization of the local material culture. The last record of spoken Gaulish deemed to be plausibly credible was when Gregory of Tours wrote in the 6th century (c. 560-575) that a shrine in Auvergne which \\"is called Vasso Galatae in the Gallic tongue\\" was destroyed and burnt to the ground.Hist. Franc., book I, 32 Veniens vero Arvernos, delubrum illud, quod Gallica lingua Vasso Galat√¶ vocant, incendit, diruit, atque subvertit. And coming to Clermont [to the Arverni] he set on fire, overthrew and destroyed that shrine which they call Vasso Galat√¶ in the Gallic tongue. Coexisting with Latin, Gaulish helped shape the Vulgar Latin dialects that developed into French, with effects including loanwords and calques (including oui, the word for \\"yes\\"), sound changes,Henri Guiter, \\"Sur le substrat gaulois dans la Romania\\", in Munus amicitae. Studia linguistica in honorem Witoldi Manczak septuagenarii, eds., Anna Bochnakowa & Stanislan Widlak, Krakow, 1995.Eugeen Roegiest, Vers les sources des langues romanes: Un itin√©raire linguistique √† travers la Romania (Leuven, Belgium: Acco, 2006), 83. and influences in conjugation and word order. Process All that led to many gradual developments. The very existence is a source of contention among modern archaeologists.Mattingly, D. J., 2004, \\"Being Roman: Expressing Identity in a provincial setting\\", Journal of Roman Archaeology Vol. 17, pp 5‚Äì26 One of the first approaches, which now can be regarded as the \\"traditional\\" approach, was taken by Francis Haverfield.Haverfield, F., 1912, The Romanization of Roman Britain, Oxford: Claredon Press He saw this process beginning in primarily post-conquest societies (such as Britain and Gaul), where direct Roman policy from the top promoted an increase in the Roman population of the province through the establishment of veteran colonies. The coloniae would have spoken Latin and been citizens of Rome following their army tenure (See Roman citizenship). Haverfield thus assumes this would have a Romanising effect upon the native communities. This thought process, fueled though it was by early 20th century standards of imperialism and cultural change, forms the basis for the modern understanding of Romanization. However, recent scholarship has devoted itself to providing alternate models of how native populations adopted Roman culture and has questioned the extent to which it was accepted or resisted. #Non-Interventionist ModelMillet, M., 1990, \\"Romanization: historical issues and archaeological interpretation\\", in Blagg, T. and Millett, M. (Eds.), The Early Roman Empire in the West, Oxford: Oxbow Books, pp. 35‚Äì44 ‚Äì Native elites were encouraged to increase social standing through association with the powerful conqueror be it in dress, language, housing and food consumption. That provides them with associated power. The establishment of a civil administration system is quickly imposed to solidify the permanence of Roman rule. #Discrepant IdentityMattingly, D. J., 2004, \\"Being Roman: Expressing Identity in a provincial setting\\", Journal of Roman Archaeology Vol. 17, pp. 13 ‚Äì No uniformity of identity that can accurately be described as traditional Romanization. Fundamental differences within a province are visible through economics, religion and identity. Not all provincials supported Rome and not all elites wanted to be like the Roman upper classes. #AcculturationWebster, J., 1997 \\"Necessary Comparisons: A Post-Colonial Approach to Religious Syncretism in the Roman Provinces\\", World Archaeology Vol 28 No 3, pp. 324‚Äì338 ‚Äì Aspects of both Native and Roman cultures are joined together., as can be seen in the Roman acceptance, and adoption of, non-Classical religious practices. The inclusion of Isis, Epona, Britannia and Dolichenus into the pantheon are evidence. #CreolizationWebster, J., 2001, \\"Creolizing the Roman Provinces\\", American Journal of Archaeology Vol 105 No. 2, pp. 209‚Äì225, ‚Äì Romanization occurs as a result of negotiation between different elements of non-egalitarian societies and so material culture is ambiguous. Legacy Romance languages in Europe Roman names were adopted. The Latin language was spread, which was greatly facilitated by the fact that many cultures were mostly oral (particularly for the Gauls and Iberians). Anyone in the Western Mediterranean who wanted to deal (through writing) with the bureaucracy and/or with the Roman market had to write in Latin. Meanwhile, in the eastern half of the Empire, the Roman authorities generally used Greek, which largely kept its position as lingua franca and continued to spread to new areas- although Latin did became prominent in certain areas around new veteran colonies like Berytus. The extent of the adoption of Latin and Greek is subject to ongoing debate, as the native languages were certainly spoken after the conquests. The ancient tribal laws were replaced by Roman law, with its institutions of property rights. Typically-Roman institutions, such as public baths, the imperial cult and gladiator fights, were adopted. Gradually, the conquered would see themselves as Romans. The process was supported by the Roman Republic and then by the Roman Empire. The entire process was facilitated by the Indo-European origin of most of the languages and by the similarity of the gods of many ancient cultures. They also already had had trade relations and contacts with one another through the seafaring Mediterranean cultures like the Phoenicians and the Greeks. Romanization was effective in the western half of the empire, where native civilizations were weaker. In the Hellenized east, ancient civilizations like those of Ancient Egypt, Judea and Syria, partly resisted some of its effects. When the Empire was divided, the east, with mainly Greek culture, continued to Romanise. Its citizens continued to regard themselves as Romans, and in later centuries even the Greek language became known as \\"Romaic\\". While Britain certainly was Romanized, its approximation to the Roman culture seems to have been smaller than that of Gaul. The most romanized regions, as demonstrated by Dott. Bernward Tewes and Barbara Woitas of the computing center of the Catholic University Eichst√§tt-Ingolstadt, were Italy, the Iberian Peninsula, Gaul, southern Germany and Dalmatia. Romanization in most of those regions remains such a powerful cultural influence in most aspects of life today that they are described as \\"Latin countries\\" and \\"Latin American countries\\". That is most evident in European countries in which Romance languages are spoken and former colonies that have inherited the languages and other Roman influences. According to Theodor Mommsen, cultural Romanisation was more complete in those areas that developed a \\"neolatin language\\" (like Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Romanian). The same process later developed in the recent centuries' colonial empires.

He is also known as the founder and publisher, with his wife Kim Betancourt, of Wildside Press in 1989. In 1998, they entered the print on demand (PoD) market and greatly expanded their production. In addition to publishing new novels and short stories, they have undertaken projects to publish new editions of collections of stories that appeared in historic magazines. Prior to establishing the new business, Betancourt worked as an assistant editor at Amazing Stories and editor of Horror: The Newsmagazine of the Horror Field, the revived Weird Tales magazine, the first issue of H. P. Lovecraft's Magazine of Horror (which he subsequently hired Marvin Kaye to edit), Cat Tales magazine (which he subsequently hired George H. Scithers to edit), and Adventure Tales magazine. He worked as a Senior Editor for Byron Preiss Visual Publications (1989‚Äì1996) and iBooks. Betancourt wrote four Star Trek novels and the new Chronicles of Amber prequel series, as well as a dozen original novels. His essays, articles, and reviews have appeared in such diverse publications as Writer's Digest, The Washington Post, and Amazing Stories. Early life Betancourt's father is Felipe Pablo \\"Philip\\" Betancourt, an archeologist. His brother Michael Betancourt became a critical theorist. When he was a child, the Betancourt family spent summers in Greece, especially Crete, where his father worked on the excavation at Kommos in the 1970s, and Pseira in the 1980s. There the younger Betancourt developed a love for reading and discovered such diverse writers as Clark Ashton Smith, Michael Moorcock, and Jack Vance through books imported from the United Kingdom. He said of this time, \\"When I ran out of stories, I made up my own to keep myself entertained. I can trace the impulse to become a writer to age fourteen, when I spent most of a summer writing sequels to classics like Treasure Island.\\" Betancourt's first published work was a poem, \\"The Argia,\\" in Space & Time magazine at age 15. At age 16, he made his first professional sale, \\"Vernon's Dragon,\\" to the anthology 100 Great Fantasy Short-Short Stories, edited by Isaac Asimov, John F. Carr, and Martin H. Greenberg. He began The Blind Archer, at age 17, finished it at age 18, and sold it to Avon Books as his debut novel at age 19. He graduated from Temple University with a Bachelor of Arts. Career Betancourt has alternated between writing and editing throughout his career. He worked for Amazing Stories as an assistant editor from 1985 to 1987. When the Philadelphia office shut down, he co-founded a literary agency with George Scithers and Darrell Schweitzer. A year later, Betancourt, Scithers, and Schweitzer licensed the name Weird Tales from Weird Tales, Ltd. and revived the magazine. Betancourt worked as an editor there until 1990. Betancourt married Kim Betancourt (n√©e Hermo) in 1990, and they moved from Philadelphia to Newark, New Jersey. He founded Wildside Press in 1989 to publish a collection of essays by Fritz Leiber designed to commemorate Leiber's appearance as Principal Speaker at Philcon that year. The book, Fafhrd & Me sold out quickly, and Betancourt decided to publish additional titles as a hobby. Betancourt was named science fiction editor for Byron Preiss Visual Publications in 1990. He worked for Byron Preiss for 7 years, rising to Senior Editor, before leaving to write full-time and take care of his and Kim Betancourt's first child. This marked the beginning of his most prolific period as an author. Betancourt also continued to publish books through Wildside Press during this period, using local short-run printers and Pulphouse Publishing to print new titles. Some of the limited editions, particularly titles by Mike Resnick, are impressive efforts. The limited editions of Resnick's Lucifer Jones series are bound in such exotic materials as Spanish cork, French leopard-patterned cloth, and leather. The limited editions he published of Bradley Denton's two short story collections are bound in Spanish snakeskin-patterned cloth and elephant-hide paper. The lettered editions have mahogany slipcases. The Denton collections won a World Fantasy Award for Best Collection of the Year. In Autumn 2005, the husband- and-wife team of DNA Publications sold Weird Tales to Betancourt. Betancourt has continued to publish Weird Tales through Wildside Press. In 2006 he hired Stephen H. Segal as Editorial Director of the magazine; Segal subsequently recruited Ann VanderMeer as Fiction Editor. In 2009, Segal and VanderMeer won a Hugo Award for Weird Tales in the category of Best Semiprozine. The magazine was also nominated for a 2009 World Fantasy Award. Print on demand In 1998, Betancourt discovered print on demand technology, which produces one book at a time. He became a pioneer in the field, bringing hundreds (eventually thousands) of books into print through PoD. Betancourt incorporated Wildside Press in 2004 and continued to expand the company, as gross annual sales continued to grow. As of January 2010, Wildside Press had more than 11,000 books in print, ranging from classic literature to genre titles by H. Beam Piper, John W. Campbell, Jr., Andre Norton, and others. Wildside Press took up an increasing amount of his time, though Betancourt still managed to produce one novel and several short stories most years. He brought in genre writers and editors to work on Wildside Press projects. Employees in the 2000‚Äì07 period included such authors and editors as P.D. Cacek, Darrell Schweitzer, George H. Scithers, Vera Nazarian, Stephen H. Segal, and Sean Wallace. In 2006, Betancourt partnered with AudioRealms to release new and classic science fiction, fantasy, and horror in Audiobook format. Initial releases included H. Beam Piper's Little Fuzzy and Andre Norton's The Time Traders, as well as works by Robert E. Howard and H.P. Lovecraft. At the same time, Betancourt created a new mass-market paperback line, Cosmos Books, with Dorchester Publishing. In 2007, Betancourt received the Black Orchid Novella Award from the Nero Wolfe Society (the \\"Wolfe Pack\\") and Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine for his novella \\"Horse Pit.\\" The award, which consisted of a certificate, a prize of $1,000, and publication in the magazine, was presented at the Wolfe Pack's annual Black Orchid Banquet on December 1, 2007. John Gregory Betancourt lives in Maryland with his wife Kim and two sons.

The film stars Sreedhar, Sangeeta, Rao Gopal Rao, Mukkamala, Allu Ramalingaiah and Nutan Prasad. The film has garnered two National Film Awards. The film recorded as blockbuster at the box office. Rao Gopal Rao received wide-spread acclaim for his role.http://www.hindu.com/2010/06/02/stories/2010060260790300.htmhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0155893/ The film was remade in Hindi as Jeevan Jyoti (1976). Plot Raja Rao Bahadur (Kanta Rao) is the head of a wealthy and charitable landlord family who has a young son Sreedhar. At his son's request, Rao helps his college friend (Hari) with the costs of higher education abroad. Hari is grateful and invites Sreedhar to his sister Laxmi's (Sangeeta) wedding in the village. Due to unusual circumstances, Sreedhar ends up marrying Lakshmi. This enrages Mukkamala who is the Raja's brother-in-law, who was hopeful of getting his daughter (Jaya Malini) married to Sreedhar. What makes matters worse is that Laxmi wins over the royal household with her humility and good nature while Sreedhar falls in love with her innocence. She accidentally discovers a stash of the estate jewels in a well. Gurunatham and Mukkamala try to implicate the Priest. Laxmi suggests that since they do not know conclusively as to who stole jewels, they should spare the Priest. Mukkamala, at the suggestion of the estate manager Joginatham (Allu Ramalingiah), then approaches Contractor (Rao Gopala Rao). Contractor agrees to break up the couple. But Contractor eyes the entire estate and its valuables and he entrap Mukkamala. He uses Kishtaiyya (Nutan Prasad) and creates suspicion in Sreedhar's mind with a sinister plan. Sreedhar falls prey to his doubts, comes to the conclusion that Laxmi is cheating on him and is only interested in his wealth. He sends off pregnant Laxmi with all the family jewels. Laxmi gives the jewels off to Joginatham and decides to end her life. She is rescued by the Priest at whose house she gives birth to twins (a boy and a girl). Meanwhile, back at the estate, Sreedhar is depressed and loses interest in life and curses out Mukkamala when he proposes that Sreedhar should marry his daughter. The contractor then fixes up Kishtayya with Jaya Malini and proceeds to squeeze Mukkamala out of his money. After that, he takes possession of several antiques that Joginatham was trying to sell. All that's left is the Deity's Jewels. The Raja who is distraught with the whole lifeless situation of the estate decides to leave the Deity's Jewels in the temple itself and wanders the villages. He stumbles upon Laxmi's kids (his grandkids), discovers the truth and requests Laxmi to come back. Laxmi refuses to come back and declares that this does not work with recommendations and that Sreedhar himself has to accept his mistake and come to her and ask her to come back. The Raja with the help of the kids and Sreedhar's friend hatch a plan to set things right with Sreedhar and beat the Contractor at his own game.

She is often described as France's greatest ballerina, and was the coach of prima ballerinas Sylvie Guillem and Marie-Claude Pietragalla. She was awarded the L√©gion d'Honneur in 1964. Early life Yvonne Chauvir√© was born in Paris on 22 April 1917. Aged 10, in 1927, she entered the Paris Opera Ballet school, and at the age of 12 she was noticed for her performance in the children's ballet L'Eventail de Jeanne (\\"Jeanne's Fan\\"). When she was 13, she was invited to join the opera's ballet company. Career Chauvir√© rose through the ranks of dancers at the Paris Opera Ballet, becoming principal dancer in 1937 and √©toile, the highest rank, in 1941. She was the star of a number of experimental works choreographed by the company's director Serge Lifar, including Alexandre le Grand, Istar, Suite en Blanc and Les Mirages. Lifar also encouraged her to study with two Russian choreographers Boris Kniaseff and Victor Gsovsky, who influenced her style towards lyricism and away from her hard-lined academic training. Although never a pupil of Carlotta Zambelli's, Chauvir√© later admitted that she spent a great deal of time watching Zambelli teach and learnt to copy her techniques and movements and then to make them her own. Lifar was forced to leave the company in 1945 after being accused of supporting Germany during World War II and the following year Chauvir√© also left, following Lifar to his newly-formed company, the Nouveau Ballet de Monte-Carlo. In 1947 both Lifar and Chauvir√© returned to the Paris Opera Ballet; however, Chauvir√© left again in 1949 due to contractual disagreements with the company over her freedom to dance with other companies. She performed in a range of productions, including two made by her former teacher Gsovsky: Grand pas classique, for the Ballets des Champs-Elys√©es, and La Dame aux cam√©lias, for the Berlin Ballet. In 1953 the Paris Opera Ballet agreed to a more flexible contract and she returned to the company but continued to dance as a guest performer with companies in Europe, the United States, South Africa and Latin America. She often danced with Rudolf Nureyev, who described her as a \\"legend\\", and also danced with MƒÅris Liepa and Erik Bruhn. During this time she widened her range of roles and began to perform in more classical productions such as Giselle, Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker. The role of Giselle became a particular passion for Chauvir√©, and she considered it her signature piece. Chauvir√© retired from the Paris Opera Ballet in 1956, but continued to appear with the company until 1972. She was also co-director of the Paris Opera Ballet school from 1963‚Äì68, and taught Sylvie Guillem and Marie-Claude Pietragalla. She choreographed some short ballets herself. In 1970, she became Director of the International Academy of Dance, in Paris. In a 1989 interview, she characterised contemporary style as becoming \\"more and more slipshod\\", and criticised the fashion for \\"extreme\\" ballet movements as risking injury to the dancer. She said she had tried during her career, \\"to simplify, within the greatest technical difficulty\\". In 1992, Chauvir√© served as an inaugural juror for the International Dance Association's Prix Benois de la Danse competition. =Publications= Chauvir√© published two autobiographies in her lifetime: in 1960, a book titled Je suis ballerine, and in 1997, with Gerard Mannoni, Yvette Chauvir√© ‚Äì Autobiographie. =Film roles= In 1937, Chauvir√© performed in Jean Beno√Æt-L√©vy's film La Mort du Cygne (\\"The Death of the Swan\\"), which told the story of a young girl who aspires to become a ballet dancer. The film received the Grand Prix du Film Francais at the 1937 Paris Exposition and was released in the United States the following year under the title Ballerina. Chauvir√© became a star in the United States, and was featured on the cover of Life magazine in December 1938. In 1988, the film was rediscovered and screened in New York with Chauvir√© as a commentator. Chauvir√© was also the subject of a documentary film produced by Dominique Delouche, Yvette Chauvir√©: une √©toile pour l'example, which was screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 1983. The film shows coaching sessions between Chauvir√© and younger ballerinas, such as Dominique Khalfouni, as well as archival footage of her performances. =Honours= * Chevalier of Ordre of the Legion of Honnour,in 1964. * Commander of Ordre of the Legion of Honnour, 24 mars 1988. * Grand officer of Ordre of the Legion of Honnour, 13 juillet 20105. * Commander of National Order of Merit, 22 juin 1994. * Grand cross of National Order of Merit, 10 novembre 1997. * Commander of Ordre of Arts and Letters.

It was first presented as a concept car at the North American International Auto Show in 2006 and the production version was shown at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show. Aston Martin Rapide concept at the 2006 North American International Auto Show The Rapide name is a reference to the Lagonda Rapide, a five-door, four-seater saloon produced by Lagonda, now a part of Aston Martin. The new Rapide is the company's first 5-door fastback saloon since the Lagonda which was discontinued in 1990. The Rapide is based on the DB9 and is underpinned by the Aston Martin VH platform. The first cars rolled off the production line in May 2010,Pal Tan First Aston Martin Rapide rolls out from Austrian factory at PaulTan.org, 10 May 2010 initially built at a dedicated plant at the Magna Steyr facility in Graz, Austria. The factory initially planned to build 2,000 cars per year, but production was relocated to England in 2012 after sales did not meet production targets. The Rapide was replaced by the DBX crossover SUV in 2020.  Models  =Rapide (2010‚Äì2013)= Specifications The Rapide is powered by a V12 engine, generating a maximum power output and torque of . The car is rear-wheel drive and has a 6-speed Touchtronic II automatic transmission. The Rapide can attain a top speed of , and can accelerate from 0 to in 5.2 seconds. Equipment The Rapide's standard features include a tilt-telescoping steering wheel, bi-xenon headlamps and LED taillamps. Leather and walnut wood trim with metallic accents; power front seats with memory, cooling and heating systems; Bluetooth; satellite radio (US version only); with USB and iPod connectivity. Other standard features include a Bang & Olufsen 16-speaker sound system with two tweeters that rise from the dashboard on activation of the system.  Design  The Rapide was designed by stretching the design of the DB9 in order to accommodate an extra set of doors. Aston Martin design director, Marek Reichman has described a thoroughbred race horse as an inspiration, stating that he wanted muscles in the design to be visible through the skin. The side windows of the car were made to appear like a single unit by using a black B pillar. The roof was designed to be as low as possible so it would mimic the design language of Aston Martin's model lineup. Due to the usage of swan doors and a low roof, the car is difficult for the accommodation of tall people. By comparison, the Porsche Panamera, a competitor of the Rapide, is 2.3 inches taller. The rear flanks of the car are wider than those on the DB9, thus smoothening the extended roof design. The rear fenders and a curvaceous design language prevent the car as being perceived as stretched. The car makes use of rear lights and diffusers from the Vantage while the front headlamps are unique to the model. Although they would find use on the later Vanquish and the facelift DB9. =Rapide S (2013‚Äì2018)= Rapide S Specifications The Rapide S succeeded the standard Rapide in 2013. The AM11 V12 engine is upgraded and now has a power output of and torque of . Performance improvements include a top speed of and acceleration from 0 to reduced to 4.9 seconds. Carbon dioxide emissions are reduced by 23g/km to 332g/km. The Rapide S received further revisions in 2014, with a new 8-speed Touchtronic III automatic transmission. It also used the AM29 V12 engine, with a power output of and of torque, resulting in an acceleration of 0 to in 4.4 seconds and an increased top speed of . =Rapide E (2019)= 2019 Aston Martin Rapide E at the Aston Martin Lagonda factory, Gaydon In 2015, Aston Martin was reported to be working on an all-electric version of the Rapide. The model named RapidE was confirmed for production at the 2018 Frankfurt Motor Show, the company revealed that the RapidE would go into production in the fourth quarter of 2019. The RapidE is expected to rival Porsche's upcoming Taycan electric saloon. One hundred and fifty-five examples of the model would be produced at Aston Martin's dedicated production facility located in St Athan, Wales where future all-electric Lagonda models will also be produced. Williams Advanced Engineering would be providing R&D; assist in the protype building and testing process with close involvement from interested customers. Aston Martin RapidE Showcar at Top Marques Monaco 2019 The RapidE will be powered by a 65 kWh battery supplied by HyperBat Limited; a new joint venture between WAE and Unipart manufacturing group. The battery would be capable of 800-volt power transfers. Five thousand six hundred lithium-ion electric cells would be fitted in the engine bay along with two electric motors supplied by Integral Powertrain at the rear. Both of the motors will drive the car via an Xtrac transmission featuring a limited- slip differential. A new suspension system will be implemented to better cope with the changes in the drive train. The two electric motors will have a combined power output of and of torque. The car will have claimed acceleration figures of in sub-4.0 seconds' time and in 1.5 seconds, along with a top speed of . Maximum performance will be accessible regardless of battery charge. A prototype was tested at the Nurb√ºrgring to ensure that the car delivers linear power despite hard usage.

Production Aston Martin opted to end its production by sub- contractor Magna Steyr in the middle of 2012, six years earlier than expected. Production of the car was also halted temporarily in May 2011. In the face of a diminishing market for luxury saloons, and to match output to shrinking sales, Aston Martin had to cut annual production from 2,000 to 1,250 in June 2011 ‚Äî and was prepared to go as low as 500 annually.

Rapide sales were a fraction of Aston Martin's more popular Vantage and Vanquish nameplates. Motorsports A Rapide S was entered in the 2010 24 Hours of N√ºrburgring. Drivers included then Aston Martin CEO Ulrich Bez. It finished second in the SP 8 class. This Rapide S was powered by a new technology introduced by Alset GmbH, a Hybrid Hydrogen system that enables the car to use hydrogen and petrol individually or at the same time in an internal combustion engine. The Rapide S was the first car to race the 24 Hours of N√ºrburgring with hydrogen fuel.

Selective in its intake, the school is notable for its celebrity alumni, including Amy Winehouse, Adele, Jessie J, Leona Lewis, Katie Melua, Joivan Wade, Cush Jumbo, Loyle Carner, Kate Nash, Black Midi and Tom Holland. Established in 1991 under the CTC programme, the school is funded by the British Government with support from the British Record Industry Trust and maintains an independent school status from the local education authority. The school is remarkable as being one of only three performing arts and technology schools in the country that are free to attend. History Mark Featherstone-Witty had been inspired by Alan Parker's 1980s film Fame to create a secondary school specialising in the performing arts. By the time he started trying to raise money through the School for Performing Arts Trust (SPA), he had refined a novel integrated curriculum. He approached Sir Richard Branson to be the project champion who agreed, on the condition that other record companies chipped in. As it happened, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) were concerned with home taping and realised they had no political influence to bring the necessary pressure to bear. The then Conservative government needed to give impetus to their flagging City Technology College scheme. For nearly 30 years, the BRIT School has been the beneficiary of funding from the British record industry, with a substantial annual contribution from the proceeds of the Brit Awards, administered via the record industry's charity, the BRIT Trust.The BRIT School Celebrates Twenty Years of Success, 22 September 2011 BPI.

Canada's large land mass and coastline make it very susceptible to any climate changes, so any contemporary changes of climate in the country are of national concern. Of the factors caused by human intervention that can affect this environment, activities that sustain the economy of Canada such as oil and gas extraction, mining, forestry and fishing are influential. The increase in greenhouse gas emissions in Canada between 1990 and 2015 was mainly due to larger emissions from mining, oil, and gas extraction and transport. In 2011 United Nations said Canada's environment was the best in the world. Several governmental programs have been created to mitigate 20th and 21st century climate change, such as the One-Tonne Challenge. In late 2005 Canada hosted the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Montreal, Quebec. Hundreds of environmental organizations have been founded in Canada. Environmental Political Power On October 21st, 2019 Canada held a Federal election which resulted in the Liberal Party of Canada (LPC) being able to form a minority government with 157 deputies. The balance of power is held by the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) at 121 deputies, the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois (BQ) at 32 deputies, and the New Democratic Party (NDP) at 24 deputies. A government in Canada requires at least 170 deputies to pass legislation, therefore the LPC will need at least one of the above-mentioned parties to pass environmental legislation. Based on the 2019 party platforms a few policy outcomes become possible. The LPC‚Äôs carbon tax has a chance of remaining since both the NDP and the BQ support a version of it. Meanwhile, a ban on single-use plastics, forming a plan for reforestation and formally protecting some of Canada‚Äôs land and oceans is supported by both the LPC and the NDP. Also, a promise to end fossil fuel subsidies is supported by the LPC, the NDP, and the BQ. While all parties have said that they were committed to the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement, pipeline plans remain because the LPC and the CPC both support some pipelines (with NDP ambiguity regarding an LNG project in British Columbia). Environmental Landscape The environmental landscape of Canada can be classified through its 15 terrestrial and 5 marine ecozones, 53 ecoprovinces, 194 ecoregions, and 1021 ecodistricts. Canada has a variety of forest regions (especially throughout British Columbia and Alberta), possessing 9% (347 million hectares) of the world‚Äôs total forest land and 24% of the world‚Äôs boreal forest land. There are eight forest regions in Canada: Acadian, Boreal, Carolinian (Deciduous), Coast, Columbia, Great Lakes-St Lawrence, Montane, and Subalpine. In terms of iconic wildlife, the beaver became Canada‚Äôs official emblem in 1975 for its historical significance in the fur trade. Other iconic wildlife include the Canada goose, the moose, and the polar bear. Environmental Education Education is a key factor in order to improve environmental situation. Therefore, in Canada is easy to find different centers and institutions in which people can learn more about the environment. For instance, the Ministry of Ontario has developed a program that consists of teaching students to create a sustainable future, not only at school but also in their daily life. There are different associations in which those who are interested in the environment can learn and go more deeply in this area. The aim of this institution is to provide more information from different perspectives. Environmental careers center of Canada (ECO) offers many different kinds of programs, from post-secondary Environmental Education in Canada to undergraduates students have also the possibility to study a bachelor degree in Environmental Practices from Royal Roads University and propose certificates for adults as well. The main purpose is to create environmental professionals.

He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University in 1903. Biography Several trips to Arizona between 1906 and 1917 permanently captured his interest in the archaeology and ethnology of the American southwest. Throughout the 1920s Fulton regularly traveled in the Arizona from his home in New England, exploring the mountains, as well as the canyons and mesa country seeking evidence of past occupation by earlier cultures that had inhabited the area. On one of his visits he was introduced to Texas Canyon with its unique geology and tales of prehistoric settlements. Fulton purchased about in Texas Canyon calling it the ‚ÄúFF Ranch‚Äù in 1930. He built a home in the canyon in 1931. As early as 1929, Fulton began to excavate archaeological sites on the property in Arizona. Fulton was asked to become a director of the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation in New York City in 1934, and it was under the auspices of this organization that he published his Archaeological Notes on Texas Canyon, Arizona. By 1936, Fulton‚Äôs collection of ethnographic and archaeological materials had become so large that a small three-room museum and workroom was built on the ranch property to house it. With the establishment of the Amerind Foundation in 1937, Fulton became fully committed to supporting research into North America's prehistoric past. With Fulton as director, and with his generous financial support, the Amerind Foundation continued to expand. The Amerind Foundation sponsored several major archaeological excavations in the Southwest and northern Mexico throughout the 1950s, resulting in a number of publications, and in 1959, the Fulton-Hayden Memorial Library and Art Museum became the most recent addition to the burgeoning Amerind Foundation's facilities. Awards In 1959 the University of Arizona awarded Fulton the honorary degree of Doctor of Science. The citation read in part: :For your distinguished achievement as an eminently successful business executive and as founder and administrator of a great research institution devoted to wider understanding of ancient and contemporary Indian civilizations, for your cultivation of the deepest human and spiritual values, for your devotion to high standards of scholarship and wide dissemination of learning, the University of Arizona hails you as one of this country‚Äôs great citizens‚Ä¶ In 1960, in honor of his work in the field of archaeology, Fulton received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Yale University in recognition of his lifelong commitment to archaeological research. An excerpt from that award reads: :When as a young man you began exploring the early history of the Indians of our Southwest, you could not have imagined how far your researches would take you. What began as a hobby has become an outstanding achievement in archaeology and ethnology, not merely of Arizona and Mexico, but of the Indians throughout this hemisphere. Your museum in Arizona is known everywhere by scholars for the range and perfection of its artifacts, for the importance of its publications, and for the generosity and leaning of its creator‚Ä¶ The William Shirley Fulton Scholarship =Endowment= A bequest by the late William Shirley Fulton, pioneer Arizona archaeologist and founder of the Amerind Foundation of Dragoon, Arizona. =Eligibility= The candidate must be an outstanding undergraduate or graduate student in archaeology.

The game begins with a dream sequence in which he is confronted by Lord Ironcrow, the ruler of the region. Lord Ironcrow attempts to persuade him to become a soldier, but Pib refuses causing him to wake up, screaming. His teacher returns to check up on Pib and informs him that he prepared to learn his very first spell, but first he must find the proper ingredients. Development and release The game began as a side project while the developers worked on The Find, introducing the player to the game world and some of its characters. Therefore, the game was criticised for its short length and a lack of any real storyline. Furthermore, the dream sequence at the beginning of the game bears no relevance to the rest of the game. Nevertheless, Apprentice was praised for its high production values and is even mentioned as a good example of a game created with Adventure Game Studio in the book Gaming Hacks published by O'Reilly Media.O Reilly's Gaming Hacks index: Apprentice cited 15 December 2006 The game won four AGS Awards in 2003 for Best Room Art, Best Character Art, Best Animation and Best Music.

Beginning Dahlia Seed began in the summer of 1992, in the northern New Jersey suburbs as a four-piece band that played a tight, and aggressive version of the indie pop that was prevalent at the time. With all the musicians having a background in the New York hardcore scene, the sound of Dahlia Seed was a bit tougher than the other indie stalwarts of the era, but the most distinctive aspect was the vocals of Tracy Wilson. Her \\"in your face\\" vocal style and delivery, coupled with a raw, and honest \\"open book\\" lyrical narrative, made her one of the most unusual vocalists of the scene. Dahlia Seed added a second guitarist (Jon Procopio) in 1993 and proceeded to release their first record, a 10\\" split w/Brokenmouth. It wasn't until their third single, a split 7\\" with Greyhouse, that the band started to gain some real notice and popularity. Their side of the split, a song called \\"Milk\\", won them new fans, especially from the tight-knit, and clique-ish Riot Grrrl scene. Rising popularity 1994 saw the release of \\"Valentine Kid's Litter\\", a full-length LP/CD culled from various demo recordings done in 1993. While the sound was a bit dated on the LP, it did give fans something more than split singles, and one-off compilation tracks to listen to. Jon Procopio left the band in summer 1994 and was replaced with Mike O'Keefe on guitar. Dahlia Seed played extensively in 1994 and early 1995, with such varied acts as Archers of Loaf, Everclear, Built to Spill, Texas is the Reason, Avail, Los Crudos, Heavens to Betsy, etc., and in the summer of 1995, headed off to Philadelphia to record their first proper record \\"Survived By\\". Although \\"Survived By\\" is considered by many to be the quintessential Dahlia Seed record because it captures the band at its zenith of songwriting, and performance, the overall production of the record betrays the undeniable power of Dahlia Seed as a live act and tends to leave the listener a bit underwhelmed. Breakup After production wrapped on \\"Survived By\\", Dahlia Seed headed out on their first ill-fated US/Canadian tour. Two weeks into the tour, guitarist Mike O'Keefe unexpectedly quit the band, which brought the tour to a halt somewhere in the mid-west of America. Dahlia Seed returned home to re-group and added a new guitarist Kevin McManus. With the addition of Kevin McManus, 1996 became a banner year for Dahlia Seed. \\"Survived By\\" was released in the spring to much praise, and critical acclaim, and shortly after that the band set out on a very successful U.S. tour. Upon return from the tour, the members of Dahlia Seed decided that it was time to call it quits, and finished up their run in August 1996, with a sold-out farewell show at Maxwell's in Hoboken, New Jersey Some reports had fans as far away as Toronto, and Chicago making the trip for the show, only to be turned away at the door. In 1999, Dahlia Seed's parting shot to the world was the release of \\"Please Excuse All The Blood\\". This CD was a posthumous release that compiled all the singles, comp tracks, and unreleased material that Dahlia Seed had left scattered about during their four years, including the last three recordings Dahlia Seed did, (with Alap Momin of Dalek fame), before their break-up. The songs \\"Standing 8 Count\\", \\"Greg Leto's Tears\\", and a cover of VoiVod's \\"Missing Sequences\\" are considered by fans to be some of the band's best work, and serve as a lament to what the future might have held for the band. Post-Dahlia Seed Tracy Wilson has also recorded under the name Ringfinger. Under this moniker she has released the vinyl-only LP Decimal.

After unsuccessfully attempting to resolve disputes with Eddie Livingstone, owner of the Toronto Blueshirts, executives of the three other NHA franchises suspended the NHA, and formed the National Hockey League (NHL), replacing the Livingstone team with a temporary team in Toronto, the Arenas. The NHL's first quarter-century saw the league compete against two rival major leagues‚Äîthe Pacific Coast Hockey Association and Western Canada Hockey League‚Äîfor players and the Stanley Cup. The NHL first expanded into the United States in 1924 with the founding of the Boston Bruins, and by 1926 consisted of ten teams in Ontario, Quebec, the Great Lakes region, and the Northeastern United States. At the same time, the NHL emerged as the only major league and the sole competitor for the Stanley Cup; in 1947, the NHL completed a deal with the Stanley Cup trustees to gain full control of the Cup. The NHL's footprint spread across Canada as Foster Hewitt's radio broadcasts were heard coast-to- coast starting in 1933. The Great Depression and World War II reduced the league to six teams, later known as the \\"Original Six\\", by 1942. Maurice Richard became the first player to score 50 goals in a season in 1944‚Äì45, and ten years later, Richard was suspended for assaulting a linesman, leading to the Richard Riot. Gordie Howe made his debut in 1946, and retired 35 seasons later as the NHL's all-time leader in goals and points. \\"China Clipper\\" Larry Kwong becomes the first non-white player in the league, breaking the NHL colour barrier in 1948, when he played for the New York Rangers. Willie O'Ree broke the NHL's black colour barrier when he suited up for the Bruins in 1958. In 1959, Jacques Plante became the first goaltender to regularly use a mask for protection. The Original Six era ended in 1967 when the NHL doubled in size by adding six new expansion teams. The six existing teams were formed into the newly created East Division, while the expansion teams were formed into the West Division. The NHL continued to expand, adding another six teams, to total 18 by 1974. This continued expansion was partially brought about by the NHL's attempts to compete with the World Hockey Association, which operated from 1972 until 1979 and sought to compete with the NHL for markets and players. Bobby Hull was the most famous player to defect to the rival league, signing a $2.75 million contract with the Winnipeg Jets. The NHL became involved in international play in the mid-1970s, starting with the Summit Series in 1972 which pitted the top Canadian players of the NHL against the top players in the Soviet Union, which was won by Canada with four wins, three losses, and a tie. Eventually, Soviet-Bloc players streamed into the NHL with the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989. When the WHA ceased operations in 1979, the NHL absorbed four of the league's teams, which brought the NHL to 21 teams, a figure that remained constant until the San Jose Sharks were added as an expansion franchise in 1991. Since then, the league has grown from 22 teams in 1992 to 31 today as the NHL spread its footprint across the United States. The league has withstood major labour conflicts in 1994‚Äì95 and 2004‚Äì05, the latter of which saw the entire 2004‚Äì05 NHL season canceled, the first time in North American history that a league has canceled an entire season in a labour dispute. Wayne Gretzky passed Gordie Howe as the NHL's all-time leading scorer in 1994 when he scored his 802nd career goal. Mario Lemieux overcame non- Hodgkin lymphoma to finish his NHL career with over 1,700 points and two Stanley Cup championships. Increased use of defence-focused systems helped cause scoring to fall in the late 1990s, leading some to argue that the NHL's talent pool had been diluted by 1990s expansion. In 1998, the NHL began awarding teams a single point for losing in overtime, hoping to reduce the number of tie games; after the 2004‚Äì05 lockout, it eliminated the tie altogether, introducing the shootout to ensure that each game has a winner. Map of Canadian provinces and U.S. states, and what decade they got their first NHL team. Background and founding The first attempts to regulate competitive ice hockey matches came in the late 1880s. Before then, teams competed in tournaments and infrequent challenge contests that prevailed in the Canadian sports world at the time. In 1887, four clubs from Montreal formed the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) and developed a structured schedule. In 1892, Lord Stanley donated the Stanley Cup to be symbolic of the Canadian championship and appointed Philip Dansken Ross and Sheriff John Sweetland as its trustees. It was awarded to the AHAC champion Montreal Hockey Club and thereafter awarded to the league champions, or to any pre-approved team that won it in a challenge. In 1904, the International Hockey League (IHL), based around Lake Michigan, was created as the first fully professional league, which lasted for two seasons. In recruiting players, the IHL caused an \\"Athletic War\\" that drained amateur clubs of top players, most noticeably in the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA). In the 1905‚Äì06 season, the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) was formed, which mixed paid and amateur players in its rosters, which led to the demise of the IHL. Bidding wars for players led many ECAHA teams to lose money, and it eventually folded on November 25, 1909. As a result of the dissolution of the ECAHA, two leagues were formed‚Äîthe Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) and the National Hockey Association (NHA). Since the NHA's owners were notable, wealthy businessmen, the CHA did not complete a season, as the NHA easily recruited the top players, and interest in the CHA teams faded. By 1914, the rival Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) league was launched and the NHA champion would play off each season against the PCHA champion for the Stanley Cup, ending the challenge era. The National Hockey League came into existence with the suspension of the NHA in 1917. After unsuccessfully resolving disputes with Eddie Livingstone, owner of the Toronto Blueshirts, executives of the three other NHA franchises‚Äîthe Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Wanderers and Ottawa Senators‚Äîsuspended the NHA, and formed the NHL, replacing Livingstone's team with a temporary team in Toronto, the Arenas. While new, the NHL was a continuation of the NHA. The NHL adopted the NHA's constitution, its rules, playing with six men to a side rather than the then-traditional seven and the NHA's split-season schedule. The owners originally intended the NHL to only operate for one season. However, the NHA was suspended permanently in 1918 and ceased to be an organisation in 1920. In 1921, the NHA championship trophy O'Brien Cup was adopted as the championship trophy of the NHL. 1917‚Äì1942: Founding =Early years= Cities that hosted NHL teams prior to the 1967 NHL expansion. The six teams that lasted past the Great Depression and World War II became known as the Original Six. Montreal and New York hosted Original Six teams and teams that folded. One of the NHL's first superstars was the prolific goal-scorer Joe Malone, who scored 44 goals in 20 games in the NHL's first season, of which five were netted on the NHL's opening night. He also set the record for the most goals in a game that season, with seven. Six games into the season, the Montreal Wanderers were forced to permanently withdraw from the league, as a fire left them without an arena. In the 1918‚Äì19 season, the Montreal Canadiens faced the Seattle Metropolitans of the PCHA for the Stanley Cup amid the Spanish influenza pandemic. The series was called off after five games when numerous players became ill; one, Joe Hall of the Canadiens, died a few weeks later. Maple Leaf Gardens in 1934 During the early 1920s, the NHL faced competition for players from two other major leagues: the PCHA and the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). As a result, ice hockey players were among the best paid athletes in North America. By the mid-1920s, the NHL emerged as the sole major league in North America; the PCHA and WCHL merged in 1924, only to disband two years later. The Victoria Cougars are the last non-NHL team to win the Stanley Cup, having defeated the Canadiens in 1925, and lost to the Montreal Maroons in 1926, respectively. The NHL continued to expand, adding the Maroons and its first American team, the Boston Bruins in 1924, getting up to 10 teams by 1926. Defence dominated the NHL, and in the 1928‚Äì29 season, Canadiens goaltender George Hainsworth set what remains a league record with 22 shutouts in 44 games. In response, the NHL began to allow forward passing in the offensive zone, which caused the offense to increase by approximately 2.5 times; to stem the tide, the NHL introduced the offside rule, which prevents offensive players from entering the opponent's zone before the puck crosses the \\"blue line\\". Livingstone continued to press claims in court throughout the 1920s, going as far as the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London, England. In early 1927, the Toronto franchise was sold to Conn Smythe, who renamed it to the Maple Leafs, and successfully promised to win the Stanley Cup in five years. He built the Maple Leaf Gardens, which included radio broadcaster Foster Hewitt's famous broadcast booth, affectionately referred to as a \\"gondola\\". On December 13, 1933, Eddie Shore charged Ace Bailey causing a severe skull fracture, following what Shore thought was a check from Bailey, but was actually made by King Clancy. Despite the grim prognosis (newspapers printed his obituary), Bailey survived, but never played a game. The Maple Leafs hosted the Ace Bailey All-Star Benefit Game, which raised over $20,000 for Bailey and his family. =Great Depression= The sweater of the Philadelphia Quakers, in 1931‚Äì32; the Quakers were one of four franchises to fail between 1931 and 1942. While Conn Smythe was able to successfully build a new arena, numerous other teams experienced financial difficulties. With the folding of the Philadelphia Quakers (originally the Pittsburgh Pirates) and the St. Louis Eagles (originally the Ottawa Senators), the NHL was reduced to eight teams starting in the 1935‚Äì36 season. The Montreal Canadiens narrowly escaped a move to Cleveland, Ohio, before a syndicate of Montreal businessmen bought the team. Montreal's financial troubles forced them to sell popular player Howie Morenz. When Morenz scored against the Canadiens on the last day of the 1935 season, Montreal fans voiced their opinion, giving him a standing ovation. Morenz was eventually re-acquired by Montreal, and on January 28, 1937, Morenz's skate became caught in the ice during a play. He suffered a broken leg in four places, and died on March 8 of a coronary embolism; 50,000 people filed past Morenz's casket at centre ice of the Montreal Forum to pay their last respects. A benefit game held in November 1937 raised $20,000 for Morenz's family as the NHL All-Stars defeated the Montreal Canadiens 6‚Äì5. In the mid-1930s, Chicago Black Hawks owner and staunch American nationalist Frederic McLaughlin commanded his general manager to compile a team of only American players; at the time, Taffy Abel was the only American-born player who was a regular player in the league. With eight out of 14 players Americans, the Black Hawks won only 14 of 48 games. In the playoffs, however, the Hawks upset the Canadiens, New York Americans, and the Maple Leafs to become the only team in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup despite a losing regular-season record. In the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals, the heavily favoured Toronto Maple Leafs were facing an upset, having fallen 3‚Äì0 in the seven-game series to the fifth-place Detroit Red Wings. Toronto rebounded, and won the next four games to capture the Stanley Cup, becoming the first of four teams in the NHL to come back from a 3‚Äì0 series deficit and the only team to accomplish that in the Stanley Cup Finals. Prior to the 1938‚Äì39 season, the Montreal Maroons folded due to financial difficulties, while the New York Americans suffered a similar fate prior to the 1942‚Äì43 season. With the league reduced to six teams, the \\"Original Six\\" era began. The league was nearly reduced to five teams before the following season, as World War II had ravaged the rosters of many teams to such an extent that teams battled each other for players. With only five returning players from the previous season, New York Rangers general manager Lester Patrick suggested suspending his team's play for the duration of the war but was persuaded otherwise. 1942‚Äì1967: Original Six =Post-war period= Red Dutton briefly served as NHL president between 1943 and 1946. Clarence Campbell served as the NHL's third President from 1946 until his retirement in 1977. In February 1943, league President Frank Calder collapsed during a meeting, dying shortly after. Red Dutton agreed to take over as president after receiving assurances from the league that the Brooklyn franchise he had operated would resume play after the war. When the other team owners reneged on this promise in 1946, Dutton resigned as league president. With Dutton's recommendation, Clarence Campbell was named president of the NHL in 1946. He remained in that role until his retirement in 1977. For the first 21 years of his presidency, the same six teams (located in Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Montreal, New York, and Toronto) competed for the Stanley Cup and that period has been called the \\"golden age of hockey\\". The NHL featured increasingly intense rivalries coupled with rule innovations that opened up the game. The first official All-Star Game took place at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto on October 13, 1947 to raise money for the newly created NHL Pension Society. The NHL All-Stars defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 4‚Äì3 and raised C$25,000 for the pension fund. Maurice \\"Rocket\\" Richard, the first player to score 50 goals in 50 games, retired as the NHL's all-time scoring leader. The 1940s Canadiens were led by the \\"Punch line\\" of Elmer Lach, Toe Blake and Maurice \\"Rocket\\" Richard. In 1944‚Äì45, Lach, Richard and Blake finished first, second and third in the NHL's scoring race with 80, 73 and 67 points respectively. It was Richard who became the focus of the media and fans as he attempted to score 50 goals in a 50-game season, a feat no other player had accomplished in league history. Richard scored his 50th goal in Boston at 17:45 of the third period of Montreal's final game of the season. On March 13, 1948, Larry Kwong, the \\"China Clipper\\", becomes the first non-white player in the NHL, breaking the colour barrier. He suited up for the New York Rangers against the Montreal Canadiens at the Montreal Forum. In March 1955, Richard was suspended for the remainder of the season, including the playoffs, after he received a match penalty for slashing Boston's Hal Laycoe then punching a linesman who attempted to intervene. The suspension touched off a wave of anger towards league president Clarence Campbell, who was warned not to attend a scheduled game in Montreal after receiving numerous death threats, mainly from French-Canadians accusing him of anti-French bias. Campbell dismissed the warnings, and attended the March 17 game as planned. His presence at the game was perceived by many fans as a provocation and he was booed and pelted with eggs and fruit. An hour into the game, a fan lobbed a tear-gas bomb in Campbell's direction, and firefighters decided to clear the building. Fans leaving the game and a growing mob of angry demonstrators rioted outside of the Montreal Forum, which became known as l'affaire Richard, or the Richard Riot. Richard became the first player to score 500 career goals on October 19, 1957. He retired in 1960 as an eight-time Stanley Cup champion, as well as the NHL's all-time leading scorer with 544 goals. In the fall of 1951, Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe watched special television feeds of games in an attempt to determine whether it would be a suitable medium for broadcasting hockey games. Television already had its detractors within the NHL, especially in Campbell. In 1952, even though only 10% of Canadians owned a television set, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) began televising games. On November 1, 1952, Hockey Night in Canada was first broadcast on television, with Foster Hewitt calling the action between the Leafs and Bruins at Maple Leaf Gardens. The broadcasts quickly became the highest-rated show on Canadian television. Campbell feared televised hockey would cause people to stop attending games in person, but Smythe felt the opposite. CBS first broadcast hockey games in the United States in the 1956‚Äì57 season as an experiment. Amazed with the initial popularity of the broadcasts, it inaugurated a 21-game package of games the following year. The NHL itself adapted to be viewer-friendly. In 1949, the league mandated that the ice surface be painted white to make the puck easier to see. On January 18, 1958, Willie O'Ree joined the Bruins as an injury call- up for a game in Montreal. In doing so he became the first black player in the NHL. Clint Benedict was the first goaltender to wear facial protection, donning it in 1930 to protect a broken nose. He quickly abandoned his mask as its design interfered with his vision. Twenty-nine years later, on November 1, 1959, in a game against New York Rangers Jacques Plante made the goaltender mask a permanent fixture in hockey. The first players' union was formed February 12, 1957 by Red Wings player Ted Lindsay who had sat on the board of the NHL's Pension Society since 1952. Lindsay and his fellow players were upset by the league's refusal to let them view the books related to the pension fund. The league claimed that it could not contribute more than it did but the players on the Pension Committee suspected otherwise. The idea quickly gained popularity and when the union's founding was announced publicly, nearly every NHL player had signed up. Led by Alan Eagleson, the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) was formed in 1967 and it quickly received acceptance from the owners. =Dynasties= Syl Apps, with the Cup before it was redesigned, in the 1940s The Original Six era was a period of dynasties. The Toronto Maple Leafs won the Stanley Cup five times between 1944‚Äì45 and 1950‚Äì51. In the 1951 Stanley Cup Finals, the Maple Leafs defeated the Canadiens four games to one in the only final in NHL history when all games were decided in overtime. Beginning in 1948‚Äì49, the Red Wings won seven consecutive regular season titles, a feat that no other team has accomplished. During that time, the Wings won four Stanley Cups. It was during the 1952 Stanley Cup Finals that the Legend of the Octopus was created. Brothers Pete and Jerry Cusimano brought a dead octopus to the Detroit Olympia for the fourth game of the finals. They hoped that the octopus would inspire Detroit to an eighth game victory. Detroit went on to defeat Montreal 3‚Äì0 and the tradition was born. The Red Wings faced the Canadiens in the Stanley Cup Finals in three consecutive seasons between 1954 and 1956. Detroit won the first two match-ups, but Montreal captured the 1956 Stanley Cup, ending one dynasty and starting another. The Canadiens won five consecutive championships between 1956 and 1960, a feat no other team has duplicated. The Original Six era ended with the 1967 Stanley Cup Finals between the two-time defending champion Canadiens, and the Maple Leafs. The Maple Leafs finished the era by winning the Cup four times between 1962 and 1967, their 1967 championship is the last Maple Leafs title to date. The Chicago Blackhawks, who won in 1961, are the only other team to win the Stanley Cup during this period. 1967‚Äì1992: Expansion era =Expansion years= In 1963, Rangers governor William Jennings introduced to his peers the idea of expanding the league to the American West Coast by adding two new teams for the 1964‚Äì65 season. While the governors did not agree to the proposal, the topic of expansion came up every time the owners met from then on out. In 1965, it was decided to expand by six teams, doubling the size of the NHL. In February 1966, the governors met and decided to award franchises to Los Angeles, Minnesota, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Oakland and St. Louis. The league rejected bids from Baltimore, Buffalo and Vancouver. In Canada, there was widespread outrage over the denial of an expansion team to Vancouver in 1967; three years later, the NHL awarded a franchise to Vancouver, which formerly played in the Western Hockey League, for the 1970‚Äì71 season, along with the Buffalo Sabres. On January 13, 1968, North Stars' rookie Bill Masterton became the first, and to date, only player to die as a result of injuries suffered during an NHL game. Early in a game against Oakland, Masterton was checked hard by two players causing him to flip over backwards and land on his head. Masterton was rushed to hospital with massive head injuries, and died there two days later. The National Hockey League Writers Association presented the league with the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy later in the season. Following Masterton's death, players slowly began wearing helmets, and starting in the 1979‚Äì80 season, the league mandated all players entering the league wear them. In the 1968‚Äì69 season, third-year defenceman Bobby Orr scored 21 goals to set an NHL record for goals by a defenceman en route to winning his first of eight consecutive Norris Trophies as the league's top defenceman. At the same time, Orr's teammate, Phil Esposito, became the first player in league history to score 100 points in a season, finishing with 126 points. A gifted scorer, Orr revolutionized defencemen's impact on the offensive part of the game, as blue-liners began to be judged on how well they created goals in addition to how well they prevented them. Orr twice won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL's leading scorer, the only defenceman in NHL history to do so. Chronic knee problems plagued Orr throughout his career; he played 12 seasons in the NHL before injuries forced his retirement in 1978. Orr finished with 270 goals and 915 points in 657 games, and he won the Hart Memorial Trophy as league Most Valuable Player thrice. For the 1970‚Äì71 NHL season, two new teams, the Buffalo Sabres and Vancouver Canucks made their debuts and were both put into the East Division. The Chicago Black Hawks were moved to the West Division. The Montreal Canadiens won the Stanley Cup by beating the Black Hawks in seven games in the finals. The 1970s were associated with aggressive, and often violent play. Known as the \\"Broad Street Bullies\\", the Philadelphia Flyers are the most famous example of this mindset. The Flyers established league records for penalty minutes‚ÄîDave \\"the Hammer\\" Schultz' total of 472 in 1974‚Äì75 remains a league record. They captured the 1974 Stanley Cup, becoming the first expansion team to win the league championship. =WHA competition and merger= The Colorado Rockies battle the Atlanta Flames in 1978. These teams are now the New Jersey Devils and Calgary Flames respectively. In 1972, the NHL faced competition from the newly formed World Hockey Association (WHA). The WHA lured many players away from the NHL. The WHA's biggest coup was to lure Bobby Hull from the Black Hawks to play for the Winnipeg Jets. He signed a $2.75 million contract, and lent instant credibility to the new league. After Hull signed, several other players quickly followed suit and the NHL suddenly found itself in a war for talent. By the time the 1972‚Äì73 WHA season began, 67 players had switched from the NHL to the WHA. The NHL also found itself competing with the WHA for markets. Initially, the league had no intention to expand past 14 teams, but the threat the WHA represented caused the league to change its plans. The league hastily announced the creation of the New York Islanders and Atlanta Flames as 1972 expansion teams. Following the 1972‚Äì73 season, the NHL announced it was further expanding to 18-teams for the 1974‚Äì75 season, adding the Kansas City Scouts and Washington Capitals. In just eight years, the NHL had tripled in size to 18 teams. By 1976, both leagues were dealing with serious financial problems. The St. Louis Blues were on the verge of bankruptcy.WHA, SI.com, October 17, 1977. Talk of a merger between the NHL and the WHA was growing. In 1976, for the first time in four decades, the NHL approved franchise relocations; the Scouts moved after just two years in Kansas City to Denver to become the Colorado Rockies, while the California Golden Seals became the Cleveland Barons. Two years later, after failed overtures about merging the Barons with Washington and Vancouver, the Barons merged with the Minnesota North Stars, reducing the NHL to 17 teams for 1978‚Äì79. Cities that hosted NHL and WHA teams at the time of the NHL-WHA merger in 1979. Four WHA teams joined the NHL, while the two remaining teams joined the CHL. The move towards a merger picked up in 1977 when John Ziegler succeeded Clarence Campbell as NHL president. The WHA folded following the 1978‚Äì79 season, while the Edmonton Oilers, Hartford Whalers, Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets joined the NHL as expansion teams, which brought the league up to 21 teams, until 1991. The merger brought Gordie Howe back to the NHL for one final season in 1979‚Äì80, during which he brought his NHL career total to 801 goals and 1,850 points. It was also the last season for the Atlanta Flames. The team averaged only 9,800 fans in attendance and lost over $2 million. They were sold for a record $16 million, and relocated north to become the Calgary Flames in 1980‚Äì81. Two years later, the Rockies were sold for $30 million, and left Denver to become the New Jersey Devils for the 1982‚Äì83 season. =More dynasties= A statue of Wayne Gretzky raising the Stanley Cup in front of Edmonton's Rogers Place. Although the league expanded from six to 21 teams, dynasties still prevailed in the NHL. The Montreal Canadiens won four consecutive Stanley Cups starting in 1975-76. In 1980, the New York Islanders won their first of four consecutive Stanley Cups. The Islanders dominated both the regular season and the playoffs with the likes of Billy Smith, Mike Bossy, Denis Potvin, and Bryan Trottier. In 1981, Bossy became the first player to score 50 goals in 50 games since Maurice Richard accomplished that feat in 1945. In 1982‚Äì83, the Edmonton Oilers had the best record. The Oilers were led by Wayne Gretzky, who remained with the Oilers when they joined the NHL in 1979. He scored 137 points in 1979‚Äì80 and won the first of nine Hart Trophies as the NHL's most valuable player. Over the next several seasons, Gretzky established new highs in goals scored in a season, with 92 in the 1981‚Äì82 season; in assists, with 163 in the 1985‚Äì86; and in total points, with 215 in 1985‚Äì86. Gretzky also set the record for scoring 50 goals in the fewest games, achieving the mark in 39 games. The Islanders and Oilers met in the Finals as New York swept Edmonton for their last Stanley Cup. The following season, the Oilers and Islanders met again in the playoffs. The Oilers won the rematch in five games, marking the start of another dynasty. Led by Gretzky and Mark Messier, the Oilers won five Stanley Cup championships between 1984 and 1990. On August 9, 1988, Oilers owner Peter Pocklington, in financial trouble, traded Gretzky to the Los Angeles Kings. Gretzky's trade to the Kings popularized ice hockey in the United States. With the Kings, Gretzky broke Gordie Howe's record for the most career points. Mario Lemieux led Pittsburgh to Stanley Cups in 1990‚Äì91 and 1991‚Äì92. A gifted forward, he won six Art Ross Trophies as the league's leading scorer and he scored 199 points in 1988‚Äì89, becoming the second highest single-season point scorer behind Gretzky. Lemieux's career was plagued by health issues, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and he retired in 1997. In 2000, he returned and finished his NHL career in 2006 with more than 1,700 points. =Fall of the Iron Curtain= Alexander Mogilny, pictured in 2006, was among the first Soviets to play in the NHL in 1989. The NHL became first involved in international play in the mid-1970s, starting with the Summit Series in 1972 which pitted the top Canadian players of the NHL against the top players in the Soviet Union. With the eight-game series tied at three wins apiece and a tie, Paul Henderson scooped up a rebound and put it past Soviet goaltender Vladislav Tretiak with 34 seconds left in the eighth and final game to score the series-winning goal. While European-born players were a part of the NHL since its founding, it was still rare to see them in the NHL until 1980, although the WHA employed a number of them. Borje Salming was the first European star in the NHL and Finns Jari Kurri and Esa Tikkanen helped lead the Oilers dynasty of the 1980s. The WHA opened the door, and players slowly joined the NHL, but those behind the Iron Curtain were restricted from following suit. In 1980, Peter Stastny, his wife, and his brother Anton secretly fled Czechoslovakia with the aid of Nordiques owner Marcel Aubut. The Stastnys' defection made international headlines, and contributed to the first wave of Europeans' entrance into the NHL. Hoping that they would one day be permitted to play in the NHL, teams drafted Soviet players in the 1980s, 27 in all by the 1988 draft; however, defection was the only way such players could play in the NHL. Shortly before the end of the 1988‚Äì89 regular season, Flames general manager Cliff Fletcher announced that he had reached an agreement with Soviet authorities that allowed Sergei Pryakhin to play in North America. It was the first time a member of the Soviet national team was permitted to leave the Soviet Union. Shortly after, Soviet players began to flood into the NHL. Teams anticipated that there would be an influx of Soviet players in the 1990s, as 18 Soviets were selected in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft. 1992‚Äìpresent: Modern era Map of relocated NHL teams =Southward expansion (1992-2000)= The 21-team era ended in 1990, when the league revealed ambitious plans to double league revenues from $400 million within a decade and bring the NHL to 28 franchises during that period. The NHL quickly announced three new teams: The San Jose Sharks, who began play in the 1991‚Äì92 season, and the Ottawa Senators and Tampa Bay Lightning, who followed a year later. The Lightning made NHL history when goaltender Manon Rheaume played a period of an exhibition game, September 23, 1992. In doing so, Rheaume became the first woman to play in an NHL game. One year later, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and Florida Panthers began play as the NHL's 25th and 26th franchises respectively. The two new franchises were granted as part of the NHL's attempts at regaining a network television presence by expanding throughout the American south. The NHL's southward push continued in 1993 as the Minnesota North Stars moved to Dallas, Texas to become the Dallas Stars. In 1994, the players were locked out by the owners because of a lack of a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). The 1994‚Äì95 NHL lockout lasted 104 days and resulted in the season's being shortened from a planned 84 games to 48. The owners insisted on a salary cap, changes to free agency and arbitration in the hopes of limiting escalating salaries, the union instead proposed a luxury tax system. Just as the entire season seemed to be lost, an 11th-hour deal was agreed on. The owners failed to achieve a full salary cap but the deal was initially hailed as a win for the owners. The deal was not enough to save two teams in Canada's smallest NHL markets. The revenue disparity between large and small market teams, exacerbated by the falling value of the Canadian Dollar, forced the Quebec Nordiques to move to Denver and become the Colorado Avalanche in 1995; the Winnipeg Jets relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, becoming the Coyotes, the next year. The Hartford Whalers followed, moving to Greensboro, NC and becoming the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997. The NHL continued its expansion into cities in the Southern United States. In 1998, the Nashville Predators joined the league, followed by the Atlanta Thrashers the following year. To further market their players, the NHL decided to have its players play in the Winter Olympics, starting in 1998, at the Nagano Games. In 2000, the league added two franchises, boosting the total number to 30. The NHL returned to Minnesota with the Wild and added the Blue Jackets in Columbus, Ohio. =2004‚Äì05 lockout= Gary Bettman, pictured in 2008, joined the NHL as its first commissioner in 1993. By 2004, the owners were claiming that player salaries had grown far faster than revenues, and that the league as a whole lost over US$300 million in 2002‚Äì03. As a result, on September 15, 2004 Gary Bettman announced that the owners again locked the players out before the start of the 2004‚Äì05 season. On February 16, 2005, Bettman announced the cancellation of the entire season. As with the 1994‚Äì95 lockout, the owners were again demanding a salary cap, which the players were unwilling to consider until the season was on the verge of being lost. The season's cancellation led to a revolt within the union. NHLPA president Trevor Linden and senior director Ted Saskin took charge of negotiations from executive director Bob Goodenow. By early July, the two sides had agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement. The deal featured a hard salary cap, linked to a fixed percentage of league revenues and a 24% rollback on salaries. =21st century= Arena setup at Ralph Wilson Stadium in Buffalo for the 2008 Winter Classic Hoping to reduce the number of tie games during the regular season, the NHL decided that beginning in the 1999‚Äì2000 season, in any game tied after regulation time, both teams would be guaranteed one point, while the team that won in overtime would earn a second point. The Edmonton Oilers hosted the NHL's first regular season outdoor hockey game, the Heritage Classic on November 22, 2003. The game against the Canadiens was held at Commonwealth Stadium before a then-record crowd of 57,167 fans who endured temperatures as low as ‚àí18 degrees Celsius (0 degrees Fahrenheit). In the 2005‚Äì06 season, the NHL eliminated tie games, as the shootout was introduced to decide all regular season games tied after the five-minute overtime period. The shootout was one of several rule changes made in 2005, as the league attempted to open the game up after the lockout. One of the most controversial changes was the league's zero-tolerance policy on obstruction penalties. The league hoped that the game could be opened up if it cracked down on \\"clutching and grabbing\\". The tighter regulations have met with numerous complaints about the legitimacy of some calls, that players are diving to draw penalties, and that officials are not calling enough penalties. The changes initially led to a sharp increase in scoring. Teams combined to score 6.1 goals per game in 2005‚Äì06, more than a full goal per game higher than in the 2003‚Äì04 season. This represented the highest increase in offence since 1929‚Äì30. However, scoring has rapidly declined since, approaching pre-lockout totals in 2007‚Äì08. In the 2005‚Äì06 season, rookies Alexander Ovechkin and Sidney Crosby began their careers. In their first three seasons, they each won both the Art Ross and Hart trophies; Crosby in 2007, and Ovechkin in 2008. The success of the Heritage Classic led to the scheduling of more outdoor games. The Sabres hosted the 2008 NHL Winter Classic on New Year's Day 2008, losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in a shootout before a crowd of 71,217 at Ralph Wilson Stadium. The second Winter Classic was held January 1, 2009 at Wrigley Field in Chicago between the Blackhawks and Red Wings. The third NHL Winter Classic was held in Fenway Park on January 1, 2010, between the Boston Bruins and the Philadelphia Flyers. The home team Bruins won. Two clubs still experienced financial problems, however. The Phoenix Coyotes eventually filed for bankruptcy in May 2009. The league then took control over the team later that year in order to stabilize the club's operations, with the hopes of eventually reselling it to a new owner who would be committed to stay in the Phoenix market. The league did not find a satisfactory buyer for the Coyotes until 2013. The financially struggling Atlanta Thrashers were eventually sold to True North Sports and Entertainment in 2011, who then relocated the team to Winnipeg, a stark reversal of the league's Southward expansion more than a decade earlier. The NHL again entered lockout in 2012, cancelling the first 526 games, about 43% of the season, until at least December 30, 2012. Just after 5 am on January 6, 2013, after approximately 16 continuous hours of negotiating, the NHL and the player's union reached a tentative deal on a new collective bargaining agreement to end the lockout. The first games of the season were held on January 19. In 2017, the league expanded again to Las Vegas, Nevada with the Vegas Golden Knights. In 2018, the league approved another expansion team in Seattle, the Seattle Kraken, to begin play in 2021. On May 26, 2020, the NHL declared that 2019‚Äì20 regular season (which had been suspended after March 11) would be prematurely terminated due to the COVID-19 pandemic; the league subsequently announced on July 1 that the season would end with a 24-team playoff tournament to be held behind closed doors in Toronto and Edmonton from August 1.

The assassin, an Israeli ultranationalist named Yigal Amir, radically opposed Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's peace initiative, particularly the signing of the Oslo Accords. Background Yitzhak Rabin's family mourn at his funeral. The assassination of Israeli Prime Minister and Defence Minister Yitzhak Rabin was the culmination of an anti-violence rally in support of the Oslo peace process. Rabin was disparaged personally by right-wing conservatives and Likud leaders who perceived the Oslo peace process as an attempt to forfeit the occupied territories and a capitulation to Israel's enemies. National religious conservatives and Likud party leaders believed that withdrawing from any \\"Jewish\\" land was heresy. The Likud leader and future prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, accused Rabin's government of being \\"removed from Jewish tradition [...] and Jewish values\\". Right-wing rabbis associated with the settlers' movement prohibited territorial concessions to the Palestinians and forbade soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces from evacuating Jewish settlers under the accords. Some rabbis proclaimed din rodef, based on a traditional Jewish law of self-defense, against Rabin personally, arguing that the Oslo Accords would endanger Jewish lives. Rallies organized by Likud and other right-wing groups featured depictions of Rabin in a Nazi SS uniform, or in the crosshairs of a gun. Protesters compared the Labor party to the Nazis and Rabin to Adolf Hitler and chanted, \\"Rabin is a murderer\\" and \\"Rabin is a traitor\\". In July 1995, Netanyahu led a mock funeral procession featuring a coffin and hangman's noose at an anti-Rabin rally where protesters chanted, \\"Death to Rabin\\". The chief of internal security, Carmi Gillon, then alerted Netanyahu of a plot on Rabin's life and asked him to moderate the protests' rhetoric, which Netanyahu declined to do. Netanyahu denied any intention to incite violence.Smith, Charles D. Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict A History with Documents, , pp. 464, 466. Rabin dismissed such protests or labeled them chutzpah. According to Gillon, Rabin refused his requests to wear a bulletproof vest and preferred not to use the armored car purchased for him. Left-wing supporters organized pro-peace rallies in support of the Oslo Accords. It was after one such gathering in Tel Aviv that the assassination took place. =Yigal Amir and din rodef= Yitzhak Rabin grave, December 1995. The assassin was Yigal Amir, a 25-year-old former Hesder student and far-right law student at Bar-Ilan University. Amir had strenuously opposed Rabin's peace initiative, particularly the signing of the Oslo Accords, because he felt that an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank would deny Jews their \\"biblical heritage which they had reclaimed by establishing settlements\\". Amir had come to believe that Rabin was a rodef, meaning a \\"pursuer\\" who endangered Jewish lives. The concept of din rodef (\\"law of the pursuer\\") is a part of traditional Jewish law. Amir believed he would be justified under din rodef in removing Rabin as a threat to Jews in the territories.Smith, pp. 458, 468 In the Israeli settlements, pamphlets debating the validity of applying din rodef and din moser (\\"law of the informer\\") to Rabin and the Oslo Accords were distributed at synagogues. Both carried a death sentence according to traditional Halakhic law. There was disagreement among religious Zionists as to whether Amir ever secured authorization from a rabbi to carry out the assassination of Rabin. His father later said that in the months before the assassination, Amir repeatedly \\"said that the prime minister should be killed because a din rodef was issued against him\\". During his later trial, Amir stated: \\"I acted according to din rodef. ... It was not a personal act, I just wanted [Rabin] to be removed from his position\\". For his radical activities, Yigal Amir had been brought under attention by the Israeli internal security service (Shin Bet), but the organization only had information on Amir's attempt on creating an anti-Arab militia, not on comments regarding assassinating Rabin, which he openly stated to a number of people. Another incident describing Amir's comments to a fellow student about stating the vidui prior to an earlier, aborted attempt on his life was ignored by the organization as \\"non-credible\\". The source refused to name Amir by name but instead described him as a \\"short Yemeni guy with curly hair\\". Assassination The monument at the site of the assassination: Ibn Gabirol Street between the Tel Aviv City Hall and Gan Ha'ir (in the back). The monument is composed of broken rocks, which represent the political earthquake that the assassination represents. After the rally, Rabin walked down the city hall steps towards his car. As he entered the car, Amir approached the car from the rear and fired two shots at Rabin with a Beretta 84F semi-automatic pistol. Rabin was hit in the abdomen and chest. Amir was immediately subdued by Rabin's bodyguards and police on the scene, and fired a third shot at bodyguard Yoram Robin during the struggle, lightly wounding him. Amir was arrested on the scene with the murder weapon. He was taken to a police station a few blocks away.Barak T: Ten years have passed, friend. Tel Aviv Newspaper Perry D: Israel and the Quest for Permanence, p. 216.https://www.thisamericanlife.org/570/transcripthttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/31/night- yitzhak-rabin-was-assassinated Yoram Rubin pushed Rabin into his car and ordered the driver, Menachem Damati, to drive to Ichilov Hospital at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, a drive that was only minutes away. However, Damati was disoriented by the hysteria of the shooting and the crowds that lined the streets, and as a result lost his bearing. Rabin, who was bleeding heavily, was initially conscious and said that he thought he'd been hurt but not too badly before passing out. Damati drove frantically trying to find the hospital, running red lights and swerving to avoid pedestrians, until he spotted a police officer, Pinchas Terem, stopped next to him, and shouted at him to get in. He asked Terem to guide him to Ichilov Hospital. Terem took control of the car's megaphone system, and ordered other cars to get out of the way. Two minutes later, some ten minutes since the shooting, the car arrived at Ichilov Hospital. At the hospital, no one had been alerted to expect Rabin's arrival and Damati had to stop at the gate and explain the situation. After the car was allowed in, Damati, Rubin, and Terem carried Rabin into the trauma ward. At this time, Rabin was not breathing and had no pulse. Doctors performed an initial examination, attached Rabin to an IV, and drained the air that had seeped into his right chest cavity with a tube inserted into his ribcage. After the air was drained from Rabin's chest, his pulse reappeared. He then underwent surgery. Up to forty hospital staff, including anesthesiologists and nurses, were involved in Rabin's care. Meanwhile, cabinet ministers, military officers, security officials, and family members of Rabin arrived at the hospital, as did Rabin's Chief of Staff Eitan Haber. After Israeli media reported the shooting, a crowd of spectators and journalists began to gather in front of the hospital. At one point, the doctors managed to briefely stabilize his vital signs, and after being informed, Haber told a high-ranking Defense Ministry official to begin preparations for setting up a makeshift office at the hospital with telephones and fax lines to enable Rabin to continue his work as Prime Minister while recuperating. However, Rabin's condition rapidly deteriorated again. After his heart stopped, a surgeon carried out a cardiac massage in a last-ditch attempt to save him. At 11:02 PM, one hour and twenty minutes after the shooting, doctors gave up their efforts to revive Rabin and pronounced him dead. At 11:15 PM, Eitan Haber walked out of the hospital to face the television cameras outside and announced Rabin's death to the media: > The government of Israel announces in consternation, in great sadness, and > in deep sorrow, the death of prime minister and minister of defense Yitzhak > Rabin, who was murdered by an assassin, tonight in Tel Aviv. The government > shall convene in one hour for a mourning session in Tel Aviv. Blessed be his > memory. In Rabin's pocket was a blood-stained sheet of paper with the lyrics to the well-known Israeli song \\"Shir LaShalom\\" (\\"Song for Peace\\"), which was sung at the rally and dwells on the impossibility of bringing a dead person back to life and, therefore, the need for peace. Shortly after Rabin's death, an emergency meeting of the Israeli cabinet was held during which Shimon Peres, then serving as Foreign Minister, was appointed acting Prime Minister. About three hours after Rabin's death, Dr. Yehuda Hiss, the Israeli government's chief pathologist, arrived at Ichilov Hospital to conduct an autopsy together with two assistants, including a photographer.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/31/night-yitzhak- rabin-was-assassinated The autopsy concluded that one bullet had entered Rabin's lower back, ruptured his spleen, and punctured his left lung, while the other pierced his back below the collarbone, smashed through his ribcage, and pierced his right lung. Hiss concluded that Rabin had died of massive blood loss and the collapse of both of his lungs, and that his chances of surviving the shooting had been extremely low. A subsequent brain scan found an embolism in one of Rabin's cerebral arteries, a large pocket of air which had entered his bloodstream in the lungs and traveled to the brain, restricting the flow of blood and oxygen. This blockage had hindered the resuscitaiton effort. Amir was interrogated by Chief Superintendant Motti Naftali. He made a full confession and after being told that Rabin had died, Amir expressed joy and asked to be brought Schnapps to make a celebratory toast. Police officers and Shin Bet agents subsequently raided the Amir family home in Herzliya, where they arrested Amir's brother Hagai, whom he had implicated as an accomplice during his interrogation.

Yigal Amir was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for Rabin's murder and an additional six years for injuring Yoram Rubin. While in Israel it is customary for the President to reduce a life sentence to a set period, usually 20-30 years, with a possibility for further reduction for good behavior, Amir's sentence was not reduced. In 2001, the Knesset later passed the Yigal Amir Law, which prohibits a parole board from recommending a pardon or reduction in a sentence for the assassin of a Prime Minister. Adani was sentenced to seven years imprisonment, while Hagai Amir was sentenced to 12 years in prison, increased to 16 years upon appeal, and later received an additional year in prison for threatening to kill Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. Adani was released in 2002 and Hagai Amir in 2012. Yigal Amir remains incarcerated. =Social impact= Yitzhak and Leah Rabin's grave on Mount Herzl. Rabin's assassination was a shock to the Israeli public. Rallies and memorials took place near Kings of Israel Square‚Äîlater renamed Rabin Square in his honor‚Äîas well as near Rabin's home, the Knesset building, and the home of the assassin. Many other streets and public buildings around the country were named for Rabin as well. The assassination has been described as emblematic of a kulturkampf (\\"cultural struggle\\") between religious right-wing and secular left-wing forces within Israel. Ilan Peleg of the Middle East Institute has described Rabin's assassination as \\"reflecting a deep cultural divide within Israel's body politic [...] intimately connected with the peace process\\" which illustrates both increased polarization and political conflict in the country. On 28 March 1996, the Shamgar Commission issued its final report into the assassination. It was critical of Shin Bet for putting the Prime Minister at risk and ignoring threats to his life from Jewish extremists.

It is a colorless liquid, but aged samples appear amber. It possesses a faint odor of burning and a bitter taste. It is miscible with but unstable in water. It is soluble in common organic solvents. Synthesis Furfuryl alcohol is manufactured industrially by hydrogenation of furfural, which is itself typically produced from waste bio-mass such as corncobs or sugar cane bagasse. As such furfuryl alcohol may be considered a green chemical. Reactions It undergoes many reactions including Diels-Alder additions to electrophilic alkenes and alkynes. Hydroxymethylation gives 1,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan. Hydrolysis gives levulinic acid. Upon treatment with acids, heat and/or catalysts, furfuryl alcohol can be made to polymerize into a resin, poly(furfuryl alcohol). Hydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol can proceed to give hydroxymethyl derivative of tetrahydrofuran and 1,5-pentanediol. The etherification reaction of furfuryl alcohol with alkyl or aryl halide (e.g. benzyl chloride) in the liquid-liquid-liquid triphase system with the help of a phase transfer catalyst also reported. Katole DO, Yadav GD. Process intensification and waste minimization using liquid-liquid-liquid triphase transfer catalysis for the synthesis of 2-((benzyloxy)methyl)furan. Molecular Catalysis 2019;466:112‚Äì21. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcat.2019.01.004 Applications The primary use of furfuryl alcohol is as a monomer for the synthesis of furan resins. These polymers are used in thermoset polymer matrix composites, cements, adhesives, coatings and casting/foundry resins. Polymerization involves an acid-catalyzed polycondensation, usually giving a black cross-linked product. A highly simplified representation is shown below. center =Craft uses= Furfuryl alcohol has been used in rocketry as a fuel which ignites hypergolically (immediately and energetically in contact) with white fuming nitric acid or red fuming nitric acid oxidizer. The use of hypergolics avoids the need for an igniter. In late 2012, Spectra, a concept liquid rocket engine using white fuming nitric acid as the oxidizer to furfuryl alcohol fuel was static tested by Copenhagen Suborbitals. The Spectra engine test report pdf Because of its low molecular weight, furfuryl alcohol can impregnate the cells of wood, where it can be polymerized and bonded with the wood by heat, radiation, and/or catalysts or additional reactants. The treated wood has improved moisture- dimensional stability, hardness, and decay and insect resistance; catalysts can include zinc chloride, citric, and formic acid, as well as borates. Safety The median lethal dose for furfuryl alcohol ranges from 160 to 400 mg/kg (mouse or rabbit, oral).

Early life and career Hattie was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. She loved to dance the hula and sing in the church choir. She began teaching at Waipahu Elementary School in 1923, entertaining her students with what would become her comedy hula routines. In 1930, she married Theodore Inter. By 1936, she had joined Louise Akeo's Royal Hawaiian Girls Glee Club singing at venues around Oahu. The group got $25 per appearance to distribute among the 25 members. The Don McDiarmid Sr-Johnny Noble song When Hilo Hattie Does the Hilo Hop became her signature tune. McDiarmid intended the 1935 song to be danced by the typical beautifully smooth hula dancer. But in 1936, while the band was performing as shipboard entertainment on a cruise to Portland, Oregon, the dancer meant to perform it fell ill. Hilo Hattie, who claimed to have never had a hula lesson in her life, ran with it as a comedy piece, and it became a monster success in its time. Clara legally changed her name to Hilo Hattie, when she performed her second signature song, The Cockeyed Mayor of Kaunakakai, in the movie Song of the Islands. From 1939, Hilo Hattie was a favorite among the military. Fame, film, and television work By 1940, Harry Owens was conducting the Royal Hawaiian Hotel orchestra and hired her. Hattie joined the Webley Edwards-hosted Hawaii Calls broadcasts that went out to 600 radio stations around the world. From that point on, she became a global household name, touring the world and performing in movies and on television, with a recurring role in Hawaii Five-O as Mrs. Pruitt. In 1945, she was referred to as \\"the Polynesian Sophie Tucker\\" when she entertained at the Holland Supper Club in Eugene, Oregon. The divorced Clara married bandleader and violinist, Carlyle Nelson, in Las Vegas in 1949.McWhorter, A. J., \\"Hilo Hattie's Name and Fame Came with Lots of Laughter\\", Honolulu Star- Advertiser, November 11, 2012, p. G9 She was still touring the mainland in 1956, when she performed four days and nights at the Merced County, California Spring Fair. Hilo Hattie and her Hawaiian Revue played the Peabody Auditorium in Daytona Beach, Florida in January 1959. Hilo Hattie began doing two shows a night, six nights a week, at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Tapa Room in 1960. It was an arrangement that continued for more than a decade. In 1961, she appeared in the motion picture Blue Hawaii with Elvis Presley. In June 1963, she entertained at the Sportsmen of Stanislaus luau in Modesto, California. Personal life and death In 1972, she recalled having once made an attempt at retirement but live performing was too much fun. Hilo Hattie died of cancer on December 12, 1979. Hattie's first husband was Ted H. Inter whom she divorced in 1946. She married musician Carlyle Nelson in 1949. He survived her.; She is buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific (Section U, Grave 653-A) under her married name, Clara Nelson. Retail Stores Hilo Hattie is the brand name of a group of stores selling Hawaiian and Hawaiian- themed merchandise. The stores were founded by Richard and Evelyn Margolis in 1965 and operated by the Margolis Manufacturing and Retail Company (Hilo, Hawaii) until the Sale of the company to James Romig of Pomare Ltd in 1979. As of 2010, there were seven Hilo Hattie stores in the state of Hawaii; at one time the firm operated stores outside of Hawaii as well, primarily in California, Arizona, and Nevada. The store filed for bankruptcy in 2009, and has subsequently been acquired by its principal creditors, exiting bankruptcy in 2010.

The ballistic cap is absent. 15-inch APCBC shell Battleship shells 36cm, 40cm, 46cm; World War II The armour-piercing capped ballistic cap (APCBC) is a type of armor-piercing shell introduced in the 1930s. The ballistic cap was a thin shell, typically metal, that fit over the rounded nose of an otherwise unchanged armour-piercing round to improve its aerodynamics. This allowed the APCBC shells to retain higher velocities, delivering more energy to the target, especially at long range. On impact the shell crumpled, allowing the armour-piercing component to impact as normal. Development The APCBC munition type was an evolutionary development of the early war armour-piercing capped (APC) shell, itself an evolution of the more basic AP (armor-piercing or solid shot) and APHE (armor- piercing high-explosive) shell types. With respect to armored land warfare, the primary intended function of both AP and APHE shell types was to penetrate an enemy armored vehicle and incapacitate the vehicle and crew by internal explosion (in the case of APHE) or fragmentation/ricochet (in the case of AP rounds). As the war lengthened, target armor became progressively thicker (and sloped) as new tank designs emerged, and early war AP and APHE became progressively less effective. The initial response to this thickening in armor had been to increase the muzzle velocity in newly developed anti-tank guns. However, it was found that steel shot tended to shatter on impact at velocities upward of about 823 m/s (2700 feet/second). Based on this deficiency, a new form of shell was developed which was designated APC (armor- piercing capped). In this form of munition, a cap of softer metal was attached to the tip of an AP (solid) round. The purpose of this cap was many-fold. The cap transferred energy from the tip of the shell to the sides of the projectile, thereby helping to reduce shattering. In addition, the cap appeared to improve penetration of sloped armor by deforming, spreading and ‚Äústicking‚Äù to the armor on impact and thereby reducing the tendency of the shell to deflect at an angle. However, the cap structure of the APC shell reduced the aerodynamic efficiency of the round with a resultant reduction in accuracy and range' Early World War II-era uncapped AP projectiles fired from high-velocity guns were able to penetrate about twice their caliber at close range (100 m). At longer ranges (500‚Äì1,000 m), this dropped to 1.5‚Äì1.1 calibers due to the poor ballistic shape and higher drag of the smaller- diameter early projectiles. Later in the conflict, APCBC fired at close range (100 m) from large-caliber, high-velocity guns (75‚Äì128 mm) were able to penetrate a much greater thickness of armor in relation to their caliber (2.5 times) and also a greater thickness (2‚Äì1.75 times) at longer ranges (1,500‚Äì2,000 m). Comparative testing of British Ordnance QF 17 pounder APCBC rounds fired into captured German Panther tanks indicated the APCBC munitions were more accurate than late war armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) shot.U.S. Army Firing Test No. 3, U.S. Army Firing Tests conducted August 1944 by 12th U.S. Army Group at Isigny, France. Report of tests conducted during 20‚Äì21 August 1944. APCBC shot was produced for a wide range of anti-tank artillery ranging from 2 pounders to the German 88 mm. This type of munition was also designated as APBC (Armor Piercing Ballistic Capped), in reference to the Soviet version of APCBC. APCBC shot was also used in naval armaments in World War II. After World War II, the trend in armor-piercing munitions development centered on sub-caliber projectiles. No tank guns designed since the late 1950s have used full-caliber AP, APC, or APCBC ammunition.Orgokiewicz, p. 77. Countermeasures One way to defeat APC rounds was to increase the thickness of armour. However, it became increasingly impractical to up-armour vehicles. One alternative was the use of spaced armour, which consists of a thin outer layer of armour sufficient to deform the armour piercing cap and a main armour layer sufficient to resist the now \\"decapped\\" round.

Each holds a grudge against each other yet they must reluctantly work together and deal with their shared evil pasts. Continuity Supposed to be set early in sixth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Angel third season, the story remains outside Buffyverse canon, and written long before Angel season 5 which would come to contradict certain continuity points. =Canonical issues= Buffy/Angel books such as this one are not usually considered by fans as canonical. Some fans consider them stories from the imaginations of authors and artists, while other fans consider them as taking place in an alternative fictional reality. However unlike fan fiction, overviews summarising their story, written early in the writing process, were 'approved' by both Fox and Joss Whedon (or his office), and the books were therefore later published as official Buffy/Angel merchandise. Although, the permanence of such officiality is understandably suspect, given the ret-con the Star Wars Expanded Universe underwent, following the purchase of licensing rights by Marvel/Disney.

It is a wide zither with strings made of twisted silk, played by means of a slender stick made of forsythia wood, which is scraped against the strings in the manner of a bow. The original version of the instrument, and that used in court music (called the jeongak ajaeng), has seven strings, while the ajaeng used for sanjo and sinawi (called the sanjo ajaeng) has eight strings; some instruments may have up to nine, ten or twelve strings. The ajaeng is generally played while seated on the floor. It has a tone similar to that of a cello, but raspier. Some contemporary players prefer to use an actual horsehair bow rather than a stick, believing the sound to be smoother. The instrument is used in court, aristocratic, and folk music, as well as in contemporary classical music and film scores. The ajaeng is derived from the Chinese yazheng (simplified: ËΩßÁ≠ù; traditional: ËªãÁÆè) and Vietnamese nha tranh in Nh√£ nh·∫°c ‚Äì Vietnamese court music.  History  Bowed the ajaeng On the Korean Peninsula, Chinese music started to be imported from the late 7th century before and after the unification of the three kingdoms. During the Goryeo Dynasty, Song's court music was widely accepted. In 1430, 'Uiryesangjeongso', the organization for the arrangement of court music and ceremonies arranged the institution of the Goryeo Dynasty and included Ajaeng to the instrument of Dangak. On the 'Five manners' in the annals of King Sejong, it describes the appearance of \\"Ajaeng\\". The line was seven, and the left was broken, with catters placed on it.  How to play  Instead of putting musical instruments on your lap, like a gayageum or a harpoon, you put on a pedestal called \\"Chosang\\" and hang the head of Ajaeng at an angle, and sit right with the bent tail on the floor. And makes a sound. The bark of the forsythia tree is peeled, and the surface is smoothed to make a ridge. Ribbon is used to paint the rosin because it reinforces the rubbing sound of string and string. Though the sound is rough because it makes a sound by rubbing a thick line with a forsythia tree instead of a horsehair, it is also a feature of Ajaeng. Nowadays, however, Sanjo Ajaeng is using a horsehooking band. Sometimes, ajaeng can plucked like gayageum.

E. Bosworth, Oriens 36 (2000), p. 304.) was a Turkic slave commander of the Samanid Empire, who would later become the semi-independent governor of Ghazna from 962 until his death in 963. Before becoming governor of Ghazni, Alp-Tegin was the commander-in-chief (sipahsalar) of the Samanid army in Khorasan. In a political fallout over succession of the Samanids he crossed the Hindu Kush mountains southward and captured Ghazna, located strategically between Kabul and Kandahar in present-day Afghanistan, and thereby establishing his own principality, which, however, was still under Samanid authority. He was succeeded by his son, Abu Ishaq Ibrahim. Biography =Origin= Alp-Tegin was originally part of the nomadic Turks that roamed the Central Asian steppes, but was later captured and brought as a slave to the Samanid capital of Bukhara, where he was raised in the Samanid court. Despite being of Turkic stock and allegedly in speech, Alp-Tegin was highly Persianized.David Christian: A History of Russia, Central Asia and Mongolia; Blackwell Publishing, 1998; pg. 370: \\"Though Turkic in origin [‚Ä¶] Alp Tegin, Sebuk Tegin and Mahmud were all thoroughly Persianized\\". = Service under Nuh I and Abd al-Malik I = During the reign of Nuh I (r. 943‚Äì954), Alp-Tegin was appointed as the head of the royal guard (hajib al-hujjab). During the reign of Nuh's son and successor Abd al-Malik I (r. 954-961), Alp-Tegin was appointed as the governor of Balkh, and by 961 he was the commander-in-chief (sipahsalar) of the Samanid army in Khorasan, thus succeeding Abu Mansur Muhammad. On 10 February 961, Alp-Tegin arrived to Nishapur with his vizier Abu Abdallah Muhammad ibn al-Shibli. Alp-Tegin also played a major role in the appointment of Muhammad Bal'ami as vizier, whom he became close allies with. 300px Abd al- Malik I died a few months later (November). Alp-Tegin and Bal'ami sought to use his death as an opportunity to make the deceased ruler's young son Nasr the new ruler, in order to rule on his behalf. However, several powerful figures of the Samanid state, such as Fa'iq Khassa, favored Abd al-Malik's brother Mansur I, and managed to make him the new ruler. Bal'ami then quickly went over to Fa'iq's side, leaving Alp-Tegin isolated. Mansur I upon his accession had Alp-Tegin dismissed from the governorship of Khorasan. =Flight and recognition as governor of Ghazna= Alp-Tegin then took his personal guard of Turkic slave-soldiers and group of Iranian ghazis to Balkh, where he in April 962 defeated an army sent by Mansur I. He then left for Ghazna, a small town in Zabulistan ruled by the local Lawik dynasty, defeating the forces of the local rulers of Bamiyan and Kabul along the way. He seized Ghazna from Abu Bakr Lawik, a kinsman of the Kabulshah, and secured his position by receiving an investiture from the Samanids as the governor of Ghazna. Alp-Tegin died a few months later (September 963) and was succeeded by his son Abu Ishaq Ibrahim. Sabuktigin, a slave who was bought by Alp-Tegin and had accompanied him to Ghazna, was appointed as the ruler of Ghazna by the Turks of the town in 977, marking the start of the Ghaznavid dynasty, which would go on to conquer all of Transoxiana and Khorasan.

Instead, the pattern of development was one of large cattle ranches on federal land, with the ranchers using the homestead laws to secure lakes and streams for their operations. In an effort to increase settlement in the northwestern portion of his state, Kinkaid sponsored and obtained passage of the Kinkaid Act, which amended the Homestead Act to enlarge the size of a homestead claim in certain arid regions of western Nebraska. Settlers on non-irrigable lands west of the 98th Meridian could claim up to . The measure was signed by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1904.

Attempts to farm the land thus obtained generally failed; but Kinkaid claims, together with regulations prohibiting fencing of federal land, led to the replacement of a few large ranches in the Sandhills with many smaller ones.

The victory of Genoa and the destruction of the Pisan fleet marked the decline of the Republic of Pisa.  Background  In the 13th century, the Republic of Genoa conquered numerous settlements in Crimea, where the Genoese colony of Caffa was established. The alliance with the restored Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty increased the wealth and power of Genoa and simultaneously decreased Venetian and Pisan commerce. The Byzantine Empire had granted most of their free trading rights to Genoa. In 1282, Pisa tried to gain control of the commerce and administration of Corsica, when Sinucello, the judge of Cinarca, revolted against Genoa and asked for Pisan support. In August 1282, part of the Genoese fleet blockaded Pisan commerce near the River Arno. During 1283, both Genoa and Pisa made war preparations. Pisa gathered soldiers from Tuscany and appointed captains from its noble families. Genoa built 120 galleys; sixty of these belonged to the Republic and the remainder were rented to individuals. This fleet required at least 15,000 to 17,000 rowers and seamen. In early 1284, the Genoese fleet tried to conquer Porto Torres and Sassari in Sardinia. Part of the Genoese merchant fleet defeated a Pisan force while travelling to the Byzantine Empire. The Genoese fleet blocked Porto Pisano and attacked Pisan ships travelling in the Mediterranean Sea. A Genoese force of thirty ships led by Benedetto Zaccaria travelled to Porto Torres to support Genoese forces which were besieging Sassari.  Battle  Fresco depicting the Battle of Meloria, Diano Castello, Liguria, Italy When the Genoese appeared off Meloria, the Pisans were lying in the Arno at the mouth of which lay Porto Pisano, the port of the city. The Pisan fleet represented the whole power of the city, and carried members of every family of mark and most of the officers of state. The Genoese, desiring to draw their enemy out to battle and to make the action decisive, arranged their fleet in two lines abreast. According to Agostino Giustiniani, the first was composed of fifty-eight galleys, and eight panfilia class of light galley of eastern origin named after the province of Pamphylia. Oberto Doria, the Genoese admiral, was stationed in the centre and in advance of his line. To the right were the galleys of the Spinola family, among those of four of the eight companies into which Genoa was divided: Castello, Piazzalunga, Macagnana and San Lorenzo. To the left were the galleys of the Doria family and the companies Porta, Soziglia, Porta Nuova and Il Borgo. The second line of twenty galleys under the command of Benedetto Zaccaria was placed so far behind the first that the Pisans could not see whether it was made up of war-vessels or of small craft meant to act as tenders to the others. It was near enough to strike in and decide the battle when the action had begun. The Pisans, commanded by the Podest√† Morosini and his lieutenants Ugolino della Gherardesca and Andreotto Saraceno, came out in a single body. While the Archbishop was blessing the fleet, the silver cross of his archiepiscopal staff fell off, but the omen was disregarded by the irreverence of the Pisans, who declared that if they had the wind they could do without divine help. The Pisan fleet advanced in line abreast to meet the first line of the Genoese, fighting according to the medieval custom of ramming and boarding. The victory was decided for Genoa by the squadron of Zaccaria, which fell on the flank of the Pisans. Their fleet was nearly annihilated, the Podest√† was captured and Ugolino fled with a few vessels.  Aftermath  Chains from Porto Pisano taken by Genoa (returned in 1860 to Pisa) Pisa was also attacked by Florence and Lucca, and it could never recover from the disaster. Two years later, Genoa took Porto Pisano, the city's access to the sea, and filled up the harbour. Pisa lost its role as a major Mediterranean naval power and a regional power of Tuscany, being overshadowed and finally conquered in 1406 by Florence. Count Ugolino was afterwards starved to death with several of his sons and grandsons, an event recounted in the 33rd canto of Dante's Inferno. One famous captive of the battle was Rustichello da Pisa, who co-wrote Marco Polo's account of his travels, Il Milione.

London: William Heinemann, 1921.  Mythology  left Cepheus is prominently featured in the Perseus legend as the husband of Cassiopeia and father of Princess Andromeda, and whose brother Phineus expected to marry Andromeda. Various sources described his kingdom to be \\"Aethiopia\\" or the city of Joppa (Jaffa) in Phoenicia which was named after the elder Cepheus' wife, Iope, daughter of Aeolus.Stephanus of Byzantium s.v. Iope: ·º∏œåœÄŒ∑ When Cepheus' proud wife Cassiopeia foolishly boasted that Andromeda was more beautiful than the Nereids, not only the sea-nymphs themselves but also Poseidon was angered. Thus, the sea god sent a flood and a sea monster Cetus to attack the Aethiopian land. Cepheus and Cassiopeia then consulted a wise oracle of Ammon (identified with Zeus), at the oasis of Siwa in the Libyan desert, who declared that the calamity would not be brought to an end until their daughter Andromeda was offered up to the monster. The king chained the princess to a rock by the shore at the insistence of his people to be devoured by Cetus. Andromeda was saved from this fate when Perseus, flying home with his trophy (i.e. head of Medusa), had passed by the kingdom of Cepheus and noticed that a girl of wonderful beauty was chained to a rock by the seashore. Perseus fell in love with her at first sight and undertook to slay the monster if she would promise to marry him; or, in a slightly different version, he approached her father Cepheus and won an equivalent promise from him. The hero then proceeded to kill the monster with his sword or sickle (or else turned it to stone by showing it the Gorgon‚Äôs head). Perseus washed off his blood in the spring near the city of Joppa which later became red water, because of his blood.Pausanias, Description of Greece 4.35.9 with an English Translation by W.H.S.

Cepheus and Cassiopeia allowed Perseus to become Andromeda's husband after he used Medusa's head to turn Phineus and his men to stone for plotting against him.Ovid, Metamorphoses 5. 1 - 238 According to Hyginus, the betrothed of Andromeda was named Agenor.Hyginus. Fabulae 64. After spending a year or so at the court of his father-in-law, Perseus finally set off for Seriphos with his wife. Since Cepheus had no heir of his own, the departing couple allowed him to adopt their first-born child, Perses, who was destined to give his name to the Persians.

It is situated approximately west of the coast of Sicily, between Trapani and Marsala, the coastal area where the Stagnone Lagoon and the international airport of Trapani, are sited. Island The island of Favignana is famous for its tuna fisheries and is now a popular tourist destination with frequent hydrofoil connections to the mainland. History In ancient times Favignana was called Aegusa, meaning \\"goat island\\" in Greek (ŒëŒπŒ≥ŒøœçœÉŒ±). The present name is derived from Favonio, an Italian name for the foehn wind. The Phoenicians established an outpost on the island as a stopping point on their trans-Mediterranean trading routes until the defeat of the Carthaginian army during the First Punic War. On 10 March 241 BC, a major naval battle was fought a short distance offshore between the two powers. Two hundred Roman ships under the consul Gaius Lutatius Catulus met and decisively defeated a much larger Carthaginian fleet of 400 ships, with the Romans sinking 120 Carthaginian vessels and taking 10,000 prisoners. So many dead Phoenicians washed ashore on the northeastern part of Favignana that the shoreline there acquired the name \\"Red Cove\\" (Cala Rossa) from the bloodshed. The Romans took possession of the island under the terms of the treaty that ended the war. In the early Middle Ages, Favignana was captured by Arabs and was used as a base for the Islamic conquest of Sicily. The Normans subsequently took possession of the island, and built fortifications there from 1081. Under the Aragonese rulers of Sicily, Favignana and the other Aegadian Islands were hired out to Genoese merchants and in the 15th century the islands were granted to one Giovanni de Karissima, who adopted the grand title \\"Baron of Tuna\\". The plentiful tuna fish found offshore were first exploited systematically under the Spanish from about the 17th century onwards. Facing severe financial problems from their ongoing wars, the Spanish sold the islands to the Marquis Pallavicino of Genoa in 1637. The Pallavicini substantially developed the economy of the island, prompting the establishment of the modern town of Favignana around the Castello San Giacomo. In 1874, the Pallavicino family sold the Aegadian Islands to Ignazio Florio, the son of a wealthy mainland industrialist, for two million liras. He invested heavily in Favignana and built a major tuna cannery on the island, bringing prosperity to many of the inhabitants. Calcarenite quarries were also opened with stone being exported to Tunisia and Libya. During the 20th century, Favignana's economy slumped between the two World Wars and many inhabitants emigrated to the mainland and abroad. The fishery declined with the rise of factory fishing after World War II. Thanks to the Parodi brothers, who bought the factory -- after the troubles of the Florio family -- tuna fishing continued through the 1980s. The factory is now a museum due to the unavoidable decline. The island's fortunes were turned around by the advent of tourism from the late 1960s onwards. During World War II, American Forces under Gen. Patton drove the Axis forces from Sicily. Two American officers, Lt. Louis Testa, and Capt. R.E. Gerard, were a two-man ‚Äòexpedition‚Äô which ‚Äòcaptured' the three Aegadian Islands and 1027 prisoners. The officers went over from a Sicilian fishing boat, which they paid $3. They went ashore on Favigna Island and the Italian Lt. Colonel surrendered it along with Levanzo and Marittimo islands and their garrisons. Geography Favignana is the largest of the three principal Egadi Islands, with a land area of . The island is often described as having a \\"butterfly\\" shape. Favignana town is located on a narrow isthmus connecting the two \\"wings\\", which have quite different characteristics. The eastern half of the island is largely flat, while the western half is dominated by a chain of hills of which Monte Santa Caterina is the tallest at . It is topped by a fort, originally established by the Saracens and still in use by the Italian military (and closed to the public). A number of small islands are situated off the south coast of Favignana. Main sights The island is famous for its caves of calcarenite rock (locally known as \\"tufo\\") and the ancient fishing technique of tonnara, with the trapping and mattanza (massacre) of bluefin tuna. As the island consists mainly of calcareous rocks, there are few beaches on the island; however, it is a popular site for scuba diving, snorkeling, and for day trips from nearby Trapani.

Childhood Gran√≥wko, Niezychowski's childhood home Niezychowski was born near Posen, Germany (now Pozna≈Ñ, Poland), the fourth child out of six to Stanis≈Çaw Nie≈ºychowski (1851-1897) and Lucia (≈Åucja) Taczanowska (1862-1917). Niezychowski's father died when he was nine years old. Two years later, his mother, now 37 years old, married the 29-year-old Count Rodryg Dunin, and had four more children. They lived on the Gran√≥wko estate, near Pozna≈Ñ. Niezychowski was educated at the German military school at Wahlstadt, Silesia, and at the naval schools at Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk) and Kiel. His oldest brother, Count Josef von Niezychowski, initially attained high rank in the army, but at the outbreak of World War II changed his allegiance and served as a General in the Polish Army. Career The German passenger liner Kronprinz Wilhelm As an adult, Niezychowski joined the German merchant marine of the Hamburg-American Line, and was an officer on such ships as the Hamburg-American liner and the North German Lloyd liner in 1914, before being transferred to his most famous assignment, the German passenger liner , where he held the rank of Lieutenant. He was later promoted to Lieutenant Commander in the German naval reserve and became second in command. The ship was one of the fastest in the world, having won the Blue Riband a few years earlier for the fastest-ever Atlantic crossing, in 5 days, 11 hours, and 57 minutes. Germany entered World War I in August 1914, while the ship was in port in New York City, and the Kronprinz Wilhelm was ordered into service with the Imperial German Navy as an auxiliary cruiser. She left port and rendezvoused with the to have deck guns installed, and then spent the next 251 days capturing and sinking commercial vessels off the coast of South America, while simultaneously evading capture by the Allies. The ship eventually ran out of supplies, and dozens of the men in her crew had become sick with beri-beri from the restricted diet on the long voyage. Her captain headed for Virginia, and successfully evading the British ships guarding the port, entered safe harbor at Newport News, in 1915. At the Norfolk Navy Yard, the ship and crew were originally interned as neutrals by the United States, until that country entered the war in 1917. Image of a page from The New York Times. At that time, Niezychowski and the rest of the crew became American prisoners of war and the ship was officially seized by the US Navy. Renamed the USS Von Steuben, she was turned into a troopship. American citizenship Despite officially being a prisoner of the United States, Niezychowski was evidently quite a popular storyteller among influential Americans, partially because he was the nephew of Baron Ladislaus Hengelm√ºller von Hengerv√°r, who had been Austro-Hungarian ambassador to the United States for decades, until retiring in 1913. Niezychowski was known as the \\"jolly Polish count\\" and after his release from Fort McPherson, Georgia in August 1919, he moved to Washington DC, where he was welcomed into diplomatic and society circles.Frederick Wallis at genealogyimagesofhistory.com He was also President of the Polish American Navigation Company of New York. In October 1923, Niezychowski became engaged to marry Nanine H. Ulman (1896-1972), a Baltimore socialite and Colonial Dame, daughter of Jacob A. Ulman of Helmore Farms in Green Spring Valley, and great grandniece of President Thomas Jefferson. Having renounced his European titles, Niezychowski became an American citizen in January 1926; the affianced couple married on December 27, 1927, with Admiral Walter McLean, commander of the Norfolk Navy Yard (where the groom's ship had been interned ten years earlier) was his best man. After their wedding, Niezychowski and his wife moved to Detroit, Michigan, where he entered the business world; He first worked as a salesman with a printing and advertising company, and later with the Seldon & Johnson real estate firm. In 1928, he published a book about the Kronprinz Wilhelm's 251-day adventure, and gave lectures on the subject.] He was known for signing autographs with green ink, and one of his lecture taglines was that of all of the ships that had been sunk during the ship's wartime duty, it had never caused the loss of a single human life. The capturing and sinking had been done in a very civilized, even courteous, manner. Passengers who had been taken aboard from a captured vessel were often given first class accommodations aboard the ex- passenger-liner/commerce-raider (members of the crew until they could be transferred to another ship). In 1932, while in the investment brokerage business, Niezychowski ran as a Democratic candidate for the Michigan First District. He was a staunch Democrat, and wanted to fight for the immediate repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment, as well as lowering tariff laws to restore foreign trade. However, he lost in the primary election to George G. Sadowski. Niezychowski and Nanine had no biological children, though Niezychowski did become guardian for the children of his half-brother Count Antoni Dunin, after both Antoni and his wife, Zofia Werner Dunin (daughter of Polish vice-Finance Minister Edward Werner), had been killed in 1939, during the German offensive in the Invasion of Poland. According to the Detroit News, Alfred worked with Senator Homer Ferguson of Michigan, to obtain visas so that the orphaned children could enter the United States in the 1940s. They were: * Count Stanley Dunin, who later participated in a NASA project, launching the world's first geosynchronous communications satellite * Countess Magda Dunin Hirata, who later married Japanese-American scientist Arthur Hirata * Countess Christine Dunin Zika, later the mother of noted botanist Peter Zika In 1964, Niezychowski died in Michigan, and was buried in Mount Elliott Cemetery in Grosse Pointe.

A renogram, which may also be known as a MAG3 scan, allows a nuclear medicine physician or a radiologist to visualize the kidneys and learn more about how they are functioning. MAG3 is an acronym for mercapto acetyl tri glycine, a compound that is chelated with a radioactive element ‚Äì technetium-99m. The two most common radiolabelled pharmaceutical agents used are Tc99m-MAG3 (MAG3 is also called mercaptoacetyltriglycine or mertiatide) and Tc99m-DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentacetate). Some other radiolabelled pharmaceuticals are EC (Ethylenedicysteine) and 131-iodine labelled OIH (ortho-iodohippurate). Scan procedure After injection into the venous system, the compound is excreted by the kidneys and its progress through the renal system can be tracked with a gamma camera. A series of images are taken at regular intervals. Processing then involves drawing a region of interest (ROI) around both kidneys, and a computer program produces a graph of radioactivity inside the kidney with time, representing the quantity of tracer, from the number of counts measured inside in each image (representing a different time point). If the kidney is not getting blood for example, it will not be viewed at all, even if it looks structurally normal in medical ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging. If the kidney is getting blood, but there is an obstruction inferior to the kidney in the bladder or ureters, the radioisotope will not pass beyond the level of the obstruction, whereas if there is a partial obstruction then there is a delayed transit time for the MAG3 to pass. More information can be gathered by calculating time activity curves; with normal kidney perfusion, peak activity should be observed after 3‚Äì5 minutes. The relative quantitative information gives the differential function between each kidney's filtration activity. Tracers MAG3 is preferred over Tc-99m-DTPA in neonates, patients with impaired function, and patients with suspected obstruction, due to its more efficient extraction. The MAG3 clearance is highly correlated with the effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), and the MAG3 clearance can be used as an independent measure of kidney function. After intravenous administration, about 40-50% of the MAG3 in the blood is extracted by the proximal tubules with each pass through the kidneys; the proximal tubules then secrete the MAG3 into the tubular lumen. Tc-99m-DTPA is filtered by the glomerulus and may be used to measure the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (in a separate test), making it theoretically the best (most accurate) choice for kidney function imaging. The extraction fraction of DTPA is approximately 20%, less than half that of MAG3. DTPA is the second most commonly used renal radiopharmaceutical in the United States. Clinical use The technique is very useful in evaluating the functioning of kidneys. Radioisotopes can differentiate between passive dilatation and obstruction. It is widely used before kidney transplantation to assess the vascularity of the kidney to be transplanted and with a test dose of captopril to highlight possible renal artery stenosis in the donor's other kidney, and later the performance of the transplant. The use of the test to identify reduced kidney function after test doses of captopril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medication) has also been used to identify the cause of hypertension in patients with kidney failure. Initially there was uncertainty as to the usefulness, or best test parameter to identify renal artery stenosis, the eventual consensus was that the distinctive finding is of alteration in the differential function. History In 1986, MAG3 was developed at the University of Utah by Dr. Alan R. Fritzberg, Dr. Sudhakar Kasina, and Dr. Dennis Eshima. The drug underwent clinical trials in 1987 and passed Phase III testing in 1988. 99mTc-MAG3 has replaced the older iodine-131 orthoiodohippurate or I131-Hippuran because of better quality imaging regardless of the level of kidney function, and with the benefit of being able to administer lower radiation dosages.

Planning for the ship began in the 1970s to provide the Australian Army with a permanent sealift capability. She was laid down by Carrington Slipways in 1979, launched in 1980, and commissioned in 1981. She was a multi-purpose, roll-on/roll-off heavy lift ship capable of transporting soldiers, APCs, and tanks, and delivering them to shore via landing craft or directly by beaching. The ship experienced problems during her early career with her engines (which differed from the British base design) and sewerage system (leading to the death of a cadet in 1981). During the 1980s, the ship delivered supplies to the Multinational Force and Observers on the Sinai Peninsula, assisted in the withdrawal from RAAF Base Butterworth, provided support and accommodation for delegates to the South Pacific Forum, and was part of the Australian response to the 1987 Fijian coups d'√©tat. In the early 1990s, Tobruk was part of ceremonies marking the 75th anniversary of the landing at Anzac Cove, then after a refit, participated in peacekeeping efforts in Somalia. Plans to replace Tobruk with one of the Kanimbla-class ships began in 1993. She was offered for sale to the Royal New Zealand Navy, who refused because of the ship's manpower requirements. Delays in converting the Kanimbla for service meant Tobruk continued with normal operations during the 1990s. Attempts to sell the ship to the British and the Portuguese did not succeed, and in 1997 the decision was made to keep Tobruk, as the Kanimbla could not completely replace the heavy lift capability provided. During this period, Tobruk was deployed to Bougainville on several occasions as peacekeeping operations during the Bougainville Civil War. At the end of the decade, Tobruk operated as part of the INTERFET peacekeeping operation in East Timor. In 2000 and 2001, Tobruk was sent to the Solomon Islands on several deployments in response to the civil war: first to evacuate Australian citizens, then as a neutral venue for peace talks. From late 2001 to early 2002, the ship was in northern Australian waters on border-protection duties as part of Operation Relex. During 2005 and early 2006, Tobruk sailed to the Middle East on several occasions to deliver vehicles and cargo to Australian forces in the region. Tobruk and the two Kanimbla were set to East Timor in mid-2006 in response to the 2006 East Timorese crisis, forming the first RAN amphibious readiness group since World War II. The rest of the decade included further border protection deployments under Operation Resolute, a visit to Hawaii for the RIMPAC multinational naval exercise, support for the Army Aboriginal Community Assistance Program, relief operations following the 2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami, and use as the venue for a Fall Out Boy concert. After spending several months in 2010 undergoing extended maintenance, Tobruk participated in the United States Navy's Pacific Partnership humanitarian assistance deployment. Because of the need for propeller shaft repairs, Tobruk could not be part of the military response to Cyclone Yasi. Heavy use and lack of maintenance in previous years began to take its toll, with Tobruk unavailable for service on several occasions during the early 2010s. As the two Kanimbla had been forced out of service by ongoing issues, the Australian government had to charter a succession of civilian ships to provide standby heavy transport capability. In 2013, Tobruk again participated in Pacific Partnership, followed by a visit to the Philippines with disaster relief supplies after Typhoon Haiyan. In early 2015, the ship was part of the response to Cyclone Pam's impact on Vanuatu. Tobruk was decommissioned in July 2015, and was scuttled as a dive wreck in June 2018. Design and construction In the late 1970s, it was decided that the Australian Army needed to be provided with a long-term sealift capability, preferably through the acquisition of a dedicated cargo ship.Jones, in Stevens (2001), p. 222. The chartering of civilian ships to provide this capability when required‚Äîas had been done with the merchant vessels and during the Vietnam War‚Äîwas considered and rejected, because Australian National Line was unable to provide the necessary level of support. It was decided that a purpose-built ship would be constructed for the role, and would be operated by the RAN. While the Army did not require that the ship be capable of beaching, the RAN set this as a requirement, to maximise the ship's flexibility. In 1975, the Navy successfully convinced Australian Military's Force Structure Committee to endorse this requirement over the Army's opposition, and the committee authorised the purchase of a Landing Ship Heavy (LSH) on 19 March 1975.Doolan (2007), pp. 8‚Äì13. HMAS Tobruk beaching during an exercise in 2006 Two designs were considered for Tobruk, with a modified Sir- or Round Table- class landing ship logistics, in use with the Royal Fleet Auxiliary at the time, selected for construction. Tobruk design was based on RFA Sir Bedivere, the second of the class, which had been modified following the Royal Fleet Auxiliary's experience with operating the class' lead ship, RFA Sir Lancelot. The ship is designed as a multi-purpose, roll-on/roll-off heavy lift and transport vessel.Royal Australian Navy, HMAS Tobruk (II) ‚Äì Part 1 The Australian modifications to the design were kept to a minimum to simplify construction; the most significant changes were to improve the ship's ability to operate both large and multiple helicopters, fitting an operations room, and adding a derrick with a lift of 70 tonnes. Most of the other changes related to bringing accommodation conditions into line with Australian requirements. Like the other ships of the Round Table class, Tobruk was built to commercial rather than military standards, and is unable to sustain as much damage as warships.Doolan (2007), pp. 16‚Äì18. The ship has a standard displacement of 3,353 tons, and a full load displacement of 5,791 tons. She is in length, with a beam of , and a draught of . Propulsion machinery consists of two Mirrlees Blackstone KDMR8 diesels, which provide to the ship's two propeller shafts.Saunders (ed.), (2012), p. 32. The ship was fitted with different engines to those used in the equivalent British ships, which were proven unreliable early in Tobruk career.Doolan (2007), pp. 28‚Äì30. Top speed is , with a range of at . A bow thruster is also fitted to assist with confined-waters manoeuvring. Armament initially consisted of two 40/60 Bofors guns, supplemented by two 12.7 mm machine guns.Sharpe (ed.), (1998), p. 30 During the 1990s, the Bofors were removed.Royal Australian Navy (2007), Last blast for Bofors They were later replaced by two Mini Typhoon 12.7 mm mounts, which were not permanently installed but fitted as needed, and the number of standard 12.7 mm machine guns was increased to six. The sensor suite includes a Kelvin Hughes Type 1006 surface search radar and a Kelvin Hughes Type 1007 navigational radar. In 2012, the ship's company was 148, including 13 officers. Tobruk is capable of embarking between 300 and 520 soldiers (extended duration versus short term), along with 1,300 tons of cargo or 330 lane metres of vehicles (equivalent to 18 Leopard 1 or M1 Abrams main battle tanks plus 40 M113 armored personnel carriers or Australian Light Armoured Vehicles). Vehicles and cargo can be embarked via bow or stern ramps, with the reinforced tank-deck running the length of the ship, and inter-deck transfer ramps fitted. The bow ramp is contained behind horizontal-opening bow doors, and can be extended and lowered for beach or harbour loading, while at the stern a combined door-ramp can be used conventionally when at suitable facilities, or for ramp-to-ramp loading of landing craft at sea. Additional cargo handling is provided by the 70-tonne Velle heavy lift derrick (a feature singled out for attention in Jane's Fighting Ships), supplemented by two 8.5-tonne Favco cranes. Two LCM-8 landing craft can be carried in cradles on the main deck, while two LCVP are carried in derricks on the superstructure. Two Naval Lighterage Equipment pontoons can be carried on the ship's flanks to extend the reach of the bow ramp when beaching, or as rafts to transport cargo ashore.Gillett (1988), p. 81 The ship has an aft helicopter platform capable of handling aircraft up to Sea King size, while the main deck (once cleared of landing craft and cargo) can be used as a secondary flight deck for helicopters up to Chinook size.Gillett (1988), p. 80 Both flight decks can be operated simultaneously, and both have capability for landed or at-hover refuelling. Tobruk was built by Carrington Slipways, Tomago, New South Wales. The company was selected following a competitive tender in May 1977, with contract negotiations completed on 3 November 1977.Doolan (2007), pp. 25‚Äì26. Construction of Tobruk formally began on 7 February 1978, when the ship's keel was laid. Tobruk was launched on 1 March 1980 by Lady Anna Cowen, wife of Governor General Zelman Cowen. The ship left the dockyard for the first time in December 1980: her construction had been delayed by over four months by industrial disputes, and her final cost of A$59 million was 42 percent greater than originally estimated.Doolan (2007), pp. 30‚Äì36. The ship's sea trials were conducted in early 1981 off Newcastle and Port Stephens by a joint Navy-Army- civilian crew, and fitting out was completed on 7 April 1981. Tobruk was handed over to the Navy on 11 April 1981 and was commissioned at Newcastle on 23 April.Doolan (2007), pp. 45‚Äì49. The ship's name had been selected in 1976 and refers to the Siege of Tobruk during World War II, in which the RAN's 'Scrap Iron Flotilla' supplied the besieged 9th Australian Division.Doolan (2007), p. 15. She is the second RAN ship of this name; preceded by the Battle-class destroyer . She is the first purpose-built major amphibious vessel in RAN service, and is classified as a Landing Ship Heavy by the RAN. Operational history =1980s= Following her commissioning, Tobruk proceeded to her initial home port of in Brisbane, Queensland for the first time, then undertook further sea trials. These trials were conducted during the winter of 1981, and were intended to both test whether the ship met her design specifications and develop procedures for landing helicopters and beaching. The trials were generally successful, although Tobruk engines continued to be unreliable and problems were encountered with the sewage system.Doolan (2007), pp. 50‚Äì54. The ship undertook its first tasking in the spring of 1981 when she transported elements of the 16th Air Defence Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery from Adelaide to Port Alma, Queensland. Following this Tobruk proceeded to Port Phillip Bay and suffered a serious engine malfunction while approaching Station Pier. While the engines were repaired, the main engine control mechanism was later found to be entirely unreliable and had to be redesigned and reconstructed at Brisbane. During trials following this repair the ship's sewerage system seriously malfunctioned, fatally gassing one of the Australian Navy Cadets who had been embarked for seagoing experience.Doolan (2007), pp. 54‚Äì56. The cadet's death led to an inquiry into the ship by the Commonwealth Government's Auditor General which concluded that she should not have been accepted by the RAN at the time she was commissioned due to the number of defects still present. HMAS Tobruk in 1987 Tobruk conducted her first trips outside Australia in the early 1980s. On 15 February 1982, the ship left Brisbane to transport eight UH-1 Iroquois helicopters from the Royal Australian Air Force, plus supporting stores, to join the Australian contingent to the Multinational Force and Observers in the Sinai Peninsula. Tobruk arrived in Ashdod, Israel on 19 March, becoming the first Australian warship to visit the country, and arrived back in Brisbane on 30 April. The ship transported cyclone relief stores to Tonga in May and spent the remainder of the year undertaking tasks in Australian waters. These included supporting the 1982 Commonwealth Games, which were held in Brisbane. In early 1983, Tobruk travelled to Malaysia to assist the RAAF in withdrawing units from RAAF Base Butterworth. In February 1984, Tobruk took part in exercises in New Zealand, before travelling to Tuvalu in August, where she provided support and accommodation for delegates to the South Pacific Forum.Doolan (2007), pp. 57‚Äì66. In late 1985, the naval base was decommissioned, prompting the disbanding of the Amphibious Squadron (which had consisted of Tobruk and the six Balikpapan-class landing craft) and the relocation of Tobruk homeport to Fleet Base East in Sydney.Jones, in Stevens (2001), p. 243 In May 1987, Tobruk formed part of the Australian military force which deployed to Fiji following the 1987 Fijian coups d'√©tat. The goal of this deployment, which was designated Operation Morris Dance, was to evacuate Australian citizens if necessary. Tobruk left Sydney carrying Army stores and five helicopters on 21 May and embarked 'B' Company of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1RAR) at Norfolk Island on 23 May. Tobruk joined HMA Ships , and off Suva on 26 May. By this time it had become clear that there would not be a need to evacuate Australians from Fiji, and Tobruk proceeded to support the South Pacific Forum meeting at Apia, Samoa after cross-decking the troops and their supplies to the other ships. Operation Morris Dance revealed serious shortcomings in the Australian Defence Force's ability to deploy forces outside Australia, with the Army unit having no previous experience of amphibious operations and the naval helicopters being unable to carry Army supplies.Doolan (2007), pp. 69‚Äì73. After Operation Morris Dance, Tobruk returned to mainly routine duties. She travelled to New Zealand on a training cruise in early 1988 and was placed on alert to carry an Army force to evacuate Australian civilians from Vanuatu in April 1988 following a political crisis there. While Tobruk was loaded with stores and three Sea King helicopters, this deployment did not eventuate and the ship was unloaded on 24 May. The ship transported the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment's vehicles and supplies to the west coast of the United States in early 1989 and participated in a joint Australian, British, Canadian and United States amphibious warfare exercise at Monterey Bay. The ship then visited Canada before returning to Australia. In December 1989, Tobruk was forced to undergo unscheduled repairs at Newcastle to repair damage caused by excessive vibration, which had possibly been caused by her engines revving at a higher rate than the ship had been designed for.Doolan (2007), pp. 74‚Äì82. =1990s= Tobruk began the 1990s with another deployment at short notice to the South Pacific. On 26 January 1990, she was tasked to assist with evacuating Australian citizens from Bougainville in Papua New Guinea; this operation was cancelled in early February while the ship was travelling to the island from Sydney. On 5 March, Tobruk left Sydney bound for Gallipoli, Turkey in company with HMAS Sydney to participate in ceremonies marking the 75th anniversary of the landing at Anzac Cove. Tobruk carried vehicles, stores and support personnel for the ceremony on 25 April, with many of the ship's crew also going ashore to visit the battlefields on Anzac Day.Doolan (2007), p. 82‚Äì88. In 1991, the ship was refitted by Forgacs (formerly Carrington Slipways) in the company's new floating dock. The refit was delayed by industrial action by the Painters and Dockers Union. Tobruk with underway as part of an Australian/U.S. Navy task group commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1992 In late December 1992, Tobruk was selected to take part in Operation Solace, Australia's contribution to the international peacekeeping effort in Somalia. Initial notice of the deployment was given on 9 December, then confirmed on 15 December, with personnel recalled from leave.Royal Australian Navy, HMAS Tobruk (II) ‚Äì Part 2 Working- up exercises ran between 22 and 26 December, before the ship left Sydney for Townsville. En route, the ship's company was informed that Tobruk would remain on station in Somalia for the duration of Operation Solace. In Townsville, equipment and vehicles for 1RAR and elements of the 3rd/4th Cavalry Regiment (Australia). Tobruk sailed for Somalia on 1 January 1993: the loading process was delayed by another serious toxic gas incident in one of the ship's sewerage plants. The sealift operation in support Operation Solace, conducted by Tobruk and , was the largest performed by the RAN since the Vietnam War. Tobruk arrived at Mogadishu on 19 January, and unloaded during 20 January. She spent the next few days at anchor, during which she was used as a training platform for boarding and seizure operations by the United States Navy SEALs, in their preparation for the arrival of a merchant vessel smuggling weapons. Between 26 and 28 January, Tobruk visited Mombasa, Kenya to collect building materials for the reconstruction of the United States embassy in Somalia. The ship remained in Somali waters until late May, apart from runs to Mombasa to embark humanitarian supplies, along with a port visit to the Seychelles in late April. As well as providing heavy lift and logistic support, Tobruk provided the main communications link for 1RAR back to Australia, and served as a venue for rest and recreation for soldiers. Re-embarkation of Australian equipment began on 14 May, and Tobruk sailed for home on 20 May.Doolan (2007), pp. 89‚Äì101. The ship called at Diego Garcia and Singapore before unloading in Townsville, then returning to Sydney on 21 June. After a maintenance period lasting until August, Tobruk resumed normal exercise and training routines. The ship was awarded the Gloucester Cup for 1993 for her service off Somalia and subsequent operations during the year. In 1993, the Australian Government decided to purchase two ex-United States Navy Newport-class tank landing ships to replace Tobruk and the navy's training and sealift ship Jervis Bay in 1994. Plans were developed to place Tobruk in reserve or lease her to the Royal New Zealand Navy. While the New Zealand government was interested in obtaining a sealift ship, the RNZN did not feel that it could afford to crew and operate Tobruk and the negotiations with New Zealand ended unsuccessfully in September 1994. The unexpected difficulty of converting the two LSTs into the Kanimbla class led to the date of Tobruk retirement being postponed to mid-1996, with the ship continuing normal operations.Doolan (2007), pp. 105‚Äì107. After the negotiations with New Zealand ended, the RAN opened negotiations with the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, which was considering scrapping one of their Round Tables and replacing it with Tobruk. A British team travelled to Australia to inspect the ship in December 1994, but this sale did not eventuate. The Portuguese Navy expressed interest in buying Tobruk in 1995 and sent a team to Sydney in 1996 to inspect the ship. During this period Tobruk remained in active service, and in 1997 the new Liberal Party government decided to retain her until 2010 as the two LSTs could not fully replace her ability to carry heavy equipment. The period of uncertainty about the ship's fate led to a deterioration in her material condition, as she did not receive a major refit during the period she was up for sale.Doolan (2007), pp. 110‚Äì113. Tobruk played an important role in efforts to end the civil war in Bougainville during the 1990s. In September 1994, she transported an Australian peacekeeping force to Bougainville to protect peace talks which were attempting to end the civil war on the island. These talks were not successful and during the deployment one of the ship's Sea King helicopters was damaged by small arms fire; the first damage sustained by a RAN unit since the Vietnam War.Doolan (2007), pp. 107‚Äì110. A peace agreement was signed in October 1997, and Tobruk returned to Bougainville in November of that year to deploy a peace monitoring group. The ship made several voyages to the island during the first four months of 1998 to support the peace process. Further voyages to Bougainville took place in September 1998, February 2000 and August 2003; the last of these was to extract the peace monitoring group following the successful conclusion of this mission. Tobruk also participated in a major international exercise in South East Asia in 1999.Doolan (2007), pp. 115‚Äì119. In 1999 and 2000, Tobruk took part in the international peacekeeping effort in East Timor. On 30 August 1999, the day the referendum which led to East Timor's independence was held, she left Sydney for Townsville to load elements of the 3rd Brigade in case there was a need to evacuate Australians and other foreigners from East Timor. The referendum was followed by widespread violence and the Indonesian government agreed to an international peacekeeping force (the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) being deployed to East Timor in mid-September. Tobruk left Darwin on 18 September under escort by , and arrived at Dili on 21 September. The ship made six further voyages between Darwin and East Timor in September and October 1999, and continued to make an important contribution to the peacekeeping operation until November, when she returned to Sydney for maintenance. Tobruk made two further trips to East Timor in March and April 2000.Doolan (2007), pp. 121‚Äì125. Tobruk was later awarded the battle honour \\"East Timor 1999\\" in recognition of her contribution to INTERFET. =2000‚Äì2015= In mid-2000, a civil war broke out in the Solomon Islands; Tobruk was ordered to the Islands' capital, Honiara, to evacuate Australian citizens. She arrived on 8 June and embarked 486 civilians, who were then transported to Cairns, Queensland. After a brief maintenance period, Tobruk returned to the Solomons in late June, where she served as the venue for peace talks. She spent almost all of July at anchor off Honiara and returned to Australia after a cease-fire agreement was signed on board the ship on 2 August. Tobruk made a further voyage to the Solomons in December 2000 to support the International Peace Monitoring team which had been established there. A peace treaty ending the conflict was signed on board the ship on 7 February 2001 and she returned to Sydney on 15 February.Doolan (2007), pp. 127‚Äì131. Tobruk took part of Operation Relex in late 2001 and early 2002 where she transported would-be refugees to Nauru and Christmas Island. She also made a further voyage from Darwin to East Timor in April 2002 to deliver supplies to the Australian Defence Force units there.Doolan (2007), pp. 133‚Äì136. Tobruk unloading an ASLAV during her deployment to the Middle East in 2005 In April 2005, HMAS Tobruk left Sydney to transport 20 ASLAVs to Kuwait, where they would equip the Australian Army's Al Muthanna Task Group in Iraq. The ASLAVs were embarked at Darwin on 18 April and the ship arrived at Kuwait on 9 May. She returned to Australia via India, arriving back in Sydney on 22 June.Doolan (2007), pp. 138‚Äì141. Tobruk undertook a second voyage to the Middle East in late 2006 to transport the equipment for the Army forces in the Reconstruction Task Force in Afghanistan and arrived home via the Philippines in April 2007.Brooke (2008), Tobruk spirit Tobruk travelled to Nias Island in Indonesia in March 2006 to support ceremonies commemorating the anniversary of the crash of Sea King helicopter Shark 02 there on 2 April 2005. Following this deployment, she took part in Exercise Croix du Sud off New Caledonia, then proceeded to the Philippines where she was to embark an OV-10 Bronco aircraft for the Australian War Memorial.Doolan (2007), pp. 143‚Äì145. In mid- May, Tobruk was recalled from her voyage to the Philippines to embark elements of the 3rd Brigade for an urgent deployment to East Timor following fighting caused by unrest in the country's military. She proceeded to Dili in company with the Navy's two Kanimbla-class landing platform amphibious ships. This was the first time that an Australian amphibious readiness group had been formed since World War II.Sea Power Centre (2006). The Group departed from Townsville on 23 May and arrived at Dili a few days later. After unloading her cargo, Tobruk returned to Townsville where she embarked a second load of vehicles and supplies for the Australian forces in East Timor, arriving back at Dili in the first week of June. She returned to Sydney in late June.Doolan (2007), pp. 145‚Äì147. In November 2006 it was reported that while the Department of Defence had engaged a specialist to supervise the removal of large quantities of asbestos from Tobruk, her crew were concerned that the ship was continuing operations during the overhaul. The report also stated that removal of the material had been delayed for several years due to the ship's high operational tempo. In late December 2007, two groups of 60 Australian Navy Cadets and staff were embarked aboard Tobruk for the final part of the ship's deployment with Operation Resolute and the return voyage from Darwin to Sydney.Royal Australian Navy (2008). This was the first time cadets had been embarked under these conditions. The first group remained aboard until Tobruk arrived in Cairns, where they were replaced with the second group for the return to Sydney. An 817 Squadron RAN Sea King helicopter landing on Tobruk stern flight deck in 2008 In 2008, Tobruk formed part of the Australia Defence Force's contingent during the annual RIMPAC exercise off Hawaii. She left Sydney on 10 June and returned on 18 August. During the exercise Tobruk embarked and landed United States Marines Amphibious Assault Vehicles. In October, Tobruk and supported the Army Aboriginal Community Assistance Program (AACAP) by transporting equipment from Kalumburu, Western Australia at the end of an AACAP project. On 22 February 2009, Tobruk was used as the venue for a Fall Out Boy concert. From 3 April to 24 June she operated off northern Australia as part of Operation Resolute. On 16 April she was one of the ships which responded to an explosion on board the refugee ship 'Siev 36'. During this operation she provided medical treatment to people wounded in the blast and her embarked Sea King helicopter flew the more badly injured to Mungalalu Truscott Airbase. Tobruk subsequently carried 136 refugees to Christmas Island in early May. During the period 3 April to 24 June she spent 79 days at sea and only four in port, steamed and embarked more than 250 asylum seekers. In October 2009 she sailed to Samoa to conduct relief operations after the islands were affected by the 2009 Samoa earthquake and tsunami. Tobruk completed a period of extended maintenance in April 2010. As of late May that year, she had sailed during her service with the RAN. During the first week of September 2010, Tobruk and two other RAN amphibious ships participated in the United States-led Pacific Partnership 2010 deployment in Papua New Guinea. Tobruk during International Fleet Review 2013 Open Day In early 2011, Tobruk was at Garden Island Naval Dockyard for heavy repairs to the propeller shaft. As a result, she was not available to participate in Operation Yasi Assist following Severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi and, due to both ships of the Kanimbla class being out of service with mechanical problems, the Navy did not have an amphibious transport capacity at the time. Minister for Defence Stephen Smith stated afterwards that he was misinformed about when Tobruk would be ready to put to sea if required. Temporary repairs were completed by 7 March, and the ship was returned to \\"48-hours deployment notice\\" status, although more permanent repairs will be required in the future. Following the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011, Tobruk and Sydney were placed on alert to transport supplies and Australian Army engineers to Japan if this was requested by the Japanese Government. In May 2011, the ship began a two-month- long maintenance period in Sydney. To provide an amphibious capability during this refit, the civilian icebreaker Aurora Australis was chartered from May until August. Although Tobruk was to be active during late August and early September, she would then return to dockyard hands for further maintenance during September and October in preparation for the 2011‚Äì12 tropical cyclone season. The Australian Customs vessel Ocean Protector was used for humanitarian and disaster relief operations during Tobruk docking. In June 2013, Tobruk was deployed to Papua New Guinea as part of the annual United States Navy Pacific Partnership humanitarian assistance operation. Tobruk was designated the command platform for Pacific Partnership operations around Papua New Guinea during her seven-week deployment, and she was accompanied by the Japanese destroyer Yamagiri. In October, Tobruk participated in the International Fleet Review 2013. On 18 November, the ship sailed from Townsville with disaster relief supplies for Tacloban City and coastal regions of Leyte in the Philippines following Typhoon Haiyan. The ship returned to Sydney on 21 December. In March 2015, Tobruk was deployed to Vanuatu as part of Australia's response to Cyclone Pam. The ship embarked 355 personnel and a helicopter. Tobruk visited Newcastle, her city of origin, for the seventh and final time on 19 June 2015. From there, the ship sailed to Sydney, arriving on 25 June. That day Prime Minister Tony Abbott, Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten and Speaker of the House of Representatives Bronwyn Bishop made statements in parliament acknowledging the ship's service. Decommissioning and fate Tobruk was decommissioned in Sydney on 31 July 2015. During her 34-year operational history, Tobruk sailed over , and was deployed on 26 major operations (more than any other ADF unit), leading to a reputation as the \\"workhorse of the RAN\\". Several entities called for the ship to be scuttled as a dive wreck. Federal Member of Parliament Keith Pitt spent several years campaigning for the scuttling of a warship in Hervey Bay as a tourist attraction, with Tobruk his preferred vessel. Another proposal came from the community of St Helens, Tasmania, for the ship to be sunk in Skeleton Bay. The Gold Coast also expressed interest. On 2 December 2016 it was announced that Tobruk would be scuttled off the Fraser Coast, at a location halfway between Bundaberg and Hervey Bay, by late 2018. As the ship awaited its scuttling, Tobruk was located between the Australian Navy Cadet Base TS Bundaberg and the Burnett Heads Marina. The ship was transported to this area in late 2016 and was used as a tourist attraction whilst undergoing preparations for scuttling. She was sunk off the coast between Bundaberg and Hervey Bay on 29 June 2018. Instead of coming to rest upright on its keel as planned, the ship rolled 90 degrees to starboard (right) and came to rest on its side in a position that severely limits dive opportunities.

Alternate spellings include Gusyatin, Husyatin, and Hsiatyn. Husiatyn is the administrative center of the Husiatyn Raion (district), and is located on the west bank of the Zbruch River. This river formed the old boundary between Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire in the nineteenth century, and the boundary between the Republic of Poland and the Soviet Union during the inter-war period of the twentieth century. History Husiatyn was first mentioned in documents in 1559, a time when it was part of the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth and the year that it was granted self-government under the Magdeburg Law. At this time it was located in the province of Podolia. It came under Austrian rule in 1772 with other parts of Southern Podolia (the region between the Zbruch and the Seret rivers) and attached to the Austrian crownland of Galicia and Lodomeria. The Emperor Joseph II toured this area immediately after its annexation to Austria and was very impressed by the fertility of the soil and its future prospects. It remained a county centre under Austrian rule until the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the declaration of the Western Ukrainian People's Republic in late 1918. In 1919, the Ukrainian Galician Army fought the Bolsheviks there but was driven out by the Poles who thereafter annexed the area to the Second Polish Republic. In 1939 it was annexed to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Husiatyn was occupied by Nazi troops on July 6, 1941. As soon as they arrived, approximately 200 Jews were sent to the labor camps or killed immediately by Germans and Ukrainian police. In March 1942, the Jews who remained were transported to concentration camps in Kopychyntsi, Probizhna and Belzec. In the nineteenth century, the population of Husiatyn County was predominantly Ukrainian, though there was a small Polish landowning stratum and some Jews in the town. In the late nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century, Southern Podolia, including Husiatyn County witnessed large-scale out-migration of its peasant population to western Canada. =Husiatyn and Hasidism= Synagogue in Husiatyn Husiatyn was home to a large Jewish population prior to the Holocaust, and in particular was the base for a significant Hasidic group of the Husiatyner dynasty and their Rebbes, that went four generations in Husiatyn: Shraga Feivish Friedman, (1835-1894) 1st Rebbe of Husiatyn; Yisroel Friedman, (1858-1949) 2nd Rebbe of Husiatyn, Yaakov Friedman, (1878-1957) 3rd Rebbe of Husiatyn, and Yitzchok Friedman, (1900-1968) 4th and last Rebbe of Husiatyn. Monuments Colonnade in Husiatyn Architectural monuments in the town of Husiatyn include the ruins of a seventeenth-century castle, a sixteenth-century church, a seventeenth- century town hall and synagogue built in the Renaissance style, and a sixteenth-century Bernardine monastery and church. Prior to 1928, in the village of Chornokintsi Velyki (Czarnoko≈Ñce Wielkie in Polish), Husiatyn County, a Neolithic grave complete with a coffin was found. The Husiatyn Synagogue, is a rare example of a sixteenth-century Fortress synagogue and was restored and used as a museum until about 20 years ago. Today The population in 1978 was estimated at 2,800. In 2017, it was 7,139. References * Paulus Adelsgruber, L. Cohen, B.

TAg is capable of inducing malignant transformation of a variety of cell types. The transforming activity of TAg is due in large part to its perturbation of the retinoblastoma (pRb) and p53 tumor suppressor proteins. In addition, TAg binds to several other cellular factors, including the transcriptional co- activators p300 and CBP, which may contribute to its transformation function.Ali SH, DeCaprio JA (2001). \\"Cellular transformation by SV40 large T antigen: interaction with host proteins\\". Semin Cancer Biol 11 (1): 15‚Äì23. TAg is a product of an early gene transcribed during viral infection by SV40, and is involved in viral genome replication and regulation of host cell cycle. SV40 is a double-stranded, circular DNA virus belonging to the Polyomaviridae (earlier Papovavirus) family, Orthopolyomavirus genus. Polyomaviruses infect a wide variety of vertebrates and cause solid tumours at multiple sites. SV40 was isolated by Sweet and Maurice Hilleman in 1960 in primary monkey kidney cell cultures being used to grow Sabin OPV. Domains The TAg has a CUL7-binding domain, a TP53-binding domain, a Zinc finger, and a Superfamily 3 ATPase/Helicase domain. It has two motifs, one for nuclear localization signal, the other being the LXCXE motif.; InterPro view for P03070. Mechanism After entering the cell, the viral genes are transcribed by host cell RNA polymerase II to produce early mRNAs. Because of the relative simplicity of the genome, polyomaviruses are heavily dependent on the cell for transcription and genome replication. The cis-acting regulatory element surrounding the origin of replication directs transcription, and T-antigen directs transcription and replication. SV40 DNA replication is initiated by binding of large T-antigen to the origin region of the genome. The function of T-antigen is controlled by phosphorylation, which attenuates the binding to the SV40 origin. Protein-protein interactions between T-antigen and DNA polymerase-alpha directly stimulate replication of the virus genome. T-antigen also binds and inactivates tumor suppressor proteins (p53, p105-Rb). This causes the cells to leave G1 phase and enter into S phase, which promotes DNA replication. The SV40 genome is very small and does not encode all the information necessary for DNA replication. Therefore, it is essential for the host cell to enter S phase, when cell DNA and the viral genome are replicated together. Therefore, in addition to increasing transcription, another function of T-antigen is to alter the cellular environment to permit virus genome replication. Nuclear localization signal The SV40 large T-antigen has been used as a model protein to study nuclear localization signals (NLSs). It is imported into the nucleus by its interaction with importin Œ±. The NLS sequence is PKKKRKV. Interaction with pRb via the LXCXE motif SV40 large TAg, other polyomavirus large T antigens, adenovirus E1a proteins, and oncogenic human papillomavirus E7 proteins share a structural motif that encodes a high- affinity pRb-binding domain. This motif is characterized by an Asp, Asn or Thr residue followed by three invariant amino acids, interspersed with non- conserved amino acids (designated by x, where x cannot be a Lys or Arg residue). A negatively charged region frequently follows carboxy-terminal to the pRb-binding domain. : {Asp/Asn/Thr} ‚Äì Leu ‚Äì x ‚Äì Cys ‚Äì x ‚Äì Glu ‚Äì x ‚Äì ... {negatively charged region} Hydrophobic and electrostatic properties are highly conserved in this motif. For example, a local hydrophobicity maximum occurs in the vicinity of the invariant Leu residue. A net negative charge occurs within 3 residues amino-terminal to the invariant Leu residue; furthermore, positively charged amino acids (Lys or Arg) are not found within the Leu ‚Äì x ‚Äì Cys ‚Äì x ‚Äì Glu sequence, nor in the positions immediately flanking this sequence. The pRb-binding motif and negatively charged region match to a segment of SV40 TAg beginning at residue 102 and ending at residue 115 as shown below: : ‚Äì Asn ‚Äì Leu ‚Äì Phe ‚Äì Cys ‚Äì Ser ‚Äì Glu ‚Äì Glu ‚Äì Met ‚Äì Pro ‚Äì Ser ‚Äì Ser ‚Äì Asp ‚Äì Asp ‚Äì Glu ‚Äì Functional studies of TAg proteins bearing mutations within this segment (amino acid positions 106 to 114, inclusive) demonstrate that certain deleterious mutations abolish malignant transforming activity. For example, mutation of the invariant Glu at position 107 to Lys-107 completely abolishes transforming activity. Deleterious mutations within this segment (amino acid positions 105 to 114, inclusive) also impair binding of the mutant TAg protein species to pRb, implying a correlation between transforming activity and the ability of TAg to bind pRb. A detailed computerized bioinformatics analysis, as well as an x-ray crystallography study, have demonstrated the biophysical basis for the interaction between this region of TAg and pRb. TAg residues 103 to 109 form an extended loop structure that binds tightly in a surface groove of pRb. In the crystal structure, Leu-103 is positioned so that it makes van der Waals contacts with the hydrophobic side chains of Val-714 and Leu-769 in pRb. A number of hydrogen bonds also stabilize the TAg‚ÄìpRb complex. For example, the side chain of Glu-107 forms hydrogen bonds by accepting hydrogens from the main chain amide groups of Phe-721 and Lys-722 in pRb. The mutation of Glu-107 to Lys-107 is expected to result in loss of these hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, the side chain of Lys-107 would likely have energetically unfavorable interactions with the amide of Phe-721 or Lys-722, destabilizing the complex. Strong experimental evidence confirms that positively charged amino acids (Lys or Arg) significantly weaken the binding interaction with pRB when positioned in the vicinity of the Leu ‚Äì x ‚Äì Cys ‚Äì x ‚Äì Glu sequence. This is likely due to the fact that the binding surface on pRb features six lysine residues, which will tend to repel positive residues within or flanking the Leu ‚Äì x ‚Äì Cys ‚Äì x ‚Äì Glu sequence.

He spent most of his life living and performing in the city of Toronto where for many years he was a popular performer in the city's nightclubs and hotels. He also played and recorded with many of the city's orchestras and been featured on Canadian television and radio programs. In the early 1970s he drew wide acclaim for his performances with Benny Goodman's jazz sextet with which he toured internationally. In 1992, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in recognition of his being an \\"internationally renowned vibraphonist [who] has represented the Canadian jazz community across North America, Europe, the Middle East and Australia\\". Early life and career in England Born in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, Appleyard became apprenticed to a nautical instrument maker after being forced to leave school owing to economic reasons related to the Second World War. At that time the popularity of the American Big Bands was growing in England, particularly through a major influx in big band recordings from America by jazz musicians like Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, and Count Basie. These recordings had a strong influence on Appleyard and he decided to pursue a career as a jazz musician. He began his career in the early 1940s playing in the Boys Brigade, a youth organization. He performed as a drummer in several other British dance bands during the 1940s and, while a member of the Royal Air Force in the mid-1940s, played in RAF bands. Early career in North America In 1949 Appleyard moved to Bermuda where he lived for two years. While there he spent his holidays in Canada and picked up his first set of vibes. He was so impressed with Canada that, when the time came to leave Bermuda the choice of a new home was easy - he headed for Toronto. At first, unable to get a union card in Toronto, Appleyard worked as a room booking clerk at the King Edward Hotel and as a salesman at Simpson's department store. He began studying music with Gordon Delamont and soon thereafter began playing the vibraphone in concerts with Billy O'Connor in the early 1950s. From 1954 to 1956 he played with a band at the Park Plaza Hotel and made numerous appearances on CBC Radio with jazz pianist Calvin Jackson. He formed his own jazz ensemble in 1957 which performed not only in Toronto but also toured throughout North America and appeared on American television during the 1960s. Among the ensemble's original members was pianist and arranger Jimmy Dale. The group notably accompanied singer Gloria DeHaven for a year. From 1961 to 1962 Appleyard co- hosted, with singer Patti Lewis, the CBC Radio program Patti and Peter. He spent most of the mid-1960s on the road touring. In the late sixties, he ceased his busy touring schedule and returned to Toronto on a more permanent basis. He began playing once more at the Park Plaza Hotel. In 1969 he co- hosted the program Mallets and Brass with Guido Basso for CBC TV. In addition he began studying timpani and percussion and extended his musical expertise substantially. Working with Benny Goodman and later career In the early 1970s Appleyard was a member of Benny Goodman's sextet which toured in Europe in 1972 and 1974 and in Australia in 1973. Afterwards, he played only periodically with the group for the remainder of the decade, notably playing three performances with the ensemble at Carnegie Hall in the mid to late 1970s. During these years he lived in Toronto and performed in nightclubs and hotel lounges and was music director for local jazz bands. He was a percussionist in the city's orchestra. In the 1970s he appeared at the Colorado Springs Invitation Jazz Party. From 1977 to 1980 he hosted Peter Appleyard Presents, a jazz and variety television program that was syndicated in North America. In 1976, Frank Sinatra invited Appleyard to join him in concert with the Count Basie Orchestra and Ella Fitzgerald at the Uris Theatre in New York City. Sinatra made this request based on Appleyard's work with Goodman. Appleyard and Sinatra performed together several years later during a benefit concert in Ottawa that was arranged by Rich Little. In 1982 Appleyard formed the All-Star Swing Band which performed traditional pop and jazz tunes, often in medley arrangements by Rick Wilkins. The ensemble's 1982 album Swing Fever received a gold record certification for sales of 50,000 units in Canada and was nominated for a Juno award. During the late 1990s Appleyard performed at Carnegie Hall under the direction of Skitch Henderson and The New York Pops. The Japanese government invited him to perform at the Sapporo Jazz Festival. He received the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Award on 18 June 2012. He spent his final years living on a farm at Rockwood, Ontario. He died at his farm on 17 July 2013.

The warhead had a variable yield of between 1 and 100 kilotons, selectable by the user. The design dates from 1973. The W70-3 was a modified version of the W70 and one of the first warheads to be battlefield-ready with an \\"enhanced radiation\\" (i.e. neutron bomb) feature. It had an explosive yield of about 1 kt, was manufactured during 1981‚Äì83, and retired by 1992; 380 were built. Note that using the explosive yield of a neutron weapon to measure its destructive power can be deceptive, especially given the W70s variable yield - so-called \\"neutron bombs\\" only display their unique qualities at lower yields; at higher yields, the radius of intense heat and blast effects far outstrips the range that the prompt radiation can reach through an atmosphere. This effect is exaggerated against tank crews, who are extremely well protected against heat and blast, but whose vehicle's armour is readily penetrated by energetic neutron radiation.

It was erected in 1911 by the British Antarctic Expedition of 1910‚Äì1913 (also known as the Terra Nova Expedition) led by Robert Falcon Scott. In selecting a base of operations for the 1910‚Äì1913 Expedition, Scott rejected the notion of reoccupying the hut he had built by McMurdo Sound during the Discovery Expedition of 1901‚Äì1904. This first hut was located at Hut Point, 20 km south of Cape Evans. Two factors influenced this decision. One was that the hut was extremely cold for living quarters and the other was that Scott's ship, the Discovery, had been trapped by sea ice at Hut Point, a problem he hoped to avoid by establishing his new base farther north. Some confusion arises because Discovery Hut can technically be referred to as Scott's hut, in that his expedition built it, and it was his base ashore during the 1901‚Äì1904 expedition, but the title Scott's Hut popularly belongs to the building erected in 1911 at Cape Evans.  Description  Interior showing beds Scott's Hut was prefabricated in England before being brought south by ship. It is rectangular, long and wide. Insulation was provided by seaweed sewn into a quilt, placed between double-planked inner and outer walls. The roof was a sandwich of three layers of plank and two layers of rubber ply enclosing more quilted seaweed. Lighting was provided by acetylene gas, and heating came from the kitchen and a supplementary stove using coal as fuel. Apsley Cherry-Garrard wrote that the hut was divided into separate areas for sleeping and working by a bulkhead made of boxes of stores. A stables building (for nineteen Siberian ponies), approximately , was subsequently attached to the north wall of the main building. A utility room, approximately , was also added later, built around the original small porch at the southwest end of the main building. Considerable effort was made to insulate the building, and to extract the maximum amount of heat from the flues from the stove and the heater, based on lessons learned from the Discovery Hut. Terra Nova expeditioners described the hut as being warm to the point of being uncomfortable. A cross is erected on a hill behind Scott's Hut at Cape Evans, but this is not connected to Captain Scott, having been erected in memory of the three members of Shackleton's Ross Sea Party, who died nearby. The cross erected in memory of Captain Scott and his polar companions is to be found atop Observation Hill.  Use of Scott's Hut  During the winter of 1911, 25 men of the Terra Nova shore party lived in the hut. From here Scott and his men set out on the ultimately fatal trek to the South Pole. Following the failure of Scott's southern party to return, several men remained behind for a further winter (1912) in order to search for the bodies the next spring. In 1913, the Terra Nova expedition over, it was left well supplied with stores in the way of food and oil, and a certain amount of coal. The hut was reused from 1915-1917 by several of Shackleton's Ross Sea party after the Aurora, which was to have been the permanent winter quarters, broke adrift in May 1915, and went north with the ice, unable to return. The hut became the permanent living quarters for the ten marooned men, and thanks to the stores, they were able to sustain life in comparative comfort, supplementing these stores from Shackleton's Hut at Cape Royds. In January 1917, after Shackleton had rescued the survivors, he had the hut put in order and locked up. Although abandoned from 1917, the hut and its contents are remarkably well preserved today due to the consistently sub-freezing conditions.  Preservation and decay at Scott's Hut  Scientific instruments located inside the hut, as they appeared in 2013. After 1917, the hut remained untouched until 1956, when US expeditioners dug it out of the snow and ice. It was found to be in a remarkable state of preservation, and included many artifacts from both the earlier expeditions. While some artifacts were taken as souvenirs at the time (and since), this hut has remained largely as it was in 1917. New Zealand and the UK have undertaken responsibility at various times since the 1970s to restore (largely by removing snow and ice) both Scott's hut and Discovery Hut. While the preservation of food in the freezing temperatures and dry climate has been noted, bacterial decay still occurs. Visitors describe the seal meat preserved at the Discovery Hut as smelling 'quite rancid', and some have expressed concerns that the fabric of these huts are being affected by fungal decay.Blanchette, Robert (2004).

The company was started as a home business in 1893 by Cesira and Costantino Carapelli. Other members of the Carapelli family joined the business and the company rapidly grew in size and popularity, to become the most modernised food company in Italy by the 1940s. Today, Carapelli Firenze SpA is the leading Italian extra virgin olive oil company (with brand such as Carapelli, Sasso, Maya) where 30% of its production is exported to Europe and the Americas.

In 2010, when Carapelli's Extra Virgin Olive Oil the olive oils identified as mislabeled as Extra Virgin in a study by researchers at University of California, Davis. In 2015, Carapelli were once again investigated by the Italian authorities and found guilty of passing off lower quality oil as extra virgin olive oil. In 2017, Carapelli responded to the accusations by stating that the news on the fake olive oil, that were based on a study made in 2010 by the University of California Davis Olive Center, were not true and that the study was completely discredited by the International Olive Council (IOC) through several statements (see statements in here,http://deoleo.com/english-carapelli-official-statement-against-fake- olive-oil-news/?lang=en since the methodology used was not in line with the IOC standards.

It is situated on the Seven Sisters not far from Beachy Head and is owned by the National Trust. Coastal erosion has already removed some of the row of coastguard cottages built in 1878, but those that remain are still inhabited. There is a cafe, shop and visitor centre run by National Trust, and a metal staircase leading down to the enclosed pebble beach and the Seven Sisters chalk cliffs. In time, the houses are likely to be demolished due to the severe coastal erosion; the Government has concluded that the commercial value of the houses does not justify the construction of sea defences. If walkers are cut off at high tide, they can climb the ladder, which is replaced often, to Birling Gap. The beach, which was awarded the Blue flag rural beach award in 2005, is advertised by Naturist UK. It has a large number of rockpools. Noted artist Jean Cooke lived in two cottages at Birling Gap. She painted seascapes there and died in 2008 while looking at the sea. In August 2017 hundreds of people suffered ill-effects after a chemical poisoning incident. Geography The main rock type at Birling Gap is chalk. Other rock types outcropping here include flint, loess and soil. The coastline is part of the Site of Special Scientific Interest Seaford to Beachy Head, which falls within the parish. The site is of biological and geological interest. There is also extensive evidence and visible earthworks here for an Iron Age hillfort on the site ‚Äì although nearly half of it has already been lost to the sea. Information boards at the site show how it would have originally looked; however, even more will be lost due to the geological nature of these chalk cliffs.

He was a co-author of the Franck Report and a co-founder in 1945 of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a global security and public policy magazine, which he edited until his death. Early life Rabinowitch was born Evgenii Isaakovich Rabinovich in Saint Petersburg; his parents were a lawyer and pianist. During WWI Rabinowitch studied chemistry in St. Petersburg. Initially a supporter of the Russian Revolution, he and his family fled to Kiev and then Warsaw with the onset of the Red Terror in late 1918. Ultimately fleeing to Germany, Rabinowitch was able to take a course Einstein taught on relativity, and attend academic events that included Max Planck and Max von Laue. He later worked with James Franck at G√∂ttingen. After the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, Rabinowitch worked for a year with Nils Bohr in Denmark, before finding a job in London. In 1932 Rabinowitch married Russian actress Anya Rabinowitch, and in 1934 the couple had twins, Victor and Alexander Rabinowitch. Botany Rabinowitch was studying the photochemical properties of chlorophyll at University College London in 1937 and 1938. In the summer he went to Marine Biological Laboratory and began to compile a bibliography on photosynthesis. This work grew into a book published April 1945 that he wrote largely during the summers at Woods Hole. When Rabinowitch arrived in New York City, he was assisted by Selig Hecht, :a man whose spontaneous sympathy, friendship and assistance were so generously given to me when I first came to America and felt lost in the human sea of New York.E. Rabinowitch (1959) Preface to second edition of Explaining the Atom (1947) by Selig Hecht, page xiii, Viking Press The American Association for Advancement of Science sponsored symposia that Rabinowitch attended: 1939 in Columbus and 1941 at Gibson Island supporting research on the book. Rabinowitch credits Selig Hecht with help in the early stages, and Hans Gaffron for reading the manuscript.E. Rabinowitch (1945) Photosynthesis, pages vii & viii After World War II, Rabinowitch taught and researched botany as a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, continuing his photosynthesis work and publishing the three-volume Photosynthesis and Related Processes.E. Rabinowitch (1945) Photosynthesis and Related Processes via Biodiversity Heritage Library In 1965 he and his student Govindjee contributed an article to Scientific American on the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis. A bibliography of Rabinowitch's publicationsGovindjee (1972) \\"Publications of Eugene Rabinowitch\\", Biophysical Journal 12(7):719‚Äì22 was compiled by Govindjee at the Department of Botany, University of Illinois. The papers of Rabinowitch are held in the Special Collections at the University of Chicago Library. Nuclear energy During World War II, Rabinowitch worked in the Metallurgical Laboratory (or \\"Met Lab\\"), the Manhattan Project's division at the University of Chicago. At that time he was a member of the Committee on Political and Social Problems, chaired by James Franck. Rabinowitch wrote (with help from Le√≥ Szil√°rd) what became known as the Franck Report. The report recommended that nuclear energy be brought under civilian rather than military control and argued that the United States should demonstrate the atomic bomb to world leaders in an uninhabited desert or barren island before using it in combat. The social and ethical concerns expressed in the Franck Report translated into the guiding principles of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, founded by Rabinowitch and fellow physicist Hyman Goldsmith. In the twenty-fifth anniversary issue of the Bulletin, Rabinowitch wrote that the magazine's purpose \\"was to awaken the public to full understanding of the horrendous reality of nuclear weapons and of their far-reaching implications for the future of mankind; to warn of the inevitability of other nations acquiring nuclear weapons within a few years, and of the futility of relying on America's possession of the 'secret' of the bomb.\\" Over the years, Rabinowitch wrote more than 100 articles for the magazine, most of them editorials. According to the historian of the Pugwash Conferences, :Eugene Rabinowitch was one of the first to call and work for setting up of international discussions; it is largely due to his enthusiasm and devotion that many of the events recorded here have materialized. One example of his untiring efforts was the convening of an informal talk in September 1951 in Chicago, during a conference on nuclear physics attended by scientists from many countries.Joseph Rotblat (1972) Scientists in the Quest for Peace: a history the Pugwash Conferences, page one, The MIT Press In 1959 he re-issued Explaining the Atom that Selig Hecht had written in 1947 when nuclear energy was a novel concept.

In practice, sections of cones are used. Cutaway view of a tapered roller bearing Tapered roller bearings are rolling element bearings that can support axial forces (i.e., they are good thrust bearings) as well as radial forces. Description The inner and outer ring raceways are segments of cones and the rollers are tapered so that the conical surfaces of the raceways, and the roller axes, if projected, would all meet at a common point on the main axis of the bearing. This geometry makes the motion of the cones remain coaxial, with no sliding motion between the raceways and the OD of the rollers. This conical geometry creates a linear contact patch which permits greater loads to be carried than with spherical (ball) bearings, which have point contact. The geometry means that the tangential speeds of the surfaces of each of the rollers are the same as their raceways along the whole length of the contact patch and no differential scrubbing occurs. The rollers are stabilized and restrained by a flange on the inner ring, against which their large end slides, which stops the rollers from popping out due to the \\"pumpkin seed effect\\" of their conical shape. The larger the half angles of these cones the larger the axial force that the bearing can sustain. Tapered roller bearings are separable into a cone assembly and a cup. The non-separable cone assembly consists of the inner ring, the rollers, and a cage that retains and evenly spaces the rollers. The cup is simply the outer ring. Internal clearance is established during mounting by the axial position of the cone relative to the cup, although preloaded installations without clearance are common. Metric tapered roller bearings follow the designation system defined by ISO 355. History On March 23, 1895, John Lincoln Scott, a farmer and carpenter from Wilmot, Indiana was awarded a patent from the United States Patent Office for his invention of the tapered roller bearing. The purpose of his invention was to improve the performance of wagon wheels used in farming. In 1898, Henry Timken was awarded a patent U.S. Pat. 606,635, Roller-bearing for vehicles for the tapered roller bearing. At the time, Timken was a carriage-maker in St. Louis and held three patents for carriage springs. However, it was his patent for tapered roller bearings that allowed his company to become successful. Tapered roller bearings were a breakthrough at the end of the 19th century because bearings used in wheel axles had not changed much since ancient times. They consisted of a cylindrical seat on the frame and part of the axle enclosed in a case or box that held a lubricant. These were called journal bearings and relied on the lubricant to form a fluid bearing. Without adequate lubrication,Bearing Lubrication Whitepaper journal bearings would fail due to the excessive heat caused by friction. Timken was able to significantly reduce the friction on his axle bearings by adding tapered elements which actually rolled while transferring the load evenly from axle to frame through the hardened steel inner and outer rings and the rollers - his tapered roller bearing. The tapered roller bearing in combination with modern lubricants is extremely durable and is used almost universally in applications involving rotating axle and transmission shafts. Bearing durability is such that these shafts often require no maintenance for hundreds of thousands of kilometers of operation. Applications In many applications tapered roller bearings are used in back-to-back pairs so that axial forces can be supported equally in either direction. Pairs of tapered roller bearings are used in car and vehicle wheel bearings where they must cope simultaneously with large vertical (radial) and horizontal (axial) forces. Tapered roller bearings are commonly used for moderate speed, heavy duty applications where durability is required. Common real world applications are in agriculture, construction and mining equipment, sports robot combat, axle systems, gear box, engine motors and reducers, propeller shaft, railroad axle-box, differential, wind turbines, etc. A tapered roller bearing is a unit that consists of both tapered raceways (inner and outer rings), and tapered rollers. The construction is intended for combination loads, such as dual acting axial and radial loads. The bearing axis is where the projected lines of the raceway combine at a common location to improve rolling, while reducing friction. The load capacity can be increased or decreased depending on the contact angle being increased or decreased. The higher the degree of angle, the greater the contact angle. They are commonly used in pairs for better radial load handling, and in some heavy duty applications, can be found in two or four rows combined in a single unit.

Users could then publish their websites to MobileMe or another hosting service via FTP. In addition to its ability to publish to MobileMe, iWeb integrated with other services, including Facebook, YouTube, AdSense and Google Maps. Apple ceased development of iWeb in 2011.  Overview and features  = Page design = iWeb allowed users to create and design websites and blogs without coding, and included a number of Apple-designed themes, each of which had several page templates with coordinated fonts and colors. Users could customize these pages by replacing placeholder text and by dragging and dropping their own photos and movies into the document. Templates included blog, podcast, and photo and movie gallery pages, as well as standard \\"Welcome\\" and \\"About Me\\" pages. iWeb integrated with other applications in the iLife suite. The iLife Media Browser is a list of all the music, movies, and photos stored in iTunes, iMovie, and iPhoto. Content could be dragged from the Media Browser window and placed in the open page. Local files could also be dropped directly into the page. Nine interactive \\"widgets\\" were included with iWeb. Among other things, these widgets let users embed YouTube videos and Google Maps, include a countdown timer and add RSS feeds. = Publishing = iWeb featured built-in support for publishing to MobileMe, a suite of online applications developed by Apple, and to other third-party web hosts with FTP. Once account information was entered, users simply clicked a button to publish their entire website. iWeb could then publish updates to the user's Facebook profile to notify others of changes to the website. =Limitations= iWeb was in its third version at the time of discontinuation, and had a limited feature set and some unresolved bugs. Some limitations included: * Separate CSS files were created for each page, rather than a single stylesheet for the entire site. * No option to directly edit the HTML code of templates. HTML support was limited to small snippets that could be embedded into the page. * Password protection was not supported on non- MobileMe-hosted websites. * Creating templates required third-party software and was overly complex. * Comments on blog pages were not supported on non- MobileMe-hosted websites. = Discontinuation of iWeb in iCloud transition = In June 2011, rumors emerged that iWeb would not be developed further. On June 30, 2012 Apple finally pulled the plug on MobileMe. All iWeb websites hosted on MobileMe disappeared if not hosted elsewhere. Apple provided instructions of how to move iWeb sites to another host.  References   External links  * Category:MacOS-only software made by Apple Inc.

Ordinary roller bearings' rollers are only slightly longer than their diameter, but needle bearings typically have rollers that are at least four times longer than their diameter. Like all bearings, they are used to reduce the friction of a rotating surface. Compared to ball bearings and ordinary roller bearings, needle bearings have a greater surface area in contact with the races, so they can support a greater load. They are also thinner, so they require less clearance between the axle and the surrounding structure. Needle bearings are heavily used in automobile components such as rocker arm pivots, pumps, compressors, and transmissions. The drive shaft of a rear-wheel drive vehicle typically has at least eight needle bearings (four in each U joint) and often more if it is particularly long, or operates on steep slopes.

There are many different types of linear motion bearings. Motorized linear slides such as machine slides, X-Y tables, roller tables and some dovetail slides are bearings moved by drive mechanisms. Not all linear slides are motorized, and non-motorized dovetail slides, ball bearing slides and roller slides provide low-friction linear movement for equipment powered by inertia or by hand. All linear slides provide linear motion based on bearings, whether they are ball bearings, dovetail bearings, linear roller bearings, magnetic or fluid bearings. X-Y tables, linear stages, machine slides and other advanced slides use linear motion bearings to provide movement along both X and Y multiple axis. Rolling-element bearing A rolling-element bearing is generally composed of a sleeve-like outer ring and several rows of balls retained by cages. The cages were originally machined from solid metal and were quickly replaced by stampings. It features smooth motion, low friction, high rigidity and long life. They are economical, and easy to maintain and replace. Thomson Industries, Inc. (currently owned by Altra Industrial Motion) is generally given credit for first producing [what is now known as] a linear ball bearing. * Rolling-element bearings are generally designed to work well on hardened steel or stainless steel shafting (raceways). * Rolling-element bearings are more rigid than plain bearings. * Rolling-element bearings do not handle contamination well and require seals. * Rolling-element bearings require lubrication. Rolling-element bearings are manufactured in two forms: ball bearing slides and roller slides. = Ball bearing slides = Also called \\"ball slides,\\" ball bearing slides are the most common type of linear slide. Ball bearing slides offer smooth precision motion along a single-axis linear design, aided by ball bearings housed in the linear base, with self-lubrication properties that increase reliability. Ball bearing slide applications include delicate instrumentation, robotic assembly, cabinetry, high-end appliances and clean room environments, which primarily serve the manufacturing industry but also the furniture, electronics and construction industries. For example, a widely used ball bearing slide in the furniture industry is a ball bearing drawer slide. Commonly constructed from materials such as aluminum, hardened cold rolled steel and galvanized steel, ball bearing slides consist of two linear rows of ball bearings contained by four rods and located on differing sides of the base, which support the carriage for smooth linear movement along the ball bearings. This low-friction linear movement can be powered by either a drive mechanism, inertia or by hand. Ball bearing slides tend to have a lower load capacity for their size compared to other linear slides because the balls are less resistant to wear and abrasions. In addition, ball bearing slides are limited by the need to fit into housing or drive systems. The travelling distance of linear recirculating ball bearings is only limited by the length of their rail, as the balls recirculate inside the bearing's housing. Linear non-recirculating ball bearings have balls installed on a bracket and only move in one axis without recirculation. Since the balls do not recirculate, this type of bearings can provide extremely smooth motion. However, the travelling distance of linear non-recirculating ball bearings is limited by the length of the bracket. = Roller slides = Also known as crossed roller slides, roller slides are non- motorized linear slides that provide low-friction linear movement for equipment powered by inertia or by hand. Roller slides are based on linear roller bearings, which are frequently criss-crossed to provide heavier load capabilities and better movement control. Serving industries such as manufacturing, photonics, medical and telecommunications, roller slides are versatile and can be adjusted to meet numerous applications which typically include clean rooms, vacuum environments, material handling and automation machinery. Roller slides work similarly to ball bearing slides, except that the bearings housed within the carriage are cylinder-shaped instead of ball shaped. The rollers crisscross each other at a 90¬∞ angle and move between the four semi-flat and parallel rods that surround the rollers. The rollers are between \\"V\\" grooved bearing races, one being on the top carriage and the other on the base. Typically, bearing housings are constructed from aluminum while the rollers are constructed from steel. Although roller slides are not self- cleaning, they are suitable for environments with low levels of airborne contaminants such as dirt and dust. As one of the more expensive types of linear slides, roller slides are capable of providing linear motion on more than one axis through stackable slides and double carriages. Roller slides offers line contact versus point contact as with ball bearings, creating a broader contact surface due to the consistency of contact between the carriage and the base and resulting in less erosion. Plain bearing Plain bearings are very similar in design to rolling-element bearings, except they slide without the use of ball bearings. If they are cylindrical in shape, they are often called bushings. Bushings can be metal or plastic, or even air. * Plain bearings can run on hardened steel or stainless steel shafting (raceways), or can be run on hard-anodized aluminum or soft steel or aluminum. For plastic bushings, the specific type of polymer/fluoro-polymer will determine what hardness is allowed. * Plain bearings are less rigid than rolling-element bearings. * Plain bearings handle contamination well and often do not need seals/scrapers. * Plain bearings generally handle a wider temperature range than rolling-element bearings * Plain bearings (plastic versions) do not require oil or lubrication (often it can be used to increase performance characteristics) = Dovetail slides = Dovetail slides, or dovetail way slides are typically constructed from cast iron, but can also be constructed from hard-coat aluminum, acetal or stainless steel. Like any bearing, a dovetail slide is composed of a stationary linear base and a moving carriage. a Dovetail carriage has a v-shaped, or dovetail-shaped protruding channel which locks into the linear base's correspondingly shaped groove. Once the dovetail carriage is fitted into its base's channel, the carriage is locked into the channel's linear axis and allows free linear movement. When a platform is attached to the carriage of a dovetail slide, a dovetail table is created, offering extended load carrying capabilities. Dovetail slides are advantageous when it comes to load capacity, affordability and durability. Capable of long travel, dovetail slides are more resistant to shock than other bearings, and they are mostly immune to chemical, dust and dirt contamination. Dovetail slides can be motorized, mechanical or electromechanical. Electric dovetail slides are driven by a number of different devices, such as ball screws, belts and cables, which are powered by functional motors such as stepper motors, linear motors and handwheels. Dovetail slides are direct contact systems, making them fitting for heavy load applications including CNC machines, shuttle devices, special machines and work holding devices. Mainly used in the manufacturing and laboratory science industries, dovetail slides are ideal for high-precision applications. = Compound slides = 2-Section and 3-Section Compound Slide Slideshttps://www.firgelliauto.com/blogs/news/what-is-a-drawer-slide-drawer- slide-101 can be constructed with two sections or multiple sections. A slide with two sections can only extend approximately 3/4 of the total compressed slide length. A compound slide typically has three sections: fixed, floating intermediate member, and the section attached to the equipment. A compound slide can extend at least as far as the compressed slide length and typically a bit more. In the case of rack slides, this allows the equipment to extend completely out of the rack allowing access for service or connection of cables and such to the back of the equipment. = Rack slides = Friction Bearing Rack Slide Rack slides are specifically intended for mounting equipment into 19-inch racks or 23-inch racks. These can be friction bearing, ball bearing, or roller bearing. They are sized to fit into racks with mounting flanges on the ends to mate to the mounting holes in racks. In some cases, one mounting flange is formed into the rack slide with an adapter bracket attached to the other end to accommodate different depths of the rack. The outer fixed member is attached to the rack and the inner moving member is generally screwed to the side of the mounted equipment. Rack slides are typically compound or 3-part slides allowing full extension of the mounted equipment and generally include provision for sliding the inner member completely free to allow removal of the equipment from the rack. They can also include stops to prevent accidentally pulling the equipment out of the rack without releasing the stop mechanism. There can be proprietary configurations which, for example, may clip to the equipment without the use of screws or can be clipped into an appropriately designed rack. But the basic geometry is the same regardless of how they are mounted.

It usually measures about one meter in length. Takoba blades are straight and double edged with a pronounced tapering from the guard towards the tip; they can exhibit several notable features, including three or more hand-ground fuller grooves and a rounded point.Spring, p. 40 Since the Tuareg have an aversion to touching iron, the takoba's hilt, like many iron implements, is fully covered. Typically the simple but deep crossguard is of iron sheet, or iron-framed wood, covered in tooled leather, and occasionally sheathed in brass or silver; the grip is also often leather-covered but the pommel is always of metal, often brass or copper, sometimes iron or silver.Spring, p. 30 Alternatively the whole hilt can be covered in brass or silver sheathing. The scabbard is made of elaborately tooled leather. Geographical variations in the form of the hilt have been noted, but no rigorous typology has been established. Variations in the quality of blade and fittings on takobas probably mostly reflect the wealth of their owners. There is much debate about whether the takoba was used only by the im√∫≈°a…£ or warrior class or whether it could be borne by vassals.

In his first appearance in Iron Man #27 (July 1970), Firebrand describes his experiences demonstrating for the civil rights movement in a speech to Iron Man: While the story includes some positive messages about the civil rights movement, Firebrand is presented as a villain, because he sets himself outside of the existing political structure, and is willing to let innocents die to further his political and social aims. In his article \\"Everyday Heroism in Superhero Narratives\\", Michael Goodrum writes, \\"Having pursued tactics of accommodation without result, he turns to confrontation, asserting that there is nothing of value left in the system if it treats peaceful reformers with violence ‚Äî essentially laying bare the coercive nature of power.

The meeting, held at an abandoned tavern in Medina County, Ohio, known among the criminal underworld as \\"The Bar With No Name\\", turned out to be a massacre, as Scourge infiltrated the event disguised as a bartender; a few minutes into the meeting, Scourge slaughtered every criminal present, including Gilbert, with machine gun fire. Firebrand was later among seventeen of the criminals murdered by the Scourge, who were resurrected by Hood using the power of Dormammu as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the Punisher.Punisher Vol. 7 #5 His fire powers are augmented, and he can melt through concrete or metal.http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/preview2.php?image=previews/marvelcomics/punisher/villains/PunisherVillains-5.jpg After the Punisher is captured, he is present at the ritual where the Hood intends to resurrect the Punisher's family.

One of the oldest neighbourhoods in South Kolkata, Kalighat is also densely populated ‚Äî with a history of cultural intermingling with the various foreign incursions into the area over time. The Kali of Kalighat Kalighat Kali Temple, 1887 The famous temple Kalighat Kali Temple dedicated to the goddess Kali is situated in Kalighat. This is one of the 51 Shakti Peethas. The right toe of Dakshayani Sati is said to have fallen here. The Shakti here is known as Dakshina Kalika, while the Bhairava is Nakulesh. Considered as one of the Holiest of the Holies in terms of Hindu Shakta Pilgrimage Centres, (Shiva and Durga/Kali/Shakti worshippers) it sees the footfall of thousands of devotees everyday. However, Tuesdays and Saturdays are considered very auspicious, and the crowd increases a hundred folds on these two days. The special days when the Goddess receives even more pilgrims is during the Vipad Tarini Vrat, and when the Goddess is worshipped as Ratantika and Falaaharini Kali. Pilgrims bathing in the Hoogly at Kalighat, c. 1947 Kalika Temple Kalighat Temple. Bazaar out the temple The Medieval Bhuiyan, Raja Basanta Ray, uncle of Pratapaditya and the King of Jessore, (now in Bangladesh) probably built the first Temple here. This temple was situated on the banks of river Adi Ganga. The Temple Complex is laid out in the following manner. The natmandir, a hall attached to the Garbh Griha sanctum sanctorum is in the southern wing while Shiva's temple is situated in the north-eastern wing. There is a temple dedicated to Radha Krishna built in 1843 by a zamindar of Bhaowali. The Kalighat temple in its present form is only about 200 years old, although it has been referred to in Mansar Bhasan composed in the 15th century, and in Kavi Kankan Mukunda Das' Chandi Mangal of the 17th century. Mention of the Kali temple is also found in Lalmohon Bidyanidhis's \\"Sambanda Nirnoy\\". The image of Kali in this temple is unique. It does not follow the pattern of other Kali images in Bengal. The present idol of touchstone was created by two saints -- Atmaram Brahmachari and Brahmananda Giri. However, the image here is older than what meets the eye. Originally thought to have been worshipped and created by the Hindu All-Father Brahma, there are accounts from antiquity, which say that there was a mound or stupa here, which was called as Brahma'r Dhipi. And the image of the Kali here was present on the Dhipi or the mound, being worshipped regularly. Hundreds of years before Brahmananda GIri and Atmaram Brahmachari even reached this place. Presently, the mother goddess has three huge eyes, a long protruding tongue and four hands all of which are made of gold. The hands of the goddess was originally made out of silver, and had been donated by Gokulchandra Ghoshal, the Diwan of the East India Company, who had been appointed to the post right after the Battle of Plassey. which had been later replaced by gold hands donated by a man named Kalicharan Mullick. The crown on the Devi's head had been donated by Ramnarayan Sarkar of Beleghata. The iconic golden tongue had been donated by Raja Indrachandra Shingho of Paikpara, and the Garland of heads that the goddess wears had been donated by the Maharaja of Patiala. Nepal's former Army Chief had donated the Umbrella on top of the goddess' head. Out of the four hands, the top left hand holds a Kharga or a Scimitar, the bottom left holds a severed head of the Asura King Shumbha, while the top right hand she shows the Abhay Mudra, and the bottom right hands she shows the Varada Mudra. Whilst the Scimitar signifies Divine Knowledge, the severed head of the Asura signifies the human Ego which has to be slain by the Divine Knowledge to attain Moksha or one's goal in life. The Abhay Mudra signifies that the Goddess is always there with her devotees, protecting them from harm, while the Varada Mudra shows the benevolence and the soft-heartedness of the Devi, showering her devotees with divine and material blessings. Kali idol at the Kalighat Kali Temple Kalighat temple has references in 15th century texts. The original temple was a small hut. The present temple was built by the Sabarna Roy Choudhury family of Barisha in 1809. They offered 595 bighas of land to the Temple deity so that worship and service could be continued smoothly. It is believed by some scholars that the name Calcutta was derived from Kalighat. Historically, traders halted at Kalighat to pay patronage to the goddess. The temple was initially on the banks of Hooghly. The river over a period of time has moved away from the temple. The temple is now on the banks of a small canal called Adi Ganga, connecting to Hooghly. The present Dakshina Kali idol of touchstone was created in 1570 CE by two saints - Brahmananda Giri and Atmaram Giri based on the idol of Mata Bhuvaneshwari, the Kuladevi of Sabarna Roy Choudhury family. It was Padmabati Devi, the mother of Laksmikanta Roy Choudhury who discovered the fossils of Sati's finger in a lake called Kalikunda. This made Kalighat as one of the 51 Shakti Pithas.Bangiya Sabarna Katha Kalishetra Kalikatah by Bhabani Roy Choudhury, Manna Publication. Panchannagram and Kali-Kshetra The East India Company obtained from the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar, in 1717, the right to rent from 38 villages surrounding their settlement. Of these 5 lay across the Hooghly in what is now Howrah district. The remaining 33 villages were on the Calcutta side. After the fall of Siraj- ud-daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, it purchased these villages in 1758 from Mir Jafar, and reorganised them. These villages were known en- bloc as Dihi Panchannagram and Kalighat was one of them. It was considered to be a suburb beyond the limits of the Maratha Ditch.Cotton, H.E.A., Calcutta Old and New, first published 1909/reprint 1980, pages 103-4 and 221, General Printers and Publishers Pvt.

Kalighat was originally called Kali-Kshetra, which is widely accepted as the origin for the word Kalikata, and in turn Calcutta or Kolkata. The Kalighat Hoard Some time in 1783, a fisherman found a treasure hoard of more than 200 Gold Coins somewhere near the now defunct Strand on the Adi Ganga, near Kalighat. Not knowing what to do with it, he sold it off to Raja Nabakrishna Deb, Zamindar of Shovabazar-Sutanuti. Seeing the coins as an opportunity of gaining confidence with the then Governor General of India, Warren Hastings, Nabakrishna Deb gifted him with the coins. Keeping a few with him, Warren Hastings sent 172 coins from the horde to London, to the East India Company. These coins belonged to the Gupta Kings, testaments to India's glorious past, but since no one knew of the Guptas back then (It would not be before another half a century or so that Alexander Cunningham would find out about the glorious age of the Guptas), these coins held little value to the people involved. However, for all practical purposes, the hoard was thought to be lost, as the Company directors sent most of the coins to the melting pot, and some to a few collectors. When Hastings returned to London, he found only 24 of them in the collection of the British Museum. This astonished him beyond measures. He thought he had made a magnificent contribution to the Court of Directors ‚Äî a hoard of Persian Darics (since no one knew of the Guptas back then). In 1825, Marsden prepared the Nusmiamata Orientalia, where for the first time they were mentioned as Gupta coins. The coins had been placed in a brass pot that remained submerged in water for a long time, hence the coins developed an underwater patina of clayish black, owing to the reaction of the gold and the alloys in the coin with the alluvium. The hoard contained the Archer Type coins from the reign of Chandragupta II who had probably annexed Bengal to his Empire, and Kumaragupta I with an abundance in coins from the reign of Vishnugupta and Narasimhagupta, besides a few from the times of Shashanka, a later but important Ruler of Gauda. This is the largest hoard of Gupta coins ever found in the history of India. The Kalighat Temple as a Shakti Peeth Sati Devi The Temple at Kalighat is revered as an important Shakti Peetha, by the Shaktism sect of Hinduism. The mythology of Daksha yajna and Sati's self immolation is the story behind the origin of Shakti Peethas. Daksha, the son of Brahma was an ancient entity called Prajapati or the keeper of the beings in Hinduism. He had a lot of daughters, one of whom was Sati, an incarnation of the Primordial Mother Goddess or Shakti. She was married to Shiva, the ascetic, whose abode was in the cold and snowy recesses of the Kailasa Parvat. Daksha had frowned upon the marriage, as Shiva was a penniless man, quite unlike the King that Daksha was. In time, Daksha decided that he would arrange a yajna or a ritual where he would invite all the gods, except for Shiva. Sati, his daughter came to her father's place, uninvited and faced a flurry of insults from her father about her husband. Unable to bear the insults, she immolated herself. The news of the death of his beloved wife set Shiva on a delirious rage, as he started the Tandav or the Dance of Destruction with the body of Sati, calming down, only when Vishnu managed to chop her body down into fifty one pieces, which would fall all over the length and breadth of India. (A lot of these places are in modern-day Pakistan and Bangladesh as well.) Shakti Peethas or divine seats of Shakti or the Primordial Mother Goddess, thus came into being wherever these severed parts of Sati's body had fallen. Each of the 51 Peethas have a temple dedicated to the Shakti or the Primordial Mother, and a temple dedicated to the Bhairava or Shiva, the All-Father, essentially forming important historical centres to mark the marriage of Shaivism and Shaktism, and also the philosophical fact that a man is nothing without his Shakti or Woman and vice versa. The Shakti here is thus Dakshina Kali (the benevolent Mother of the World) while the Bhairav being Nakulish or Nakuleshwar. It is believed that the RIGHT TOES of Sati fell here at KALIGHAT. However, some Puranas also mention that the MUKHA KHANDA or the FACE of the Goddess fell here, got fossilized, and is stored and worshipped here. The 51 Shakti Peethas are linked to the 51 alphabets in Sanskrit, each carrying the power to invoke one of the goddesses associated with them. These Alphabets are called Veej Mantras or the seeds of the primordial sounds of creation. The Veej Mantra for Dakshina Kali is Kring. The mythological texts which include the Kalika Purana (Asthashakti,) recognize the four major Shakti Peethas -- Bimala where resides the Pada Khanda (feet) (the temple is inside the Jagannath Temple, Puri, Odisha), Tara Tarini housing the Stana Khanda (Breasts), (near Brahmapur, Odisha), Kamakshya, Yoni khanda (vagina) (near Guwahati, Assam) and Dakshina Kalika, Mukha khanda (in Kolkata, West Bengal) originated from the lifeless body of the goddess Sati. This is illustrated in a hymn from the Kalika Purana (Asthashakti): ‚ÄúVimala Pada khandancha, Stana khandancha Tarini (Tara Tarini), Kamakhya Yoni khandancha, Mukha khandancha Kalika (Kali) Anga pratyanga sangena Vishnu Chakra Kshate nacha‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù ''' Further explaining the importance of these four Peethas the Brihat Samhita gives the geographical location of these Peethas. For example: ‚ÄúRushikulya Tate Devi, Tarakashya Mahagiri, Tashya Srunge Stitha Tara, Vasishta Rajitapara\\"'' Thus, there is no dispute regarding these four Adi Shakti Peethas and their locations. These four Peethas are also believed as the most powerful Shakti Peethas in Bharata Varsha. However, all these Four Adi Shakti Peethas are also part of 51 Shakti Peethas but there are four major parts of Devi Sati's body so they are important, powerful and believed as Adi Shakti Peethas. Kalika's image The image of the deity is incomplete. Only the face of the deity was made first. The hands, made of gold and silver, the tongue, the Shiva statue and all the jewellery were added over the years. On snanyatra day, while giving the divine Mother the ceremonial bath, the priests tie their eyes with cloth coverings. On auspicious occasions like Kali Puja, Durga Puja, Poila Boishakh, the Bengali New Year day and sankranti large number of devotees throng the place with offerings. Adi Ganga Kalighat was a Ghat (landing stage) sacred to Kali on the old course of the Hooghly river (BhƒÅgirathi). The name Calcutta is said to have been derived from the word Kalighat. The river over a period of time has moved away from the temple. The temple is now on the banks of a small canal called Adi Ganga which connects to the Hoogly. The Adi Ganga was the original course of the river Hoogly (the Ganges). Hence the name Adi (original) Ganges. Kalighat painting Ravana and Hanuman, Kalighat school of painting, c1880 Kalighat painting, or pata (originally pronounced 'pot' in Bengali) is a style of Indian painting derives its name from the place. It is characterised by generously curving figures of both men and women and an earthy satirical style. It developed during the nineteenth century in response to the sudden prosperity brought to Calcutta by the East India Company trade, whereby many houses including that of 'Prince' Dwarkanath Tagore, grandfather of Rabindranath Tagore became incredibly wealthy. Many of these nouveau riche families came from not particular exalted caste backgrounds, so the orthodox tended to frown on them and their often very tasteless conspicuous consumption. To the common people the babus, as they were called, were equally objects of fun and sources of income. Thus the 'babu culture' portrayed in the Kalighat patas often shows inversions of the social order (wives beating husbands or leading them about in the guise of pet goats or dogs, maidservants wearing shoes, sahibs in undignified postures, domestic contretemps, and the like.) They also showed European innovations (babus wearing European clothes, smoking pipes, reading at desks, etc.). The object of this is only partly satirical; it also expresses the wonder that ordinary Bengalis felt on exposure to these new and curious ways and objects. Kalighat pata pictures are highly stylised, do not use perspective, are usually pen and ink line drawings filled in with flat bright colours and normally use paper as a substrate, though some may be found with cloth backing or on cloth. The artists were rarely educated, and usually came from a lineage of artisans. Kalighat patas are still made today although genuine work is hard to come by. The art form is urban and largely secular: although gods and goddesses are often depicted, they appear in much the same de-romanticised way as the humans do. By contrast, the Orissa tradition of pata-painting, centering on Puri, is consciously devotional. Kalighat pata has been credited with influencing the Bengal School of art associated with Jamini Roy. Kalighat in fiction Amitav Ghosh's The Calcutta Chromosome is partly set in Kalighat and gives a wonderfully atmospheric depiction of the region as well as the city itself. Kalighat also plays a prominent role in Song of Kali by Dan Simmons and in the short story Calcutta, Lord of Nerves by Poppy Z. Brite. It also features in the movie Kahaani starring Vidya Balan and directed by Sujoy Ghosh. Police district Kalighat police station is part of the South division of Kolkata Police. Located at 51, Haldarpara Road, Kolkata-700026, it has jurisdiction over the police district which is bordered on the north from the north-east corner of the junction of Sambhu Nath Pandit Street and D.

Red-light district Located around the banks of the Adi Ganga canal, an estimated 1,000 to 1,500 prostitutes live and work in the red-light district. Kolkata has emerged as a hub for the trafficking of girls, who often arrive from Nepal, Bangladesh and Burma. From Kolkata they are often sold again to brothels in Mumbai (Bombay). Some will go on to the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Many of the women in Sonnagachi were forcedly taken away from their homes; some were tricked and others sold into prostitution by their friends and families; most of them are illiterate.Prostitutes Calcutta Sex Slaves.

Roxburgh, Scotland) was the first historian of South Carolina and Georgia, best known for his two volume work \\"An Historical Account of the Rise and Progress of the Colonies of South Carolina and Georgia\\". He remained loyal to the King during the American Revolution, and as a result his property was seized and he was expelled in 1777. Life and work Hewat(t) was a Presbyterian minister who officiated in Charleston, South Carolina from 1763 to 1777. After the publication of his History in 1779, he was awarded an honorary DD doctorate degree by Edinburgh University. His character may be illustrated by one of his Sermons cited by Smollett. Gold is the idol of every traitor, and he that proves faithful to his king and country for a great reward only, will betray them both for a greater. What was the method Constantius Chlorus took to try the souls of his public servants, both civil and military? Being friendly disposed towards the Christian religion, and sensible how hard it was to know the human heart, we are told, that he assembled his officers and judges, and proposed to them this condition, either to sacrifice to demons, or leave the court and their places to others, giving each liberty of choice. By this device he divided his servants into two parties, into men of principle, and men of the world. (p. 347) Hewat believed that Religion was important for the cohesion of society, where every man should do his duty according to the station in life that Providence had allocated to him. In a 1794 sermon on The Duty of Man in Perilous Times cited by The English Review he warned: \\"Let the superior ranks beware how they introduce into society an irreverence for God, and a distaste for religion; for they cannot do so but at their peril.\\" The lower ranks are taught their duty, and warned against: the dangers of civil convulsion, with equal propriety. Hewat's History of South Carolina and Georgia includes observations of the peoples of the area, so although its account of early history may be inaccurate to a degree and his historical interpretation of the events of the times no longer in fashion, his observation of facts continues to be cited, especially his accounts of slaves and Native Americans. Hewat may have been only a \\"gentleman historian\\" but he had the advantage of first- hand observation, with the ability, time, and local contacts required for a remarkably dispassionate account of pre-revolutionary Carolina. Hewat's history, one author said, \\"is the basis ‚Äî in fact the substance ‚Äî of Ramsay's history, which quotes him copiously (without acknowledgement) and follows him blindly.\\" A less strident assessment is that Ramsay \\"shows a disposition to follow slavishly in the footsteps of Hewat.\\" Contemporaneous resident of Charleston, but on the Revolutionary side, Congressman David Ramsay acknowledged his extensive use of Hewat's History, writing in his 1808 Preface: \\"Dr. Hewat's historical account of the rise and progress of the colonies of South Carolina and Georgia, was read with much more advantage ‚Äî on it greater reliance was placed ‚Äî and of it more use has been made, than of all the histories which had preceded. To him every Carolinian ought to be obliged for preserving many useful facts which otherwise would before this day have been forgotten. His valuable work was written shortly before the American Revolution, when tradition went further back and was more recent than at present.\\" Hewatt Square, in Charleston, South Carolina, was named for him. Hewat's History is still a respected account of Colonial American history, has been transcribed by Project Guttenberg, and is still in print. Incidentally, the \\"Hewatt\\" spelling was apparently introduced after his book was published anonymously; manuscript letters (below) show that he himself spelled his name \\"Hewat\\". Family Hewat came from a long line of Calvinist farmers, notaries and churchmen. The earliest record of the name appears to be a William Hewat (born about 1366); the UK National Archives show he bore witness to a grant of land and tenement at Nustede (Newstead) in 1387. Peter Hewat (born before 1482) was a Notary in Roxburgh Scotland; the National Archives of Scotland show he was a witness to an assignment of land to the church on 16 September 1503. James Hewat, was a Dominican Order friar in Dundee in the 1520s, and one of the earliest teachers of Calvin's doctrine in Scotland. In the conflicts between Catholic, Protestant and then Anglican and Puritan religions, Hewats often found themselves on the wrong side. In 1619 (the year before Mayflower) Peter Hewat a church leader, notary and member of the Parliament of Scotland, was exiled to Crossraguel Abbey (which had been given to him in 1612 by the king) after James VI of Scotland had become head of the official Anglican church as James I of England. By the 18th century Hewats were farming around Roxburgh when Alexander's grandfather James was expelled from his kirk for taking over other people's land. However, Alexander's father Richard (1707‚Äì1776) became an elder of the church and is described on his tombstone, still standing in Roxburgh churchyard, as \\"an honest and industrious man and a sincere and devout Christian\\". Alexander Hewat's arrival in Charleston and his History of the Colony Hewat was a young man of about twenty-four when he arrived in Charleston in 1763 as minister of the Scots (First Presbyterian) Church there. He had received his early education at Kelso Grammar School in Scotland and had attended the University of Edinburgh. Shortly after his arrival in Charleston he was elected to the St. Andrew's Club, an organisation of native-born Scotsmen which included some of the colony's leading men, and so had the chance to secure authentic evidence and first-hand experience for his historical narrative. His association with royal officials gave him access to official documents which he used in his history. Hewat's first volume attempts to outline the earliest settlement of North America, and the reasons for the influx of British, French and other European migrants in the early 17th century due to religious conflict at home. He wrote: \\"Amidst cold, hunger, toil, disease, and distress of every kind, they comforted themselves with the thoughts of being removed far out of the reach of tyrants, and triumphed in their deliverance from an idolatrous and wicked nation.\\" Hewat describes in much detail the conditions and customs of American Indians, with whom he shows sympathy despite their threat to European immigrants. \\"When Julius Caesar carried the Roman arms into Britain, and Germanicus over-ran the forests of Germany, did they not find the silvestres of those countries little, if at all, more civilized than the brown natives of America?\\" And even some humour ... \\"In case of adultery among Indians, the injured husband considers himself as under an obligation to revenge the crime, and he attempts to cut off the ears of the adulterer... This is more severe than the law of Ethelbert, which admitted of a fine from the adulterer, and obliged him to purchase another wife for the injured husband.\\" He describes the settlement of Carolina by aristocratic British Proprietors, the setting up of plantations, wars with the Indians, the Spanish and Pirates, and the hardships of the climate. \\"New settlers in all countries and climates are subject to many hardships, especially such as are in low and indigent circumstances; but those of the first settlers of Carolina must have equalled, if not surpassed, every thing of the kind to which men in any age have been exposed.\\" He describes the ravages of smallpox, yellow fever and other diseases on both the native and immigrant population. Hewat describes the introduction of African slaves, and maintains that \\"Hawkins had no idea of perpetual slavery, but expected they would be treated as free servants, after they had by their labours brought their masters an equivalent for the expense of their purchase... Hence arose that horrid and inhuman practice of dragging Africans into slavery; which has since been so pursued, in defiance of every principle of justice and religion... Nature has given the people of the one continent no superiority over those of the other; the advantages of Europeans were the effects only of art and improvement.\\" Hewat saw Africans as more suited to the SC climate, and essential to the Southern Economy, but imagined an indentured servant system similar to that which existed for white immigrants, and supposed that the conditions of slavery would incite them to revolt, as indeed they did at Stono in September 1739. \\"At this time there were above forty thousand negroes in the province, a fierce, hardy and strong race, whose constitutions were adapted to the warm climate, whose nerves were braced with constant labour, and who could scarcely be supposed to be contented with that oppressive yoke under which they groaned.\\" Hewat's own brother Andrew, used Black labour on his plantation, and after the Revolution at least one followed him into exile, first to Nova Scotia, and then back to Roxburgh. Indeed, many Black Loyalists fought against the revolution, and left with White Loyalists as a result. The economic requirement for Black labour in the South, and the growing opposition to slavery in Britain, may have been one of the roots of the revolution in the South, just as it was later in the civil war. In his history, Hewat points to errors made by the British Administration, and is careful not to criticise unduly the revolutionaries, setting out their complaints in some detail about what they saw as unfair taxation, or indeed any taxation at all by a parliament they claimed could not, at that distance, represent them. He did however passionately believe that Britain and America had more to achieve united than separated. When Hewat, along with other Charleston ministers, was ordered on 3 August 1776 to pray no more for the king, he \\"changed the form to 'those in Lawful Authority over us' which gave great Offence,\\" but complied with the letter of the order. Given sixty days to leave the colony or suffer imprisonment and perhaps death, Hewat left his congregation and his property and took passage to Nantes; from there, he went to London. Charleston had been recaptured by British forces by the time Hewat received the honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from Edinburgh University on 12 July 1780. He obviously expected to return to his home, for he signed the Laureation Book of the University as a resident of \\"Charlestown, South Carolina.\\" American animosity against those who had not supported the rebellion relegated loyalists to historical oblivion; nor did the British receive them with generosity or pay them honour for their sacrifice. Dr Alexander Hewat's letter To G. Edwards, 28 September 1820. Charleston Library Society MS#79 via Ogden Hammond. Manuscript copy of Dr Alexander Hewat's letter of 28 September 1820 On the death of his wife (formerly Mrs Barksdale of Charleston), Hewat wrote to G. Edwards, her relation in Charleston, showing much affection still for South Carolina. This manuscript clearly shows that he spelled his name \\"Hewat\\". George Edwards, Charleston So., Carolina Carolina Coffee House (London), 28 September 1820 Dr Hewat presents his best respects to Mr & Mrs Edwards, and having an excellent opportunity sends them by the Bearer two miniature pictures which belong to the good family of Barksdale. From what he often heard during Mrs Hewat's lifetime he has reason to conclude they will be particularly acceptable to Mrs Edwards of whom Mrs Hewat often spoke with much affection. They will be handed to her by Mr Hall in the same condition & in the Same Box in which they were left by the Deceased; and She will be pleased to accept of them in memorial of two dear and beautiful relations. They both died in Flanders and were brought to England & buried, to which place their Mother at her request was also conveyed & buried betwixt them in the same Tomb at Dover. I never saw the children, having never met their Mother in England till both were above three years & dead & buried; tho' she belonged to my Parish before she was first married; and Mr Barksdale I remember well, and together with Mr & Mrs Gordon I approved of the Choice she made. Mr Thomas Braidwood our English Teacher of the Deaf & Dumb has oft expressed to me his surprise at the degree of perfection to which the child had attained in speaking; but her mother, anxious for still greater proficiency, was advised to carry her to another famous master in France, which advice was to her matter of great lamentation till Death. Farewell & God bless you & all friends in Carolina. Death Alexander Hewat died in Marylebone, London on 3 March 1824 at the age of 85. He left an estate of 7000 sterling (equivalent to almost ¬£500,000 in 2000), including a small legacy to the Scots church in Charleston, and is buried in St. John's Wood.U.K. Death Duty Registers, Public Record Office, 20 May 1824 PROB 11/1686.

The two villages making up the principal part of the parish lie on the A267 road between Royal Tunbridge Wells and Eastbourne: Mayfield, the larger of the two villages is ten miles (16 km) south of Royal Tunbridge Wells; with Five Ashes being 2.5 miles (4 km) further south. Mayfield village Village sign. Every September the village hosts its annual carnival. This is to commemorate the Protestants being condemned here on 23 September 1556, and being burnt at the stake in Lewes. The festival is part of the Sussex bonfire tradition of marking the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot. The procession marches through the village by torchlight on the third Saturday in September, climaxing with a firework display in the recreation ground. The money raised through the street collection is spent on charities. Governance Mayfield and Five Ashes Civil Parish falls within the electoral ward simply called Mayfield. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 2,614. =Toponymy= The early village was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1087 within the Rape of Pevensey as Mesewelle,http://domesdaymap.co.uk/place/TQ5827/mayfield/ which may indicate a well on tableland or more likely \\"belonging to Meese\\", a Norman man's name, or less likely, a new well or well dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The meshing of Norman French and Anglo-Saxon into Middle English meant that one person was often referred to by several spellings in a lifetime. Various spellings of Meese include Meece, Mese, Mece, Mees, Mey, and May. The village name derives from both \\"Maghefeld\\"History of the Deanery of South Malling (a field where mayweed grows) and \\"maid's field\\"‚Äìthe village sign depicts a maid. A number of 15th century emigrants to the new world had the surname May rather than Maid, which indicates the Middle English \\"mayde\\" in signage began as a rebus. Mayfield used to be a part of the manor of Malling, to the north west of Lewes, which belonged to the Kings of Wessex. Between 823 and 836 CE, King Egbert of Wessex and his son √Üthelwulf gave it to Canterbury Cathedral: it became an Archbishop's 'peculiar' in the Diocese of Canterbury, and one of the Archbishop's palaces was built here. It was transferred to the Diocese of Chichester in 1846. =16th and 17th centuries= Mayfield was at its height during the boom in the Wealden iron industry, and many of the fine houses date from that time. =18th and 19th centuries= During the early 18th century, Mayfield became a centre for owling - smuggling wool for brandy and silk. Gabriel Tomkins was the leader of the local gang: in 1721 he was chased from Burwash to Nutley and then was arrested. The gang had a reputation for not using violence; and also applying their profits to the benefit of the local community, unlike many other such gangs: the Hawkhurst Gang in particular. The Swing Riots affected the area with army arriving on 15 November 1830. Some local workers were imprisoned or transported. With the opening of the railway line in 1880 between Hailsham and Tunbridge Wells a railway station was built to serve the village. On 1 September 1897, there was a railway accident on a curved section of track between Heathfield and Mayfield near Clayton Farm. A six-carriage train pulled by the engine Bonchurch was derailed and the driver was killed. image 165 the station closed in 1965 following the Beeching Report. The station building in Station Road is now converted to a private house and the route of the railway is now occupied by the re-routed A267 bypass of the village. =Mayfield churches= St Dunstan's Church Both village and church are said to have been founded by the Archbishop of Canterbury, St Dunstan, in 960 CE, and there are legends surrounding his connection with the village. Dunstan is supposed to have become an ironworker and run a small forge next to the church. The legend goes that he was confronted by the devil, either making offensive remarks, or disguised as a young woman. He then pinched the devil's nose with the tongs. The devil then fled to Tunbridge Wells and doused his burnt nose with the spring water. Some sources note that the story happened in Glastonbury rather than Mayfield, and that Dunstan may have in fact clamped tongs around someone's nose, with the story of it being the devil added later. The Anglican church is dedicated to Dunstan. In 1389 much of the village and most of the church were destroyed by fire; the latter was struck by lightning in the 17th century.Church of St Dunstan, History of Church Building . The church was subsequently rebuilt in the fifteenth century. The church is in a mostly Perpendicular style and has a \\"squat, shingled broach spire\\". Inside the church there are a number of graves made of iron for the families of Mayfield's ironmasters. Mayfield Baptist Chapel There are three other religious buildings in Mayfield: the Roman Catholic church of St Thomas of Canterbury (in Station Road), Coggins Mill Church (a Free Church, also in Station Road), and Mayfield Baptist Chapel (on South Street). =Shops and businesses= There are a large number of shops and other commercial properties in Mayfield High Street.Village Directory There are two pubs in Mayfield: the Middle House (in the High Street) and the Rose and Crown (in Fletching Street). =Mayfield schools= Mayfield College, the now defunct private boys' school. St Leonards-MayfieldHomepage of St Leonards Mayfield school Roman Catholic girls' boarding school, which has existed since 1872, is situated on the High Street. The school consists of years seven up to thirteen. The head mistress is Miss Antonia Beary. The school is on the site of the Mayfield Old Palace which, after being founded by St Dunstan, used to be a lodging place for archbishops before being given to Henry VIII. It was rebuilt in the fourteenth century by Archbishop Simon Islip, and was owned by Thomas Cranmer before being given to Henry VIII in 1545. It was also used by Edward I and Queen Elizabeth I. After this, it fell into ruin image 91 but was purchased in 1863 by the Duchess of Leeds and given to the Society of the Holy Child, who established a convent there. The school was opened in 1872. Mayfield College, a now-defunct boys' boarding school run by the Xaverian Brothers, was located in nearby Little Trodgers Lane. Following its closure its main building, designed by E. W. Pugin, has been converted to luxury apartments.Weston Homes restores Mayfield College to its former glory The village's Church of England primary school is mainly Edwardian but has modern additions. Five Ashes village Between Mayfield and Heathfield lie two small hamlets: Cross-in-Hand and Five Ashes. The latter is part of the same parish as Mayfield. =Churches= The small village church is dedicated to The Good Shepherd. =Commercial businesses= There are no retail shops in the village apart from a Porsche car dealership. There is also a pub called The Five Ashes Inn. =Schools= Five Ashes C of E Primary School There are two schools in Five Ashes. Five Ashes Primary School is a small voluntary controlled Church of England school with around 45 children on roll.

She is also a former MTV VJ, sometimes credited on-screen as China Slick Kantner. Biography Kantner was born in San Francisco, California, the daughter of two Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship bandmembers, singer Grace Slick (born Grace Wing) and guitarist Paul Kantner. She is a native of San Francisco, living first in the city itself, and later in Mill Valley,Jefferson Starship: Strange Times at the Launching Pad - Rolling Stone Retrieved 2016-12-21. just north of the city, and is an alumna of Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley, California and Redwood High School, Larkspur, California. She has an older half-brother, Gareth Alexander Kantner, who works in the film industry, and a younger half-brother, Alexander Kantner, who occasionally appears on-stage with Jefferson Starship playing bass guitar. A common misbelief is that her name was originally \\"god\\" (with a small \\"g\\"), and was only later changed to \\"China\\". However, Jeff Tamarkin's 2003 book on the history of Jefferson Airplane, Got a Revolution: The Turbulent Flight of Jefferson Airplane, explains this resulted from a sardonic remark made by her mother to a nurse.Got a Revolution: The Turbulent Flight of Jefferson Airplane, Tamarkin, 2003, p235 In San Francisco County, a birth was registered for January 25, 1971, for a female child with the surname Kantner. The mother's maiden surname was Wing. No given name was registered for the child at that time. While working for MTV, she was sometimes credited on- screen as \\"China Slick Kantner\\", although this was never her legal name. Later in her MTV career, she was credited simply as \\"China Kantner\\". In January 1988, she was interviewed by Jonathan King for the BBC TV show Entertainment USA as part of a feature on the children of rock stars working as MTV VJs. During this interview, she stated that, while she initially did not like her name, she grew to like it as she got older. She first appeared as an infant on the cover of the Kantner/Slick 1971 solo LP Sunfighter. She has been given co- songwriting credits by her father on several of his songs. She also sang a song on his 1983 album Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra. =MTV and radio= In July 1986, she appeared as a guest VJ on MTV, which led to her making regular appearances for the next four years during her summer vacations. When she started working for the station at the age of 15, she was, at the time, the youngest MTV VJ ever. As an MTV VJ, she interviewed her father for the MTV Summer of Love 20th anniversary celebrations. For a while around 1989, she also presented a Saturday night phone-in request show on a local Bay Area radio station, KRQR-FM. =Acting= Having started off acting in school plays, Kantner has appeared in several movies (such as Airheads, The Stoned Age and The Evening Star), television sitcoms (notably Home Improvement) and stage plays. Between acting roles, she studied psychology at Santa Monica College, having relocated from San Francisco to Los Angeles in the early 1990s. Her 1998 appearance in season seven of Home Improvement as the recurring character Willow Branch Leaf Wilson (she 'pruned' the name back to Willow Wilson) was her final professional acting role, and she has now retired from acting. In late 2001, following an interview in Vanity Fair, she also stopped giving interviews. She did, however, provide a few brief quotes for Jeff Tamarkin's book on the history of Jefferson Airplane. =Personal life= Like her mother, Kantner has, over the years, struggled with alcoholism.Baker 1996, Brown 2000, Dodd 1996, Kantner 2008 She has been sober since about 1998. She contributed a section to the book Playing It Straight by David Dodd, alongside her mother and other recovering substance abusers, such as Dennis Hopper, Steven Tyler and Ozzy Osbourne. In 1999, she married a Los Angeles dentist, Jamie Azdair, although the couple divorced in 2006. While they were married, she preferred to be known by her married name of China Azdair. On 13 April 2011, Kantner married actor and producer Seth Isler and now prefers to be known as China Isler. After retiring from acting, she studied art history at UCLA. In 2007, she obtained a degree in Christian theology (with a minor in English) at Loyola Marymount University. In a 2007 interview, her mother stated, \\"My daughter loves studying Jesus. Some friends of hers turn their nose up at that. They don't understand that she is not talking about churches and what churches say; she is studying the actual words and message of Jesus.\\" =Musical career= Kantner has, over the years, made several contributions to the music of Jefferson Starship as both songwriter and singer. However, she has also commented in interviews that she has no real musical aspirations of her own, claiming that she cannot sing very well. She has also said that having well-known musicians for parents actually lost her several parts, as directors automatically assumed she was also musical. Kantner has several songwriting credits on various Jefferson Starship albums. The first is for the song \\"Don't Let It Rain\\", from the 1976 album Spitfire. This was followed by credits for \\"Things to Come\\" (Freedom at Point Zero, 1979), \\"Out of Control\\" (Winds of Change, 1982), and \\"The Sky Is No Limit\\" on her father's 1983 solo album Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra. Kantner appeared as credited lead vocalist on the song \\"Declaration Of Independence\\" and contributing vocalist on \\"The Sky Is No Limit\\" and \\"Let's Go\\", all of which appear on Planet Earth Rock And Roll Orchestra. She also made an uncredited appearance on the songs \\"Wooden Ships\\" and \\"Volunteers\\" on the 1995 live album Deep Space/Virgin Sky, which was later re-released in an expanded form as Deeper Space/Extra Virgin Sky.

Today it is kept in the Hast Imam library, in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. It is said to have belonged to the third caliph, Uthman ibn Affan. Dating the Manuscript The Uthman Quran, Sura 7 (Ala'araf), verses 86 and 87 Based on orthographic and palaeographic studies, the manuscript probably dates from the 8th or 9th century.E. A. Rezvan, \\"On The Dating Of An ‚Äú'Uthmanic Qur'an‚Äù From St. Petersburg\\", Manuscripta Orientalia, 2000, Volume 6, No. 3, pp. 19-22. Radio- carbon dating showed a 95.4% probability of a date between 775 and 995. However, one of the folios from another manuscript (held in the Religious Administration of Muslims in Tashkent) was dated to between 595 and 855 A.D. with a likelihood of 95%.  History  The copy of the Quran is traditionally considered to be one of a group commissioned by the third caliph Uthman; however, this attribution has been questioned. According to Islamic tradition, in 651, 19 years after the death of the Islamic Prophet, Muhammad, Uthman commissioned a committee to produce a standard copy of the text of the Quran (see Origin and development of the Quran). Five of these authoritative Qurans were sent to the major Muslim cities of the era, and Uthman kept one for his own use in Medina, although the Samarkand Quran is most likely not one of those copies. The only other surviving copy was thought to be the one held in Topkapƒ± Palace in Turkey, but studies have shown that the Topkapƒ± manuscript is also not from the 7th century, but from much later. Uthman was succeeded by Ali, who took the uthmanic Quran to Kufa, now in Iraq. The subsequent history of this Quran is known only from legends. According to one of them, when Tamerlane destroyed the area, he took the Quran to his capital, Samarkand, as a treasure. According to another, the Quran was brought from the caliph of Rum to Samarkand by Khoja Ahrar, a Turkestani sufi master, as a gift after he had cured the caliph. The Quran remained in the Khoja Ahrar Mosque of Samarkand for four centuries until 1869, when the Russian general Abramov bought it from the mullahs of the mosque and gave it to Konstantin von Kaufman, Governor- General of Turkestan, who in turn sent it to the Imperial Library in Saint Petersburg (now the Russian National Library). It attracted the attention of Orientalists and eventually a facsimile edition was published in Saint- Petersburg in 1905. The 50 copies soon became rarities. The first thorough description and dating of the manuscript was undertaken by the Russian Orientalist Shebunin in 1891. After the October Revolution, Vladimir Lenin, in an act of goodwill to the Muslims of Russia, gave the Quran to the people of Ufa, Bashkortostan. After repeated appeals by the people of the Turkestan ASSR, the Quran was returned to Central Asia, to Tashkent, in 1924, where it has since remained.  Current state  The Samarkand manuscript, now kept in Tashkent The parchment manuscript now is held in the library of the Telyashayakh Mosque, in the old \\"Hast-Imam\\" (Khazrati Imom) area of Tashkent, close to the grave of Kaffal Shashi, a 10th-century Islamic scholar. A folio containing a page from the sura Al-Anbiya is held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, US. The manuscript is incomplete: it begins in the middle of verse 7 of the second sura and ends at Surah 43:10. The manuscript has between eight and twelve lines to the page and, showing its antiquity, the text is devoid of vocalisation.

Written by Jonze and Dave Eggers, it is based on Maurice Sendak's 1963 children's book of the same name. It combines live-action, performers in costumes, animatronics, and computer-generated imagery (CGI). The film stars Max Records and features the voices of James Gandolfini, Paul Dano, Lauren Ambrose, Forest Whitaker, Catherine O'Hara, and Chris Cooper. The film centers on a lonely boy named Max who sails away to an island inhabited by creatures known as the \\"Wild Things,\\" who declare Max their king. In the early 1980s, Disney considered adapting the film as a blend of traditionally animated characters and computer-generated environments, but development did not go past a test film to see how the animation hybridizing would result. In 2001, Universal Studios acquired rights to the book's adaptation and initially attempted to develop a computer-animated adaptation with Disney animator Eric Goldberg, but the CGI concept was replaced with a live-action one in 2003, and Goldberg was dropped for Spike Jonze. The film was co-produced by actor Tom Hanks through his production company Playtone and made with an estimated budget of $100 million. Where the Wild Things Are was a joint production between Australia, Germany, and the United States, and was filmed principally in Melbourne. The film was released on October 16, 2009, in the United States, on December 3 in Australia, and on December 17 in Germany. The film was met with mostly positive reviews and appeared on many year-end top ten lists. However, the film was a box office bomb, making $100.1 million from a budget of $100 million. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 2, 2010. Plot 8-year-old Max, a lonely boyWBshop.com - The Official Online Store of Warner Bros. Studios with an active imagination whose parents are divorced, is wearing a wolf costume and chasing his dog. His older sister, Claire, does nothing when her friends crush Max's snow fort with him inside during a snowball fight. Out of frustration, Max messes up her bedroom and destroys a frame he made for her. At school, Max's teacher teaches him and his classmates about the eventual death of the sun. Later his mother, Connie, invites her boyfriend Adrian to dinner. Max becomes upset with his mother for not coming to the fort he made in his room. He wears his wolf costume, acts like an animal, and demands to be fed. When his mother gets upset, he throws a tantrum and bites her on the shoulder. She yells at him and he runs away, scared by what transpired. At the edge of a pond, Max finds a small boat that he boards. The pond soon becomes an ocean. Max, still in his wolf suit, reaches an island. He stumbles upon a group of seven large, monstrous creatures. One of them, Carol, is in the middle of a destructive tantrum caused by the departure of a female Wild Thing named KW. As Carol wreaks havoc, Max tries joining in on the mayhem but finds himself facing the suspicious anger of the Wild Things. When they contemplate eating him, Max convinces them that he is a king with magical powers capable of bringing harmony to the group. They crown him as their new king. Shortly after, KW returns, and Max declares a wild rumpus in which the Wild Things smash trees and tackle each other. The Wild Things introduce themselves as Carol, Ira, Judith, Alexander, Douglas, the Bull, and KW. Soon, they pile on one another before going to sleep with Max at the center. Carol takes Max on a tour of the island, showing him a model he built depicting what he wishes the island looked like. Inspired by this, Max orders the construction of an enormous fort with Carol in charge of construction. When KW brings her two owl friends, Bob and Terry, to the fort, a disagreement ensues as Carol feels they are outsiders. To release their frustrations, Max divides the tribe into \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys\\" for a dirt clod fight. However, Alexander is injured during the game, and Carol berates KW for jokingly stepping on his head, prompting the latter to leave once again. Max finds Alexander alone in the fort. Alexander reveals that he suspected that Max is not a king with magical powers, but warns him to never let Carol know. Max‚Äôs secret, however, is soon revealed by Douglas when Carol throws another tantrum in the middle of the night - this time over the state of the fort and Max‚Äôs failure to fulfill his duties as a king. Carol becomes enraged and rips off Douglas's right arm - though only sand pours from the wound - before chasing Max into the forest and attempting to eat him. Max is saved by KW, who hides him in her stomach. After Carol leaves, KW explains to Max how difficult everyone‚Äôs lives are, with Carol‚Äôs tantrums only making matters worse. Max realizes what his mother is going through, and decides to leave the island. Max finds the crushed remains of Carol's model island and leaves a token of affection for him to find. Max finds Carol and tells him he is going home because he is not a king. The other Wild Things escort Max to his boat. Carol runs to join them after finding Max's token and arrives in time to see him off. He starts to howl and Max howls back; then all the other Wild Things join in.

Animators Glen Keane and John Lasseter (who later moved on to Pixar) had completed a test film to see how the animation hybridising would work out, but the project proceeded no further. Universal Studios acquired rights to the book's adaptation in 2001 and initially attempted to develop a computer- animated adaptation with Disney animator Eric Goldberg, but in 2003 the CGI concept was replaced with a live-action one, and Goldberg was replaced with Spike Jonze. After years of interest from various producers, Sendak favoured Spike Jonze as director, noting he was \\"young, interesting and had a spark that none of the others had\\". The film was originally set for release from Universal, and a teaser of the film was attached to the studio's 2000 adaptation of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Disagreements between Universal and Sendak over Jonze's approach to the story led to a turnaround arrangement where the film's production was transferred to Warner Bros. In 2005, Jonze and Dave Eggers completed a 111-page screenplay, expanding the original ten- sentence story. On 8 July 2006, production began open auditions for the role of Max. The process took months, but, eventually, Max Records was cast. Academy Award-winning make-up effects supervisor Howard Berger (The Chronicles of Narnia) turned down offers to work on the film four times. Although the book inspired him as a child to work in special effects, he felt filming it was a \\"horrible idea.\\" Jim Henson's Creature Shop provided the animatronic suits for the Wild Things.https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2009/10/where- the-wild-things-are-built-jim-hensons-creature-workshop/amp Jonze kept in close consultation with Sendak throughout the process, and the author approved creature designs created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. To make the set a more comfortable environment for Max Records, Jonze encouraged the crew members to bring their children to the set. Some of them can be seen in the film's classroom scene. Michelle Williams was originally cast as the female Wild Thing KW only to leave the project after her voice \\"didn't match the original vision of how the Wild Thing should sound\\". She was replaced by Lauren Ambrose, and filming continued. =Filming= Principal photography began in April 2006 at Docklands Studios Melbourne in Melbourne, Australia. In 2008, test footage was leaked onto the internet, garnering mixed reactions. Jonze called the footage \\"a very early test... to see if our VFX plan for the faces would work,\\" but early fan outcry over the video, along with rumored \\"scared children\\" in test audiences led Warner Bros. to delay the film's release for a year. On 20 February 2008, speculation emerged that Warner Bros. was considering reshooting the entire film. Then-WB president Alan F. Horn responded, \\"We've given him more money and, even more importantly, more time for him to work on the film. We'd like to find a common ground that represents Spike's vision but still offers a film that really delivers for a broad-based audience. No one wants to turn this into a bland, sanitized studio movie. This is a very special piece of material, and we're just trying to get it right.\\" Producer Gary Goetzman followed, \\"We support Spike's vision. We're helping him make the vision he wants to make.\\" At the end of 2008, Spike got together with Framestore in London to complete his movie and work with them to bring to life the performances through their animation and visual effects team. Over the course of the next six months, Spike spent time with the animators on the floor of the studio as they worked together to realise his intention for the performances that had started many years before with the voices, continued with the suit performances in Australia, and were completed in London's Soho. =Music= For the film's trailer, Arcade Fire provided a re-recorded version of the track \\"Wake Up\\" from their album Funeral. The new version is not featured in the actual film or the soundtrack and has never been made available to the public. During the film, various songs can be heard such as \\"Hideaway\\", \\"Rumpus\\", \\"Worried Shoes\\" and \\"All is Love\\" by Karen O, Zahida K, Anisa R K and the Kids. Reception =Box office= The studio decided not to position the film as a children's movie and spent 70% of the advertising on broad-based and adult-driven promotion.Where The Wild Things Are Runs Up $33M by Nikki Finke, Deadline Hollywood, 17 October 2009 The film was released in North America in both conventional and IMAX theatres on 16 October 2009. Early Friday box office estimates show the film earned about $32.7 million on its opening weekend in theaters. It grossed $77.2 million during its theatrical run in the U.S. and Canada, plus $22.8 million internationally. Overall, the studio took a loss as the final budget of the movie was estimated to be around $100 million. Internationally, the film was released in Australia on 4 December 2009; in Ireland and the UK on 11 December 2009; and in Germany on 17 December 2009.Wo die wilden Kerle wohnen ‚Äì movieworlds.com. It was released in Russia on 4 February 2010.Where the Wild Things Are Russian release date 4 February 2010. Page in Russian. =Critical response= Reception to the film has been generally positive. The film holds a 73% approval rating on review website Rotten Tomatoes from 268 reviews with an average score of 6.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Some may find its dark tone and slender narrative off-putting, but Spike Jonze's heartfelt adaptation of the classic children's book is as beautiful as it is uncompromising.\\" Review aggregation website Metacritic gave the film an average score of 71 out of 100 based on 37 reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+ on scale of A to F. Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A, declaring the film \\"one of the year's best.\\" Manohla Dargis of the New York Times wrote that Spike Jonze's \\"filmmaking exceeds anything he's done\\" before, while also noting the imaginative visuals and otherworldly feel, along with the fantastic creature effects on the \\"Wild Things\\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film four stars saying, \\"For all the money spent, the film's success is best measured by its simplicity and the purity of its innovation.\\" Roger Ebert awarded the film three stars out of four, saying, \\"All the same, the film will play better for older audiences remembering a much-loved book from childhood, and not as well with kids who have been trained on slam-bam action animation.\\" Dan Jolin of Empire Magazine gave the film a four out of five stars, saying, \\"A film for anyone who's ever climbed trees, grassed knees or basked in the comfort of a parents sympathy as they've pulled you off the ground crying. It'll make your inner child run wild\\".https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/wild-things-2-review/ Some critics have noted the movie's dark adaptation for children, such as David Denby from The New Yorker saying, \\"I have a vision of eight-year-olds leaving the movie in bewilderment. Why are the creatures so unhappy?\\" Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com criticized the film's visual aspect, \\"Even the look of the picture becomes tiresome after a while ‚Äî it starts to seem depressive and shaggy and tired.\\" She also stated that \\"The movie is so loaded with adult ideas about childhood ‚Äî as opposed to things that might delight or engage an actual child.\\" The Globe and Mails Liam Lacey branded the production a \\"self- consciously sad film.\\" Critic A.O. Scott named the film the best of 2009 and placed it at number five on his list of top ten movies of the decade. =Suitability for children= Warner Bros. initially feared that the film was not family friendly and would frighten children, but these fears were not shared by Jonze or Sendak, and Jonze refused to compromise. Maurice Sendak said after having seen a completed cut of the film, \\"I've never seen a movie that looked or felt like this. And it's [Spike Jonze's] personal 'this.' And he's not afraid of himself. He's a real artist that lets it come through in the work. So he's touched me. He's touched me very much.\\" After seeing the finished product, a Warner Bros. executive stated of Jonze, \\"He's a perfectionist and just kept working on it, but now we know that at the end of the day he nailed it.\\" Film classification agencies have tended to assign \\"parental guidance\\" ratings rather than general or family ratings. MPAA in the United States assessed a PG rating \\"for mild thematic elements, some adventure action, and brief language\\". A PG rating was also declared in the United Kingdom by BBFC, citing \\"mild threat and brief violence\\". In Canada, the film also received a PG rating in Ontario with an alert for frightening scenes while Quebec awarded a General rating. British Columbia also assessed the film with a G rating with a proviso that it \\"may frighten young children\\". In Ireland the film has been classified PG because of what is claimed as having \\"mild\\" violenceReviews of Where the Wild Things Are 6 October 2009 from Irish Film Classification Office. Similarly in South Africa, the film received a PG rating with a consumer content Violence indicator, noting there were \\"moments of mildish menace and poignant themes.\\" Australia also applied a PG rating to the film and noted \\"mild violence and scary scenes\\". The movie's release generated conflicting views over whether it is harmful to expose children to frightening scenes. Jonze indicated that his goal was \\"to make a movie about childhood\\" rather than to create a children's movie. Dan Fellman, Warner Brothers' head of movie distribution, noted that the film's promotion was not directed towards children, advising parents to exercise their own discretion. In an interview with Newsweek, Sendak stated that parents who deemed the film's content to be too disturbing for children should \\"go to hell. That's a question I will not tolerate\\" and he further noted \\"I saw the most horrendous movies that were unfit for child's eyes. So what? I managed to survive.\\" =Home media= The film was released as a Blu-ray/DVD/Digital copy combo pack and on DVD on 2 March 2010. The home media release was accompanied by a Canadian-produced live-action/animated short film adaptation of another Sendak work, Higglety Pigglety Pop! or There Must Be More to Life, produced especially for the Blu-ray edition. Merchandise =Video game= A video game based on the film was released on 13 October 2009, for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, and Nintendo DS. The former three were developed by Griptonite Games, and the latter by WayForward. All were published by Warner Bros. Games. =Skateboards and limited edition shoes= To coincide with the film's release, Girl Skateboards (which Jonze co-owns) came out with seven pro-model skateboards with the Wild Things as the board graphics. Lakai shoes also re- designed most of their pro-model and stock shoes and added in different colors, adding in pictures of the Wild Things on the side and on others with Where the Wild Things Are printed on the side.Lakai Limited Footwear UGG Australia also designed limited-edition Where the Wild Things Are boots.Where The Wild Things Are Limited Edition Boots ‚Äì UGG Australia. =Toys= A series of collectible vinyl dolls of the Wild Things and Max was released from the Japanese company MediCom Toys. Other releases include an eight-inch articulated figure of Max in wolf costume and smaller scale sets of the characters released under their Kubrick figure banner. =Novelization= McSweeney's published The Wild Things by Dave Eggers, a full-length novel based on the film adaptation.

Raktabƒ´ja had a boon that whenever a drop of his blood fell on the ground, a duplicate Raktabƒ´ja would be born at that spot (rakta = blood, bƒ´ja = seed; \\"he for whom each drop of blood is a seed\\"). According to some sources, Raktabija was, in his previous birth, Rambhasura, king of demons and the father of Mahishasura. The eighth chapter of the Devi Mahatmya, raktabIja-vadh, focuses on Ambika's battle with Raktabƒ´ja as part of her battle against the asuras Shumbha and Nishumbha, who had disenfranchised the gods from heaven. Raktabƒ´ja was wounded, but drops of blood falling on the ground created innumerable other Raktabƒ´jas, and Ambika and the Matrikas were in difficulty. At this point, the Goddess Kali joined the battle, who collected blood pouring from Raktabƒ´ja's body in a bowl while other goddesses wounded him. Kali devoured his duplicates into her gaping mouth. This form who drank the demon's blood is also called Raktheshwari. Ultimately, Raktabƒ´ja was annihilated. According to popular folklore, after killing Raktabƒ´ja and most of his entire army, Goddess Kali went on to kill all creatures in a fury, but was timely intervened by Lord Shiva who laid himself in her path. Striking his body, Kali was shaken and embarrassed and took out her tongue. This act has been depicted in many Hindu paintings and portraits. There are references of Kali not being created but having sprung from Durga's forehead as they were all the same goddess in different forms.

History  Statue of Berzelius in the centre of Berzelii Park = Planning and construction = Berzelii Park was named after the Swedish chemist J√∂ns Jacob Berzelius. The work on establishing the park was begun in 1852, under the leadership of Knut Malte Forsberg. The park's opening ceremony took place on the morning of July 13, 1858. = Monuments added = The Academy of Sciences initiated funding for a statue honoring Berzelius, which was to stand in the middle of the park. Artist Carl Gustaf Qvarnstr√∂m (1810-1867) was commissioned to do the work. He went to Munich to model the statue and had Ferdinand von Miller cast it in bronze. It became the first public statue of a \\"commoner\\" to be produced in full figure. As the new park installations were still considered too fragile to receive a large crowd, the statue was secretly inaugurated in the middle of the night following the opening ceremony. Other monuments have been added in and around the park, including art by Carl Milles, and a humorous statue of Hans Alfredsson (seen sticking his head out of a sewer). Location The park today is located in or near the city districts of Norrmalm and √ñstermalm, next to the Nybroplan and the Norrmalmstorg. The area surrounding Berzelii Park was part of Nybroviken bay until the mid-19th century. In the mid-1830s, a new bridge across the bay was being planned for the 25th anniversary of King Charles XIV. On the request of the king, the part of the bay inside the bridge was replaced with landfill, which transformed the existing bridge into more of a quay. This old bridge, Ladug√•rdslandsbron, was demolished in 1845, but the replacement bridge wasn't opened until 1848 due to technical problems (caused by the load from the landfill). One of the cast iron railings from the old bridge is still found in the park today.J√§rbe, pp 39-43. Later development Berzelii Park initially failed to develop as intended. A report published in 1890 described its lawns as \\"consisting mostly of dandelions,\\" and the raised area surrounding the statue as a \\"sand hill\\". However, the situation improved when Alfred Medin became city gardener, and the same journalist later wrote enthusiastically about the park.

It has a large cast of well-known musical stars of the day who appear performing Kern's songs. It was the first in a series of MGM biopics about Broadway's composers; it was followed by Words and Music (Rodgers and Hart, 1948), Three Little Words (Kalmar and Ruby, 1950), and Deep in My Heart (Sigmund Romberg, 1954).

The working title for the film was \\"As the Clouds Roll By\\". Gene Kelly was originally intended to play Kern, with Gloria DeHaven, Jacqueline White, Imogene Carpenter, a stage actress, and Jeanette MacDonald in major parts. None appeared in the film. The first 15 minutes of the film consist of a condensed adaptation of Act I of Show Boat, with the order of some of the songs shifted - \\"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\\" is sung after \\"Life upon the Wicked Stage\\", and \\"Ol' Man River\\" was used as an Act I Finale, dissimilar to the show. \\"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\\" as sung by Lena Horne was filmed, like many of her other musical numbers in MGM films, so that it could be easily removed from the print by sensitive Southern distributors. When the film started production in the fall of 1945, Judy Garland was signed as Broadway singer-dancer Marilyn Miller, having just returned to California after a long New York honeymoon with her new husband, director Vincente Minnelli. Soon after, Kern returned to New York towards the end of October and died in November 1945. During the six months that it took to shoot the film, producer Arthur Freed had to come up with one director after another. Lemuel Ayers, a set designer, was originally scheduled to make his directorial debut on the film, but was replaced by Busby Berkeley late in August 1945. Meanwhile, Minnelli - who, it was rumored at the time, would be taking over the direction of the film - was shooting Garland's sequences even before the beginning of principal photography, as she was pregnant and expected to give birth in March 1946; her shooting was completed on November 8, 1945. By the time full shooting began in the middle of December, Berkeley had been replaced by Henry Koster, who was also replaced after a short period by Richard Whorf. Whorf ended up receiving the onscreen directorial credit. There was a break in production from some time in January 1946 to the middle of March of that year. The film includes two versions of \\"Ol' Man River\\" - the first sung by Caleb Peterson and an African-American chorus as part of the Show Boat medley, and the second, a \\"crooner version\\" by Frank Sinatra, featured as the grand finale.

Life and career Lehman was born in Fresno, California. He grew up on his family's farm near Sanger and attended local public schools. He attended Fresno City College before transferring to the University of California at Santa Cruz from which he earned his degree. He was student body president at Fresno City College in 1968. In that year he served as Fresno County Co-Chairman of Robert F. Kennedy's California presidential campaign and he was an alternate delegate to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. In 1969 he joined the staff of California State Senator George Zenovich. In 1976, Lehman was elected to the State Assembly as a Democrat. He rose quickly through the ranks, becoming assistant majority leader by 1978. In 1983, he successfully ran for a seat in Congress, representing a newly created district in Fresno. He was reelected six times. Lehman was known in Congress for his passionate commitments to important causes such as environmental protection, water policy, and consumer protection. He was able to strike delicate balances on many of these issues, a particularly important skill given the increasingly conservative nature of his Central Valley district. His notable successes include playing instrumental roles in passage of laws to protect the Kings and Tuolumne Rivers, the California Desert Protection Act, creation of the Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area and expansions of wilderness areas in the Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks. He served on the Banking Finance and Urban Affairs Committee where he chaired the Consumer Affairs and Coinage sub-committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee where he chaired the Mining and Mineral Affairs subcommittee. He served 12 years on the water and Power subcommittee and received the distinguished service award from the National Water REsources Association in 1990. An avid outdoorsman, he frequented the Sierra back country and successfully climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in Kenya in 1991. Lehman's district was made considerably more Republican after the 1990s' round of redistricting. It was renumbered the 19th District, and pushed further to the north and east, incorporating some more rural territory in the Sierra Nevada as well as the more conservative eastern portion of Fresno. At the same time, he lost his share of Stockton to the new 11th District, and lost most of his Latino constituents to the neighboring 20th District. Lehman barely held onto his seat in 1992, winning by only 1,100 votes. This led to speculation that the 19th would not stay Democratic for long. In 1994, Lehman was swept from office in the Republican Revolution, losing to Republican George Radanovich by a 17-point margin‚Äîone of the largest margins of defeat for an incumbent in that cycle. Lehman is currently a partner for the Sacramento-based lobbying firm Lehman Levi Pappas & Sadler. He also serves as a member of the board of the National Parks Trusts, the Mono Lakes Committee, the National council for the Traditional Arts and is on the board of directors of Premier Valley Bank in Fresno.

Clinical pathology is a medical specialty that is concerned with the diagnosis of disease based on the laboratory analysis of bodily fluids, such as blood, urine, and tissue homogenates or extracts using the tools of chemistry, microbiology, hematology and molecular pathology. This specialty requires a medical residency. Clinical pathology is a term used in the US, UK, Ireland, many Commonwealth countries, Portugal, Brazil, Italy, Japan, and Peru; countries using the equivalent in the home language of \\"laboratory medicine\\" include Austria, Germany, Romania, Poland and other Eastern European countries; other terms are \\"clinical analysis\\" (Spain) and \\"clinical/medical biology (France, Belgium, Netherlands, North and West Africa). Note: This document does not cover all countries listed.

In some countries other sub specialities fall under certified Clinical Biologists responsibility:Sub-specialties and Curriculum content of Clinical pathology specialization in France * Reproductive biology including Assisted reproductive technology, Sperm bank and Semen analysis * Immunopathology  Organization  Clinical pathologists are often medical doctors. In some countries in South-America, Europe, Africa or Asia, this specialty can be practiced by non-physicians, such as Ph.D or Pharm.D after a variable number of years of residency. = In United States of America = Clinical pathologists work in close collaboration with clinical scientists (clinical biochemists, clinical microbiologists, etc.), medical technologists, hospital administrators, and referring physicians to ensure the accuracy and optimal utilization of laboratory testing. Clinical pathology is one of the two major divisions of pathology, the other being anatomical pathology. Often, pathologists practice both anatomical and clinical pathology, a combination sometimes known as general pathology. Similar specialties exist in veterinary pathology. Clinical pathology is itself divided into subspecialties, the main ones being clinical chemistry, clinical hematology/blood banking, hematopathology and clinical microbiology and emerging subspecialties such as molecular diagnostics and proteomics. Many areas of clinical pathology overlap with anatomic pathology. Both can serve as medical directors of CLIA certified laboratories. Under the CLIA law, only the US Department of Health and Human Services approved Board Certified Ph.D., D Sc, or MD and DO can perform the duties of a Medical or Clinical Laboratory Director. This overlap includes immunoassays, flow cytometry, microbiology and cytogenetics and any assay done on tissue. Overlap between anatomic and clinical pathology is expanding to molecular diagnostics and proteomics as we move towards making the best use of new technologies for personalized medicine.Description of Pathology in USA = In Europe = Recently, EFLM has chosen the name of \\"Specialists in Laboratory Medicine\\" to define all European Clinical pathologists, regardless of their training (M.D, Ph.D or Pharm.D) . In France, Clinical Pathology is called Medical Biology (\\"Biologie m√©dicale\\") and is practiced by both M.D.s and Pharm.Ds. The residency lasts four years. Specialists in this discipline are called \\"Biologiste m√©dical\\" which literally translates as Clinical Biologist rather than \\"Clinical pathologist\\".Reglementation for French Residency in Clinical Pathology  Place of work  See Medical laboratory.  Tools  Microscopes, analyzers, strips, centrifugal machines... = Macroscopic examination = The visual examination of the taken liquid is a first main indication for the pathologist or the physician. The aspect of the liquid, in addition, conditions the analytical assumption of responsibility that follow and the validity of the end-results. = Microscopical examination = Microscopic analysis is an important activity of the pathologist and the laboratory assistant. They have many different colourings at their disposal (GRAM, MGG, Grocott, Ziehl-Neelsen, ‚Ä¶). Immunofluorescence, cytochemistry, the immunocytochemistry and FISH are also used in order make a correct diagnosis. This stage allows the pathologist to determine the character of the liquid: ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, tumoral, inflammatory even infectious. Indeed, microscopic examination can often determine the causal infectious agent, in general a bacterium, a mould, a yeast, or a parasite, more rarely a virus. = Physical Analyzers = See Automated analyser. The analysers, by the association of robotics and spectrophotometry, allowed these last decades a better reproducibility of the results of proportionings, in particular in medical biochemistry and hematology. The companies of in vitro diagnosis henceforth try to sell chains of automats, i.e. a system allowing the automatic transfer of the tubes towards the various types of automats of the same mark. These systems can include the computer-assisted management of a serum library. These analysers must undergo daily controls to guarantee a result just possible, one speaks about quality control. These analysers must also undergo daily, weekly and monthly maintenances. = Cultures = A big part of the examinations of clinical pathology, primarily in medical microbiology, use culture media.

He was of Scottish noble descent, and held a Scottish peerage. Fairfax was lured west as part of the gold rush. The town of Fairfax, California, is named for him. Early life and family He was born on Vaucluse Plantation in Virginia, the eldest son of Albert Fairfax (April 15, 1802 ‚Äì May 9, 1835) and Caroline Eliza Snowden (April 21, 1812 ‚Äì December 28, 1899), who were married on April 7, 1828.. His younger brother was John Fairfax, 11th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (September 13, 1830 ‚Äì September 28, 1900), who became the 11th Lord Fairfax of Cameron upon Charles' death in 1869. His paternal grandfather was Thomas Fairfax, 9th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1762‚Äì1846). On May 1, 1838, his mother married William R. Saunders.. = Lineage = He was collaterally related to Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax, who was a Parliamentary general during the English Civil Wars. He was also related to Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, who relinquished his English estates to his brother Robert Fairfax, 7th Lord Fairfax of Cameron and emigrated to America, where he settled on a plantation of more than five million acres (4,000 km2) in Virginia, which he inherited from his mother, Catherine Colepeper. Thomas Fairfax was the first person to employ George Washington as a surveyor. The 7th Lord, Robert Fairfax, died without issue in 1793 and the title passed to an American second cousin, the Rev. Bryan Fairfax, 8th Lord Fairfax of Cameron (1736‚Äì1802), a priest of the Episcopal Church and rector of a parish in Alexandria, who was the son of William Fairfax (1691‚Äì1757) of Belvoir and Deborah Clarke (1707‚Äì1747). The clergyman then became the 8th Lord Fairfax of Cameron. Bryan Fairfax, whose wife was Elizabeth Cary (1730‚Äì1757), was succeeded in 1802 by his eldest son, Thomas Fairfax (1762‚Äì1846). Thomas Fairfax, 9th Lord Fairfax of Cameron married three times; his son by his third wife, Margaret Herbert (1783‚Äì1858), Albert, who had died during the lifetime of his father, left two sons, Charles and John. Therefore, Charles S. Fairfax, the grandson of Thomas, the 9th Lord, succeeded to the title of Lord Fairfax in 1846‚Äîa title, however, that he never claimed, preferring to live as an American citizen.  California  Fairfax, still the potential 10th Lord Fairfax, Baron of Cameron, left Richmond with 74 other gold-seekers on the ship Glenmore. After disembarking and crossing Panama, he boarded a second ship, the steamer California, and arrived in San Francisco on June 23, 1850. The life of a miner in the mother lode of California might have been somewhat of a shock to Fairfax, who grew up as a gentleman farmer, but he stuck with the endeavor for a while. He prospected extensively, only to lose whatever money he made as fast as he got hold of it. There were stories of him working for others, pushing a wheelbarrow, or tending a mule pulling a cart of gravel and sloshing about in the mud of the diggings. In 1851, he abandoned the goldfields and turned to a new calling‚Äîpolitics‚Äîand became a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. Fairfax was a member of the California State Assembly, first representing Yuba and Sierra Counties from 1853 to '54, then Yuba County alone from 1854 to '55. He served as Speaker of the Assembly in 1854. He subsequently served as Clerk of the Supreme Court of California, 1856‚Äì'61. From 1865 to 1867, he was a Supervisor of Marin County.  Personal life  In 1854, Fairfax met his wife, Ada Benham (1833‚Äì1888), in San Francisco. They were married on January 10, 1855, in Louisville, Kentucky, at the home of her stepsister, Henrietta Prentice. They had no children. =Estate in California= After their return to San Francisco, Fairfax and his bride visited his boyhood friend Dr. Alfred Taliaferro at his country home in Marin County. When they expressed their great admiration of his estate, he gave them the property as a wedding gift. Thus, in 1855, the couple became residents of what would eventually become the town of Fairfax. They made many improvements to their new property. Fairfax imported game birds to satisfy his zeal for hunting and improve his chances for success. Ada planted trees and flowers around the home and grounds and named the estate Bird's Nest Glen, which is now on the National Register of Historic Places as California Registered Historical Landmark No. 679. They entertained lavishly and it became so customary for their friends to say, \\"Let's go to the Fairfax's,\\" or \\"Let's go to Fairfax,\\" that the area took on the identity of Fairfax, which continued long after their departure, up to the time of the town's incorporation in 1931. The Fairfax estate was also the site of the last political duel fought in California, on the afternoon of May 25, 1861, between State Assemblymen Daniel Showalter and Charles W. Piercy. Though Fairfax served them lunch and tried to dissuade them, the two men walked to a grassy meadow and fired rifles at 40 paces; Piercy was killed by the second volley. = Death = Charles S. Fairfax died suddenly, at age 40, at Barnum's City Hotel in Baltimore, Maryland, after having traveled east as a chairman of the California delegation to the Democratic National Convention, which was assembled in New York City. He is interred in Rock Creek Cemetery, Washington, D.C., as is his widow. Fairfax was thoroughly identified with the state of his adoption, and was well known and respected on the Pacific coast. He stood high in the Masonic fraternity, the members of which arranged to send a large delegation at the time of his death.

It was released in 1983 under the Polydor label, and a remastered version was reissued in 2000, with a high-fidelity version appearing on Blu-ray in 2013 (2-channel, 96kHz/24-bit). It remains one of Renaud's most successful albums to date, including two of his most famous songs, the sea tale \\"D√®s que le vent soufflera\\" and the ballad \\"Morgane de toi\\", about his daughter Lolita.

But he learns that \\"C'est pas l'homme qui prend la mer, c'est la mer qui prend l'homme!\\" (It's not man who takes the sea, it's the sea who takes the man). Features various deliberate grammatical mistakes such as \\"Je repartira\\" and \\"Nous nous en allerons\\", as an openly easy way to satisfy the rhyme. ;Deuxi√®me g√©n√©ration:A slower, melancholic story of a young guy, son of immigrants (hence the \\"second generation\\") who lives on the street, \\"not far from La D√©fense\\", on the outskirts of Paris. The tale explains how his only pleasures in life are violence, being feared by people, music with friends and cheap drugs. Very good portrait of people (here Arabic origin, typical of the 1960s-1970s immigration in France) whose malaise is to feel foreigner in France as well as in their parents' country of origin. ; Pochtron!:A parody on people who drink too much. A \\"pochtron\\" is a slang word for a drunkard. The narrator claims that \\"I don't throw up much, only when I mix different stuff. For example if people put water in my Ricard...\\", the joke being that Ricard is always drunk with water. ; Morgane de toi:One of Renaud's greatest hits, for once the narrator is himself in this moving ballad. He describes his daughter at the age of about four years, projecting his worries for her future onto her. Anxious that she will be bossed around by the young \\"machos\\" in the playground he advises her to whack one in the back with her rake. The song has nine verses, arranged as follows: VBVVC, VBVVC, VBVVC CC where V is a verse, B is a short bridge and C is the chorus. ; Doudou s'en fout:(Black Doudou isn't worried) A Caribbean-influenced parody of a young girl who works in a clothing shop in Paris. She sells overpriced bathing suits to rich, snobby women. Although she hates her job, in the end she doesn't care, because in August, Doudou is heading home, presumably to somewhere \\"warmer and more beautiful\\" (perhaps Guadeloupe or New Caledonia) where she can \\"burn her skin\\". ;En cloque:(Knocked up) An interesting juxtaposition with \\"Morgane de toi\\", this is another slow autobiographical ballad, written before the birth of his daughter. He describes in his typical style his wife's pregnancy. It is sentimental, but slightly self-mocking, as he describes his inability to find something to do with himself as his wife goes through cravings. It features the memorable line \\"M√™me si je devenais p√©d√© comme un phoque, je serais jamais en cloque\\" (even if I was gay as a lark, I would never be up the duff...). ;Ma chanson leur a pas plu...:(They didn't like my song...) This parody of his fellow French pop stars is a hard- edged rock number as an imaginary autobiographical narration of Renaud's difficulties coming up with new tunes. Each verse is about a new number he has just written, but every time, upon hearing it, his close friends point out to him that this one is not of his usual style, and that he should forget it and start again. The songwriter then figures he can sell his failed composition to this one contemporary singer (a different one at each verse, namely Jean- Patrick Capdevielle, Bernard Lavilliers, and Francis Cabrel), but he never manages to convince them, even though each time the song in question is of the style of the given artist in turn. Persistent, he goes back to writing yet another, better song, and so on to the next song-artist combination until at the end, fed up, he fiercely sets off to write one for his very own self, one with mopeds and motorbikes and leather jackets and pipe wrenches and all, along with cheap word puns. This final verse is where Renaud did not forget to parody himself as well, as he has at other times in his career. ;D√©serteur:Picking up on where a famous anti-military French song of the same name left it decades ago, Renaud mocks the French military and political life, this time with harsher lyrics, as times have changed, pacifism has made its mark and censorship is no longer to be feared so much. The original song (written by Boris Vian) begins \\"Monsieur le Pr√©sident, je vous fais une lettre que vous lirez peut-√™tre\\" (Mr President, I'm writing you a letter which you might perhaps read). Renaud's version rhymes with the original, but goes \\"Monsieur le Pr√©sident, je vous fais une bafouille, que vous lirez s√ªrement si vous avez des couilles\\". (Mr President, I'm spewing out a letter, which you'll surely read if you have any balls) ;Pr√®s des autos tamponneuses:A tale of a young lad who meets a girl, fashion-victim at the dodgem cars. Complete with carousel music, with accordion played by Peter White, he describes meeting her, spending a few nice moments with her, then things going horribly wrong when he rams her. ;Loulou:An ode presumably to a friend of his, who, although tough and mean when younger, has become older and flabbier.

Since 2010, the lineup stabilized around Mastelotto, Levin, and Markus Reuter. The band was formed as a vehicle for progressive rock music performed almost exclusively with Chapman Sticks and drums. History In 2007, Levin released a solo album entitled Stick Man, consisting of pieces recorded on the Chapman Stick, featuring his King Crimson bandmate Pat Mastelotto on drums. This then led to the formation of the band Stick Men by Mastelotto, Levin and Chapman Stick player Michael Bernier. The band released its first album Soup in 2010. Bernier left shortly after the release of Soup, to be replaced by Markus Reuter in early August 2010. The new lineup released the CD Absalom, in 2011, and an album of improvisations, Open, in June 2012. A studio album titled Deep was released in February 2013. There is a special edition including a DVD. The album features heavy rock pieces that are mostly instrumental with exceptions like Horatio featuring Pat Mastelotto on vocals. The album also includes 11 minute tone poem Whale Watch based on Tony Levin's experiences taking whale watching trips out of Boston. In January 2014, the band released their first live album called Power Play. In October 2014, Stick Men released their first retrospective album. A double album, the first disc featured studio recordings, while the second was a compilation of various recorded live improvisations the band performed on tour. Also included on the album are remixes and remakes of various other Stick Men songs. Two collaborative live albums with King Crimson members were subsequently recorded in Tokyo, Japan. The first one, Midori, featuring David Cross on violin and keyboards, was recorded in 2015. The second one, Roppongi, with Mel Collins on sax, was recorded in 2017. Eventually, a 2018 tour of Latin American countries featuring David Cross on violin became the multi-disc boxed set Panamerica, released in 2019. In the same spirit of collaborations with prog legends, their sole 2020 concert in Japan with keyboardist Gary Husband became their album Nagoya, recorded in its namesake Japanese city on February the 28th. Their fourth studio album with Markus Reuter, Prog Noir, was recorded and released in 2016. This album featured several vocal pieces. Tony Levin sang the title track, Markus Reuter sang Plutonium, and they shared vocals on the promotional single, The Tempest. Style Stylistically, Stick Men's sound is quite unique. Touting the fact that their lead musicians are \\"playing instruments unlike any other,\\" their music has evolved to be somewhere between Art Rock, Progressive Rock, and in some cases Progressive Metal. There is a heavy influence of free music and improvisation during their live shows, as the musicians will often showcase their prowess on their respective instruments in extended free music jams. Most notably, the band honors their connection and tenure with King Crimson by performing songs by the band as well as songs by Robert Fripp, King Crimson's lead member and guitarist. Stick Men has also composed an abridged version of Stravinsky's \\"Firebird Suite\\", a staple of their live shows. Most of their compositions are instrumental, with very few songs featuring vocals, mostly by Levin, but occasionally by Reuter and Mastelotto as well. During his time with the band following the release of \\"Soup\\", Bernier provided vocals on some songs.

History Local legend with tenuous documentary support suggests that the statue originated in St. Mary's Abbey on Mary Street in Dublin which was dissolved as part of the Henrician reforms in 1539 (see: Dissolution of the Monasteries). The first concrete historical mention dates from 1749 in a survey of the Catholic Chapels of Dublin, which refers to a statue in St. Mary's Lane Parochial Chapel. The chapel was torn down in 1816 to make way for a new school and no further mention of the statue is recorded until it was found by Father John Spratt, a member of the Carmelite order, in 1824. The restored statue has been on display near the high altar of the church in a purpose built shrine since 1915. The feast-day of Our Lady of Dublin is celebrated on 8 September. Description Stylistically, the statue resembles early 16th-century wooden statuary and probably dates from that period. It is a life-size figure carved in oak.

History  =Before WWII= Upon the conclusion of the US-Japan Amity Treaty in 1858, a Japanese delegation to America observed Western-style museums first-hand. Following the Meiji Restoration, botanist Keisuke Ito, and natural historian, Tanaka Yoshio, also wrote of the necessity of establishing museum facilities similar to the ones found in the West. Preparations commenced to construct facilities to preserve historical relics of the past. In 1872, the Museum of the Ministry of Education (Monbusho Hakubutsukan ÊñáÈÉ®ÁúÅÂçöÁâ©È§®) staged Japan's first exhibition in the Yushima area of Tokyo. Minerals, fossils, animals, plants, regional crafts, and artifacts were among the articles displayed. Following the Yushima exposition, the government set up a bureau charged with the construction of a permanent museum. The bureau proposed that in keeping with Japan's participation in the Vienna World Fair of 1873, a Home Ministry Museum (now, the Tokyo National Museum) eventually be developed. In 1877, the Museum of Education (Kyoiku Hakubutsukan ÊïôËÇ≤ÂçöÁâ©È§®)opened in Ueno Park (now, the National Science Museum of Japan) with displays devoted to physics, chemistry, zoology, botany, and regional crafts. As a part of the exhibition, art objects were also displayed in an ‚Äúart museum.‚Äù The Imperial Household Department oversaw the establishment of a central museum dedicated to historical artifacts in 1886. In addition, in the years after 1877, there was great enthusiasm for establishing regional museums in Akita, Niigata, Kanazawa, Kyoto, Osaka, and Hiroshima. In 1895, the Nara National Museum opened its doors, followed in 1897 by the Kyoto National Museum. Other national specialty museums followed: the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce Exhibition Hall (1897), Patent Office Exhibition Hall (1905), and the Postal Museum (1902). In 1925, the Imperial Household museum, now part of the Tokyo National Museum collection, was separated into science and historical relic departments. Separating the categories was a step towards the creation of art museum. In addition to the national museums, private museums were also established after the turn of the century. The first private museum was the Okura Shukokan Museum, built in 1917 to house Okura Kihachiro's collection. The industrialist ≈åhara Mogasaburo established the Ohara Museum of Art in 1930 in Kurashiki, Okayama Prefecture. The museum was the first Japanese museum devoted to Western art. By 1945, there were 150 museums in Japan. However, the Great Kant≈ç earthquake (1923), the Sino-Japanese war, and World War II, led to the stagnation of Japan's museum activities. Japanese art objects had been collected in the Sh≈çs≈çin (treasure houses) of shrines and temples from the Nara Period on. Artifacts were included in the national hakubutsukan established during the Meiji period, but were not assigned to the distinct category of art museum (bijutsukan ÁæéË°ìÈ§®) until after 1945. = After WWII = Plans for museums that had been put on hold during the war recommenced in the 1950s. The Kyoiku Hakubutsukan became the National Science Museum of Japan (Kokuritsu Kagaku Hakubutsukan ÂõΩÁ´ãÁßëÂ≠¶ÂçöÁâ©È§®Ôºâin 1949, and the former Monbusho Hakubutsukan became the Tokyo National Museum (Tokyo Kokuritsu Hakubutsukan Êù±‰∫¨ÂõΩÁ´ãÂçöÁâ©È§®Ôºâin 1952. The government became active in art museum development in the postwar period, opening the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, (Tokyo Kokuritsu Kindai Bijutsukan Êù±‰∫¨ÂõΩÁ´ãÂçöÁâ©È§®) which housed both Japanese and foreign art. Private museums continued to open after the war. In 1966, the Yamatane Museum of Art and the Idemitsu Art Gallery, both built around private collections, were established. During the 1970s, prefectural and local governmental entities began to found museums and art museums devoted to the traditional arts and crafts or commerce of their individual communities. The 1980s saw a national boom in new art museum development, with 90 new facilities constructed in 1988 alone. Local governments were active in establishing many of these museums. In addition, museums devoted to particular industries were also founded, among them the Electric Energy Museum Denryokukan ÈõªÂäõÈ§®, 1984) and the Subway Museum (Chikatetsu Hakubutsukan Âú∞‰∏ãÈâÑÂçöÁâ©È§®, 1986).

Dorine Justice served as pastor for the first year, between 1950 and 1979 there were eleven different pastors, during which time church growth was slow. In 1979, Pastor John A. Loper, then an official with the Alabama District of the Assemblies of God, accepted the pastorate. During this time the church's radio outreach, Garywood Alive, was aired. This soon evolved into a television outreach as well. On October 7, 2012, Pastor Loper announced that he would retire on February 11, 2013, one week after he would celebrate the 35th anniversary of his coming to Garywood. On February 3, 2013, Pastor Jeff Leatherman was elected as Lead Pastor of Garywood.  Annual events  A scene from the 2007 performance of Garywood's annual Easter drama The church is known throughout metro Birmingham for its annual Easter Drama, which began in 1977 and was produced each year through 2004, and again in 2006 before being discontinued. The church also hosted an annual Garywood Campmeeting, which for many years was billed as the largest \\"spiritual gathering\\" in Alabama, featuring well- known figures Vestal Goodman, Marvin Gorman, Jesse Duplantis and John Kilpatrick (of Brownsville Revival fame).Ibid  Property acquisitions  In 2003 Garywood's congregation overwhelmingly voted to buy property on I-459 near McCalla, Alabama for relocation. Original plans included a 2,500-seat state-of-the-art auditorium, large facilities for youth, children's ministry and greatly expanded capacity for Garywood Christian School. However, the church sold the property to Colonial Properties Trust in 2006, and is using the proceeds of the sale to build a new facility approximately one mile away from the first site. Groundbreaking for the new facility, just off Charles Hamilton Road and Old Tuscaloosa Road, took place on November 18, 2007. Construction of the new facility was scheduled to begin in January 2008 and be completed sometime in 2009. Because of the ongoing economic situation, the move has been delayed, and new construction has not begun.

It was built for suburban and long-distance services. Presently it is used by Przewozy Regionalne (POLREGIO), Szybka Kolej Miejska and Koleje Mazowieckie companies. Out of over 1400 units produced, about 300 still remain in service in Poland, most of them with Przewozy Regionalne. History Several EN57 units on Pozna≈Ñ G≈Ç√≥wny railway station in 2009 Designed for regional transport class EN57 was based on the earlier class EW55 units. EW55 were the first electrical multiple units built in Poland with 100% of domestic components. They were built by Pafawag works in Wroc≈Çaw. Production started in 1962 and ended in 1993 with 1412 units produced, most of which are still in operation. This class is believed to have had the longest production period in the world for electric multiple units. The first units had first-class compartments, but units numbered 602 and upwards were produced with only second class. Due to very long production period, the series varies between specific production spans. Units up to number 1113 have corrugated sides and three windscreens, units numbered 1114 to 1825 have flat sides and three windscreens, whilst units from number 1900 up to 1953 have flat sides and two windscreens, resembling class EW58 units. As the result of several fires and accidents, units numbered 201 to 206 are assembled from surviving cars of previously destroyed units. Since 2006, Przewozy Regionalne have modernized several units with funding from the European Union. The changes affect the appearance of the units, with the ends being redesigned. The interior was also changed. Mechanical and electric devices remain mostly unchanged. Modified units are being renumbered from 2001 upwards. Classes EN71, ED72, and ED73 units were based on class EN57. Szybka Kolej Miejska which operates service in the Tricity area uses these units and has also modernized them, this being mostly to the interior. Technical data EN57 is a three-car electric multiple unit with traction motors located in the middle car. The unit has four LK450 motors, each with power of 145 kW. The outer two cars are both driving trailers and do not have motors. Trailers are distinguished with letters a and b, with part a including compressor and part b including the batteries. Each part of the unit consists of three compartments, divided by corridors. In the trailers only two compartments are for passenger accommodation, while the third was thought to be luggage compartment. In the motor car, all three compartments are used by passengers. Previously, there were toilets in all parts of the unit, yet due to several fires caused by neighbouring electric devices, the toilets in the motor cars were removed. Class EN57 is capable of multiple unit operation with two or three units, using Scharfenberger couplers to connect units together. Each unit can seat up to 212 passengers. Service in other countries Three units of class EN57 EMU were exported to Yugoslavia in 1964, where they classified 311-0 (for trailers) and 315-0 (for motor cars). Another eleven were subsequently rebuilt from class 315-1 with additional trailers. As in the time of delivery W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka was the leader of Polish Polish United Workers' Party, those items were nicknamed after him. Modernizations EN57 modernizated from SPOT programme = SPOT and EN57-20XX = In 2006, ZNTK \\"Mi≈Ñsk Mazowiecki\\", Pesa Bydgoszcz and Newag Nowy SƒÖcz begin modernizing 75 EN57 EMUs, financed by European Union funds. The appearance of the end walls, cab driver and interior was changed. The separate service compartments were removed by connecting them with entrance hallways. The modernized EMU was adapted to the needs of disabled people through the installation of elevators for wheelchairs and bigger toilets. EMUs after modernisation had also installed alarm and 16 cameras. The main spinning transformer was replaced by electronic transformer giving voltage 110 V DC, 230 V AC and 24 V DC. = EN57KM = In 2007 SKM Tricity and Koleje Mazowieckie decided to apply the start pulse in some of their EN57's: SKM Tr√≥jmiasto: EN57-768, EN57-1089, EN57-1094 i EN57-1116 Koleje Mazowieckie: EN57-1486, EN57-1566, EN57-1567 i EN57-1562 ZNTK \\"Mi≈Ñsk Mazowiecki\\" works made this modernisations.

In audio recording, a given song is almost always made up of multiple tracks, with each instrument or sound on their own track (for example, one track could contain the drums, one the guitar, one for a vocal, etc). Further, each track can be separately adjusted in many ways, such as changing the volume, adding effects, and so on. This can be done with individual hardware components, commonly known as \\"outside the box,\\" or via software applications known as DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations), commonly known as \\"inside the box.\\" Send tracks are tracks that aren't (normally) used to record sound on themselves, but to apply those adjustments to multiple, perhaps even all, tracks the same way. For example: if the drums are not on one track, but are instead spread out across multiple tracks (which is common), there is often the desire to treat them all the same in terms of volume, effects, etc. Instead of doing that for each track, you can set up a single send track to apply to all of them. Advantages Because one can treat numerous tracks uniformly with a single send track, they can save a lot of time and resources. They are also inherently more flexible than their hardware equivalent, since any number of send tracks can be created as needed. For more complicated effect chains, send tracks also allow their output to be routed to other send tracks, which can switch their routing to other send tracks in turn. The solutions offered by most multi-track software provide musicians with an easier (although arguably less hands-on) approach to controlling sends and their respective effects on the audio.

A few months before the start of Winter War, the Finnish Army held extra war training for its troops. One day, Sillanp√§√§ watched as some troops passed his house, singing a quite non- military song Maailman Matti. Sillanp√§√§ became frustrated, he wondered why the Finnish soldiers did not sing something more fitting to the age of war they lived. Almost immediately, he wrote new, far more patriotic words to the Maailman Matti theme. The new words of Maailman Matti were published by the Suomen Kuvalehti-magazine, catching the eye of captain Palmroth of the Finnish Defence Forces. Palmroth immediately recognized the potential of the song, thinking it was perfect for raising the morale of the Finnish forces. He quickly organized a composing contest to create a more fitting theme for Sillanp√§√§'s song. Rising out of obscurity was Aimo Mustonen, winning over many well-known composers. The coming of winter war proved Palmroth's instinct correct, as Sillanp√§√§n marssilaulu became a huge success among the Finnish troops. While serving in certain units of the Finnish Army, conscripts are required to learn the lyrics. One such unit is the Reconnaissance Company of the Reserve Officer School in Hamina. Whenever the unit is moving in formation the officer students are required to sing Sillanp√§√§n marssilaulu.

Their last studio album \\"N of tha World\\" was released in 2006 through Warlock/Sony Red. In 2009, they released the mixtape \\"The Vatican\\". Currently original members Esham and Mastamind are recording a reunion album according to Mastamind's official Facebook account. History Esham met Mastamind as a student at Osborne High School, who gave him a three-song demo tape of his music, leading the two to form the group with Esham's longtime friend, T-N-T, deciding on the name Natas, an acronym for \\"Nation Ahead of Time and Space\\", and because it was \\"Satan\\" spelled backwards. In 1992, Natas released its first album, Life After Death on Esham's Reel Life Productions. Following the release of this album, Esham, Natas and Reel Life Productions were the subject of much controversy when a 17-year-old fan killed himself while smoking cannabis and playing Russian roulette while listening to Life After Death. In 2002, Natas released its only charting album to date, Godlike, which peaked at #35 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums chart, #45 on the Heatseekers chart and #56 on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart. This was the last album of new material recorded by the group, until FUQERRBDY. Previously recorded material was released in 2006 and 2009 on N of tha World and The Vatican. In 2013 it was announced on Mastamind's official Facebook account that a new Natas album has been planned and after the release of his next album \\"The Ultimate Price\\" they will begin recording the album with an expected 2014 release date. This was later confirmed by Esham and than later by Mastamind's label Lyrikal Snuff Productionz. On December 8, 2013 once again via his official Facebook account, Mastamind announced that recording of the new Natas album was completed and was in the mixing stages. Esham, Mastamind, and the official Natas Facebook confirmed that FUQERRBDY was to be released on July 15, 2014. On December 20, 2014, Natas member T-N-T was killed in a car accident. With the death of T-N-T, Natas broke up. Esham has said in his interview with Faygoluvers, for his 16th album Scribble, \\"There won't be another Natas album\\". Style and influence Natas refers to its performance style as \\"acid rap\\", comparing the lyrics to hallucinations induced by LSD. Acid rap has been described as a fusion of hip hop beats and death metal lyrics. Esham defined the genre as analogous to \\"modern day blues [or] heavy metal\\". AllMusic writer Jason Birchmeier said that Mastamind's rapping \\"owes little to any conventional style\\". Natas is known for using live instrumentation, as well as for highly sample-based instrumentation which AllMusic compared to that of the Bomb Squad and Dr. Dre. Natas' lyrics focus on topics ranging from women and violence to spirituality, expressing self-reliance. Rappers influenced by Natas include Insane Clown Posse, Eminem and Kid Rock.

This family of large and beautiful butterflies is well represented with 89 species found within Indian borders.Evans (1932) states, in a table on pg 23, the number of papilionids in the Indian subcontinent as 90; 15 species being found in Ceylon, 19 in South India, 6 in Baluchistan, 11 in Chitral, 31 in the western Himalayas, 69 in Northeast India, 50 in southern Myanmar and 13 in the Andaman and Nicobar islands. Wynter-Blyth (1957) gives a modified version of the same table on p. 12, where the overall number of species is 94; with differences being in total number of species for Northeast Himalayas (62) and Myanmar (66). The present list is based on the IUCN red data book, with corrections made by subsequent editors especially in the Parnassiinae. Kunte (2000) on p. 55 mentions a total of 107 species with 19 in peninsular India. Varshney & Smetacek (2015), which this article follows, lists 89 species. Two of the three papilionid subfamilies are represented in India, namely, the Parnassiinae or Apollos, with 19 species, and the Papilioninae or swallowtails, with 70 species. The area of India falls in the Indomalayan realm, except for the Himalayas above and beyond the foothills adjoining the Indo-Gangetic Plains, and which fall in the Palearctic realm, resulting in increased diversity of papilionid butterflies, especially the Parnassiini or snow Apollos, all species of which are Palearctic. Indian swallowtails are spread over all the biomes/ecoregions of India. The Malabar banded peacock (Papilio buddha) and the Malabar banded swallowtail (Papilio liomedon) fly at sea level while the Apollos (Parnassius species), are to be found only in the highest alpine meadows of the Himalayas. Some species such as the common Mormon (Papilio polytes) and the blue Mormon (Papilio polymnestor) fly at ground level whereas others, such as the tailed jay (Graphium agamemnon) are normally found flying high in the forest canopy. The lime butterfly (Papilio demoleus) is a creature of arid scrub-land, occasionally being spotted even in the Thar Desert, while the tropical evergreen forests have their own representatives, such as the red Helen (Papilio helenus), the common bluebottle (Graphium cloanthus) and the Malabar raven (Papilio dravidarum). Indian papilionids such as the common Mormon (Papilio polytes) and great Mormon (Papilio memnon) show polymorphism with many mimetic female forms.Clarke, C. A.; Sheppard, P. M. & Thornton, I. W.

They were formerly considered to be subgenera under genus Atrophaneura till several authorities elevated them to genus level in their publications (e.g. LepIndex; GLoBIS; Racheli & Cotton (2010)). These butterflies sequester toxins from plants and are inedible or poisonous to predators. They also have warning colouration, a phenomenon also known as aposematism. The red-bodied swallowtails are involved in Batesian mimicry complexes as aposematic models which are mimicked by edible species.

Located in the Appalachian Mountains, it lies approximately southeast of Lexington. The town was named for David L. Francis, president of Princess Elkhorn Coal Company which originally built and owned the town. Retrieved on 2010-12-14 It bears the postal ZIP code 41616. The U.S. Census of 2000 recorded a population of 435.Zip Code Tabulation Area 41616 U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved on 2010-12-14 Although it was formerly a company town, it was in many ways a model coal community with many amenities not typical of the region at the time including a swimming pool, central water and sewer, and cable TV service. The company also supported a children's choir which toured nationally. When Princess-Elkhorn sold the community in the late 1960s, many of these amenities fell into disrepair and the housing stock deteriorated from over 100 units to slightly more than 30. The town rallied around a hepatitis outbreak and ended up purchasing the entire town from the investor who owned it. The mechanism for this purchase was the creation of the David Community Development Corporation, which went on to secure funding for a new water and sewer system, a fire station, a new park and several dozen new homes. The David School is featured in the six-hour documentary film Country Boys which was broadcast in Frontline on PBS, about two residents, Chris and Cody, and their life in a poor, rural mountain town.

Early life and career Papworth was born in London in 1781 and was the third son of the English stuccoist John Papworth (1750‚Äì1799). In 1799 he became the pupil of his elder brother, the architect John Buonarotti Papworth, and acted as his clerk of works until 1804.  Life and work in Ireland  He moved to Ireland in 1806 and took charge of the Circular Stone Manufacturers of North Strand, Dublin. He also started to build up an architectural practice. He was architect to the Dublin and Drogheda Railway and to the Royal Bank. He was later appointed Professor of Architecture by the Royal Hibernian Academy. He was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery. His sons carried on the family tradition.  Work  The dome of St Mary's Pro-Cathedral, Dublin The cast-iron bridge at Oak Park c. 1817 is one of Papworth's earliest works. Other work followed including the Dublin Library in D'Olier Street, Dublin (1818‚Äì1820) and the single span cast-iron King's Bridge which was built to commemorate the visit of George IV to Ireland (now Se√°n Heuston Bridge). The foundation stone for this bridge was laid in 1827. Papworth is also responsible for the Malahide Railway Station, Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church, Middleton Park House in Westmeath, and St Mary's Pro- Cathedral in Dublin. He also added the portico to Kenure House in Rush in north County Dublin in about 1840; the portico is still standing but the rest of the house was demolished in 1978. He designed some of the most impressive monuments in Mount Jerome Cemetery, including the Drummond Memorial.

Retrieved on May 16, 2017 Biography Nuclear Death were formed on March 23, 1986, by Lori Bravo (vocals, bass guitar), Phil Hampson (guitar), and Joel Whitfield (drums) while they were in high school. Nuclear Death cited Venom, Mot√∂rhead, The Plasmatics, Witchfinder General, and Discharge as their influences. Their first demo, Wake Me When I'm Dead, was released later that same year, receiving positive reviews from American and overseas zines. They were notable as at the time very few death metal artists had female singers. Their second demo, Welcome to the Minds of the Morbid, followed in 1987, on the back of which Nuclear Death signed a contract with Richard Campos from Wild Rags, a record label, fanzine and record dealer in California. In 1991, the band released their more controversial work, entitled Carrion for Worm, containing many songs considered to be in bad taste, such as \\"The Human Seed\\", \\"Lurker in the Closet: A 'Fairy' Tale\\", and \\"Greenflies\\". Carrion for Worm featured vocals by Chris Reifert, singer from popular death metal band Autopsy, on two songs, \\"Cathedral of Sleep\\" and \\"Vampirism\\". On May 23, 1992, Nuclear Death played a notorious concert in Puerto Rico, with label partners Impetigo. Later that year they released For Our Dead, a four-track single containing a rerecorded version of 1987's \\"The Third Antichrist\\" from Welcome to the Minds of the Morbid. After the break-up of Nuclear Death, Lori went on to form a new band, Raped, in 2002. Joel Whitfield joined Eroticide in 1991. After leaving the band in 1992, Phil was in Eroticide (1996 to 1998), and Whorror (2000 to 2002). In late 2013, Phil started Feral Viscera. He currently continues to record as Feral Viscera, but - decided to re-form Whorror (along with original vocalist Donn Sullivan and original drummer, Mike Wyatt (Genocaust).

The bitter fight pitted elements of Union Army Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's Army of the Tennessee against Confederate forces of Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton's Department of the Mississippi and East Louisiana. The Confederates failed to prevent the Federal troops from reaching the Southern Railroad and isolating Vicksburg from reinforcement and resupply. During the morning of the 12th, the Confederates enjoyed a two-to-one advantage in numbers, as they faced off across Fourteen Mile Creek against a single Federal brigade. However, as morning turned to noon with the Confederates waiting in ambush, the remainder of the Federal division secretly deployed into the fields beside the brigade, giving the Union troops a three to one advantage in numbers and a seven to one advantage in artillery. The ranking Confederate officer, Brig. Gen. John Gregg, attempted to achieve tactical surprise and rout the Federal force as it crossed the creek, but he was in turn tactically surprised and routed from the field by the Union XVII Corps under the command of Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson. The Union casualties were 68 killed, 341 wounded, and 37 missing, while the Confederate casualties were 100 killed, 305 wounded, and 415 captured.Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant, Chapter 34Grabau, page 66OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part III) Chapter XXXVI page 638 The small battle had an inordinately large impact on the Vicksburg Campaign. Union interdiction of the railroad interrupted Pemberton's attempt to further consolidate his forces and prevented him from linking up with his commanding officer Gen. Joseph E. Johnston. As a result, Pemberton was limited to three options: abandon Vicksburg, withdraw into the city and accept a siege, or fight a meeting engagement against a superior force. Facing conflicting orders from his superiors and open insurrection from his subordinates, Pemberton was forced into fighting the Battle of Champion Hill, which the Union won, leading to the successful Siege of Vicksburg, which gave the Union complete control of the Mississippi River, hastening the Confederate surrender. Preparations for battle Grant's Operations against Vicksburg. As part of Pemberton's plan to hold Grant's army in check along a broad front roughly delineated by Fourteen Mile Creek, Pemberton ordered all reinforcements arriving in Jackson to march to Raymond, 20 miles (30 km) to the southwest. There they would form the left wing of a force superior in size to the Federal army. In Raymond, arriving reinforcements would be supported by Wirt Adams's Cavalry Regiment, which was scouting the roads for indications of a Federal movement towards Jackson. Adams had been ordered by Pemberton to leave his regiment in Raymond and ride to Edwards, 15 miles (24 km) away to organize the assorted cavalry attached to the Confederate main body.OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part III) Chapter XXXVI page 851 However, Adams elected to obey a subsequent order from Confederate Maj. Gen. John S. Bowen instructing him to bring his whole force to Edwards.OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part III) Chapter XXXVI page 853 The Confederate infantry making its way to Raymond by way of the rail and road included Gregg's and Maxey's overstrength brigades from Port Hudson, Louisiana, and William H.T. Walker's and States Rights Gist's brigades from the east. Complicating the journey, however, was Grierson's Raid, which rendered unusable portions of the railroad east of Jackson and about 50 miles (80 km) of track south of Brookhaven. Gregg's men consequently marched all but 85 miles (137 km) of the 200 mile (300 km) journey from Port Hudson to Jackson, arriving on May 9. A second cavalry raid, launched by Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson, cut the railroad just north of Brookhaven, trapping the cars of the Jackson & New Orleans Railroad with General Maxey's brigade too far south to assist in the ensuing battle. After being granted a day of rest on the Pearl River just north of Jackson, Gregg received orders to march to Raymond at first light on May 11. Subsequently, Gregg's brigade arrived in Raymond late in the afternoon, and \\"dropped to rest as soon as halted.\\"Drake, page 25 The rest would prove to be a short one. Rather than finding Wirt Adams's cavalry regiment guarding the roads into town, Gregg found the network of roads posted by a five-man detachment of Confederate cavalry and a company of state cavalry.OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part I) Chapter XXXVI page 736 Gregg was forced to picket the roads out of town with his weary infantry. Unbeknownst to anyone in the Confederate army, McPherson's men of the XVII Corps were lurking near Utica, maintaining strict drum and bugle silence and a strong cavalry screen. The two divisions had been inching along the parched ridge road between Utica and Raymond for two days, struggling to maintain proximity to a water source, while the remainder of Grant's army probed north towards the railroad.PUSG, page 183 & 194‚Äì195 Having uncovered Pemberton's main body, Grant ordered McPherson to move his two divisions into Raymond by mid-day May 12.PUSG, page 200 Rising before daylight, Federal cavalry screening General John Logan's Third Division triggered the alarm from the state cavalry posted on the Utica road almost immediately.T. B. Riggin, Memorial Day Address Because the roads had not been properly posted, news of the arrival of thousands of Confederate troops in Raymond had spread. Having discovered from the locals that a large Confederate force was waiting just up the road, Logan attempted to deploy the 20th Ohio Infantry into a broad skirmish line and march nearly a mile through the almost impassable tangles. After an hour of stops and starts to straighten the line, and \\"a great expense of time, breath and strong language,\\" Logan ordered the skirmish line shortened. Around 10 am, Logan's second brigade emerged into a small field that bordered Fourteen Mile Creek.Dwight Word had reached Gregg that the Federal main body was due south of Edwards, so he estimated that this body of troops must be a raiding party.OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part III) Chapter XXXVI page 737 To much fanfare, he marched his men through the streets of Raymond to meet the threat. Arriving on the hills overlooking Fourteen Mile Creek, he ordered his troops to conceal themselves, then ordered Col. Hiram Granbury, commander of the veteran 7th Texas Infantry Regiment, to send Company A and a portion of Company B to picket the bridge over the creek due to their new Enfield Rifles.Report Of Hiram Granbury Gregg's plan appears to have been to lure the raiding party into making a rash charge over the bridge to save it from being burned. Once the Federal force was on the Confederate side of the bridge, Gregg's 3,200 men would erupt from their hiding places and drive the Union force into the creek bed where they would be pinned for the slaughter. Gregg watched with anticipation as the Federal skirmish line crossed the field and engaged his pickets. Anticipation turned to surprise, however, when at 10 o'clock the skirmishers halted in the tree line and called up DeGolyer's 8th Michigan Battery Light Artillery to clear the bridge with a few rounds of canister shot. The presence of artillery could only mean one thing: the force occupying the field before him was no mere raiding party, but at least a full Federal brigade. Gregg remained undaunted, and merely altered his plan for attack. His main body would shift to the left, leaving the fields that were now threatened by the federal artillery a mere 500 yards (500 m) away for the safety of the hills above Fourteen Mile Creek. Two large regiments of infantry would launch the ambush when the Federal brigade crossed the creek, while two more large regiments would slip silently through the woods into the rear of the Federal line, capturing the artillery battery and trapping the Union troops in the bed of Fourteen Mile Creek, where they would be forced to surrender. In the heat of preparation, Gregg forgot to inform Pemberton of these plans. Pemberton's plan had been to allow Grant to dictate the focus of the Federal attack. Grant could turn east and attack Raymond, or turn west and attack Edwards. In doing so, Grant's vulnerable rear would be open to attack by whichever force was not engaged.OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part III) Chapter XXXVI page 861 Pemberton had explicitly ordered Gregg not to bring on a general engagement with a larger force, but to withdraw to Jackson in the face of overwhelming odds while Pemberton dealt the Federal army a heavy blow from behind.OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part III) Chapter XXXVI page 862 Technically, Gregg did not feel he was violating that order, because the over-strength Confederate brigade of 3,200 men, with reinforcements on the way, outnumbered the average federal brigade by over 2-to-1 odds. What Gregg could not see, because McPherson was orchestrating his own ambush, was the entire Third Division of McPherson's Corps silently deploying into the field beside the Second Brigade. Knowing that the woods ahead hid a large Confederate force, McPherson began to suspect an ambush. After having his men stack arms, eat lunch, and rest for the fight ahead, he deployed a brigade to the rear for reserves, and posted his left flank with cavalry and his right flank with the 31st Illinois Infantry Regiment and additional cavalry.OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part III) Chapter XXXVI page 707 & 735 The men were just wrapping up lunch when an artillery duel opened up between the Union artillery near Fourteen Mile Creek and Gregg's artillery, which had been called forward by General Gregg to a hilltop 700 yards (600 m) distant.OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part III) Chapter XXXVI page 747 Around noon, McPherson ordered Logan forward.OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part III) Chapter XXXVI page 711 Chaos and irony Map of Raymond Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. The men of the First and Third Brigades faced the same challenge faced by Second Brigade earlier in the day. The vines in this area hung like ropes between the trees, and some of them boasted thorns three inches (76 mm) long. Additionally, though Fourteen Mile Creek was just inches deep, the nearly vertical banks rose over above the creek bed in places. To compound the command problems created by the terrain, McPherson's men were operating under drum and bugle silence and orders had to be delivered by courier, causing the line to lurch forward unevenly. The men of the 23rd Indiana Infantry Regiment experienced what must have seemed like a stroke of luck at the time‚Äîbecause of a turn in the creek, their right flank rested very near the creek. With a little effort, the unit was across the creek and standing in formation. In order to close the gap created by the march, the unit quick-stepped back the other direction looking for the rest of the brigade, and stumbled sideways into the jaws of the Confederate trap.OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part I) Chapter XXXVI pages 711 and 712 The only thing that saved the 23rd Indiana Infantry from wholesale slaughter was the fact that the Confederates had never been issued bayonets.OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part I) Chapter XXXVI page 747 Col. Manning Force, the commander of the 20th Ohio Infantry Regiment, heard the rebel yell, followed by the sounds of musketry, and panicked. He ordered his regiment to charge, running through the nearly impassable tangle and then leaping into the creek bed. There his men must have been stricken with horror at their mistake‚Äîthe rest of the division was holding its ground to the rear, and the walls of the creek were too steep to either move forwards or retreat. Luckily the creek made a turn here, and the soldiers utilized it as a bunker as they traded blows with the right battalion of the 7th Texas Infantry, the ends of the Texans' rifles discharging just inches away as the Confederates utilized the other side of the creek bed in the same manner. Force crawled out of the creek bed with difficulty and sought help from the rest of the division, begging Colonel Richards of the 20th Illinois Volunteer Infantry regiment to move forward and connect the Federal line.Drake, page 45 The left battalion of the 7th Texas Infantry, and the 3rd Tennessee Infantry, wild with their easy victory over the 23rd Indiana Infantry, had pushed across the creek and past the 20th Ohio in a wave, encountering the Union battle line still standing in the woods. For a few minutes, the Union line and Confederate line stood obscured in the thick woods and smoke and killed each other at short range, \\"both lines [standing] equally firm; both equally determined as a couple of bulldogs engaged in a death struggle\\".Drake, page 46 Just after Force returned to the creek bed, the Federal line was ordered to leave the woods for the safety of the fence line, allowing the Union commanders to sort out what had happened. In executing this movement, Colonel Richards was lost, and with him Manning Force's desperate plea for assistance. The Confederates, perceiving that the Federals were withdrawing, imagined that the Federal line was being forced back. The rebels pushed forward with vigor, only to be ripped apart by a volley from federal troops now hiding behind the fence. Aggravating the situation for the Confederates was the fact that the 31st Illinois, hearing the fighting erupt behind them, had merely to about-face from their position on the Union right flank, and step forward in line a few yards before they were in firing position to enfilade the line of the 3rd Tennessee Infantry.OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part I) Chapter XXXVI page 740 On the Confederate left flank, two Confederate regiments (50th Tennessee and consolidated 10th/30th Tennessee) were sneaking forward in complete silence, ready to stream into the field in the federal rear and seal the trap. Skirmishers of the leading 50th Tennessee chased off the cavalry pickets with a few ill-aimed shots.OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part I) Chapter XXXVI page 744 In the field behind the Federal army, General Logan must have been near panic. The cavalry protecting his right flank was scrambling from the woods, his rightmost infantry regiment was nowhere to be seen, and what was left of the next regiment in line had emerged from the woods in disorganized groups of three and four, and was attempting in vain to regroup. Normally calm in battle, Logan was noted to be riding behind the lines screeching like an eagle for his troops to plug the perceived gaps. He pulled the 8th Illinois and the 81st Illinois out of line, sending the former to the left where the 23rd Indiana was reforming, and the latter to the right where the 23rd Indiana should have been, and then sent the remaining two regiments of his reserve to probe for the force that had scattered his cavalry picket. The commander of the 50th Tennessee emerged from the woods ahead of his skirmishers, and his heart sank. To his right, a line of blue stretched as far as he could see. To the left, he could hear Logan's two reserve regiments moving past his flank. General Gregg had made a grave miscalculation. The federal infantry brigade he had been ordered to rout from the field had somehow turned into an entire federal division. The Confederate force withdrew across the creek with haste, and for a moment was too stunned to do anything but stand in formation waiting for orders. At this point, McPherson sent a note back to Grant stating that he had been engaged with a Confederate force of about 1,000 men for two hours and was about to get the upper hand.PUSG, page 206 This was an incredibly accurate statement. So far, the Confederates had only managed to commit the 7th Texas and 3rd Tennessee Infantry Regiments, just under 1,000 men in total. Strangely enough, the Confederates engaged now found themselves caught in the same trap that they had planned for the Federals: they had been lured in a disorganized mass across a nearly impassable creek, and now faced the danger of being driven into the creek and slaughtered. The enfilading fire on the 3rd Tennessee began to take its toll, and its left flank crumbled. Col. Hiram Granbury of the 7th Texas decided to order a withdrawal, then had second thoughts and sent a courier to his right battalion with a message to rescind the order. A timely bullet killed the courier before he could deliver the message, meaning that for a few valuable minutes five companies of the 7th Texas regiment were holding back an entire Federal army division. This allowed hundreds of Confederates to withdraw safely across the creek. A final push by the fresh 8th Illinois Infantry regiment finally broke the 7th Texas. A proud veteran regiment that had once boasted that it had never been broken in battle was now reduced to fleeing for its life in scattered groups, with hundreds of Federals in pursuit.OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part I) Chapter XXXVI page 748 Confederate fight for survival Colonel Randal William McGavock, 10th Tennessee Infantry, commanding the consolidated 10th/30th Tennessee, sent a courier to find General Gregg. The courier returned, not with orders from General Gregg, but with news that the Confederate center had been routed. In a panic, McGavock ordered his regiment to the center without pausing to inform the 50th Tennessee now protecting the Confederate left flank. Marching double time by the right flank back to the position he had occupied earlier that morning, McGavock emerged from the woods in time to see scattered groups of Confederates being pursued by a wave of blue. Before all his troops had even emerged from the woods, McGavock ordered an oblique charge by his own 10th Tennessee \\"Sons of Erin,\\" some seven companies, across the open field into the midst of the blue mass. What McGavock failed to realize was that the field was now enfiladed by the 31st Illinois, lying hidden in the edge of the woods along the creek. In a dramatic flourish, McGavock threw back his cape, exposing the red liner and inspiring his fellow Irishmen as he led the counterattack. Unfortunately for the 10th TN, this also made McGavock a fine target and he was shot almost immediately. The 31st Illinois \\"opened fire as if by file\\" as the Irish Southerners charged across their front, successfully forcing the Federal pursuers of the Confederate center to return to the shelter of the creek. The success came at a cost: the 10th Tennessee suffered a majority of its 88 reported casualties in this action. Receiving enfilading fire, the 10th Tennessee withdrew, loading and firing the entire time, to join the three companies of the 30th atop the hill. Lt. Colonel James Turner, commander of the 30th Tennessee who succeeded to command of the consolidated unit, positioned the whole prone to sweep the field below.OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part I) Chapter XXXVI page 741 Helping stem the Federal tide was the arrival of Gregg's reserve‚Äîthe 41st Tennessee Infantry‚Äîand the fact that \\"McGavock Hill\\" had become a rallying point for remnants of other units, most notably the right battalion of the 7th Texas Infantry. At this point, the battle devolved into a contest of sniping, as the Federal commanders attempted to reform the men into organized units in the difficult tangle while suppressing the fire from the hill top. Gregg, meanwhile, found himself scrambling to provide enough time to allow the routed units to reform for the retreat. The 1st Tennessee Infantry Battalion spent the afternoon feinting in various directions, and suffered heavy casualties for its efforts.OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part I) Chapter XXXVI page 746 The 50th Tennessee, having grown tired of standing in the Gallatin Road, traversed the battlefield from left to right, while the 41st Tennessee marched to the sound of firing on the left flank to protect it, unaware that the 50th Tennessee was already there. Moving to the left, it passed the 50th Tennessee headed in the opposite direction, and took up the 50th's former position on the flank.OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part I) Chapter XXXVI page 745 Eventually, McPherson began to extend his right flank beyond the Confederate hilltop. The position having been turned and his routed units reasonably reformed, Gregg ordered a withdrawal through Raymond towards Jackson. Here, the Federal artillery finally made its mark in the battle, pounding the Confederate ranks as Gregg continued the delaying action to allow his battered units to withdraw. As his disorganized force came scrambling over fences and through yards in Raymond, they were met by the 3rd Kentucky Mounted Infantry and 800 cavalry under the command of Wirt Adams, the leading elements of reinforcements headed to Raymond from all over the Confederacy. Help had arrived too late to do anything but provide cavalry rear guard protection to General Gregg's spent force.OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part I) Chapter XXXVI page 738 Aftermath The Union casualties at Raymond consisted of 68 killed, 341 wounded, and 37 missing. The Confederate casualties were nearly double: 100 killed, 305 wounded, and 415 captured. Indicative of the number of locals and state troops who answered Jefferson Davis' desperate request to the Mississippi governor for help turning back Grant OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part III) Chapter XXXVI page 859 is the fact that the Union Army buried and captured more Confederates at Raymond than the number of casualties reported by General Gregg, total (500).OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part III) Chapter XXXVI page 739 Many of the Confederate dead were interred in the Confederate Cemetery at Raymond, by the townspeople.Confederate Cemetery at Raymond Grant's plan had been to lure Pemberton into splitting his force, allowing the Confederate army to be defeated in detail. News that Pemberton's left wing had retreated to the rail center at Jackson, where it was receiving reinforcements from across the Confederacy, led Grant to change his plan of attack. Whereas initially he had planned to detach McPherson's two divisions to destroy Jackson, Grant now planned a full-scale assault on the Mississippi capital.OR Series 1 ‚Äì Volume 24 (Part I) Chapter XXXVI page 50 This led to the Battle of Jackson on May 14, 1863, which was essentially a rear-guard action for the suddenly timorous Joseph E. Johnston. The threat of Confederate reinforcement having been eliminated, Grant turned and defeated Pemberton at the Battle of Champion Hill on May 16, and the Battle of Big Black River Bridge on May 17. Pemberton, his army all but shattered, retreated into Fortress Vicksburg, where his men rallied to thwart two Federal assaults, but finally accepted the inevitable and surrendered on July 4, 1863. Battlefield preservation Battle of Raymond historic site on the Natchez Trace Parkway near Raymond, Mississippi. Although the Raymond battlefield remained nearly unchanged for over a century, commercial and residential development along Mississippi Highway 18 vaulted Raymond onto the Civil War Preservation Trust's list of the Top Ten Endangered Civil War Battlefields for 2005. In 1998, in response to the planned conversion of pasture land into a strip mall fronting the highway, a group of concerned citizens formed the Friends of Raymond to promote the preservation of the land comprising the Raymond battlefield.Friends of Raymond The organization initially purchased the which was to host the commercial development, and additional non-contiguous areas have been added since. A battlefield park has been constructed on the north side of Highway 18, featuring a walking trail, several cannon, and planned interpretive markers. In 2009, the Raymond Battlefield Park doubled in size with the acquisition of the field that saw the bulk of the fighting; this land, however, remains undeveloped and lacks the interpretive signage of the core park.Raymond Battlefield Park Doubles in Size Through mid-2018, the Civil War Trust (formerly the Civil War Preservation Trust and now a division of the American Battlefield Trust), and its partners, including the Friends of Raymond, have acquired and preserved of the Raymond battlefield.

Micheltorena was the last non-Californian Mexican governor before Californian native son P√≠o Pico took office. Family Micheltorena was born in 1804 in Oaxaca de Ju√°rez, Oaxaca, Mexico, into a prominent Basque family. His parents were Army Captain Joseph Eusebio Micheltorena (who in 1819 was included among a list of notable foreigners in Mexico), and Catarina Gertrudis Llano. He was baptized at five days old at Oaxaca Cathedral. His grandparents were Joseph de Micheltorena (Mixteltorena) and Mar√≠a Encarnaci√≥n de Herrera (paternal), and Joseph August√≠n de Llano and Mar√≠a Romero (maternal). Career Micheltorena was appointed governor of California by Mexican President Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna and served from 30 December 1842, until his ouster in 1845. Micheltorena continued previous governors' policy of large land grants (\\"ranchos\\"). He faced criticism, opposition, and eventually rebellion by the Californios who wanted local-born governors. Micheltorena brought with him from Mexico a group of soldiers that included criminals, and who were derisively referred to by some as cholos, to enforce his policies. Micheltorena was defeated at the 1845 Battle of Providencia, left California, and was succeeded by Pio Pico as governor.

History The series was designed to replace the EN57, which was struggling to cope with the steep inclines of the Krak√≥w - Zakopane route. Twenty EN71s were built at the PaFaWag works in 1976 and a further 30, or so, were manufactured in 1984 using individual EN57 units. The original twenty EN71s had bodywork made from corrugated metal; units with numbers above 20 are built from EN57s and can, therefore, have bodywork made from either flat or corrugated metal panels. Construction The EN71 is made up of four carriages: two with cabs; two with motors. The former (factory designation 5B) are marked as ra -- where r stands for rozrzƒÖdczy (the Polish term for control car) and a signifies that this is the front end of the train -- and rb. The motor carriages (factory designation 6B) are classified as s, which is short for silnikowy, Polish for approximately engine-equipped. The sets can be connected together using Scharfenberger couplers, which prevent access between sets. Each carriage is equipped with two sets of automatic, pneumatic powered doors and is split into three sections with seating -- a central aisle running between the seats. The front and rearmost passenger sections of the control car are arranged differently from the rest: they contain foldable seats built into the wall of the carriage, as well as an extra set of doors that can be opened manually. According to need, these sections can also serve as compartments for staff or for transporting bicycles, pushchairs, and oversize luggage. The driver's cab is accessible via a separate, manually operated door at the front of the carriage. In contrast to the EN57 series, all EN71s (with exception to EN71-100) are equipped with racks for skis located next to the passenger compartment doors. Service history The EN71 series are operated by Przewozy Regionalne (Regional Transport) and Szybka Kolej Miejska (Fast Urban Railway) in the Tricity, EN71-046 was used for 3 weeks by Szybka Kolej Miejska in Warsaw. As has been mentioned in the History section, the new EN71s were set to work on the Krak√≥w-Zakopane route, which had been electrified in 1975. In the years that followed, the series saw use on the routes to Krynica and Szklarska Porƒôba. At the beginning of the 1990s, several EN71s were modernised and became more comfortable (1st class carriages were also built). These new EN71s were assigned to a new service called RegioPlus before becoming superseded by the ED72 series. Service in other countries Total of 37 four-carriage units were exported to Yugoslavia along with the three-carriage EN57 in the 1960s and 1970s. A few have recently returned to Poland, purchased by Koleje Mazowieckie (Masovia Railways) and various other companies.

It was fought during the Continuation War (1941‚Äì1944), a part of World War II, between Finland and the Soviet Union.  Background  After the Soviets saw that they had failed in the Battle of Tali-Ihantala against the Finnish defenders in the late June and early July 1944, they tried to break the Finnish positions in Vuosalmi (now Druzhnoye) and encircle the southern part of the Finnish forces in the Karelian Isthmus. Soviet forces of the 23rd Army in the region had made unsuccessful low-scale attacks against the Finnish defenses for nearly two weeks at √Ñyr√§p√§√§ region. Lack of success from the 23rd Army's performance lead to change of command on July 3. Order of battle =Finnish= Finnish defenses on the Vuosalmi consisted initially with only the 2nd Division (Martola, later Blick). But this was later reinforced with parts of the Armored Division (Lagus), 57th Infantry Regiment and 25th Separate Battalion of 15th Infantry Division and 4th Battalion of 19th Brigade (IV/19.Pr) after the battles in the Tali-Ihantala region started to slow down. Total 21 artillery battalions were supporting infantry during critical last stage of the battle. Per infantry battalion there were more artillery support in Vuosalmi than in Tali-Ihantala. :III Corps (Siilasvuo) ::2nd Infantry Division (Martola/Blick) ::15th Infantry Division (Hersalo) :::57th Infantry Regiment :::25th Separate Battalion ::19th Infantry Brigade (Maskula) :::4th Battalion of brigade(during last stage) :Finnish Armoured Division (Lagus, during last stage) ::Assault Gun Battalion :: 4 J√§ger Battalions Total forces first ~20,000 growing to ~32,000 in mid july. Average personal strength of infantry division around 13,300 men, while 6,700-7,000 of infantry brigade, 3,620 of infantry regiment and 1,022 of infantry battalion. 21 field artillery battalions (average 520-560 men each). =Soviet= Soviet Leningrad Front's 23rd Army (Svetsov) was assigned with the task of making a crossing and a breakthrough at Vuosalmi. For this task 23rd Army assigned first the 98th Rifle Corps and later switched it to the 115th Rifle Corps. :98th Rifle Corps (Anisimov) ::92nd Rifle Division ::281st Rifle Division ::381st Rifle Division :115th Rifle Corps (Kozatsek) ::10th Rifle Division ::92nd Rifle Division ::142nd Rifle Division :6th Rifle Corps ::13th Rifle Division ::382th Rifle Division ::327th Rifle Division (Soviet Union) :Supporting units of 23rd Army ::17th Fortification Area troops ::47th Guards Artillery Brigade ::21st, 151st and 336th Artillery Regiments ::165th, 641st, 883rd and 1072nd Antitank Regiments ::175th, 456th, 506th and 567th Mortar Regiments ::70th Guards Mortar Regiment ::1469th Antiaircraft Regiment ::71st and 618th Separate Antiaircraft Battallions ::46th Guards Tank Regiment ::226th Tank Regiment ::938th Self-Propelled Gun Regiment ::952rd Self-Propelled Gun Regiment ::71st Separate Armoured Train Battalion ::20th Engineer Brigade Total: 8 infantry divisions, 80-90 tanks or assault/self-propelled guns and around 600 field artillery pieces or heavy mortars. Average personal strength of rifle divisions was around 6,600-6,700 men.  The battle  The Finnish positions were very unfavorably located in the ridge of √Ñyr√§p√§√§, with the wide River Vuoksi behind. Though the position was very unfavorable, the √Ñyr√§p√§√§ ridge dominated the lower lands on the northern shore requiring the defensive lines to be placed on the ridge. The Red Army 98th Corps started heavier attacks on July 4 and heavy battles raged for control of the ridge until July 9 when Finns finally withdrew to the northern shore. The Soviet 115th Corps then continued the attack and crossed the Vuosalmi on July 9.During that day both Soviet and Finnish forces had highest numbers of artillery and mortar rounds fired: 30,000 (Soviet forces) and 18,800 (Finnish, 13,500 of it field artillery rounds). The Soviet 115th Corps reinforced the bridgehead and had all its three divisions in the bridgehead on July 11. The Finnish forces also received reinforcements in the form of the depleted Finnish Armored Division directly from Ihantala and on July 11 both sides were attempting to attack simultaneously. Attempts on both sides were halted when they ran into attacking enemy formations. Though the Soviets now had access to the fields on the northern side, which were advantageous to the Soviet armor, the Finns were able to stop all further Soviet advances. The following Finnish counterattacks in Vuosalmi at this point amounted to not much success either, and thus both sides were on defensive here in mid-July, 1944. The Finnish field artillery fired altogether over 122,000 rounds of ordnance in √Ñyr√§p√§√§ and Vuosalmi, from June 20 to July 17, 1944 ‚Äì the same amount as in the Battle of Tali-Ihantala, which was fought during exactly the same time period in a nearby vicinity, on the relatively narrow Karelian Isthmus of Finland. Mortar units fired 85,000 rounds. When comparing 8 days period of most intensive fighting much more artillery rounds were fired in Vuosalmi (74,000) than in Tali-Ihantala (56,000). During that 8 days period in Vuosalmi Finnish mortar units fired also 52,000 rounds.Risto Erjola, \\"Ampumatarvikkeet sotien 1939-45 aikana Suomessa\\" https://journal.fi/ta/article/view/47724/13599 Finnish field artillery especially during the latter part of battle fired also relatively heavy rounds. In 16 July the average weight of rounds were around 28 kilos.War diary of 2nd Division artillery, http://digi.narc.fi/digi/view.ka?kuid=4507092  Aftermath  The commander of the Soviet Leningrad Front, Marshal Leonid Govorov criticized heavily the 23rd Army, 98th Corps and 115th Corps commanders when the offensive in Vuosalmi had not yielded any concrete results despite of the intolerably heavy casualties.

Bowling pins (historically known as skittles or kegels) are the target of the bowling ball in various bowling games including tenpins, five-pins, duckpins and candlepins.  Tenpins  Ten-pin bowling pins shown at different stages of manufacture. From right to left: a lathe shapes a pin from a block of wood before it is coated with plastic. Inner voids (spaces affecting center of gravity and tipping point) are also visible.Photo taken at the International Bowling Museum in Arlington, Texas, U.S. Pin specifications are set by the United States Bowling Congress (USBC). World Bowling, formerly World Tenpin Bowling Association, has adopted the USBC specifications. Pins are wide at their widest point and tall. They weigh , pins weighing up to are approved. The weight of the pin was originally based on the idea that a single pin should be around 24 percent the weight of the heaviest bowling ball within regulation, .  Duckpins and fivepins  Much-used duckpins on display Duckpins are shorter and squatter than standard tenpins. Canadian fivepins are between duckpins and tenpins in size, but have a thick, inch-wide rubber band around the widest part of the pin to increase pin action when struck.  Candlepins  A full rack of ten candlepins, with the sport's small ball. Candlepins are dissimilar to the others, being the tallest of all at 15-3/4 inches (40 cm), but only 2-15/16 inches wide and in weight, each pin nearly matching the maximum weight of a candlepin ball. They are nearly cylindrical in shape with a slight taper toward either end, making them vaguely resemble candles (hence the name). Unlike other bowling pins, because they are vertically symmetrical, candlepins may be set on either end. Due to their width and construction, candlepins tends to produce a billiard ball-like sound when struck. Kegels Kegel pins and ball Pins used in the German bowling game kegel appears to combine the design of tenpins and duckpins. The overall shape of the pin resembles a standard ten-pin bowling pins, and its small size is comparable to duckpins. Similar to five-pin bowling, these pins have strings attached on top of each, which connects them to the pinsetter.  Pin construction  Bowling pins are constructed by gluing blocks of rock maple wood into the approximate shape, and then turning on a lathe. After the lathe shapes the pin, it is coated with a plastic material, painted, and covered with a glossy finish. Because of the scarcity of suitable wood, bowling pins can be made from approved synthetics. Currently there are synthetic pins sanctioned for play in five-pin, duckpin, and candlepin. There is one synthetic ten pin model approved by the USBC. When hit by the ball, synthetic pins usually sound different from wooden pins. Juggling clubs could be mistaken for bowling pins due to their similar shape. The two differ greatly in construction and weight.

Formally, caucuses are formed as congressional member organizations (CMOs) through the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate and governed under the rules of these chambers. In addition to the term caucus, they are sometimes called conferences (especially Republican ones), coalitions, study groups, task forces, or working groups. Many other countries use the term parliamentary group‚Äîfor example, the Parliament of the United Kingdom has many all-party parliamentary groups.  Party caucuses and conferences in the United States Congress  The largest caucuses are the party caucuses and conferences in the United States Congress, which are the partisan caucuses comprising all members of one house from one party (either the Democrats or the Republicans) in addition to any independent members who may caucus with either party. These are the House Democratic Caucus, House Republican Conference, Senate Democratic Caucus and Senate Republican Conference. The caucuses meet regularly in closed sessions to set legislative agendas, select committee members and chairs and hold elections to choose various floor leaders. They also oversee the four Hill committees, political party committees that work to elect members of their own party to Congress.  Ideological conferences  Some caucuses are organized political factions with a common ideological orientation. In other words, ideological congressional caucuses can represent a \\"political party\\" within a political party. In the United States two-party dominant political system, these congressional caucuses help congregate and advance the ideals of a more focused ideology within the two major relatively \\"big tent\\" political parties. * On the Democratic side: **Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) ‚Äì progressive Democrats **New Democrat Coalition (NDC) ‚Äì modern liberal and centrist Democrats **Blue Dog Coalition (BDC) ‚Äì conservative Democrats * On the Republican side: ** Tuesday Group (TG) ‚Äì moderate Republicans ** Republican Main Street Partnership (MSP) ‚Äì moderate Republicans ** Republican Study Committee (RSC) ‚Äì conservative Republicans ** Liberty Caucus (LC) ‚Äì libertarian Republicans ** Freedom Caucus (FC) ‚Äì a conservative caucus affiliated with the Tea Party movement * On the Libertarian side: **Liberty Caucus (LC) ‚Äì libertarian Republicans and Libertarian Party members Most ideological caucuses are confined to the House of Representatives.  Racial and ethnic caucuses  Among the most visible caucuses are those composed of members sharing the same race or ethnic group. The most high profile of these represent people of color. The Congressional Black Caucus, Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus also form the Congressional Tri Caucus when they sit together. * The Congressional Black Caucus for African-Americans * The two Hispanic caucuses: ** The Congressional Hispanic Caucus for Hispanic Democrats ** The Congressional Hispanic Conference for Hispanic Republicans, who formerly belonged to the Hispanic Caucus, but later split off to form the Hispanic Conference * The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus represents members who are Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, but they are open to other members as well  LGBTQ caucus  The formation of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus was announced on June 4, 2008, by openly gay representatives Tammy Baldwin and Barney Frank. The mission of the caucus is to work for LGBT rights, the repeal of laws discriminatory against LGBT persons, the elimination of hate-motivated violence, and improved health and well-being for all persons, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. The caucus serves as a resource for Members of Congress, their staffs, and the public on LGBT issues. Unlike the Congressional Black Caucus, famous for admitting only black members, the LGBT Equality Caucus admits any member who is willing to advance LGBT rights, regardless of their sexual identity or orientation; it has historically been co-chaired by every openly-LGBT member of the House. The caucus currently has 165 members (164 Democrats and 1 Republican) in the 116th United States Congress.  Interest group caucuses  The most common caucuses consist of members united as an interest group. These are often bipartisan (comprising both Democrats and Republicans) and bicameral (comprising both Representatives and Senators). For example, the Congressional Bike Caucus works to promote cycling, and the Senate Taiwan Caucus promotes better relationships with Taiwan.  Rules  The House Committee on House Administration (HCHA) prescribes certain rules for Congressional Member Organizations (CMOs). Each Congress, CMOs must electronically register with the Committee on House Administration, providing the name of the caucus, a statement of purpose, the CMO officers and the employee designated to work on issues related to the CMO. The HCHA rules include the following: * Members of both the House and Senate may participate in CMO, but at least one of the Officers of the CMO must be a Member of the House. The participation of Senators in a CMO does not impact the scope of authorized CMO activities in any regard. * CMOs have no separate corporate or legal identity. A CMO is not an employing authority. The Members' Representational Allowance may not directly support a CMO as an independent entity. A CMO may not be assigned separate office space. * Neither CMOs nor individual Members may accept goods, funds, or services from private organizations or individuals to support the CMO. Members may use personal funds to support the CMO. * A member of a CMO may utilize employees (including shared employees) and official resources under the control of the Member to assist the CMO in carrying out its legislative objectives, but no employees may be appointed in the name of a CMO. * CMOs may not use the Frank (congressional free mailing) privilege, nor may a Member lend their Frank to a CMO. * A member may use official resources for communications related to the purpose of a CMO. Any such communications must comply with the Franking regulations. * Members may devote a section of their official website to CMO issues, but CMOs may not have independent web pages. * A member may use inside mail to communicate information related to a CMO. * Members may prepare material related to CMO issues for dissemination. * Official funds may not be used to print or pay for stationery for the CMO. * Members may refer to their membership in a CMO on their official stationery.

Retarders serve to slow vehicles, or maintain a steady speed while traveling down a hill, and help prevent the vehicle from \\"running away\\" by accelerating down the hill. They are not usually capable of bringing vehicles to a standstill, as their effectiveness diminishes as vehicle speed lowers. They are usually used as an additional \\"assistance\\" to slow vehicles, with the final braking done by a conventional friction braking system. As the friction brake will be used less, particularly at higher speeds, their service life is increased, and since in those vehicles the brakes are air-actuated helps to conserve air pressure too. Friction-based braking systems are susceptible to \\"brake fade\\" when used extensively for continuous periods, which can be dangerous if braking performance drops below what is required to stop the vehicle ‚Äì for instance if a truck or bus is descending a long decline. For this reason, such heavy vehicles are frequently fitted with a supplementary system that is not friction-based. Retarders are not restricted to road motor vehicles, but may also be used in railway systems. The British prototype Advanced Passenger Train (APT) used hydraulic retarders to allow the high-speed train to stop in the same distance as standard lower speed trains, as a pure friction-based system was not viable. Engine brake = Diesel-powered vehicles = Diesel engines regulate power output purely by the volume and timing of fuel injected into the combustion chambers. The engine braking generated by creating partial vacuum with a closed throttle at each intake stroke in petrol/gasoline engines does not apply to vehicles equipped with diesel engines, as such engines are quite \\"free-running\\". However Clessie L. Cummins, founder of Cummins Engine Company, realized that by opening the cylinder exhaust valves when the piston reached top dead centre, rather than at the end of the power stroke, the accumulated compressed air in the cylinder could be vented before it could act as a \\"spring\\" to drive the piston back down again. By doing this, the engine acts as an air compressor, with the energy coming from the transmission used to compress the air, hence slowing the vehicle. The amount of power extracted from the transmission can be up to 90% of the rated power of the engine for certain engines. In a compression release engine braking system for a turbocharged internal combustion engine, excessive stress associated with opening the exhaust valves of the engine near top dead center of engine compression strokes when the engine is turning at high speed is prevented by reducing the intake manifold pressure from what it otherwise would be at that high speed. This is done by retarding the turbocharger so that its speed is less than it otherwise would be at high engine speed. This type of retarder is known as compression release engine brake or \\"Jake brake\\". A disadvantage of this system is that it becomes very noisy in operation, particularly if the exhaust muffler is faulty; its use is, therefore, banned in some locales. =Exhaust brake= Exhaust brakes are simpler in operation than an engine brake. Essentially, the exhaust pipe of the vehicle is restricted by a valve. This raises the pressure in the exhaust system, forcing the engine to work harder on the exhaust stroke of its cylinders, so again the engine is acting as an air compressor, with the power required to compress the air being withheld from the exhaust pipe, retarding the vehicle. Turbocharger retarders that restrict the flow of exhaust gas can also help in increasing the exhaust pressure to achieve the same objective. Hydraulic retarder Hydraulic retarders use the viscous drag forces between dynamic and static vanes in a fluid-filled chamber to achieve retardation. There are several different types which can use standard transmission fluid (gear oil), a separate oil supply, water, or a mix of oil and magnetic retardation. Magnetic retarders are similar to the electric retarder discussed below. A simple retarder uses vanes attached to a transmission driveshaft between the clutch and roadwheels. They can also be driven separately via gears off a driveshaft. The vanes are enclosed in a static chamber with small clearances to the chamber's walls (which will also be vaned), as in an automatic transmission. When retardation is required, fluid (oil or water) is pumped into the chamber, and the viscous drag induced will slow the vehicle. The working fluid will heat, and is usually circulated through a cooling system. The degree of retardation can be varied by adjusting the fill level of the chamber. Hydraulic retarders are extremely quiet, often inaudible over the sound of a running engine, and are especially quiet in operation compared to engine brakes. Electric retarder Electric retarders use electromagnetic induction to provide a retardation force. An electric retardation unit can be placed on an axle, transmission, or driveline and consists of a rotor attached to the axle, transmission, or driveline‚Äîand a stator securely attached to the vehicle chassis. There are no contact surfaces between the rotor and stator, and no working fluid. When retardation is required, the electrical windings in the stator receive power from the vehicle battery, producing a magnetic field through which the rotor moves. This induces eddy currents in the rotor, which produces an opposing magnetic field to the stator. The opposing magnetic fields slows the rotor, and hence the axle, transmission or driveshaft to which it is attached. The rotor incorporates internal vanes (like a ventilated brake disk) to provide its own air cooling, so no load is placed on the vehicle's engine cooling system. The operation of the system is extremely quiet. A hybrid vehicle drivetrain uses electrical retardation to assist the mechanical brakes, while recycling the energy. The electric traction motor acts as a generator to charge the battery. The power stored in the battery is available to help the vehicle accelerate. Regenerative braking and eddy current braking are separate types of electric braking. Regenerative braking might not be classified as a retarder as it uses no extra physical hardware in addition to the existing rotor/stator pair of the motor. It effectuates braking by using the electric field created by the rotational inertia in the rotor/stator that is delivered into the rotor by the momentum of the vehicle(wheels). Additional circuitry in the controller is used to manage this current flow from the stator windings into the battery, some of which dissipates as heat within the circuitry of the controller. In contrast, eddy current retarder brakes comprise a distinct and purpose-built static armature and rotor that are explicitly made and added to a vehicle for braking and dissipation of heat and not for motive power; it is a purpose-built system distinct from the motor. Finally, \\"dynamic\\" braking is the complex use of controller braking where the controller can be used either for regenerative braking or by switching the circuit to feed the current to resistors. In this latter way \\"rheostatic\\" braking can be achieved. Whereas an eddy brake relies on eddy currents to create magnetic resistance some of which is incidentally dissipated as heat, rheostatic braking relies on controller circuitry resistors which directly dissipate current-borne electric energy as heat. Some dynamic braking vehicles describe the rheostatic braking as \\"plug\\" braking. In particular, forklift dynamic braking has been developed to take advantage of combining this type of braking with controllers specialized to quickly reverse vehicle direction. Dynamic and regenerative braking, when used on electric or diesel-electric railroad locomotives, means that the electric motors which usually are used to drive the road wheels are instead use as generators being driven by the wheels on a downslope. In regenerative braking, the electric current created is typically fed back into the power supply (i.e. overhead catenary, third rail), and can be used by other locomotives or stored for later use. In this way a locomotive will receive current while on level ground or traveling uphill, but acts as a current supply when braking, transforming the kinetic energy created from traveling downhill (or less often, converting forward momentum from travel on level ground) into electricity. In a diesel-electric, rather than being generated remotely and collected from a power source, the power supply is generated directly by the onboard prime mover (engine) and transmitted to the motors; there is presently rarely any way of storing electricity up for later use, so instead, the motors are used as generators, retarding the wheel rotation, and the generated power is routed through resistors mounted on the roof of the locomotive, where it is transformed into heat energy (much like an electric heating element) and dissipated into the atmosphere with large fans. While this has the drawback of not re-utilizing the energy created while traveling downhill, it does create a powerful and safe retarding system that is not prone to brake fade or wearing out like mechanical brakes.

The speed of these tunnels vary from Mach 5 to 15. The power requirement of a wind tunnel increases with the cross section, the flow density and is directly proportional to the third power of the test velocity. Hence installation of a continuous, closed circuit wind tunnel remains a costly affair. The first continuous Mach 7-10 wind tunnel with 1x1 m test section was planned at Kochel am See, Germany during WW IIEckardt, Dietrich: \\"The 1x1 m hypersonic wind tunnel Kochel/Tullahoma 1940-1960\\", CEAS Space Journal, March 2015, Vol. 7, Issue 1, pp. 23-36 and finally put into operation as 'Tunnel A' in the late 1950s at AEDC Tullahoma, TN, USA for an installed power of 57 MW. In view of these high facility demands, also intermittently operated experimental facilities like blow-down wind tunnels are designed and installed to simulate the hypersonic flow. A hypersonic wind tunnel comprises in flow direction the main components: heater/cooler arrangements, dryer, convergent/divergent nozzle, test section, second throat and diffuser. A blow- down wind tunnel has a low vacuum reservoir at the back end, while a continuously operated, closed circuit wind tunnel has a high power compressor installation instead. Since the temperature drops with the expanding flow, the air inside the test section has the chance of becoming liquefied. For that reason, preheating is particularly critical (the nozzle may require cooling). Technological problems There are several technological problems in designing and constructing a hyper-velocity wind tunnel: *supply of high temperatures and pressures for times long enough to perform a measurement *reproduction of equilibrium conditions *structural damage produced by overheating *fast instrumentation *power requirements to run the tunnel Simulations of a flow at 5.5 km/s, 45 km altitude would require tunnel temperatures of over 9000 K, and a pressure of 3 GPa (see discussion). Hot shot wind tunnel One form of HWT is known as a Gun Tunnel or hot shot tunnel (up to M=27), which can be used for analysis of flows past ballistic missiles, space vehicles in atmospheric entry, and plasma physics or heat transfer at high temperatures. It runs intermittently, but has a very low running time (less than a second). The method of operation is based on a high temperature and pressurized gas (air or nitrogen) produced in an arc-chamber, and a near- vacuum in the remaining part of the tunnel. The arc-chamber can reach several MPa, while pressures in the vacuum chamber can be as low as 0.1 Pa. This means that the pressure ratios of these tunnels are in the order of 10 million. Also, the temperatures of the hot gas are up to 5000 K. The arc chamber is mounted in the gun barrel. The high pressure gas is separated from the vacuum by a diaphragm. Prior to a test run commencing, a membrane separates the compressed air from the gun barrel breech. A rifle (or similar) is used to rupture the membrane. Compressed air rushes into the breech of the gun barrel, forcing a small projectile to accelerate rapidly down the barrel. Although the projectile is prevented from leaving the barrel, the air in front of the projectile emerges at hypersonic velocity into the working section. Naturally the duration of the test is extremely brief, so high speed instrumentation is required to get any meaningful data.  Hypersonic Wind Tunnel Facility in India  ISRO commissioned two major facilities ‚Äî a Hypersonic Wind Tunnel and Shock Tunnel ‚Äî at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Center as part of its continuous and concerted efforts to minimize cost of access to space. ISRO Chairman A. S. Kiran Kumar said commissioning of such facilities would provide adequate data for design and development of current and future space transportation systems in India.

The screenplay was written by Robert Westerby and Paul Gallico. It was based upon Gallico's 1957 novel Thomasina, the Cat Who Thought She Was God. The film was shot in Inveraray, Argyll, Scotland, and Pinewood Studios, England. Plot The story takes place in fictional Inveranoch, Scotland in the year 1912. It centres on Andrew MacDhui (Patrick McGoohan) a coldly scientific, atheist veterinarian, his seven-year-old daughter Mary (Karen Dotrice), and her cat Thomasina (voiced by Elspeth March), who narrates the film. (Thomasina was originally called \\"Thomas\\" by her adoptive family. She explains that they amended her name \\"when they, well, got to know me better.\\") Dr. MacDhui is a widower. His wife's death from illness destroyed his belief in God, as well as his empathy for others. He has little sympathy for pets such as Thomasina, preferring \\"useful\\" animals such as hard-working farm beasts and the blind man Tammas' guide dog, Bruce. One night Thomasina is chased by dogs in the marketplace. She falls from some boxes and sustains an injury. Mary and her friends find Thomasina the following day. Meanwhile, Dr. MacDhui is operating on Bruce (who had been struck by a car). The doctor is interrupted during the surgery by his daughter, begging him to help her cat. Observing that Thomasina's muscles are stiff, he diagnoses her with tetanus and cannot treat her. He orders his assistant Willie Bannock (Wilfrid Brambell) to euthanize Thomasina. Mary is shattered by Thomasina's death, and loses faith in her father, who had promised to save her cat. She withdraws emotionally from Dr. MacDhui and declares her father dead, refusing to speak to or look at him. Meanwhile, Thomasina's soul goes to a feline afterlife where cats who have used all of their nine lives are transformed into Siamese and live with the Egyptian cat goddess Bastet for eternity. But Thomasina has lived only once, and is returned to her body alive but in a coma. Mary and her playmates Hughie Stirling (Vincent Winter), and Jamie and Geordie McNab (Denis Gilmore and Matthew Garber) and other friends give Thomasina a funeral. They take her out to the glen beyond the town, but are unintentionally frightened away by \\"Mad Lori\\" MacGregor (Susan Hampshire), a beautiful kindhearted young woman who lives in the glen and was attracted by the children's singing and bagpipe playing. The children believe she is a witch, in part because of her apparent power to calm and cure animals. Lori brings Thomasina back to her makeshift animal hospital, but although the cat recovers she has no memory of her first life with Mary. Thus begins her second life. Lori lacks the surgical skill needed to help a wounded badger that she finds in a trap, and asks God for assistance. Soon after, Dr. MacDhui comes to give her a piece of his mind: the children have told the townspeople to boycott his practice and to bring their sick pets to her instead. Discovering the injured animal, he treats the badger's wound as Lori watches in amazement. Lori (and later, Dr. MacDhui) realize that they each have half of what is needed to treat sick animals. He has the science and surgery, and she has the power of love. During the time, Mary becomes increasingly distraught and distant from her playmates and her father. Not even a new pet brought by Dr. MacDhui will cheer her up. Meanwhile, Thomasina's memory is slowly returning. She realizes she misses something very important, but she doesn't know what. She remembers the way back home, but doesn't recognize Mary, who chases her into a rainstorm. Thomasina returns to the safety of Lori's cabin in the woods, but Mary contracts pneumonia after Dr. MacDhui finds her lying on the street in the rain. Dr. MacDhui and Lori start to bond emotionally when their attempt to shut down a travelling circus results in a fight with its gypsy proprietors who had been physically abusing their performing animals. The circus spectators, including Mary's playmates, join in the fight and a fire breaks out. The police ultimately arrest the proprietors for animal cruelty. Dr. MacDhui prays for the first time in four years that God will somehow cure his daughter. Off in the glen, a lightning bolt (which may be a miracle from God) strikes a tree next to Thomasina and her memory is suddenly restored. Lori comes to the house, as Thomasina does, who is the only one able to save Mary as she has lost the will to live. However the cat sees Dr. MacDhui (who had her killed) and refuses to enter through the window despite Dr. MacDhui's pleading. At this point, Thomasina realizes that she could get revenge on Dr. MacDhui by not entering, but Lori's love has changed her, and she no longer desires revenge. Dr. MacDhui places Thomasina in Mary's arms, thereby restoring Thomasina to Mary, Mary's life, and Mary's love for her father. Lori's love has changed Dr. MacDhui, and they are soon married, making the perfect veterinary team. Thomasina now begins her third life with all of them together.

He concluded by describing the film as \\"mighty, mighty cosy.\\"New York Times: Thomasina Film critic Leonard Maltin (in his book The Disney Films) on the other hand, refers to this film very highly; calling it \\"delicate and charming\\", and very deserving of a larger audience if ever reissued. One scene in particular that he highly praised, was Thomasina's trip to Cat Heaven, calling it: \\"a wondrous piece of movie magic\\". In another article written by Maltin, he includes this film title among the lesser known gems of Disney Movies, (along with other film titles like Darby O'Gill and the Little People). Maltin also said Dotrice \\"won over everyone\\" with her performance in Thomasina, and she (and fellow cast member Matthew Garber) were signed to play the Banks children in the Disney film Mary Poppins. References in other works *In Grant Morrison's comic book series The Invisibles, Mason Lang claims that the film \\"explains 'Everything'\\".

Like its cousin (EN71), the ED72 is based on the EN57 and became the basis for its successor: the ED73. History Between the years 1993-1997, a mere 21 units were built by Pafawag. The newly built ED72s were assigned to large regional transit operations in the towns of Pozna≈Ñ, Szczecin, Krak√≥w, and Bydgoszcz. The series was created as an \\"upmarket\\" replacement for the, more spartan, EN57 and EN71 electric multiple units. Unfortunately, the express passenger service, InterRegio, for which the series was designed didn't find the ED72 to be quite as comfortable as they had hoped. Currently, all 21 units are still in use, servicing mostly InterRegio and some local Regio and RegioPlus trains. Modifications The ED72 introduced a number of innovations over the previous series of EMUs. Amongst these was converting the rb (rear control cars) sections to first class units which were fitted with more comfortable seats, as well as new upholstery in the second class carriages. Double glazed windows were fitted; buttons for opening and closing the doors were installed -- rather than having to wait for the driver to operate them; and matrix route manifests were installed, as opposed to the traditional blinds which only displayed the train's destination. The last unit to be produced -- ED72-021 -- is unique in that it has sliding doors that open outwards. In terms of the unit's appearance, the major difference -- apart from the red and yellow colour scheme -- is the control car's frontal aspect. Furthermore, ED72s were originally equipped with single-arm pantographs, but most have been converted to using the traditional, diamond-shaped, double-arm version. The ED72's couplers allow it to be easily connected to other EMUs, and this is done quite frequently.

He was possibly one of the more successful medieval Catalan writers, since his works were widely read, copied, published and translated. Therefore, it can be said that both in the literary and in the political sphere he had a lot of influence. Among his readers were numbered important people of his time, such as the kings of the Crown of Aragon Peter IV, John I and Martin I, the queen Maria de Luna (wife of Martin I), and the Pope of Avignon Benedict XIII. Life Francesc Eiximenis was born around 1330, possibly in Girona. When he was very young, he became a Franciscan and his education began in the Franciscan schools of the Kingdom of Aragon. Later, he attended the most important universities of Europe: the University of Oxford and the University of Paris. The University of Oxford influenced him notably, since the Franciscans had there an important school. Thus, several English Franciscans (and British authors in general) are the thinkers who most influenced Eiximenis, such as Robert Grosseteste (whom Eiximenis calls Linconiensis, since he was bishop of Lincoln), John of Wales, Richard Kilvington, Alexander of Hales, Richard of Middleton, Thomas Bradwardine, William of Ockham, and John Duns Scotus. Title page of the incunable edition of the Regiment de la Cosa P√∫blica (Valencia, Crist√≤for Cofman, 1499). Francesc Eiximenis is on the right. He offers his book to the jurats of Valencia. On the left is the guardian angel of the city and kingdom of Valencia. The six Jurats de Valencia are kneeling in front of the Serrans gothic gate of the ancient wall of Valencia. In 1371 there was an attempt to bring him to the University of Lleida as a teacher. But he lacked the title of Doctor in Theology (magister in sacra pagina), and so this attempt did not go further. Eiximenis acquired this title in 1374 at the University of Toulouse, with the financial help and support of the king Peter IV. Eiximenis subsequently returned to Catalonia, where he was considered very intellectual. He was on good terms with the Court of the Crown of Aragon and with the ruling social class of Barcelona and Val√®ncia. Most of his works were written in Valencia, where he stayed from 1382 to 1408. There he was consultant of the jurats (the city representatives) and of the Consell (ruling organ of the city). In Valencia, Eiximenis' activity, besides his literary tasks, was tireless. The year 1391 was a very difficult one for the city and kingdom of Valencia, since there were many social problems. Then Eiximenis organized a kind of \\"praying army\\" in some monasteries and convents around Valencia. In 1392 he and other people received the assignment of checking the Jewish books that were stolen during the 1391 pogrom. At the end of 1397 he was a member of a commission that would advise king Martin I about the Western Schism. In 1397 and 1398 he undertook the organization of two crusades of Valencians and Majorcans against the Muslim pirates of North Africa. In 1399 Eiximenis was also president of a commission that sought to unify all the schools of Valencia. The Consell (ruling organ of Valencia) rejected that in 1400, but this attempt was anyway a clear first step towards the University of Valencia, that was founded officially in 1499. The last years of Eiximenis in Valencia (1404‚Äì1408) were devoted to the foundation and endowment of the Franciscan convent of Sant Esperit (in Gilet, near Sagunto). This convent was founded by the queen Maria de Luna. In 1408 Eiximenis took part in the Council of Perpignan. There the Pope of Avignon Benedict XIII appointed him first Patriarch of Jerusalem and later apostolic administrator (interim bishop) of the diocese of Elna (ancient name of the diocese of Perpignan). Eiximenis died in Perpignan, possibly on 23 April 1409. Works =In Catalan= Eiximenis wrote the following works in Catalan: * Tractat d'usura (Treaty about Usury). Short treatise about usury according to the Canon Law. This matter was much debated in the Middle Ages by many scholars. * Lo Cresti√† (The Christian). According to Curt Wittlin the name should be Lo Cristi√†.Wittlin, Curt. \\"Era Cristi√† Lo Cresti√† de Francesc Eiximenis? Hist√≤ria d'un error de Paleografia\\". Caplletra, 48. Spring 2010. 163-77. It was a huge project of Summa Theologica written in popular language. The original project consisted of 13 books, but only four were written: ** Primer del Cresti√† (First of the Christian). It deals with the fundamentals of Christianity. ** Segon del Cresti√† (Second of the Christian). It deals with the temptation. ** Ter√ß del Cresti√† (Third of the Christian). It deals with the different kinds of sins and their remedies. ** Dotz√® del Cresti√† (Twelfth of the Christian). It deals with government and politics in general. Nevertheless, the content is encyclopedic. * Regiment de la cosa p√∫blica (Government of the Republic). It was a gift from Eiximenis to the jurats (representatives of the city) of Valencia, when he went to Valencia in 1383. It gives advice for good government. This work shows the influence of John of Wales' Communiloquium, according to Albert Hauf.Hauf, Albert. ‚ÄúEiximenis, Joan de Salisbury i Fr. Joan de Gal.les, OFM‚Äù. Miscel¬∑l√†nia Sanchis Guarner, I. Quaderns de Filologia. Universitat de Val√®ncia. 1984. 167-174. This work was also included as the third part of the Dotz√® del Cresti√†. * Llibre dels √†ngels (Book of Angels). It is a very complete treatise about angelology but with several political thoughts. This book was dedicated to the Valencian knight Pere d'Art√©s. * Llibre de les dones (Book of Women). It begins as just a book about women's education; but four-fifths of this work deal about theology and the fundamentals of Catholic morality. The book was dedicated to the countess of Prades, Sanxa Ximenes d'Aren√≥s. * Vida de Jesucrist (Life of Jesus Christ). It is a biography of Jesus Christ with theological thoughts and also contemplative content. This work was very much influenced by Pseudo-Bonaventure's Meditations on the Life of Christ and also by the vehement Franciscan Ubertino da Casale according to Albert Hauf.Hauf, Albert. ¬´La huella de Ubertino de Casale en el preerasmismo hisp√°nico: el caso de fray Francesc Eiximenis¬ª, Actes del X Congr√©s Internacional de l‚ÄôAssociaci√≥ Hisp√†nica de Literatura Medieval [Associaci√≥ Hisp√†nica de Literatura Medieval / IIFV, Universitat d‚ÄôAlacant, 16/20 September 2003]. Alacant. IIFV. 2005. 93-135. This book was also dedicated to the Valencian knight Pere d'Art√©s. * Scala Dei or Tractat de contemplaci√≥ (Stairs towards God or Treatise about Contemplation). It is a short treatise about morals and theology. This book was dedicated to the queen Maria de Luna. * Two autograph letters in Catalan (from 15 July 1392 and 12 March 1396). The first (15 July 1392) was addressed to King Martin I (who at the time was only a prince), and is of interest since Eiximenis gives him advice in the letter about the good government of Sicily. =In Latin= Eiximenis wrote the following works in Latin: * De Triplici Statu Mundi (About the three states of the world). It is a short eschatological treatise. There are doubts however, that Eiximenis is the author of this work. * Allegationes (Statements). In Valencia there was a conflict between the Church and the State, and several important people were asked to express their opinion about that. This is the part that concerns Eiximenis. Here Eiximenis has a very strong theocratic point of view. * A short part of his Summa Theologica. This extract is very short, and deals with some theological matters. * Ars Praedicandi Populo (Manual for the preaching to the people). It is a very interesting manual about preaching. * A sermon (or a part of it). * Pastorale (Pastoral). It deals with advice for priests and bishops, and it follows the classical Saint Gregory's Pastorale. This book was dedicated to Hug de Llupi√†, bishop of Valencia. * Psalterium alias Laudatorium Papae Benedicto XIII dedicatum (Psalter or Doxology Dedicated to Pope Benedict XIII). It is a very beautiful collection of 344 prayers. As the title shows, this book was dedicated to the Avignon pope Benedict XIII. Two other books have been attributed to Eiximenis: the Cercapou, and the Doctrina compendiosa. The Doctrina Compendiosa shows however a very strong influence from Eiximenis' political theories. there was also an adaptation of Llibre de las Dones in Spanish, which was called Carro de las Donas.There is this digital edition (Valladolid, Juan de Villaquigr√°n, 1542). Eiximenis' works had much success in his time, as evidenced by more than 200 manuscripts of his works that have survived. Another example was the Psaltiri devot√≠ssim There is this digital edition (Girona, Diego de Gumiel, 1495) (Translation into Catalan of 100 out of the 344 prayers of the Psalterium alias Laudatorium). The incunabulum edition of this book had 2000 copies, i.e. more than double both editions of the Tirant lo Blanc (Valencia 1490 and Barcelona 1497). It was the biggest incunabulum edition of the whole medieval Catalan literature. There were also a lot of translations during the 15th and 16th centuries. The Llibre de les Dones was translated into Spanish. One of the Spanish translations was used for the education of the four daughters of the Catholic Monarchs. The Llibre dels √Ängels had great international success and was translated into several languages: Spanish, Latin, French and even Flemish (it was possibly the only book from the medieval Catalan literature that was translated into that language). And the Vida de Jesucrist was translated into Spanish and French. There are finally two other examples that show the international spreading of Eiximenis' works. First of all, the French translation of the Llibre dels √Ängels was the first book that in 1478 was printed in Geneva. Secondly, the Spanish translation of the Vida de Jesucrist was the first book that was printed in Granada in 1496 after the conquest of the city by the Catholic Monarchs. Unfortunately we have few modern editions of Eiximenis' works. Most of the modern editions of his works have been prepared by Curt Wittlin and by Albert Hauf. Beginning of the Ter√ß del Cresti√† in the manuscript 1792 from the National Library of Madrid. This manuscript has the chapters 1-523 from this book (which has 1060 chapters in total). =Editions= Obres de Francesc Eiximenis (OFE) ‚Äî Complete Works of Francesc Eiximenis * \\"Dotz√® Llibre del Cresti√†.

Wilse was born in Flekkefjord, but grew up in Krager√∏ and decided early to become a sailor. After having graduated with a technical degree from the technical school in Horten in 1882, Wilse emigrated to the United States in 1884. He did not find work in the beginning, but eventually settled in Seattle working for the United States Geological Survey. He is reported to have acquired his first camera in 1886. He opened a photography store in Seattle in 1897, after having visited Norway, and married Helen Marie Hutchinson. Wilse's photograph of Knut Hamsun in 1914 In 1900, his wife and children moved to Norway, and Wilse himself joined them, opening a photography store in Christiania in 1901, after 17 years in the United States. Work Wilse traveled extensively in Norway, both on assignment and for his own interest. He brought his 10 kg camera to inaccessible places through rugged terrain, going as far north as Svalbard. \\"Gausta\\" (Gaustatoppen) He photographed both natural sceneries and people at work, including the fishing industry in Lofoten before the introduction of motorized boats.

Alternative terms are industry concentration and seller concentration. Concentration. Glossary of Statistical Terms. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Market concentration is related to industrial concentration, which concerns the distribution of production within an industry, as opposed to a market. In industrial organization, market concentration may be used as a measure of competition, theorized to be positively related to the rate of profit in the industry, for example in the work of Joe S. Bain. Metrics Commonly used market concentration measures are the Herfindahl index (HHI or simply H) and the concentration ratio (CR).J. Gregory Sidak, Evaluating Market Power Using Competitive Benchmark Prices Instead of the Hirschman-Herfindahl Index, 74 ANTITRUST L.J. 387, 387-388 (2007). The Hannah-Kay (1971) index has the general form :\\\\text{HK}_\\\\alpha(x) = \\\\begin{cases} & \\\\left(\\\\sum s_i^\\\\alpha\\\\right)^\\\\frac {1}{\\\\alpha-1} \\\\text{ if }\\\\alpha > 0, \\\\alpha e 1  & \\\\prod s_i^{s_i} \\\\text{ if }\\\\alpha = 1 \\\\end{cases}. Note, \\\\prod s_i^{s_i} = \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\sum s_i \\\\log(s_i)\\\\right), which is the exponential index. Uses When antitrust agencies are evaluating a potential violation of competition laws, they will typically make a determination of the relevant market and attempt to measure market concentration within the relevant market. Motivation As an economic tool market concentration is useful because it reflects the degree of competition in the market. Tirole (1988, p. 247) notes that: :Bain's (1956) original concern with market concentration was based on an intuitive relationship between high concentration and collusion. There are game theoretic models of market interaction (e.g. among oligopolists) that predict that an increase in market concentration will result in higher prices and lower consumer welfare even when collusion in the sense of cartelization (i.e. explicit collusion) is absent. Examples are Cournot oligopoly, and Bertrand oligopoly for differentiated products. Empirical tests Empirical studies that are designed to test the relationship between market concentration and prices are collectively known as price-concentration studies; see Weiss (1989). Typically, any study that claims to test the relationship between price and the level of market concentration is also (jointly, that is, simultaneously) testing whether the market definition (according to which market concentration is being calculated) is relevant; that is, whether the boundaries of each market is not being determined either too narrowly or too broadly so as to make the defined \\"market\\" meaningless from the point of the competitive interactions of the firms that it includes (or is made of).  Alternative definition  In economics, market concentration is a criterion that can be used to rank order various distributions of firms' shares of the total production (alternatively, total capacity or total reserves) in a market. Further examples Section 1 of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission's Horizontal Merger Guidelines is entitled \\"Market Definition, Measurement and Concentration.\\" Herfindahl index is the measure of concentration that these Guidelines state that will be used. A simple measure of market concentration is 1/N where N is the number of firms in the market. This measure of concentration ignores the dispersion among the firms' shares. It is decreasing in the number of firms and nonincreasing in the degree of symmetry between them. This measure is practically useful only if a sample of firms' market shares is believed to be random, rather than determined by the firms' inherent characteristics. Any criterion that can be used to compare or rank distributions (e.g. probability distribution, frequency distribution or size distribution) can be used as a market concentration criterion. Examples are stochastic dominance and Gini coefficient. Curry and George (1981) enlist the following \\"alternative\\" measures of concentration: (a) The mean of the first moment distribution (Niehans, 1958); Hannah and Kay (1977) call this an \\"absolute concentration\\" index: :\\\\bar{X}_1 = \\\\sum x_i^2/x_i = \\\\sum x_i H (b) The Rosenbluth (1961) index (also Hall and Tideman, 1967): :R = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sum is_i - 1} where symbol i indicates the firm's rank position. (c) Comprehensive concentration index (Horvath 1970): :CCI = s_1 + \\\\sum_{i=2}^N s_i^2(2 - s_i) where s1 is the share of the largest firm. The index is similar to 2\\\\text{H} - \\\\sum s_i^3 except that greater weight is assigned to the share of the largest firm. (d) The Pareto slope (Ijiri and Simon, 1971). If the Pareto distribution is plotted on double logarithmic scales, [then] the distribution function is linear, and its slope can be calculated if it is fitted to an observed size- distribution. (e) The Linda index (1976) :L=\\\\frac 1 {N(N-1)}\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}Q_i where Qi is the ratio between the average share of the first i firms and the average share of the remaining N - i firms. This index is designed to measure the degree of inequality between values of the size variable accounted for by various sub-samples of firms. It is also intended to define the boundary between the oligopolists within an industry and other firms. It has been used by the European Union. (f) The U Index (Davies, 1980): :U = I^{*a}N^{-1} where I^{*} is an accepted measure of inequality (in practice the coefficient of variation is suggested), a is a constant or a parameter (to be estimated empirically) and N is the number of firms. Davies (1979) suggests that a concentration index should in general depend on both N and the inequality of firms' shares. The \\"number of effective competitors\\" is the inverse of the Herfindahl index. Terrence Kavyu Muthoka defines distribution just as functionals in the Swartz space which is the space of functions with compact support and with all derivatives existing. The Media:Dirac Distribution or the Dirac function is a good example .  Real World Examples  Universal Music Group, Sony, and Warner dominate the music entertainment industry. Walt Disney, Time Warner, ViacomCBS, NBC Universal, and News Corporation combined have a 90% share of the national mass media and news outlets. Pharmaceutical market is dominated by three major players Novartis, Merck, and Pfizer. JBS/Swift, Tyson, Cargill, and National Beef combined control 80% of meat packing market. Search engine market is dominated by Google with 92% percent share. Facebook controls around 70% of social networks.

The alkene is classified as a higher olefin and alpha-olefin, meaning that the double bond is located at the alpha (primary) position, endowing this compound with higher reactivity and thus useful chemical properties. 1-Octene is one of the important linear alpha olefins in industry. It is a colourless liquid. Synthesis In industry, 1-octene is commonly manufactured by two main routes: oligomerization of ethylene and by Fischer‚ÄìTropsch synthesis followed by purification. Another route to 1-octene that has been used commercially on a small scale is dehydration of alcohols. Prior to the 1970s, 1-octene was also manufactured by thermal cracking of waxes, whereas linear internal octenes were also manufactured by chlorination/dehydrochlorination of linear alkanes. There are five commercial processes that oligomerize ethylene to 1-octene. Four of these processes produce 1-octene as a part of a wide distribution of alpha-olefins. In typical circumstances, 1-hexene content of the entire distribution of alpha-olefins ranges from about 25% of the distribution in the Ethyl (Innovene) process to about 8% of distribution in some modes of the Gulf (CP Chemicals) and Idemitsu processes. The only commercial process to isolate 1-octene from a wide mixture of C8 hydrocarbons is practiced by Sasol, a South African oil and gas and petrochemical company. For commercial purposes, Sasol employs Fischer‚ÄìTropsch synthesis to make fuels from synthesis gas derived from coal and recovers 1-octene from these fuel streams, where the initial 1-octene concentration in a narrow distillation cut may be 60%, with the remainder being vinylidenes, linear and branched internal olefins, linear and branched paraffins, alcohols, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, and aromatic hydrocarbons. In recent years, two on-purpose 1-octene technologies have been commercialised: a butadiene telomerization plant (Dow, Tarragona), and a 1-heptene to 1-octene plant based on a Fischer-Tropsch- derived C7 olefin stream (Sasol, Secunda). Sasol is currently in the engineering phase of a new 1-octene technology based on selective tetramerisation of ethylene. Applications The main use of 1-octene is as a comonomer in production of polyethylene. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) use approximately 2‚Äì4% and 8‚Äì10% of comonomers, respectively. Another significant use of 1-octene is for production of linear aldehyde via oxo synthesis (hydroformylation) to give the C9 aldehyde (nonanal). Oxidation of this aldehyde gives the short-chain fatty acid nonanoic acid. Hydrogenation of the same aldehyde gives the fatty alcohol 1-nonanol, which is used as a plasticizer.

Prior to the emergence of ISIL the town had a population of 6,000 people, after the town was liberated it remains partially populated with 800 inhabitants as of November 2018.  History  Batnaya is first mentioned in the 7th century under the name Beth Madai. The first manuscript found from the town, in the 15th century, was by a priest whose family was from Hakkari. Batnaya was attacked by the army of Nader Shah in 1743, who destroyed the village extensively and is believed to have killed half of its inhabitants. In the past Batnaya used to be famous for making matting from the reeds its people used to cultivate in the valley of al-Khoser river. Currently, some of its inhabitants are cultivating different kinds of crops while others are involved in non-agricultural trades. In 1944 the Mar Qeryaqos Church was built on the ruins of a monastery by the same name believed to have been built in the early 15th century. A second but smaller church, Mart Maryam, was built in 1966, while the church of Mar Gewargis was mentioned in an inscription dated 1745. In Batnaya are several inscriptions. One dating to 1545 by Darweesh bin Yohanan from the village of Aqreen is entitled \\"Prayers for the Dead\\". Another is a complete bible inscribed in Chaldaya by the priest Ataya bin Faraj bin Marqos of Alqosh, dating to 1586. As with all the other currently Assyrian villages that belong to the Chaldean Catholic Church, Batnaya's Assyrian Catholic population used to follow the Church of the East until the seventeenth to eighteenth century, when the efforts of the Catholic Church came to fruition and the Church of the East was divided. In early 2019 the UN planned to rehabilitate hundreds of damaged homes in the town. In June the first thirty home were restored and residents started returning home.

With over a thousand works to his name, although only about forty of these have survived to this day, he is regarded as the master of Turkish classical music. In 2012, due to the 300th anniversary of Itri's death, the UNESCO declared 2012 the \\"International Itri Year\\". Biography Many things known about him today are subject to dispute. His real name was Mustafa, and he was sometimes referred to as Buhurizade Mustafa Efendi. Itri was a major exponent of Turkish classical music. He was a very prolific composer with more than a thousand works. However, only about forty of these survived to this day, the rest being lost. It is believed that he was a Mevlevi, and composed religious music for this order. He lived through the times of five Ottoman Sultans. He became well known during the time of Mehmet IV. He sang in fasƒ±ls, which are concert programs with the same makam, in the presence of Mehmet IV. Starting from this time, he enjoyed the support of the palace for many years. He taught music in the palace Enderun school. He was also interested in gardening. It is believed that his name Itri comes from the word itir, which means pelargonium. As with most composers of his day, Itri was also a famous poet. He used poetic forms based on the classical Ottoman school of poetry (Divan), as well as those based on syllabic meters identified with folk music and poetry. Unfortunately most of his poetry has not survived to this day. He was also known for being a calligrapher.

The Chosen Eight, as their name implies, are the hunters specially selected to provide sustenance for the rest of their tribe, the Gliders. The Gliders are taller than most of the other tribes of elves on the World of Two Moons. They are magic users who choose to reside within Blue Mountain, a refuge they shaped to mimic the Palace of the High Ones. The High Ones were the first elves (actually a race of aliens) to arrive on the World of Two Moons during what‚Äôs assumed to be this world‚Äôs prehistoric period. (Elfquest, Fire and Flight, volume one) Thousands of years before the time of the Elfquest story, In order to avoid murder by the native humans, who were threatened by these strange beings, some of the High Ones escaped into the hills and took up residence within Blue Mountain. These elves became the Gliders, and they developed and maintained the use of their magical powers within the mountain‚Äôs confines under the rigid control of Winnowill, their manipulative leader.  Characteristics  The Gliders, like the other tribes of elves, possess the power to communicate telepathically, called sending. They can also levitate themselves and use this power to lift objects and propel themselves in flight. The Chosen Eight wear uniforms modeled after the plumage of birds. They ally themselves with giant hawklike birds, which they ride while hunting for prey. Weapons they typically use include small knives and spears, as well as a clawlike grasping implement. While they have a close bond with their birds, the Chosen Eight do not seem to have the kind of spiritual link with these birds that the Wolfriders have with their mounts. The Chosen Eight, like the rest of the Gliders, are pure-blooded elves. Their blood is not mingled with that of wolves like the Wolfriders. This makes the Chosen Eight immortal. The High Ones are also referred to as the Firstcomers. Winnowill initially claimed that the Gliders were the High Ones; this was a deception on her part, as Lord Voll later disclosed that his parents remembered fleeing the palace, and that he remembered seeing it as a boy. Winnowill and Voll are actually \\"second generation\\" elves, children of the High Ones. (Captives of Blue Mountain; reprints Elfquest issues 6-10)  History  The Wolfriders first encounter the Chosen Eight (prior to the introduction of the rest of the Gliders or Blue Mountain) in the story arc/graphic novel The Forbidden Grove. Strongbow, a Wolfrider, shoots down a large bird making its fledgling flight, despite warnings not to from Suntop, son of Cutter the wolf chief, a young boy elf who senses magic. This bird turns out to have been the ‚Äúbond-bird‚Äù of Kureel, one of the Chosen Eight, later revealed in Captives at Blue Mountain. The Chosen Eight then take most of the fleeing Wolfriders captive; Suntop is among those who escape. The Wolfriders are then forced into indentured servitude to the Gliders as penance for slaying the bond-bird. Strongbow is trapped in a thorny cage of shaped rock and tortured mercilessly by Winnowill, the leader of the Gliders. Cutter, the Wolfriders' chief, attempts to rescue his captive tribe members with help from his lifemate, Leetah, and his best friend, Skywise. They make it into the mountain's walls and are astonished to discover these strange new elves. Suntop's \\"magic feeling\\" alerts him to the fact that Winnowill is the \\"evil presence\\" that his mentor, Savah, warned him about when the Wolfriders left the village of Sorrow's End. During the resulting skirmish within the mountain, Winnowill dissuades the Wolfriders from fighting as she announces (falsely) that \\"We are the High Ones!\\" The Wolfriders are divided in their reactions to this news. Strongbow, still traumatized by his torture at Winnowill's hand, chooses to refuse Lord Voll's offer of hospitality within Blue Mountain and leaves the mountain with his lifemate, Moonshade, to wait in the forests below for the rest of the Wolfriders. During the Captives of Blue Mountain story arc, Leetah discovers from Winnowill that her healing gifts are actually a form of flesh-shaping, not unlike rock-shaping or tree shaping, powers demonstrated by a few elves at various times in elfin history. Skywise and the Glider Aroree become better acquainted as Skywise rides with Aroree on her giant bond-bird, the first time he had ever flown. While they make their flight, Aroree soars over a camp of humans and tosses them some new spears. The Wolfriders come to realize that the Gliders, in their arrogance, had convinced the humans that they were gods. The Gliders and the Wolfriders form an uneasy alliance for a while, until Winnowill attempts to kidnap Suntop and orders the Chosen Eight to attack the Wolfriders again. Her motive is to force them out of Blue Mountain before Lord Voll could become inspired by them to lead the Gliders from Blue Mountain to the High Ones' Palace. Leetah eventually defeats Winnowill when Winnowill is injured by Strongbow's arrow; Leetah heals her injury, only to have Winnowill slip from her grasp and step off a ledge, seemingly to her death. Lord Voll orders the Chosen Eight to transport the Wolfriders over the snow-capped mountains to the High Ones' Palace, but his bond-bird is shot down by a troll spear; Voll and his mount are both killed. The Chosen Eight recoil, reviling the Wolfriders and ending their association with them in the wake of their leader's death. They abandon the Wolfriders to the trolls' attack, under the command of King Guttlekraw (Elfquest: Quest's End, Vol. 4). The Chosen Eight and the Wolfriders do not meet again until after the Wolfriders and the Go-Backs, a snow-dwelling tribe of elves living in the Frozen Mountains far to the north of Blue Mountain, discover the lost Palace. Aroree of the Chosen Eight flees into the Forbidden Grove, where the Wolfriders had built their new holt (their home). Winnowill had sent her on a search for Preservers, the winged, web-spinning sprites that the High Ones used to preserve their bodies during their original journey to the World of Two Moons. Skywise confronts Aroree, accosting her when she comes to the area of the holt. However, Aroree, in thrall to the evil Winnowill, sees in Dewshine's cub (son) Windkin, fathered by Tyldak of the Gliders, a way to escape from Blue Mountain and Winnowill's clutches. She kidnaps Windkin and offers him to Winnowill in her place in order to leave the Chosen Eight. (Siege at Blue Mountain) Kureel of the Eight seeks to sway Aroree back into the Gliders' fold, attempting to stop her from leaving. Aroree stabs him during the resulting confrontation. The Wolfriders outwit the Chosen Eight when they send two of their human friends into Blue Mountain, posing as Winnowill's worshippers and offering themselves as servants to the Chosen Eight. The Eight are distracted with wine and then trapped in preserver cocoons while Cutter and Skywise rescue Dewshine and baby Windkin. They also free Tyldak, the winged elf, who had been bound and tortured in chains by Winnowill. The Gliders (except for a handful) and all of the Chosen Eight but Aroree are killed when Blue Mountain collapses under the weight of a multilayered structure known as the Egg. The deceased Gliders, including the seven deceased members of the Chosen Eight, find a temporary home within Rayek, the powerful Sun Folk magic user, who bonds with them telepathically. Their souls are drawn into him, vastly increasing his own powers. (Siege at Blue Mountain, Secret of Two-Edge) The presence of the souls of the Gliders within his psyche drives Rayek mad with power, and in a rage, he destroys the home of another tribe of elves, the Go-Backs. Aroree, the only surviving member of the Chosen Eight and now all but alone in the world, is forgiven by the Wolfriders for the kidnapping of Windkin, and later becomes a member of the Wolfrider tribe.

He invented a process that enabled white soap to be made and a means of using china clay to create better quality paper. He owned several china clay pits in Cornwall, and a mine at Tredegar in South Wales, and was briefly a Liberal Member of Parliament. His wife was Agnes Pochin who was a leading suffragist. Life Pochin was born on 25 May 1824 in Wigston.Pochin, Henry Davis (1824‚Äì1895), manufacturing chemist and industrialist  Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Retrieved 2018-03-08. He was the son of a yeoman farmer of Leicestershire who served an apprenticeship to James Woolley (1811‚Äì1858), a manufacturing chemist in Manchester. In 1852 he married Agnes Heap at the Unitarian Church in Manchester. In time Pochin became James Woolley's partner. Woolley died in 1858 and Pochin kept a manuscript diary of the illness, treatment and death of his partner.Wellcome Trust Library ‚Äì James Woolley (1811‚Äì1858), manufacturing chemist, Manchester: diary of Woolley's illness, treatment and dath, written by his partner Henry Davis Pochin (1824‚Äì1895). 1858. (MS.5949). On Woolley's death Pochin became the sole proprietor. Pochin is noted for two important inventions. Firstly, he developed a process for the clarification of rosin, a brown substance used to make soap, by passing steam through it so that after distillation it came out white, thus enabling the production of white soap. He sold the rights to this process to raise money to exploit his second invention, which was a process using ammonium sulfate and alumina as a low cost alternative to alumstone in the production of alum cake used in the manufacture of paper. The process required china clay, and Pochin bought several china clay mines in Cornwall for this purpose. In time H. D. Pochin & Co. became one of the three largest British producers of china clay until they were acquired in 1932 by the English China Clays along with the second largest producer, Lovering, to form English China Clays Lovering Pochin & Co. Ltd (ECLP), with both Lovering and Pochin remaining shareholders. ECLP kept this name until it was able to buy the shares from the Lovering family and Pochin family. ECLP was restructured, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of the newly formed English China Clays group. ECLP was split up into four divisions; ECC construction materials, ECC quarries, and ECC transportation, and ECC international. ECC transportation was later merged into ECC international. Later the company divested all but two of its divisions, ECC International and ECC quarries. In 2000, the English China Clays group and its subsidiaries was bought by Imetal SA, which changed its name to Imerys. Imerys has kept ECC International subsidiary as its speciality china clay producing division under that name, even though it does not use that name or division logo, which have been replaced by the Imerys name and logo. Imerys is now the world's largest china clay producer. Pochin's principal china clay works was the Gothers drying complex, near Roche, Cornwall. This consisted of a number of kilns, each served by a narrow gauge tramway, and was considered to be an extensive works in its day. The tramway was known simply as Pochin's Tramway, and ran from the Gothers works, across the Goss Moor to a loading wharf on the St Dennis Branch. The tramway was operated by a small fleet of steam locomotives known as \\"Pochin's Puffing Billies\\", carrying clay to the wharf in crude three plank wagons. Upon reaching the wharf, the clay would be loaded into standard gauge wagons. Coal for firing the kilns was transferred from standard gauge wagons into the narrow gauge tramway wagons for the return journey, the wagons were then cleaned of coal dust at Gothers before being loaded with clay for another trip. Because the crude tramway wagons had no braking mechanism, the train operators developed a novel solution that involved jamming a piece of timber between the spokes of the wheels while the train was in motion. Between 1863 and 1867, Alderman Pochin led a consortium of Manchester business men in the formation of a number of companies in the iron, steel and coal industries. The first of these, the Staveley Coal and Iron Company Limited, was also the first to be formed by David Chadwick (1821‚Äì1885) a Manchester accountant whose accounting methods in relation to capitalisation and depreciation have attracted interest even 100 years or more later.British cost accounting development: Continuity and change ‚Äì The Accounting Historians Journal, Dec 1995 etc. Pochin was elected to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1868 as one of two members of parliament for Stafford. He also held public office at times as a Deputy Lieutenant, Justice of the Peace and for two years, 1866‚Äì8, Mayor of Salford.Previous Mayors, Salford.gov.uk, Retrieved April 2016 Henry Pochin was a director of the Tredegar Iron and Coal Company, that sunk two shafts (North and South) at Pochin Colliery, Tredegar, in 1876 to a depth of ; the first coal was brought to the surface in 1881. The mine was named after Pochin's daughter, Laura, who later married Charles McLaren, the Tredegar Company chairman later created first Baron Aberconway. Between 1871 and 1876 Henry Pochin had a residence in Llandudno, North Wales at Haulfre, on the south facing landward side of the Great Orme where he was able to pursue his passion for gardening in an extensive and steeply terraced garden that since 1929 has been under the care of the local authority and is freely open to the public. In 1874 Pochin bought the Bodnant estate at Tal-y-Cafn in the Conwy Valley comprising 25 farms with the Bodnant House and over of garden where he lived in active retirement. At Bodnant, Pochin realised the superb qualities of the Dell through which the estate river ran and after first strengthening the banks to deter erosion he set about planting with great American and Oriental conifers. In 1949, Bodnant Garden was given to the National Trust.The Garden at Bodnant, Jarrold Publishing Norwich and Bodnant Garden, 2001.

Tonquin Creek drains Moat Lake and flows west into Mount Robson Provincial Park in British Columbia, and empties into the Fraser River. The Astoria River drains south and east into the Athabasca River. The Tonquin Valley leads to Tonquin Pass which cradles the Amythyst Lakes at its crest beneath the Precambrian quartzite wall of the Ramparts. The valley was named after the Pacific Fur Company ship Tonquin, destroyed in Clayoquot Sound in 1811. Recreation Within the valley there is the scenic Amethyst Lake and Moat Lake. It is a popular destination for back-country hikers, ski touring and horseback trips to the two outfitters camps on the shores of Amethyst Lake. There are also a number of backcountry campgrounds and an Alpine Club of Canada hut. The 1928 High Trip of the Sierra Club took place in this area. Among those who participated was photographer Ansel Adams and Sierra Club director William Colby. Two trails into the valley are utilized by outfitters, skiers and hikers alike. There is the Portal Creek access, and the Astoria River access trails. Unbeknownst to many is the older and unused access via the Meadow Creek trail. This trail is considered impassable as it has not been maintained for decades. Some portions of the current trail are visible in Google Earth.

Hall in The Phil Silvers Show. Early years Ford was born Paul Ford Weaver in Baltimore, Maryland. His father was described as \\"a well-to-do businessman\\" who lost his fortune when his investment in a soft drink company failed. At an early age, he showed an adept talent for performance, but was discouraged when directors thought he was tone-deaf. After attending Dartmouth College for one year, Ford was a salesman before he became an entertainer. He took his middle birth name, which was his mother's maiden name, as his stage last name. The change occurred after he failed an audition as Paul Weaver but was successful when he auditioned again as Paul Ford. Career In later years, Ford made his voice one of the most recognized of his era. His success was long in the making, and he did little acting but instead raised his family during the Great Depression. Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Public Works programs provided Ford with work, and to the day he died, he was a Democrat. He first ventured into entertainment, however, in a puppet theater project that the Works Progress Administration sponsored. Years later, he said of that opportunity: \\"I got on the puppet project of the W.P.A. and helped write and put on shows for the Federal Theater. We did puppet shows at the World's Fair in 1939 and 1940, and I served as narrator, a kind of Hoosier cornball in beard.\\" Following his experience with puppets, Ford worked as an attendant at a gas station before turning to acting for a career. His first professional acting job was in an Off-Broadway production in 1939. In 1955, Ford played the bank president in the NBC comedy series Norby. He became an \\"overnight\\" success at age 54 when he played Colonel John T. Hall opposite Phil Silvers on Silvers' The Phil Silvers Show TV show (often known as Sergeant Bilko or just Bilko). His signature role may well be the part of Mayor George Shinn, a befuddled politico in the film adaptation of the Broadway show The Music Man. Ford played the role straight and received glowing reviews. The other role he is most identified with is that of Horace Vandergelder opposite Shirley Booth in the 1958 screen version of The Matchmaker. Ford had an active career in both films and television until his retirement in the early 1970s. Despite being a respected Broadway character actor, Ford was notorious for being unable to remember his lines. This would cause difficulty forcing him and those around him to improvise. This became especially notable on The Phil Silvers Show. He appeared in the 1962‚Äì1963 season in the CBS anthology The Lloyd Bridges Show. He starred in The Baileys of Balboa, which lasted only one season (1964‚Äì1965). His stage credits include Another Part of the Forest (1946), Command Decision (1947), The Teahouse of the August Moon (1953), Whoop-Up (1958), replacing David Burns as Mayor Shinn in The Music Man (1957), A Thurber Carnival (1960), Never Too Late (1962), 3 Bags Full (1966), and What Did We Do Wrong? (1967). Most actors who worked with Ford claimed he was a kindly and very funny man. He was known for his quotes about the Depression in later years, including, \\"My kids used to think everyone lived on peanut butter sandwiches.\\" His final role prior to his death was a Washington doctor in Richard.

For his role in My Life as a Dog he won the award for Best Actor at the 21st Guldbagge Awards. As of 2014, Glanzelius currently works as an executive producer at Swedish TV4 AB.Google Translate On March 26, 2015, Glanzelius was announced the new channel manager for TV4 Play. At the same time, he will retain his role as deputy channel director for TV4 Group.Anton Glanzelius new channel manager for TV4 PlayAnton Glanzelius receive new service on TV4Anton Glanzelius becomes the new channel manager for TV4 Play. Early life Glanzelius was born in Copenhagen to father Ingmar Glanzelius, a journalist and a freelance music critic, and mother Margita Ahlin, an actress and a director. Glanzelius also has an older brother, Jacob. His maternal grandfather was fellow actor Harry Ahlin. He grew up in Gothenburg, Sweden. Glanzelius is of Danish descent from his father's side. Acting career At the age of eight, Glanzelius got his first role in a television movie, appeared as a messenger in a theatrical production of Antigone that starred his mother, and appeared four times on a Swedish television series. =My Life as a Dog and recognition= Film director Lasse Hallstr√∂m discovered Glanzelius from the television series and asked him to try out for the lead role of Ingemar of the film, My Life as a Dog, along with about 1,000 other boys. At first, Glanzelius was told that he was too young and too small for the part. One week later, however, he received another call. \\"They said they couldn't find anyone better to do it than me,\\" Glanzelius says. \\"I thought it would be fun and exciting. And it was. But we worked from morning to the night for 80 days. It was very hard. I was happy to get even a 5-minute break.\\" Glanzelius faced a few challenges when portraying Ingemar, such as having to spill a glass of milk on his face in one scene, which took 26 takes to film, as well as having to lose in a boxing match with an older tomboy character in another scene. Film director Hallstr√∂m described Glanzelius, who was 11 at the time of filming, as \\"very intuitive. It was like working with an adult.\\" As for Glanzelius on what eventually became his well- known role, he has been quoted saying, \\"I just play(ed) myself.\\" In 1985, Glanzelius became the youngest person ever to win the Swedish Film Critics Award for Best Actor, Sweden's equivalent to the Oscar for the same category, for his portrayal of Ingemar in My Life as a Dog. My Life as Dog was a surprise hit in the United States, an achievement that was considered rare and unheard of to occur for subtitled foreign films at the time of its release. American critics praised Glanzelius for his performance in the film, such Hall Hinson of The Washington Post describing him as \\"a pint-size Jack Nicholson, with devilish eyebrows that he knows how to use,\\" and Vincent Canby of The New York Times who applauded him for his \\"firm and wise performance.\\" The movie's success in the U.S. led Glanzelius to visit the country for the first time in 1987, as a nine-city, two-week tour accompanied with his parents. Cities he traveled into included Washington and Los Angeles. When he visited New York City, Sue Simmons got to interview Glanzelius.Anton Glanzelius interview 1987 - My Life as a Dog on YouTube \\"In the beginning everybody recognized me from the movie,\\" he says. \\"Many would even point at me with their whole arm outstretched and talk about me very loud. I would have to look at the ground. That was not fun.\\" He says he had no idea he was so popular. Glanzelius was in talks to reprise his role in a now-shelved English-language sequel to the film. Personal life Glanzelius is fluent in Swedish and English. He is also a fan of Eddie Murphy, Rod Stewart, Bill Cosby and Bruce Springsteen. Glanzelius also plays ice hockey and the piano. =Aspiration for soccer playing= Despite his stardom from My Life as a Dog, Glanzelius has made it clear that he has no apparent interest in pontificating about himself or the craft of acting. \\"Soccer is my number one priority,\\" he says. \\"I hope to be a pro player in Brazil someday. I really love to play, and I think I can be what I want to be. It will be a natural for me.\\" \\"Anton is not obsessed with the idea of having a career in movies, thank God,\\" his father said. \\"He loved working on the film and he's proud of his performance, but we've tried not to make too much of the success he's had. If we did, then everything he did for the rest of his life would measure against it as a failure. His first love is sports, and we encourage him in that because it provides something of a buffer between him and all this glamour.\\" \\"I don't wish for a dream part or anything like that,\\" Glanzelius says. \\"I want to be a professional soccer player in Brazil.\\" At the time of his recognition, Glanzelius was also a player of his hometown's junior soccer team. He said he was ranked among the 30 best soccer players in Gothenborg, and had planned to travel to Brazil after he completed school. \\"If I suffered an injury and couldn't play, I might act in another movie,\\" he concedes. Glanzelius also stated that he does not care if he ever does another movie. Nonetheless, his dream of being a soccer player was never fulfilled. =Michael Jackson= At first, Glanzelius had never even heard of Michael Jackson until he received a phone call at his parents' home in Gothenburg from Jackson himself. While he was in Los Angeles in 1987, Glanzelius had the chance to meet Jackson, who personally invited him to his home after seeing My Life as a Dog twice. \\"Michael Jackson's house was so big and beautiful,\\" Glanzelius says. \\"And he was very friendly. I liked him very much, but he was very shy.\\" Glanzelius and his mother visited the Hayvenhurst estate, but only got to spend a couple of hours with Jackson. Glanzelius described Jackson as \\"very polite\\" but also very quiet. Glanzelius also got to meet and shake hands with Jackson's pet chimpanzee Bubbles. A year later, Glanzelius got to spend a day with Jackson at the amusement park, Liseberg.One Day at Liseberg The park's management closed Liseberg to the public for the day so that Glanzelius and Jackson would have the entire place to themselves, riding the latter's favorite roller coaster 12 times and spending an hour driving bumper cars. Glanzelius spent that night in Jackson's hotel room; in recent years, Glanzelius confirmed there was not the slightest hint of a sexual advance as a respect to Jackson's reputation. Jackson kept in contact with Glanzelius afterward until the Jordan Chandler scandal broke out. Glanzelius was reportedly shocked when he found out about the death of Michael Jackson in 2009.Michael Jackson A day after Jackson's death, Glanzelius was interviewed by TV4 News on his experiences with Jackson.Glanzelius minns v√§nnen Michael Jackson Interview in Swedish References Bibliography * Holmstrom, John.

While historically its use in English was restricted to discussions of the political history of Rome, the beginning of phenomenological philosophy in the 20th century expanded the use of the word. In ancient Rome, auctoritas referred to the general level of prestige a person had in Roman society, and, as a consequence, his clout, influence, and ability to rally support around his will. Auctoritas was not merely political, however; it had a numinous content and symbolized the mysterious \\"power of command\\" of heroic Roman figures. Noble women could also achieve a degree of auctoritas. For example, the wives, sisters, and mothers of the Julio- Claudians had immense influence on society, the masses, and the political apparatus. Their auctoritas was exercised less overtly than their male counterparts due to Roman societal norms, but they were powerful nonetheless. Etymology and origin According to French linguist Emile Benveniste, auctor (which also gives us English \\"author\\") is derived from Latin auge≈ç (\\"to augment\\", \\"to enlarge\\", \\"to enrich\\"). The auctor is \\"is qui auget\\", the one who augments the act or the juridical situation of another.J. B. Greenough disputes this etymology of auctor - but not the sense of foundation and augmentation - in \\"Latin Etymologies\\", Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, Vol. 4, 1893. Arguably, Benveniste defended that Latin \\"auctoritas\\" was based on a divine conception of power and not on the individual that happened to the position of authority. Auctor in the sense of \\"author\\", comes from auctor as founder or, one might say, \\"planter-cultivator\\". Similarly, auctoritas refers to rightful ownership, based on one's having \\"produced\\" or homesteaded the article of property in question - more in the sense of \\"sponsored\\" or \\"acquired\\" than \\"manufactured\\". This auctoritas would, for example, persist through an usucapio of ill-gotten or abandoned property. Political meaning in ancient Rome Politically, the Roman Senate's authority (auctoritas patrum) was connected to auctoritas, not to be confused with potestas or imperium, which were held by the magistrates or the people. In this context, auctoritas could be defined as the juridical power to authorize some other act. The 19th-century classicist Theodor Mommsen describes the \\"force\\" of auctoritas as \\"more than advice and less than command, an advice which one may not ignore.\\" Cicero says of power and authority, \\"Cum potestas in populo auctoritas in senatu sit.\\" (\\"While power resides in the people, authority rests with the Senate.\\")De leg. 3. 28 In the private domain, those under tutelage (guardianship), such as women and minors, were similarly obliged to seek the sanction of their tutors (\\"protectors\\") for certain actions. Thus, auctoritas characterizes the auctor: The pater familias authorizes ‚Äì that is, validates and legitimates ‚Äì his son's wedding in prostate. In this way, auctoritas might function as a kind of \\"passive counsel\\", much as, for example, a scholarly authority. Traditional imperial Roman exception to declare any legalistic concept and rule of law null and overrule prior decision making, in some military and political circumstances overrule fundamental body of law within a constitution, whether it is or isn't codified. Imperial prerogative is to protect the state from harm and its peoples. During the overruling of Roman Constitution body of fundamental laws and rule of law, a dictator may be chosen by the senate in Imperial Rome. =Auctoritas principis= After the fall of the Republic, during the days of the Roman Empire, the Emperor had the title of princeps (\\"first citizen\\" of Rome) and held the auctoritas principis ‚Äì the supreme moral authority ‚Äì in conjunction with the imperium and potestas ‚Äì the military, judiciary and administrative powers. That is to say, there is a non-committal to a separation of powers, some civil rights, constitutionalism, codified constitutional state and legalist concept of law. Middle Ages The notion of auctoritas was often invoked by the papacy during the Middle Ages, in order to secure the temporal power of the Pope. Innocent III most famously invoked auctoritas in order to depose kings and emperors and to try to establish a papal theocracy.  Hannah Arendt  Hannah Arendt considered auctoritas a reference to founding acts as the source of political authority in ancient Rome. She took foundation to include (as auge≈ç suggests), the continuous conservation and increase of principles handed down from \\"the beginning\\" (see also pietas). According to Arendt, this source of authority was rediscovered in the course of the 18th-century American Revolution (see \\"United States of America\\" under Founding Fathers), as an alternative to an intervening Western tradition of absolutism, claiming absolute authority, as from God (see Divine Right of Kings), and later from Nature, Reason, History, and even, as in the French Revolution, Revolution itself (see La Terreur). Arendt views a crisis of authority as common to both the American and French Revolutions, and the response to that crisis a key factor in the relative success of the former and failure of the latter.Hannah Arendt, On Revolution, Chapter 5, Section 2. (1965) Arendt further considered the sense of auctor and auctoritas in various Latin idioms, and the fact that auctor was used in contradistinction to ‚Äì and (at least by Pliny) held in higher esteem than ‚Äì artifices, the artisans to whom it might fall to \\"merely\\" build up or implement the author-founder's vision and design.Hannah Arendt, Between Past and Future, Chapter 3, Section IV.

In Hennessey SH-51 meets US-81 before continuing eastward. later, it meets SH-74 north of Crescent. to the east, it shares a brief concurrency with US-77; later it has an interchange at Interstate 35 at Exit 174. =I-35 to Tulsa= After crossing I-35, SH-51 becomes a multilane highway and a major corridor linking I-35 to Stillwater, the home of Oklahoma State University. Along this stretch is an intersection with SH-86. When SH-51 reaches Stillwater, it meets US-177. Continuing east from Stillwater, the road returns to a two-lane highway after sharing a concurrency with SH-108 and intersects with SH-18 later. {{convert4mikmspell=In} east of this, it passes through Yale, Oklahoma before crossing SH-99. It becomes a multilane highway again after SH-48. It turns into the \\"Mannford Freeway\\" before passing through the small towns of Mannford and Lotsee on its way toward the Tulsa area. =Tulsa and beyond= In Sand Springs, SH-51 crosses the Arkansas River with SH-97 before merging onto the Sand Springs Expressway (US-412/US-64). When this freeway ends at I-244 near downtown Tulsa, SH-51 merges onto I-244 southbound only to exit later, where it runs concurrent with US-64/US-75. This freeway is actually Interstate 444, but the route is not signed as such. After one more mile, SH-51 leaves the interstate with US-64 and becomes the Broken Arrow Expressway, a freeway running northwest‚Äìsoutheast through Tulsa which is known as \\"The BA\\" by locals and local media. US-64 leaves the freeway as a concurrency with US-169 southbound. Later, SH-51 will exit the freeway and become a four-lane highway toward Coweta. The mainline freeway becomes the Muskogee Turnpike. At Coweta, SH-51 turns back east after heading southeast through the Tulsa area. After crossing the Muskogee Turnpike again and bridging the Verdigris River the highway soon enters Wagoner, where it junctions with US-69. Returning once again to a 2-lane road, Highway 51 crosses Ft. Gibson Lake and the town of Hulbert. later, it passes through Tahlequah, where it has a brief concurrency with US-62/SH-10. After spitting with these highways, it heads southeast toward Stilwell, Oklahoma, running concurrent with US-59 for a mile on the way. After leaving Stilwell it provides access to Adair State Park, and then crosses the Arkansas line becoming Arkansas Highway 244, which quickly connects to Arkansas Highway 59. History SH-51 was originally commissioned on June 1, 1927 as a connector from Stilwell to Eldon at SH-27 (present-day US-62). By 1928, it had been extended to Tulsa.Oklahoma Department of Transportation. 1928 Highway Map. On June 15, 1933, it was extended to the east to the Arkansas state line, where it became AR-45. ODOT extended SH-51 west to Stillwater and Perry (via a segment of roadway currently serving as US-177).Oklahoma Department of Transportation. 1935 Highway Map. On March 18, 1935, the section from Stillwater to Perry was rescinded and SH-51 was extended to SH-8 at Okeene.Oklahoma Department of Transportation 1937 Highway Map It was then extended to Seiling on October 18, 1938. On March 23, 1943, it was extended to the Texas state line by a concurrency with US-60. The Broken Arrow Expressway was built in the early 1960s and opened in 1964. It was not, however, officially named the Broken Arrow Expressway until July 6, 1999 by H.B. 1455. The steel truss bridge carrying SH-51 across Stillwater Creek west of Stillwater, once considered the gateway into the city, was removed on March 25, 2008. In a first for the state of Oklahoma, the bridge, originally built in 1936, was sold to Payne County for $200,000 and transferred to a county road east of Stillwater, where it was installed over Council Creek. Major intersections Spurs Like many in the Oklahoma state highway system, SH-51 has short spurs branching from it that bear the \\"51\\" number with a lettered suffix: * SH-51A {) runs from SH-58 northeast of Canton to SH-8 near Roman Nose State Park. It is the longest suffixed highway in the system . * SH-51B {) connects Coweta to US-69 north of Muskogee.

Along with Lili St. Cyr, Sally Rand, and Blaze Starr, she was one of the best-known burlesque performers of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Her career as an exotic dancer spanned more than 60 years and she was still performing in the early 21st century. Early life Tempest Storm was born Annie Blanche Banks on February 29, 1928 in Eastman, Georgia. She left school in seventh grade, and in 2016, she recalled that she had been sexually abused at that approximate time in her life. At 14, she worked as a waitress in Columbus, Georgia, where she quickly married a U.S. Marine in order to emancipate herself from her parents, and had the marriage annulled after 24 hours. At 15, she married a Columbus shoe salesman, whose sister worked with her at a hosiery mill. Storm said in a 1968 interview with film reviewer Roger Ebert that after six months in that marriage, \\"I just left one day. I still had it in my mind to go to Hollywood. I couldn't get it out of my system.\\" Burlesque career =Beginnings= In Los Angeles circa 1945 at age 17, Storm worked as a carhop waitress at Simon's Drive-In and then as a cocktail waitress, though still underage. A patron suggested she consider striptease as a profession, and arranged an audition with Follies Theater talent manager Lillian Hunt. Three weeks after being hired as a chorus dancer at $40 a week (approximately $570 in 2020 dollars), Storm accepted a promotion to $60 (approximately $855 in 2020 dollars)https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/ as a stripper. A week afterward, she recalled in 1968, Hunt said she needed a stage name: Annie Blanche Banks legally changed her name to Tempest Storm in 1957, one of the few strippers to have done so. =Feature performer, model, and actress= Tempest Storm as seen in the 1955 movie Teaserama Storm was a regular performer for many years at El Rey, a burlesque theater in Oakland, California, as well as at clubs around the United States, including in Las Vegas. She was featured in numerous men's magazines and burlesque movies, including French Peep Show (1950), Paris After Midnight (1951), Striptease Girl (1952), Teaserama (1955), and Buxom Beautease (1956). In 1953, she moved to Portland, Oregon, and worked at the Star Theater. A few months later she moved to the Capital Theater down the street after her then-husband, John Becker, bought it. The owner of the Star then brought Becker's ex-wife, and rival burlesque star, Arabelle Andre to the Star to perform as \\"John's Other Wife\\". This sparked a \\"burlesque war\\" that made it into the pages of Life magazine on November 30, 1953. In 1954, Storm was restrained from billing herself as the \\"$50,000 Hollywood Treasure Chest\\" following a successful suit brought by the \\"Treasure Chest Girl\\" Evelyn West. Retirement Storm told her life story to writer Bill Boyd, whose transcriptions of her dictations formed the 1987 book Tempest Storm: The Lady Is a Vamp. She was inducted into the Burlesque Hall of Fame, where one of her G-strings is part of the museum's display. Storm officially retired from regular performance in 1995 at the age of 67, but has done occasional stage performances since. In 1999, she stripped in San Francisco's O'Farrell Theatre to mark the club's 30-year anniversary. Mayor Willie Brown declared a \\"Tempest Storm Day\\" in her honor. She also performed at the annual Burlesque Hall of Fame Pageant events at least through 2010. She appears in the 2016 Nimisha Mukerji's documentary film Tempest Storm. Personal life As of at least 2008, Storm resided in Las Vegas, Nevada. She was married four times, once to Herb Jeffries an actor of film and television as well as a popular music and jazz singer-songwriter, known for his baritone voice, with whom she had a daughter.

As of the 2010 census, its population was 3,358. History Originally conceived as a respite from the city to be used in the Spring and Summer by urbanites occupying vacation cottages. Shannondale is nestled between the Shenandoah River and the Appalachian Trail on the western slope of the Blue Ridge Mountain. The name Shannondale first appears in public records in January 1740. It referred to a parcel conveyed by Lord Thomas Fairfax to his nephew William Fairfax which contained the once world-renowned spa and resort, Shannondale Springs. The modern Shannondale Community in Jefferson County was established in the mid-1950s by Charles M. Johnson, an engineer and real estate broker. He realized the potential of the property surrounding the Shannondale Springs as a retreat for residents of the Baltimore and Washington area. He invited people to come and enjoy the beauty of the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Shenandoah River. In 1955, the first road was built in the development then consisting of 2500 acres (10 km). Three years later, an Adirondack styled lodge, bath house, as well as an Olympic- sized swimming pool had been constructed, in addition to the recreational and camping facilities along the river. During that period, many summer vacation homes were built and more than of rugged road was put into use. Over time, the developer acquired more than making Shannondale arguably the largest subdivision in the State of West Virginia (in surface area). In 1961, work commenced on an earthen dam to impound a lake adjacent to and partially surrounding the clubhouse and pool. When it was completed, the lake was the largest in the state owned by a private entity. Building and membership in the community club (membership was concomitant with the purchase of development property) increased dramatically with the lake's completion. By 1970, Shannondale consisted of more than 500 homes, many of which were converted to full-time residences, and over of roads. C. M. Johnson remains one of the few developers of \\"Shannondale style\\" communities who delivered what was promised to its membership. The club relinquished its private status in 1972 and was bought by a consortium of members in 1978. As a result of changing demographics and the loss of operating capital from land sales, the operation never regained the luster of the years of the late 1950s and 1960s. The club is now privately owned and operated as The Mountain Lake Club. The Lodge (formerly the Clubhouse) was destroyed by a tragic fire on June 19, 2003. The investigation into the cause of the conflagration has stalled, likely for good. The owners lack of adequate insurance (30k on a structure valued at 1.5M) virtually guarantees the club house will never be re-built. In fact, the area is now considered Historic Ruins and is marketed as a space for parties, weddings, or other events. The Lake House was subsequently renovated and now provides the residents and the public a means of accessing the lake for fishing, swimming, etc. The surrounding community now consists of more than 1200 homes, most of which are inhabited on a full-time basis. The over of roads present are now maintained by the State of West Virginia.

History =1960s and 70s= Weekday cartoons began as far back as the early 1960s on commercial independent stations in the major U.S. television markets. On such stations, cartoon blocks would occupy the 7-9 a.m. and the 3-5 p.m. time periods, with some stations (such as WKBD- TV and WXON (now WMYD) in Detroit) running cartoons from 6-9 a.m. and 2-5 p.m. In smaller markets, network affiliates sometimes filled the 3 or 4 p.m. hour with such programming. In the 1970s, additional independent stations signed on running such programming (such as WUAB in Cleveland, Ohio; WXNE-TV (now WFXT) in Boston, Massachusetts; WKBS-TV, WTAF-TV (now WTXF-TV) and WPHL-TV in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). The programs were distributed on various television stations (many of which were independent stations) through broadcast syndication. A number of these weekday cartoons, especially the early ones such as Colonel Bleep, Batfink and Clutch Cargo, were serials that aired in daily, five-minute segments (as opposed to the standard half-hour format typical of most other cartoons today). A glut of such shows were produced in the late 1950s and through the 1960s, then syndicated continuously for the next two decades. These programs were usually distributed to local stations to air within their locally produced children's program showcases ‚Äì which in addition to cartoon shorts, also included games, locally produced or franchised costumed characters (the best known example being Bozo the Clown), and entertainment to form a variety show. This program model slowly died out during the 1980s. =1980s= In the 1980s, independent stations signed on in many mid-sized and small markets. This market was meant for made-for- television cartoons which had grown as a result. Many of these stations started running cartoon blocks on weekdays as early as 6 in the morning and as early as 2 in the afternoon. There were some stations that had aired cartoons as late as 6 p.m. on weekdays. Most large and mid-sized markets had at least two local stations running such programming in the 6 to 9 a.m. and the 2:30 to 5 p.m. timeslots. Some markets had as many as three. Traditionally, the local stations had been airing reruns of either old theatrical cartoons or TV cartoons produced for the nationwide channels. However, this was soon to change as producers realized the potential of selling their cartoons directly to the independent stations. The first cartoon series to be produced for first-run syndication were He-Man and the Masters of the Universe and Inspector Gadget, both premiering with 65 half-hour episodes in the fall of 1983. The 1981 deregulation of children's programming made it permissible for animated series to be used to promote toylines and merchandise, and the many series that were created as a result would come to define much of the landscape of mid-1980s children's cartoons. He-Man and the Masters of the Universe kickstarted this trend, and was followed in subsequent years by properties such as G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, The Transformers, ThunderCats, My Little Pony, and Voltron. The Children's Television Act of 1990 was instrumental in ending this practice and setting limits to the amount of advertising time which were allocated to children's programs. Currently, any advertisement for a tie-in product within the show, elsewise the entire program will be classified automatically as a violating half-hour program length commercial according to the FCC's definition, even if one second of a show's character or reference is seen in an advertisement; this clause in Children's Television Act puts the station at risk of paying large fines should the program violate this rule. In 1987, The Walt Disney Company tried its luck at syndication, through its animation production unit Walt Disney Television Animation; DuckTales debuted that September, experiencing major success and eventually lasting for 100 episodes. The success of DuckTales paved the way for a second series two years later, Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers. In 1989, the two shows aired together as part of a syndicated daily block called The Disney Afternoon. In 1991, Disney added another hour to the block; The Disney Afternoon ran until August 29, 1997, when it was replaced by an unnamed block on September 1, 1997, until 1999, which was then replaced by Disney's One Too (a spinoff of ABC Saturday morning block Disney's One Saturday Morning) - and Disney's One Too had only lasted for four years on UPN and syndication, until it had died in 2003. Since then, there are only a handful of local networks in the United States for ABC that broadcast children's programming. Otherwise, it has been replaced by reality shows, court shows, tabloid television, talk shows, and among other programming which are meant for adults. =1990s= In 1990, Fox began running a weekday afternoon cartoon called Peter Pan and the Pirates. In 1991, the network added another hour of children's programming; this block would be known as Fox Kids. In some markets, Fox stations ran one show in the morning hours and the other two on weekday afternoons, while other stations carried the entire block in the mid-afternoon hours only. In 1992, Fox Kids added Warner Bros.-produced cartoons (some of which were previously in syndication), such as: Batman: The Animated Series, Merrie Melodies reruns, Tiny Toon Adventures, and Tom and Jerry Kids Show to its schedule. Fox stations also carried other syndicated cartoons in addition to those offered by the Fox Kids weekday block, while independent stations aired Disney-produced cartoons, including The Disney Afternoon block, and other syndicated animated series. By this point, many markets had three independent stations running these animated programs. In 1993, Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers premiered on Fox. By this point, the Fox Kids block had expanded to three hours in length. After Fox signed an affiliation agreement with New World Communications to switch several ABC, CBS and NBC-affiliated stations to the network in 1994, the network's new affiliates under New World opted to decline carriage of the Fox Kids lineups, replacing them either with talk and reality shows or additional local newscasts. In the affected markets, the local rights to Fox Kids programming went to an independent station, and eventually an affiliate of either The WB or UPN. The popularity of the weekday cartoon lineup increased from the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s. The upstart minor network, The WB, launched Kids' WB, in September 1995, which had initially carried an afternoon block of animated series. At that point, shows such as Tiny Toon Adventures that featured Looney Tunes and other classic Warner Bros. animated characters migrated from Fox Kids to Kids' WB. The weekday Kids' WB block initially ran for one hour, before expanding to three hours in late 1996 ‚Äì two hours in the afternoon and one hour in the morning. By that point, The Disney Afternoon was airing largely on UPN affiliates, along with some WB and Fox stations. =Decline= In 1996, the United States Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 ‚Äì which was signed into law by then-President Bill Clinton; among the changes to broadcast regulation incurred by the passage of the law included the relaxing of radio and television ownership limits, and it would also regulate children's television substantially. All broadcast television stations would be required to air three hours of educational and informative (\\"E/I\\") children's programming on a weekly basis. With a few exceptions; however, the weekday cartoons were then not considered to meet the requirements set by the federal mandates. The Federal Communications Commission also placed new regulations on advertising content, making selling commercial time during entertainment-based children's programming difficult on over-the-air stations (cable channels, in comparison, would not face the same stringent regulations). The decline of the weekday cartoons began in 1997, as the FCC's new regulations on children's programming resulted in complaints from local stations regarding the ability to make airing cartoons financially viable. Regardless of the new regulations, UPN attempted to run a teen sitcom block in 1997. It only lasted one year. Warner Bros. would stop syndicating its vintage theatrical and made-for-TV cartoons to local stations that year, relegating them to cable television. The WB, though, continued to air the Kids' WB block and commissioned the daily cartoon Histeria! to meet the E/I guidelines. Starting in 1998, some UPN- and WB- affiliated stations would scale back their reliance on syndicated cartoons in morning timeslots in favor of airing family sitcoms, weekday morning local newscasts, and/or court, talk or reality series; many Fox affiliates also started running morning newscasts around this time. The Disney Afternoon ended its run in syndication, in September 1999. Disney would then enter into a time-lease agreement with UPN, replacing the UPN Kids block (which debuted in 1995) with Disney's One Too. Disney's One Saturday Morning was on from 1997 until 2002, which it was replaced by ABC Kids - however, ABC Kids had run until August 27, 2011; when it was replaced by a teen-oriented block ran and operated by Litton Entertainment entitled \\"Litton's Weekend Adventure,\\" which is a block that is family-oriented. Still, there was a decent number of cartoons that were available in syndication in the 1990s. And in 1999, Fox Kids trimmed its weekday block to two hours while adding The Magic School Bus, which occupied an hour of the lineup to meet the E/I quotas for its local stations. 2000s Beginning in 2000, an increasing number of television stations stopped airing cartoons on weekday mornings and/or afternoons. By now, UPN's stations mainly ran cartoons through the Disney's One Too block. Some WB and UPN stations continued running an hour or so of syndicated cartoons each weekday. Fox affiliates for the most part had used the morning time period to run local newscasts or infomercials and only ran children's programs during the afternoon hours. Some Fox affiliates began dropping the afternoon block; in contrast, UPN, WB and independent stations ran their children's programs only either during the morning or afternoon time slots. In 2001, the Kids' WB block was trimmed down to two hours, removing the one-hour morning block altogether. Syndicated cartoons started to lack station clearances. Fox also ended its weekday afternoon Fox Kids block at the end of that year, with the Fox stations that had been carrying the network's children's block replacing it with talk and reality shows. By 2002, most UPN stations ran Disney's One Too from 7 to 9 a.m. or from 3 to 5 p.m., while WB stations ran Kids' WB from 3 to 5 p.m. In most of these television markets, these were the only cartoons available on local television stations. Some stations ran a syndicated cartoon or a live action program to meet the E/I guidelines that were necessary. Still, stations lost revenue running such programs. On August 29, 2003, UPN discontinued the Disney's One Too block after it chose not to renew its contract with Disney, resulting in the network dropping children's programming entirely. This had left Kids' WB as the only children's program block to air weekdays on broadcast network television. UPN- affiliated stations owned by Fox, as well as UPN's parent company, Viacom, continued to run cartoons syndicated by DiC Entertainment (which were also syndicated to, and contracted out by other minor network affiliates and independent stations), for two hours each weekday in the 7 to 9 a.m. timeslot. The majority of UPN affiliates still ran only one children's program per day, if that. By 2003, The Daily Buzz, a three-hour syndicated morning news and lifestyle program, would replace weekday morning cartoons on WB- and UPN- affiliated stations in certain markets. In 2005, then Fox-owned UPN stations decreased weekday cartoons to one hour. In January 2006, The WB network's Kids' WB block was relegated to Saturday mornings only after the conclusion of their weekday cartoon block on December 30, 2005, which had replaced the two hours of network programming time on weekday afternoons with Daytime WB, a two-hour block of sitcom and drama reruns; which continued after The WB ceased operations (along with UPN) in September 2006, and were replaced by The CW (owned by both networks' respective parents, Time Warner and CBS Corporation) with that block being renamed The CW Daytime. That fall, Fox's UPN affiliates, which became owned-and-operated stations of the News Corporation-owned MyNetworkTV, dropped cartoons from their weekday schedules, with some stations only running an educational children's program each day to meet E/I requirements. 2010s By the start of the 2010s, the traditional entertainment-based variety of children's programs that had been popular for years had vanished from broadcast television, which was now being replaced by mostly unscripted (and less profitable) E/I-compliant programs; however, the decreasing number of more entertainment-based children's shows - due largely to tighter regulations on educational and advertising content has led to a substantial erosion in the audience for children's programs on commercial broadcast television overall due to its limited creative options for producers. The weekday time periods that were traditionally reserved for children's programming are now ceded to courtroom-based litigation shows, talk shows, reality series, tabloid shows, newsmagazines or off-network syndicated reruns of network television programs. Many of these local stations still have to air a bare minimum of the weekly three-hour requirement of E/I rated programming that was be reported by the federal government to qualify for their license; mostly in the early morning periods (on weekdays, this is most commonly between 7 and 9 a.m.), or once-a-week on Saturday mornings just to have the bare minimum of content that needs to be set. Or, the local networks air these specific programming when children have no realistic ability to watch the programming presented to them, because they're at a timeslot when they're at school, an example of working to the rule or at worst malicious compliance. (E/I regulations prohibit airing the shows at times when children are asleep; however, this regulation also previously prohibited shows from counting towards E/I if they air before school in most jurisdictions, but it does not prohibit airing them while they are on the school bus or at school. In July 2019, the FCC revised that rule and opened up the 6 a.m. hour to allow E/I programs to be shown in that slot.) PBS, which has historically carried educational children's programming as part of its lineup for several decades prior to it being mandated, airs a variety of children's programming from 6 a.m. to approximately 2 p.m. local time (the time periods ceded to children's programs vary between the network's member stations). Cable television channels specializing in children's programming such as Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney Channel as well as on demand streaming and download services such as Netflix, Hulu, iTunes and Amazon Video, RedBox, television video on demand services and other video rental outlets that also provide alternative ways of distributing children's programming at any time of day or week, without restrictions placed on such programming that an FCC-licensed broadcast station must honor to stay in business or the need for advertising to fund it. KidsClick was an attempt by Sinclair Broadcast Group, one of the United States' largest owners of broadcast television stations, to re- establish a market for entertainment-based children's programming and cartoons on broadcast television.http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sinclair-to- launch-kidsclick-multiplatform-programming-block-for-children-300449572.html Launching July 1, 2017, KidsClick was carried on stations owned by Sinclair and by This TV, as Sinclair was attempting to purchase This TV's parent company Tribune Media at the time (when the deal collapsed amid antitrust concerns, KidsClick moved to TBD, already owned by Sinclair in July 2018). It consisted mostly of rerun and imported programming from the past decade, none of which had any educational content. KidsClick ended its run March 31, 2019, 21 months after its launch. =Cable television= Numerous early cable networks that began in the 1970s and 1980s followed a similar full-service approach to their programming to their broadcast counterparts; this included children's programming blocks, both on weekdays and Saturday mornings. The number of cable channels began to increase rapidly in the 1990s, allowing the diverse full-service networks to split their programming onto specialized networks. In the fall of 1996, the USA Network discontinued its long-running animation block, the USA Cartoon Express; its sister block, the USA Action Extreme Team, which began in 1995, continued until 1998. TNT followed in the fall of 1998, replacing its cartoons with drama series; TBS (as well as its then-Atlanta parent station WTBS) also followed suit in the fall of 1999 to focus on sitcoms (in those cases, it was specifically to direct viewers to co- owned Cartoon Network and later, Boomerang). In September 2006, ABC Family dropped its Jetix lineup, making it exclusive to Toon Disney. \\"Ready Set Learn\\" ended its run on TLC in 2008 and became exclusive only to Discovery Kids. Also, in 2014, Disney Channel phased out their weekday cartoons, choosing to exclusively focus on its live-action sitcoms geared towards teen audiences. Today, weekday cartoons are relegated to basic cable networks such as Nickelodeon and Disney Channel for much of the day; along with educational and family-oriented programs (as well as educational-oriented networks such as Universal Kids); and Cartoon Network airs children's programming until 8 p.m. Eastern Time, when the network switches to the teen- and adult-oriented block Adult Swim, from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. Eastern Time. Other channels focusing on children's programs that are available through digital cable as well as satellite television that feature animated series on weekdays include Boomerang (a spin-off of Cartoon Network, which runs primarily classic cartoons); Disney XD (which airs a mixture of cartoons and live action series); Nicktoons (a channel that is dedicated spin off from Nickelodeons, which is featuring that network's original animated programs as well as series exclusive to Nicktoons); and educational-oriented channels such as Universal Kids, Disney Junior and Nick Jr. Current Since The WB dropped its weekday block on December 30, 2005, there has not been any other major American commercial broadcast network that has aired animated series on weekdays (or children's programming for that matter, other than that was acquired by their local affiliates). PBS is the only network that still runs weekday animated series, but it is a non-commercial network. Neither The CW nor MyNetworkTV have aired (much) cartoons on weekdays - aside from early morning, or rules given from the E/I rule, or any of the Big Three television networks (ABC, NBC and CBS), most of which have opted to lease out children's programming time to other production companies. Other cable networks specializing in family- oriented and children's programming have similarly cut back on animated series on weekdays, though nowhere near the level of that done by broadcast television in the 1980s and 1990s. Even if they were to air such programming, they would have to air it at times in which children are not even awake (5 a.m.-7 a.m.), or they air it directly when they are in school in the morning (7am-9am), and only on certain channels and on local affiliates which choose to opt for cartoons; however - if they have to air E/I programming because of the federal government's rule on the minimal number of hours that are needed and required. Even if they were to have afternoon programming from the 3pm-5pm, or 2pm-4pm time slots, they will still need to be required to program E/I programming just as in the morning time slots, or on every network that has cartoons. In September 2006, Ion Television launched Qubo, which was a three-hour block of programming (and accompanying digital multicast channel) that originally aired on Wednesday through Friday afternoons ‚Äì the E/I-compliant block has since moved to other time periods, and since settling on Friday mornings (airing from 8:00 to 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time, a time period during which most children are in school), in October 2012. However, on November 1, 2008, This TV launched airing a daily children's program block called Cookie Jar Toons (also known as This is for Kids); the three-hour block aired on Monday through Friday mornings as well as weekend mornings in most markets. This block was discontinued when Tribune Broadcasting assumed partial-ownership of This TV on November 1, 2013 (in favor of a three-hour Sunday-only E/I block), leaving Ion Television's Qubo as the sole remaining weekday children's block on American commercial broadcast television. Besides Qubo, there are only certain markets and syndicated channels that broadcast on weekday cartoons and broadcast it in the United States. The weekday cartoon came to an end on January 4, 2015 when the last-remaining weekday children's block on broadcast television, But - Qubo moved from Friday mornings-to-Sunday mornings under a new name, \\"Qubo Kids Corner\\". This had marked the end of a long era in weekday children's programming (including cartoons) going back to the early 1960s. Eventually \\"Qubo Kids Corner\\" discontinued thus returning on the weekday block, unlike its traditional schedule which ran Monday-Friday - it airs only on Wednesday-Fridays mornings. MundoMax airs one cartoon during late weekday afternoons in Spanish making the only two commercial networks to air cartoons while adhere the mandates, and the only Spanish network that is non E/I though it broadcast its E/I programming during weekday mornings and weekends. Due to the network closure of MundoMax this leaves only Qubo along with some local low power independent TV stations to air cartoons during the weekdays while adhering to mandates. In 2016 a new sub-channel network Light TV began airing cartoons on weekday mornings full time for the first time since This TV dropped the format in 2013 after Tribune gained full ownership of the network from Wiegel Broadcasting. It is the 3rd network and the second commercial on the minor network in 3 years to air cartoons while adhering to the mandates without any major sponsorship from food and toy companies.

Frenchay was first recorded in 1257 as Fromscawe and later as Fromeshaw, meaning the wood on the Frome. The village is situated between the B4058 road, which runs parallel to the M32 motorway, and the wooded River Frome valley. Frenchay's largest place of worship is the Anglican Church of St John the Baptist, adjacent to the large village common, which is overlooked by a number of 18th-century houses principally built by wealthy Quaker families. These include the very fine former Rectory, Bradford's House and the adjacent Frenchay Common House. Also overlooking the common is the village school which dates from 1842. The village also contains a Catholic church, a Quaker Meeting House and a Unitarian chapel. Cricket was played on Frenchay Common from early in the nineteenth century, apparently on the initiative of the Wadham family who lived at Frenchay Manor House, owned farms locally at Doynton, Pomfrey, Mangotsfield, Downend and Frenchay, and many of whom are buried in the graveyard of St John the Baptist Church.See page 74, Winterbourne, Gloucestershire by C.H.B.

Elliott, Frenchay gives its name to the Frenchay Campus of the University of the West of England, though the campus itself is situated in the neighbouring parish of Stoke Gifford. Frenchay was the home to Frenchay Hospital, greatly expanded during World War II for the US Army, which treated wounded soldiers returning from the D-Day landings in Normandy. Facilities merged with Southmead Hospital, further towards the centre of the city in 2014. A&E; services closed on 19 May 2014. The closure of Frenchay Hospital has made way for a new housing development. Frenchay village has much green space, including the common, walks along the River Frome, and a moor owned by The National Trust. The Village Hall is a village hub, and there is an annual village flower show. flower show official website Frenchay's earliest place of worship was the Quaker Meeting House. The present one dates from 1809, and it replaced an earlier one of 1670. Many Quaker merchants from nearby Bristol made their homes here, including Joseph Storrs Fry, the Quaker chocolate manufacturer, who styled his company J S Fry & Sons, which manufactured the first ever commercially available chocolate bar in the world. He moved to Grove House (now Riverwood House) in 1800. He died in 1835 and is buried in the burying ground behind the Meeting House along with his wife and daughter, Pricilla. John Wadham (1762‚Äì1843) of Frenchay Manor House, was from 1789, a co-owner and director of Wadham, Ricketts & Co, later Wadham, Ricketts, Fry & Co, which manufactured Bristol blue glass at the Phoenix Glassworks near Temple Gate, Bristol, examples of which can be seen in Bristol Museum,Bristol Glass by Cleo Witt, Cyril Weeden and Arlene Palmer Schwind published in conjunction with City of Bristol Museum & Art Gallery, pp. 35‚Äì60, and was a director of the Bristol Floating Harbour Company in 1820. His son Thomas Wadham (1797‚Äì1849) was High Sheriff of Bristol in 1843, the year that Isambard Kingdom Brunel launched his ship SS Great Britain in Bristol Harbour. Thomas Wadham and his son the Rev. John Wadham were active in setting up the Winterbourne National School and his daughters were involved on the school's women's committee. Thomas's son Edward Wadham (1828‚Äì1913), Mineral Agent to Walter Montagu Douglas Scott, 5th Duke of Buccleuch took his skills as a civil engineer who had worked under Brunel and his love of cricket to Barrow-in-Furness where, from 1851 until his death in 1913, he played an important part in the development of what had been a tiny hamlet into the biggest iron and steel centre in the world, and a major ship-building force, in just forty years.Wadham diaries held by the Cumbria Archive Service.

Situated on the north shore, North Rustico an incorporated municipality in 1954. North Rustico changed its status to a town on November 16, 2013. The town is known to locals, as well as many others as \\"The Crick\\". Its population as of the 2016 Census was 607 people. North Rustico is well known for its Canada Day celebration every year on July 1. The event usually attracts in excess of 10,000 people, which packs the town quite full. It includes festivities in the park, a parade down main street, as well as a boat parade on Rustico Harbour. The celebration is popular among families, teenagers and adults. The day is completed by a fireworks display over the bay. History The village of North Rustico was founded circa 1790, around a small natural harbour along the Gulf of St. Lawrence coast. The region was home to a remnant Acadian population who fled British capture and deportation during the Seven Years' War (see Great Upheaval), although English, Scottish and Irish settlers moved into the area during the remainder of the 18th century and throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The name Rustico comes from Rassicot, the name of one of the first settlers from France. The Farmers' Bank of Rustico in nearby South Rustico was founded and managed under the leadership of Father Georges-Antoine Belcourt, and received Royal Assent for its act of incorporation at the Court of Windsor on April 7, 1864. It is often considered to have been the first community-based bank in Canada. The bank building was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1959. Economy North Rustico Harbour North Rustico's primary industries are fishing, tourism and agriculture. Located northwest of Charlottetown, the town is increasingly becoming an exurb with residents commuting to work in the city. Since the 1996 census, the town has witnessed a population decline of 2% in year-round residents. During the short summer tourist season on Prince Edward Island in July and August, the village's proximity to the Prince Edward Island National Park results in a temporary population expansion, with many visitors staying in nearby accommodations. The town has 344 dwellings. In 2015, the median household income was $49,920, compared with the provincial average of $61,163. Many seasonal homes or cottages are owned by non-residents and are occupied for only several weeks during the summer months. The fishing industry remains the village's most important economic activity, with approximately 40 vessels home-ported in a small craft harbour. Lobster fishing is the main focus for much of the fleet and during May and June fresh north shore P.E.I lobster can be bought in a fish market on the harbour wharves or directly off of the boats. \\"Fisherman's Wharf Lobster Suppers\\", the \\"Blue Mussel Cafe\\" and \\"The Yellow House Take-Out\\" are popular places to enjoy the fresh seafood of Prince Edward Island. In the summer, this town is one of the Island's most popular destinations. On a warm summer evening, dozens of people can be found strolling the town's waterfront boardwalk, which overlooks the bay and fishing docks. Tourism Boardwalk in Rustico. Tourism is an important part of the local economy. North Rustico offers sea kayaking, cycling, walking, deep sea fishing, skating, boating, and hiking.  Sports  North Star arena is home to a number of different hockey organizations, allowing players of all ages to exercise and enjoy the game of hockey.  Climate  Similar to other Maritime provinces, Rustico's weather can be somewhat unpredictable. Winter temperatures run from -3 to -11, Autumn temperatures run from 8-22, Summer temperatures run around 20, and Spring temperatures run from 8 to 22 degrees.  Education  Gulf Shore Consolidated School provides public education for students from Kindergarten to grade 9. French language education is available at Ecole Saint-Augustin, located near South Rustico.

They attended the David School, a non-denominational alternative high school with a mission to serve underprivileged and struggling students. The film covers the 3-year period from 1999 to 2002 in which the boys' ages range from 15 to 18. It was directed by David Sutherland. It was a three-part edition of Frontline on PBS, with each part running for two hours, originally broadcast in January 2006. The focus of the film is Cody and Chris' struggles with the problems of growing up in a rural, relatively impoverished environment. In addition, both boys have unique challenges. Chris, growing up in a family without strong role models and parents who limit him in a variety of ways, struggles to motivate himself to do well in school and life. Cody deals with how to find acceptance among his peers and reconcile his Christianity with his alternative lifestyle. The film is set in rural Kentucky. As a result, the film addresses a wide range of topics. Some of these topics include the gun culture, religion and science (a biology teacher and students at the David School are portrayed dismissing evolution and misinterpreting scientific ideas). Garry Lee Cody Perkins Cody was born on 19 October 1983, in Lexington, Kentucky. When he was 5 months old, his mother killed herself. When he was 12 years old, his father killed Cody's stepmother (his 7th wife) and then himself. Cody then left his life in the city to live in the country with his step-grandmother, Liz McGuire. At the time of the filming, Cody had a girlfriend, Jessica Riddle. Both were born again Christians. At one point Cody wanted to be a preacher. In the documentary he played in a Christian heavy metal band, Seven Rise Up. The film shows Cody getting nipple piercings to add to his many other piercings, later having discussions with his teachers and storefront church pastor, and bonding with Jessica and her parents in the living room of their home. Cody graduated valedictorian of his small class of seven at the David School. =Post- documentary= Cody and Jessica married on April 10, 2004, and both attended college. Cody graduated from Mayo Technical College in May 2006 and began working as a service technician with an HVAC company. Cody and Jessica divorced in 2006, and Cody has since remarried and has four kids. The band, Seven Rise Up, is no longer together. The bulk of the band formed Bellor; Cody left the group but formed another band, Sledgehammer Persuasion, but they have disbanded. Cody is now playing bass in the worship band at a church in Prestonsburg and has formed a new Christian metal band with former Seven Rise Up bandmate Jason Johnson. Cody is saved and got baptized with his new wife, they attend a small church in Prestonsburg, KY, where he is beginning to preach and the two of them teach an adult bible study together. Chris Johnson At the beginning of the documentary, Chris lived with his father, Randall (who could not work because of medical problems related to his drinking), his mother, Sheila, his grandmother (who is rarely shown in the documentary until the very end), his younger brother, Daniel, and his younger sister, Amy. Chris received Supplemental Security Income for disability, related to a behavior disorder that played a role in his going to The David School. The Supplemental Security Income is a prominent element in the documentary as it is a reliable source of income for Chris and his mother. They both worry that he might lose the benefit if he does well in school, is re-evaluated and it is found that he no longer has a behavior disorder. He does not lose it during the documentary, but the supplement ends when he turns 18. Later in the documentary, his mother moves out (his parents fought regularly) and eventually moves in with a boyfriend and then moves to Florida. Chris worked at various low wage jobs during the documentary, including jobs at Taco Bell and Little Caesars, making him fall behind in school. With no transportation to school, and disgusted at his father's condition, Chris is given a free apartment of his own temporarily in town. Near the end of the documentary he passes the exam to receive his GED and graduates from The David School. He visits and attempts to get into a residential college, but does poorly on the ACT. The film's end shows Chris starting the long drive to his estranged mother's house in Florida, in a truck carrying his family's belongings after they are evicted from their trailer, and uncertain whether his mother will welcome them. =Post-documentary= Chris's father, Randall Johnson, died due to health related issues stemming from alcoholism in 2005. Chris has had various jobs, including fast food, lawn care, and working in coal mines. He spent some time outside of Kentucky but moved back as he missed his home state. The most recent updates say he still lives in rural Kentucky with his friend Jay Pritchard. Unlike Cody, there is no evidence that Chris has an online presence.

The list was born in the split of the spoon collective lists from the Thinknet group, over issues of free speech and appropriate philosophical expression. Early membership involved much overlap with the Futureculture List. In more recent years discussions have become more general, but the list still has members from its founding period. Michael Current died shortly after the founding of the group. This is not the only death that the group faced over the years, with quite a number of central members dying. List discussion has resulted in books, articles, conferences, more than one academic thesis, a group novel (now available through Lulu), and a strong ongoing community. Cybermind itself has been the subject of academic research, including an anthropological Doctoral dissertation by Jonathan Marshall at the University of Sydney, which has now been published as the book Living on Cybermind. The book details the life of people on Cybermind over the period from 1994 to 2006 and uses many quotations from list members to analyse the ambiguities of net presence and absence (which is called asence), the paradoxes of the public/private divide, difficulties arising around authenticity and aggression, netsex, net-politics, and the construction of 'community'. The other major gathering of writing about Cybermind is a collection of online essays about gender online and its role in the group's life.

DeMille) to instruct him to purchase a Ph.D. in Hubbard's name: \\"PLEASE INFORM DR HOUGH PHD VERY ACCEPTABLE. PRIVATELY TO YOU. FOR GOSH SAKES EXPEDITE. WORK HERE UTTERLY DEPENDENT ON IT. CABLE REPLY. RON\\" Shortly afterwards, Hubbard received a \\"Doctorate of Philosophy\\" from Sequoia, along with a \\"D. Scn\\" (Doctorate of Scientology) which he appears to have bestowed upon himself.Russell Miller, Bare-Faced Messiah, chapter 12. Michael Joseph Ltd, 1987 The degree subsequently became a key part of his self-promotional efforts. Hubbard began referring to himself as \\"L. Ron Hubbard, Ph.D., C.E.\\" Hubbard, \\"Professional Auditor's Bulletin No. 87\\", June 5, 1956 (the C.E. referring to an equally unearned civil engineering qualification supposedly obtained from George Washington University, from which he had dropped out in his second year of studies). He presented it as evidence of his scientific qualifications, calling himself \\"Doctor Hubbard\\": Hubbard also envisaged using Sequoia to bestow a variety of \\"degrees\\" on students of his proposed \\"Freudian Foundation of America\\", a scheme which he put forward in April 1953 but which apparently never got off the ground. The students would have received certificates from Sequoia accrediting them as \\"Bachelor of Scientology,\\" \\"Doctor of Scientology,\\" \\"Freudian Psycho-analyst,\\" and \\"Doctor of Divinity,\\" among other qualifications.Jon Atack, A Piece of Blue Sky , part 3 chapter 5. Lyle Stuart, 1990 He may have abandoned the idea for legal reasons; in May 1953, he told Scientologists in an \\"Associate Newsletter\\": Public attention was drawn to Hubbard's \\"degree\\" by the Anderson Report of 1965, published in Victoria, Australia. The board of enquiry that produced the report was suspicious of the degree's validity and, in its words, The question of the degree also attracted comment in the British press, forcing Hubbard onto the defensive. He issued a policy letter in February 1966 defending his degree: \\"I was a Ph.D., Sequoia's University and therefore a perfectly valid doctor under the laws of the State of California\\". (The latter claim was not true, as Sequoia had never been accredited by the State, nor had it any chance of being ‚Äî as Christopher Evans notes, it \\"used to be well known to quacks on the West Coast as a degree mill where 'qualifications' could be bought for suitable sums.\\" Christopher Evans, Cults of Unreason, p. 21. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1973) Hubbard announced that henceforth the title of \\"Doctor\\" would no longer be used within Scientology, as \\"the name has been disgraced\\" due to \\"the abuses and murders carried out under the title of 'doctor'\\" (a reference to his hatred of psychiatry).Hubbard, \\"Doctor Title Abolished\\", HCO Policy Letter of 14 February 1966. Reprinted in Organization Executive Course volume 2 A few weeks later, Hubbard publicly disclaimed his Sequoia degree in an advertisement in the personal column of The Times: However, even after this disavowal Hubbard continued to cite the Sequoia-issued Ph.D. In an interview with Rhodesian television in April 1966, he told the interviewer: \\"Actually I have a degree in philosophy, a Doctor of Philosophy\\".Hubbard, in Introduction to Scientology (interview of April 1966); quoted in Expand!\\" magazine, issue 21, 1973, p. 11.

George Baker during World War II. Set in the United States Army, Sad Sack depicted an otherwise unnamed, lowly private experiencing some of the absurdities and humiliations of military life. The title was a euphemistic shortening of the military slang \\"sad sack of shit\\", common during World War II. The phrase has come to mean \\"an inept person\\" or \\"inept soldier\\". Comic strip Originally drawn in pantomime by Baker, The Sad Sack debuted June 1942 as a comic strip in the first issue of Yank, the Army Weekly. It proved popular, and a hardcover collection of Baker's wartime Sad Sack strips was published by Simon & Schuster, Inc. in 1944, with a follow-up, The New Sad Sack (1946). The original book was concurrently published as an Armed Services edition mass market paperback, in that edition's standard squarebound, horizontal, 5 5/8\\" √ó 4\\" format, by Editions for the Armed Services, Inc., a non-profit organization of The Council on Books in Wartime; it was #719 in the series of Armed Service editions. After the war ended, The Sad Sack ran in newspaper syndication in the United States from May 5, 1946 until 1958. Baker then sold the rights to Harvey Comics, which produced a large number of commercial spin-offs.Mike Kelley. Minor histories: Statements, Conversations, Proposals, The MIT Press, 2004 p.19 n.4. , Comic book Harvey Comics published original Sad Sack stories in the Sad Sack Comics comic book series, which ran 287 issues, cover-dated September 1949 to October 1982. Sack was a civilian until he re-enlisted in issue #22 (February 1953). Harvey also published the one-shot comic The Sad Sack Comes Home in 1951.\\"Sad Sack\\" (title) at the Grand Comics Database Spin-off series were: * Sad Sack's Funny Friends #1‚Äì75 (Dec. 1955 ‚Äì Oct. 1969) *Sad Sack and the Sarge #1‚Äì155 (Sept. 1957 ‚Äì June 1982) *Sad Sack Laugh Special #1‚Äì93 (Winter 1958/59 ‚Äì Feb. 1977) *Sad Sack's Army Life Parade #1‚Äì57 (Oct. 1963 ‚Äì circa 1975) *Little Sad Sack #1‚Äì19 (Oct. 1964 ‚Äì Nov. 1967), featuring a child version of the character *Sad Sad Sack (Oct. 1964 ‚Äì Dec. 1973) commonly known as Sad Sad Sack World *Sad Sack Navy, Gobs 'n' Gals #1‚Äì8 (Aug. 1972 ‚Äì Oct. 1973) *Sad Sack USA #1‚Äì7 (Nov. 1972 ‚Äì Nov. 1973) *Sad Sack USA Vacation one-shot (Oct. 1974) *Sad Sack Fun Around the World one-shot (1974) *Sad Sack's Army Life Today #1‚Äì4 (circa mid-1975 to Nov. 1975, and May 1976) Supporting characters included the Sarge (Sack's First Sergeant, the potbellied and tough but reasonable Sergeant Circle); Slob Slobinski and Hi-Fi Tweeter (Sack's bunk buddies); the General (Brigadier General Rockjaw, always drawn with dark glasses, cigarette holder and Ascot tie); Captain Softseat;http://www.comics.org/issue/223413/ Muttsy the dog (whose dog tag # was K-9); Sadie Sack (Sad's redheaded female cousin in the WACs); Ol' Sod Sack (Sad's hillbilly uncle); and Little Sad Sack (Sad as a kid, before his army inductionhttps://www.mycomicshop.com/search?TID=355901). The spin-off Sad Sack Navy, Gobs 'n' Gals had the supporting character Gabby Gob. The army camp where most of the action took place was usually named Camp Calamity,http://www.ebay.com/itm/SAD-SACK-THE-SARGE-104-FN-comic-Camp- Calamity-Capers-/130674289070 but was sometimes called Camp Browbeat.http://www.comicvine.com/sad-sack-and-the-sarge-140/4000-203066/ The Harvey Comics and newspaper strip were aimed at younger readers than Baker's wartime originals, and the style of the strip changed dramatically. In the newspaper strip, the pantomime style was abandoned in favor of a more conventional comic-story format. In the mid-1950s, Harvey Comics and Baker brought in Paul McCarthy to draw the Sad Sack titles, followed by Fred Rhoads, Jack O'Brien, and Joe Dennett. Others who periodically drew for the titles include Warren Kremer and Ken Selig. Baker retained editorial control and continued to illustrate the covers of Sad Sack comics until his death in 1975. La Prensa, a Mexican publisher, released the Spanish language editions of the Sad Sack comics under the title Trist√°n Trist√≥n. In addition to Sad Sack strips, other strips within each Trist√°n Trist√≥n issue included Trist√°na Trist√≥na (Sad Sack's cousin, Sadie Sack) and Capul√≠n which was about a boy who had overly large feet. The latter two strips were often only one page and used as filler. Other filler strips included Firulais and Chiquilladas. Litigation Yank In late 2000, Alan Harvey (eldest son of Harvey Comics founder Alfred Harvey) sued Steve Geppi (owner of Diamond Comics Distribution and many other properties), charging that Geppi had plundered Harvey's warehouses in the mid-1980s, specifically of original art from Harvey's Sad Sack comic books. Geppi countersued, claiming that he had legal title to the original art thanks to a 1984 agreement he had made with Steve Harvey‚Äîat the time President of Harvey Publications, Inc., as well as President of Sad Sack, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Harvey Publications, Inc. The suit was settled in late 2002; at the time of the settlement, the New York Supreme Court had dismissed Harvey's claims against Geppi. The settlement agreement allowed Geppi to keep the art, with no money changing hands. The rights to Sad Sack are still owned by Alan Harvey, and have since been published under the name of Lorne-Harvey Publications and Re-Collections. Radio Private Sad Sack (played by Mel Blanc) made an appearance with Bob Hope and Betty Grable on the April 29, 1944, episode of G.I. Journal. The voice Blanc used was a stuttering delivery similar to Porky Pig. The character as voiced by Blanc appeared in multiple other broadcasts of \\"G.I. Journal\\". Sponsored by Old Gold Cigarettes, The Sad Sack radio program ran in 1946 as a summer replacement series for The Frank Sinatra Show. It starred Herb Vigran in the title role with Jim Backus, Sandra Gould, Ken Christy and Patsy Moran. Dick Joy was the announcer for the series which began June 12, 1946, with the episode \\"Sack Returns Home from the Army\\" and continued until September 4 of that year. Film Harvey Comics announced a forthcoming movie in their Sad Sack issue #32 (March 1954). At Paramount Pictures, Baker's strip was adapted by screenwriters Edmund Beloin and Nate Monaster for George Marshall's film The Sad Sack (1957), in which WAC Major Shelton (Phyllis Kirk) has the assignment to turn bumbling Private Meredith C. Bixby (Jerry Lewis) into a good soldier. The supporting cast includes David Wayne, Peter Lorre and Joe Mantell.

Yank, the Army Weekly was a weekly magazine published by the United States military during World War II. History The idea for the magazine came from Egbert White, who had worked on the newspaper Stars and Stripes during World War I. He proposed the idea to the Army in early 1942, and accepted a commission as lieutenant colonel. White was the overall commander, Major Franklin S. Forsberg was the business manager and Major Hartzell Spence was the first editor. page 65 White was removed from the Yank staff because of disagreements about articles which had appeared. Soon afterward, Spence was also assigned to other duties and Joe McCarthy became the editor.McGurn p 87-89 The first issue was published with the cover date of June 17, 1942.McGurn p 79 The magazine was written by enlisted rank (EM) soldiers with a few officers as managers, and initially was made available only to the US Army overseas.McGurn p 70 By the fifth issue of July 15, 1942, it was made available to serving members within the US, however it was never made available on the newsstands for public purchase.McGurn p 83 YANK's circulation exceeded 2.5 million in 41 countries with 21 editions.McGurn p 250 The last issue was published on December 28, 1945.McGurn p 250 Joe McCarthy remained the editor of Yank until the official closure of the office on New Year's Eve 1945.McGurn p 249  Trimmingham letter  The magazine's April 28, 1944 edition included a letter from a black corporal, Rupert Trimmingham, complaining that white German prisoners of war were being treated with more respect than black American soldiers.Carroll, Andrew, ed. War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2008), p. 315. The reaction to the letter was strong and immediate. In a follow-up letter published 28 July 1944, Trimmingham said that he had received 287 letters, 183 from whites, supporting his position.

The Shabak population has grown significantly since 2003 and constitute about 35% of the population, or a majority. as opposed to the prevoius (pre 2014 Isis invasion) majority Assyrian population https://apnews.com/6905fe02e58b40dd8d0caaca06fa847c Bartella was liberated from ISIS control on 20 October 2016 by Iraqi Special Operations Forces and Nineveh Plain Protection Units with PMF Brigade 30 currently control and run the city's security. Early history The earliest known mention of Bartella was by Father Potrus Qasha in A.D. 1153, where he talked about Ignatius Elia'azar (1143-1164), the maphiryan of Ashur, making Bartella his home and see. Elia'azar reported directly to the Patriarch in Antioch, Syria. The congregation was upset with Elia'azar for changing the see location from the traditional Mar Mattai Monastery. An agreement was reached to return to Mar Mattai, with the tradition to visit Bartella regularly. Other maphiryans who made their see Bartella include: * Dyonosius Saliba II (1222‚Äì1231) * Gregorius Barsuma (1288‚Äì1308) * Gregorius Mattai I (1317‚Äì1345) * Gregorius Bar Qeenaya (d. 1361) * Athinasius Abraham II (1365‚Äì1379) * Cyril Joseph III (1458‚Äì1470) In 1171, the Kurds attacked Bartella, as well as Mar Mattai Monastery. When the people of Nineveh heard this, they joined forced to fight back and succeeded. However, the monks at the monastery learned of another encroaching attack and agreed to sign a peace treaty with the Kurds to avoid more bloodshed. They paid the Kurds 30 golden dinariis with the agreement. As soon as the Kurds received the gold, they gathered a larger army of 1,500 and attacked the monastery, causing a crack in its wall. They entered and killed 15 monks, while the others escaped. In 1201, a Christian priest and Muslim cleric in Bartella had a quarrel. The people in the town complained to the mayor, who punished the Muslim cleric with a beating. The cleric went to Mosul and gathered a large crowd by the main mosque, and they marched toward Bartella to destroy it. When they reached the town, the gates were closed, and they couldn't enter. On their way back to Mosul, the mob broke into a church called MarZena and took all the valuables. Today, this church is the al- Khallal mosque. In 1261 and 1369, Mar Mattai Monastery was again attacked by Kurds, which impacted Bartella. In 1745, Nadir Shah, a Persian, attacked Bartella, killed many men and took many young men, girls and women away. From 1756 - 1758, Bartella experienced great famine, which promoted more travel of the people of the town to purchase their needs. They suffered many robberies and attacks during these travels. In 1789, Jolu Beg bin Bdagh, the Emir of Shikhan, exhausted Bartella of their goods while at war with the Arab Emir Mohammad bin Hasan al-Taa'i. In the 18th century, Catholicism entered the city when Latin and Dominican monks opened a center to offer educational and medical services. In 1778, The Assyrians (also known as Chaldeans and Suryan) of Bakhdeda were leaning toward Catholicism, which influenced some family members of the Aal Makrooh family in Bartella to convert. In 1780, Father Zakariya Kindo converted along with 40 other families. While there were some quarrels about using the church in Bartella between the Catholic and Orthodox priests in, they came a common understanding and accepted each other's choice of denomination. Today, about one third of the town is Catholic, while the other two-thirds remain Orthodox.Street of Bartella  Churches of Bartella  Bartella and its vicinity has six churches, two partially demolished, one abandoned, one new, and two very old: * Mar Aho Dama Church This church was in existence in 1153 when was expanded by Maphrian Ignatius II La'Azer. It was in use till 1386. Excavation in its ruins found the remains of three bishops which were moved to Mart Shmony Church. * Mart Shmony Church It's unknown when this church was first built, however, it was reinvigorated for the first time in 1807, It was rebuilt again completely in 1869, and It was reinvigorated again in 1971. * Mar Giwargis Church There are two churches with this name. The first is in ruins (recently renovated and reused) and is believed to be a monastery for St. Jerjis who built it around 1701. The second church was completed in 1939. * Church of the Virgin This church was built in 1890 at the time of Qorlos Elias al-Mosuli who died in 1911. However, an inscription dating 16th century mentions the name of the Church of the Virgin which contradicts the date of 1890 and assumes that this church was standing at that time. The gate and part of the church were destroyed by ISIS sometime between August 2014 and October 2016. * Al-Sayida Church The complete demolition of Al-Sayida Church came in 1934 as its bricks were used to build the new Mar Giwargis Church. * Ber Nagara Monastery This monastery is named after Yohanan bit Nagara (St John Bar Nagar√©) meaning \\"Yohanan of the Carpenters\\" since all his family were working as carpenters. It's believed that he used to worship pagans, and after converting to Christianity he was killed by his father and was buried in the village of Ba Agre. When this village was destroyed in 1282, his grave which was visited heavily by the locals was destroyed with it. That forced Maphrian Gregarious bin al-Ebry to build a temple for the martyr Yohanan in Bartella and was completed in 1285. On November 23, 1285, the remains of St. Yohanan, monks from Syria, and the 40 martyrs killed by the Persians were moved and reburied in this temple. Unfortunately, this monastery was destroyed in 1653 and again the remains were moved to St. Shmony church. Currently, all what exist of this monastery is a small room built recently as a reminder to its existence. * The Monastery of the Forty Martyrs This monastery is still frequented by parishioners, while a part of it is demolished. It dates back to 1269. * Mar Youhanna Monastery This monastery is ancient without a known date of construction. It sits on the side of the main road north of Bartella. * Mar Daniel Monastery Mar Daniel is on a small hill near Bartella. It is named after Mar Daniel the Hermit, who ventured to Nineveh from Diyar Bakir with Mar Mattai in the year 363. This monastery is also known locally as the \\"Monastery of the Beetles\\" due to the large numbers of small beetles that appeared during the three-day festival on October 20. Forty minutes by foot from the \\"upper monastery\\" is a \\"lower monastery\\", which is commonly where the monks lived. Arab historians have called it al-Khalidi, al-Shabishti and Yaqut. Population In early August 2014, Bartella was overrun by ISIL Islamic extremists.Nabih Bulos, Iraqi Christians displaced by Sunni militants seek to flee abroad, Los Angeles Times (September 18, 2014). The Christian population of the town fled, mostly to Irbil in Kurdistan Region, joining thousands of other Iraqi Christians fleeing ISIL terror.Mariano Castillo, ISIS overtakes Iraq's largest Christian city, CNN (August 8, 2014)., NBC News (August 8, 2014). Before the ISIS invasion, Bartella's population was around 30,000, with the majority being Syriac Christians, including Eastern Catholic Syriacs and Oriental Orthodox Syriacs. Bartella was Christianized in the 2nd century. With the emergence of the Christological controversies, the people and their church came under the dominion of the Assyrian Church of the East (often incorrectly or correctly known as Nestorian); however, it switched to the Syriac Orthodox Church (mistakenly and loosely known as Jacobite) around AD 610. On November 23‚Äì24, 2013 during the 2-day \\"Bartella Friends\\" conference held in Erbil to discuss the demographic change due to the Shabak exodus fleeing Mosul and the surrounding villages towards Bartella from 2003 on, it was announced that the percentage of Christians has dropped dramatically from 99% to 40%. Latest events On August 31, 2004, three girls from Bartella were slaughtered while returning home from their work at a hospital in Mosul where they worked. On November 19, 2004, two brothers from Bartella were killed while at work when a mortar shell fell on the shop they worked at in Mosul market. On December 8, 2004, Dr. Ra'ad Augustine Qoryaqos, one of Bartella's notables and a successful surgeon who worked as a professor at the College of Medicine in University of Anbar, was murdered in Ramadi. A group of three terrorists stormed his clinic while he was checking on his patients, shot and left him bleeding. An operation later failed to save his life. Dr. Qoryaqos left behind his wife and two children. On August 10, 2009, a pair of large flatbed trucks packed with bombs exploded simultaneously shortly after dawn, destroying a Shabaki village known as Khazna, about east of Mosul and a few kilometres away from Bartella. The blast shattered windows at many homes in Bartella. On March 28, 2013, and during the passion week of Easter, a car bomb parked downtown not far from street of Bartella went off in the early hours of that day killing one local resident. On August 3, 2014, many families from Bartella left the city to Erbil, Ankawa and Shekhan, due to attacks by ISIL fighters. The Peshmerga forces were fighting them to retake ISIL-controlled Gogjali district west of Bartella. On August 6, 2014, Peshmerga forces guarding the city ordered the remaining residents to leave, and pulled back to Erbil at around 8:30 pm. Over the night, the city was almost completely empty of its predominately Assyrian Christian residents. At around 4:30 am on August 7, the whole city was totally taken by ISIL militants in a bullet-less fall. On August 8, they burned liquor stores, looted houses and food stores, hung their flags on the church walls, pulled down the crosses and demanded the few remaining Christian locals of either converting to Islam, staying in the city and paying a yearly tax of $200 or face the \\"death by the sword\\" if refused to convert or pay. In late August and early September 2014, it was reported that three residents of the few remaining Assyrian Christians, died. One disabled, the other due to illness and old age and the third one was tortured then killed after he refused to convert to Islam. In mid September 2014, the 12 remaining residents managed to escape by faking conversion. On October 20, 2016, as part of the Iraqi government offensive to retake Mosul, the Assyrian Nineveh Plain Protection Units and Iraqi Special Operations Forces (ISOF) liberated Bartella from ISIL control. On December 24, 2016, first post- liberation Christmas Eve mass was held at Mart Shmony Church. Industry Bartella was known in Nineveh to have some of the best goldsmiths. Tahini is one of the main food products in the town. Weddings and festivals also inspire various craftsmanship in the town. Wedding tradition Every Sunday or festival day (holy feast days) between the engagement and the marriage, the groom's mother hosts the women and girls in her home, where they prepare trays of treats including seeds, sweets and dried fruit. The plates are covered with colorful fabric and taken to the bride's home to be presented to her. A few days prior to the wedding, the wall above the front of door of the couple's future home is painted with beautiful colors and decorated with various flowers. The walls of the couple's room are newly painted as well, since they typically became darkened with smoke from the indoor fires used for heat in the winter. Christian symbols were also painted on the walls to protect from bad spirits.

OAS is not a separate food allergy, but rather represents cross-reactivity between distant remnants of tree or weed pollen still found in certain fruits and vegetables. Therefore, OAS is only seen in people with seasonal pollen allergies, and mostly people who are allergic to tree pollen. It is usually limited to ingestion of uncooked fruits or vegetables. Another term used for this syndrome is pollen-food allergy. In adults up to 60% of all food allergic reactions are due to cross-reactions between foods and inhalative allergens. OAS is a Type 1 or IgE-mediated hypersensitivity, which is sometimes called a \\"true allergy\\". The body's immune system produces IgE antibodies against pollen; in OAS, these antibodies also bind to (or cross- react with) other structurally similar proteins found in botanically related plants. OAS can occur any time of the year but is most prevalent during the pollen season. Individuals with OAS usually develop symptoms within minutes of eating the food.  Signs and symptoms  OAS sufferers may have any of a number of allergic reactions that usually occur very rapidly, within minutes of eating a trigger food. The most common reaction is an itching or burning sensation in the lips, mouth, ear canal, or pharynx. Sometimes other reactions can be triggered in the eyes, nose, and skin. Swelling of the lips, tongue, and uvula, and a sensation of tightness in the throat may be observed. If a sufferer swallows the food, and the allergen is not destroyed by the stomach acids, it is likely that there will be a reaction from histamine release later in the gastrointestinal tract. Vomiting, diarrhea, severe indigestion, or cramps may occur. Rarely, OAS may be severe and present as wheezing, vomiting, hives, low blood pressure, or anaphylaxis. Causes OAS produces symptoms when an affected person eats certain fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Some individuals may only show allergy to one particular food, and others may show an allergic response to many foods. Individuals with an allergy to tree pollen may develop OAS to a variety of foods. While the tree pollen allergy has been worked out, the grass pollen is not well understood. Furthermore, some individuals have severe reactions to certain fruits and vegetables that do not fall into any particular allergy category. When tropical foods initiate OAS, allergy to latex may be the underlying cause. Because the allergenic proteins associated with OAS are usually destroyed by cooking, most reactions are caused by eating raw foods. The main exceptions to this are celery and nuts, which may cause reactions even after being cooked. = Cross reactions = Allergies to a specific pollen are usually associated with OAS reactions to other certain foods. For instance, an allergy to ragweed is associated with OAS reactions to banana, watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew, zucchini, and cucumber. This does not mean that all sufferers of an allergy to ragweed will experience adverse effects from all or even any of these foods. Reactions may be associated with one type of food, with new reactions to other foods developing later. However, reaction to one or more foods in any given category does not necessarily mean a person is allergic to all foods in that group. * Alder pollen: almonds, apples, celery, cherries, hazel nuts, peaches, pears, parsley, raspberry, strawberry * Birch pollen: almonds, apples, apricots, avocados, bananas, carrots, celery, cherries, chicory, coriander, fennel, fig, hazel nuts, kiwifruit, nectarines, parsley, parsnips, peaches, pears, peppers, plums, potatoes, prunes, soy, strawberries, wheat; Potential: walnuts * Grass pollen: fig, melons, tomatoes, oranges, celery, peach * Mugwort pollen : carrots, celery, coriander, fennel, parsley, peppers, sunflower * Ragweed pollen : banana, cantaloupe, cucumber, green pepper, paprika, sunflower seeds/oil, honeydew, watermelon, zucchini, echinacea, artichoke, dandelions, honey (if bees pollinate with pollen from wild flowers), hibiscus or chamomile tea * Possible cross-reactions (to any of the above): berries (blueberries, raspberries, etc.), citrus (oranges, lemons, etc.), grapes, mango, figs, peanut, pineapple, pomegranates, watermelon Diagnosis The patient typically already has a history of atopy and an atopic family history. Eczema, otolaryngeal symptoms of hay fever or asthma will often dominate leading to the food allergy being unsuspected. Often well-cooked, canned, pasteurized, or frozen food offenders cause little to no reaction due to denaturation of the cross-reacting proteins, causing delay and confusion in diagnosis as the symptoms are elicited only to the raw or fully ripened fresh foods. Correct diagnosis of the allergen types involved is critical. OAS sufferers may be allergic to more than just pollen. Oral reactions to food are often mistakenly self-diagnosed by patients as caused by pesticides or other contaminants. Other reactions to food‚Äîsuch as lactose intolerance and intolerances which result from a patient being unable to metabolize naturally occurring chemicals (e.g., salicylates and proteins) in food‚Äîneed to be distinguished from the systemic symptoms of OAS. =Testing= Many people are unaware that they have OAS. However, if swelling, tingling or pain develops while eating certain foods, then it is wise to see an allergy specialist. Before a diagnosis can be made, keep a food diary. This is important as the physician can then perform an allergy test. Before testing is started, a comprehensive history is obtained so that random testing is avoided. The diagnosis of OAS may involve skin prick tests, blood tests, patch tests or oral challenges. When OAS is suspected, the oral challenge test is ideal. =Exams= To confirm OAS, the suspected food is consumed in a normal way. The period of observation after ingestion and symptoms are recorded. If other factors such as combined foods are required, this is also replicated in the test. For example, if the individual always develops symptoms after eating followed by exercise, then this is replicated in the laboratory.  Treatment  OAS must be managed in conjunction with the patient's other allergies, primarily the allergy to pollen. The symptom severity may wax and wane with the pollen levels. Published pollen counts and seasonal charts are useful but may be ineffective in cases of high wind or unusual weather, as pollen can travel hundreds of kilometers from other areas.In addition, patients are advised to avoid the triggering foods, particularly nuts.Peeling or cooking the foods has been shown to eliminate the effects of some allergens such as mal d 1 (apple), but not others such as celery or strawberry. In the case of foods such as hazelnut, which have more than one allergen, cooking may eliminate one allergen but not the other. Antihistamines may also relieve the symptoms of the allergy by blocking the immune pathway. Persons with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction may carry an injectable emergency dose of epinephrine (such as an EpiPen). Oral steroids may also be helpful. Allergy immunotherapy has been reported to improve or cure OAS in some patients. Immunotherapy with extracts containing birch pollen may benefit OAS sufferers of apple or hazelnut related to birch pollen-allergens. Even so, the increase in the amount of apple/hazelnut tolerated was small (from 12.6 to 32.6 g apple), and as a result, a patient's management of OAS would be limited.

Government Cut as seen from the Macarthur Causeway on 15 March 2008. Government Cut is a manmade shipping channel between Miami Beach and Fisher Island, which allows better access to the Port of Miami in Miami, Florida. Before the cut was established, a single peninsula of dry land stretched from what is now Miami Beach to what is now Fisher Island, and boats destined for the port at the mouth of the Miami River had to pass around Cape Florida, to the south of Key Biscayne. Opened in 1905, the cut across the peninsula that is now Miami Beach was authorized by the U.S. government (hence the name), in order to provide a direct route from the Atlantic Ocean on the east to the seaport on Biscayne Bay to the west, without having to detour southward. The cut across the mangroves and beach at the southern end of the peninsula created Fisher Island, which except for the extreme northeast corner, is part of unincorporated Miami-Dade County, Florida. The now-famous South Beach is to the north of the cut.  Establishment  Government Cut was authorized by the U.S. Congress in 1902, after the Committee on Rivers and Harbors of the U.S. House of Representatives approved it on June 13 of that year. Dredging began in 1903, and finished in the summer of 1905. Fill from the dredging was used to add to the privately owned Fisher Island. Later dredging to widen and deepen the cut also added land area to the Port of Miami, and created the foundation for the MacArthur Causeway (east of Interstate 395).  Operation  Operation of the cut falls upon three government agencies. The Port of Miami is responsible for navigation, while the United States Coast Guard is responsible for safety and security, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the channel itself, including dredging.  Notoriety  Local ocean tides for Miami are reported for the entrance to Government Cut. The next-closest point on the mainland for tide information is Jupiter Inlet, to the north. In December 19, 2005, the vintage Grumann G-73T Turbine Mallard seaplane providing Chalk's Ocean Airways Flight 101 crashed immediately offshore Government Cut, temporarily closing the channel to all traffic and trapping freighters and cruise ships on both sides. On September 25, 2016, Miami Marlins pitcher Jos√© Fern√°ndez died in a boating accident at Government Cut. The boat hit the jetty and capsized, killing Fern√°ndez and two other men on board, 25-year-old Eduardo Rivero, and 27-year-old Emilio Macias, the son of a Miami-Dade police detective.

Geography The town is situated at the edge of the Cindrel Mountains, on a series of river valleys which flow into the Cibin River in the South part of the Transylvanian Plateau. The main town of SƒÉli»ôte has a population of 2,830; it also administers nine villages: * Aciliu (; ) - (268 inhabitants), 8 km away * Amna»ô (; ) - (369 inhabitants), 9 km away; Saxon fortified church * Crin»õ () (2 permanent inhabitants - military base), 18 km away * F√¢nt√¢nele (until 1964 Cacova Sibiului; ; ) - 251 inhabitants, 6 km away * Gale»ô (; ) - 331 inhabitants, 2 km away * Mag () (439 inhabitants), 9 km away * SƒÉcel (; ) (520 inhabitants), 4 km away * Sibiel (; ) - 402 inhabitants, 6 km away * Vale (; ) - 384 inhabitants, 2 km away Demographics Originally all the localities, except the village of Amna»ô, were inhabited by Romanians. As of 2011, 95.7% of inhabitants were Romanians, 3.3% Roma and 0.6% Germans. Most Romanians are Orthodox and the Germans still living in Amna»ô are Lutheran Evangelical. There are also some small Protestant Churches. Economy Traditionally the main occupation was shepherding and related activities. Today this occupies a smaller percentage of the workforce, but remains important alongside other agricultural activities. Light industry was developed in the recent period and there are some textile workshops. Commerce and services are also an important activity. The area around Aciliu and Amna»ô is well suited for wines and around Mag and SƒÉcel there are a series of artificial lakes for fish farming. History The area was inhabited for a very long time, and on a hill between SƒÉli≈üte and the nearby commune of Tili»ôca there are the ruins of an old Dacian citadel. The first document mentioning the town is from 1354 and refers, in Latin, to Magna Villa. Early names would be Nogfalu in Hungarian and Grossdorf in German. Later, in 1383 the village is known as Magna Villa Valachiealis (Big Village of the Vlachs), denoting its ethnically Romanian population. Still later, it was one of the villages in the »öara Amla»ôului (Oml√°s), a Transylvanian fiefdom granted by the kings of Hungary during the 14th and 15th centuries to the Wallachian rulers. Around 1485 it was included in one of the seven seats of Saxondom. In the late 18th century SƒÉli»ôte became an important village of the Romanian community and the most important cultural centre in the MƒÉrginimea Sibiului area.

A dog tag, pet ID tag, or pet tag is a small flat tag worn on pets' collars or harnesses. Humane societies and rescue organizations recommend that dogs and cats wear these tags, which present that the wearer is not a stray, and contain information to enable someone encountering a lost pet to contact the owner. In the UK, dog owners are required by law to ensure that their dog is wearing an ID tag, even if the dog has already been microchipped (also required by UK law). Tags may make noise as animals move. A collar-mount tag, either slide-on or riveted-on flat to a collar's surface, is silent. A tag silencer encloses loose tags in a small neoprene pouch or a soft rubbery plastic ring around the edge of a tag and may reduce noise. The resemblance of human identification tags to this method of display led to military identification tags being called dog tags. Identifying information Identifying information on dog tags may include: * On a license tag, the dog license number and contact information for the licensing organization *On a pet ID tag, the pet's name, owner's phone number(s), address, or a QR code pointing to the pet's online profile, a reward offer, and a list of the animal's critical medical problems *On a microchip registry tag, an identifying number for the dog with a phone number for the registry. Some organizations recommend not putting a pet's name on an ID tag because, in an ownership dispute over a found dog, the original owner could use the pet's name to demonstrate that the pet recognizes the name and therefore has an association with that owner. Others believe that a lost pet might feel more comfortable and therefore be more likely to approach if strangers call it by its own name, so the name should be on the tag. Materials Tags are made of a variety of materials. Metal tags usually have their information embossed or engraved onto, or stamped into, their surface. The characters created by embossing or engraving are made by removing some of the tag's surface and are not typically as deep as stamped characters, which are made by stamping the tag with a metal die. Stamped tags are therefore often more durable than engraved tags, though some drag-engraving and laser engraving methods can be as deep, or deeper, than the stamped versions. Plastic chips can be etched or printed, come in many colors, and may be highly reflective to enhance visibility at night. Some plastics are sensitive to ultraviolet light and the color and even composition can fade over time.Photodegradation Quote: \\"Photodegradation of plastics and...\\" ABS plastics are among the most durable for use as pet ID tags. Some tags use dye- sublimation to print images and artwork to aluminum tags. The image is permanent and resists fading and wear.Dye-Sublimination on aluminum 3D printing is also used to create tags from a variety of materials. Common metals used for pet tags are aluminum, stainless steel, and brass. Aluminum is by far (2.5 times lighter than stainless steel) the least durable of the three. Brass is a soft metal, and not as durable as any variety of stainless steel. It may also tarnish and turn a greenish color. Harder metals are more likely to retain their lettering after wear and tear.

During her career she won an impressive number of 30 medals at Olympic Games, world championships or continental championships. Her best events were the floor exercise (three-time world champion), the vault (two-time world champion) and the balance beam (1997 world champion). She was also an excellent all around gymnast winning several medals on this event, the European title in 1994, a silver Olympic medal (1996) and a silver medal at the 1993 World Championships. She helped the Romanian team win three consecutive world titles (1994, 1995 and 1997) and two Olympic team medals, a silver and a bronze (1992 and 1996). Gogean was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 2013. Criticized for her lack of artistry and expression, Gogean nonetheless had nearly unmatched consistency, longevity and efficiency that made her a backbone of the Romanian team in the 1990s. Early life and career Her passport listed her birth year as 1977. However, in 2002 the Romanian newspaper ProSport obtained hospital records indicating that she had actually been born in 1978. Gogean and her mother have denied this, and her official birth year is still listed as 1977 or \\"unknown\\" in many sources. Gogean initially trained at CSS Foc≈üani, near her home village, under the tutelage of Sergiu and Tatiana Popa. She made her international debut at the Japan Junior International meet in 1989, where she placed fourth in the all-around and took the gold medal on floor exercise. Senior career By 1990, Gogean was representing Romania at major meets such as the Goodwill Games. She began to make a name for herself at the 1992 European Championships where she won the floor exercise gold, and finished second all-around and vault. Crowds and analysts were impressed with the young athlete's exceptional difficulty. She was equally impressive at 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. The youngest member of the experienced Romanian team, Gina put up some of the highest scores for her team throughout the compulsories and optionals. She won a team silver, finished 6th in the all- around, and was 5th on vault. Though her teammate and close friend Lavinia Milo≈üovici was one of the stars of the Olympics, Gina nonetheless had established herself as a gymnast to watch for in the future. In a sport where athletes are constantly fighting the battle of time as well as their maturing bodies, Gina continued to be one of the top gymnasts in the world each year after the Olympics. She was criticized for her lack of artistry in her gymnastics (particularly her post-1992 routines), and her stoic demeanor. Nevertheless, each year her gymnastics continually showed improvement from the year prior and her results reflected that. She finished a close second in the all-around behind rival Shannon Miller at the 1993 World Championships, losing by only 0.007. She also took the silver on floor exercise and bronze on beam. Though she did not medal in the all-around the following year (finishing 4th), she became the World Champion on vault - her first Worlds gold medal. She also won a bronze on floor. She also became the European All-Around champion that year, and played a critical role in helping the Romanian team win the 1994 Team World Championship‚Äîthe country's first since 1987. Gina suffered a fall in the qualifying rounds of this competition while attempting a back handspring-layout-back handspring combination on beam. Her foot slipped off the side and the back of her head slammed into the beam before she crashed to the floor. Miraculously, she suffered no injury, and only took an extra moment to collect herself before jumping back up on the beam. Though Gina struggled in major all-around competition through 1995 and 1996, her gymnastics continued to improve and she won more individual event World titles. At the 1995 World Championships, she helped the Romanians win their second team title, and went on to win the bronze on vault and the gold on floor. She added two more golds to her haul at the 1996 World Championships on vault and floor. At the European Championships a few weeks later, she won the team gold as well as silver on vault and beam. She was unable to defend the all around title after suffering a fall on uneven bars in the team final. Going into the 1996 Summer Olympics, the Romanians were the favorites to win team gold. However, the Romanian team had several injuries, was under manned during the team portion and had a very lackluster performance in both compulsories and optionals. The end result was a disappointing third. Gina, however, had a strong performance during the all-around and won the silver medal behind Lilia Podkopayeva of Ukraine. She also won two more bronze medals on the vault and beam. Her performances in the 1996 Olympics were particularly impressive, as Gina underwent an emergency appendectomy only 5 weeks before the competition. By a bizarre and miraculous stroke of luck, she had been traveling on a train to Bucharest at the time, which was the only city where hospitals could perform the kind of non-invasive surgery that Gina needed to return to training quickly. Traditional surgery would have involved at least a six-week wait to resume light training; she would have missed the Olympics. Gogean continued to compete after the retirement of Lavinia Milo≈üovici. She admitted in an ABC interview during the 1997 World Championships in Lausanne, Switzerland that the new Code of Points made gymnastics too difficult for her, and that she intended to retire after the competition was over; yet she led the Romanians to their third straight world team title. Gogean herself finished just off the podium in fourth. She rebounded by winning the world title on beam and her third straight title on floor. While she never won an Olympic gold, she finished her career with an impressive thirty Olympic, World and European medals, fourteen of them gold. Retirement Gogean retired after the 1998 World Cup, where she medalled in her all three events. After completing her studies she coached in Romania and later in Scotland, and also worked as a television commentator. Since 2001 she is a regular gymnastics judge. On 1 July 2006, she married Cristian Gorza, a former classmate of hers, in a ceremony in Deva, Romania. Her former coaches, Octavian Belu and Mariana Bitang, served as the godparents. Teammates Andreea RƒÉducan and Maria Olaru were among the guests.

It is long, with its entire route falling in Woods County in the northwestern part of the state. It does not have any lettered spur routes. SH-14 was part of Oklahoma's original highway system, as designated on August 24, 1924, and ran from Frederick in southwestern Oklahoma to the Kansas state line. In the late 1930s, however, new U.S. routes were introduced to Oklahoma; U.S. Highway 281 (US-281) and US-183 overtook most of SH-14's route, reducing it to its present-day extent. Route description SH-14 begins at U.S. Highway 281 and SH-45 in Waynoka. From this point, the highway heads west for a few blocks on the north edge of Waynoka. It then turns north and, after curving slightly to the east, follows a due north course to US-64 east of Cora. Signage present along the road indicates that SH-14 ends at US-64. However, both the Oklahoma state highway map and ODOT's internal control section maps show SH-14 turning east at this intersection. SH-14 then overlaps US-64, unsigned, into Alva, the county seat. The route continues through Alva, where US-64 and unsigned SH-14 overlap US-281. On the east side of the town, US-281 splits off to the north; this intersection is the end of SH-14. History SH-14's southern terminus in Waynoka was established in 1941. State Highway 14 has its roots in the original 1924 state highway system. SH-14, as designated on August 24, 1924, was nearly a border-to-border route. It began at SH-5 east of Frederick and proceeded north to Manitou. It then intersected SH-7 in Snyder and ran through Mountain Park shortly thereafter. The route then zig-zagged to the northwest towards Roosevelt. It then ran due north to the Hobart area, beginning a concurrency with SH-9 east of that town. After SH-9 split off to the east, SH-14 entered Washita County, where it intersected no other highways, but ran through the towns of Rocky, Cordell (the county seat), and Bessie. Just after crossing into Custer County, the highway had a concurrency with SH-3; the two routes split up in Clinton. SH-14 continued on a due north course through Arapaho, Putnam, and Taloga. In Seiling, SH-14 turned west, overlapping SH-13 through Cestos to a point just east of Vici, where SH-14 split away from SH-13. SH-14 then passed through Sharon en route to Woodward. It concurred with SH-15 to Tangier, then split off to the north to run through Fort Supply before ending at SH-11 east of Buffalo. Unlike many of the other original highways, SH-14 was not immediately affected by the introduction of the United States Numbered Highways system in 1929. However, SH-14 underwent its first alteration in 1929, when it was extended south through Frederick and Davidson to the Texas state line. By the end of 1931, State Highway 14 had been realigned north of Seiling. From Seiling, the road continued north (rather than concurring with what was by then US-60 towards Vici) to Chester and Waynoka. From Waynoka, the route continued north along present-day U.S. 281 through Alva to the state line south of Hardtner, Kansas. (The old road north of Vici became part of SH-34.) New U.S. routes were added to Oklahoma's highway system in 1938. Among these were US-281, formerly a split route with one section in Kansas and one in Texas, which was connected in 1938 via Oklahoma; also added in 1938 was a southern extension of US-183. These two routes were overlaid onto SH-14, with US-183 entering the state from the south near Davidson and following the SH-14 route to Seiling, and US-281 taking the remainder of the route. SH-14 was rerouted to follow an independent routing northward from Waynoka (the present day routing) in 1940, and the section of the highway connecting Alva to the Kansas line was dropped (making this road solely US-281). The rest of the highway, still concurrent with US-183 and US-281, was decommissioned the following year, leaving SH-14 at its present-day termini. No changes have been made to SH-14 since.

Life Jos√© Antonio Estudillo was born in 1803 in Monterey, Alta California to Captain Jos√© Mar√≠a Estudillo, who was born in Andalusia, Spain. Jos√© Antonio Estudillo probably came to San Diego as a boy in 1820, when his father became commandant of the Presidio of San Diego.\\"The Estudillo Family\\", The Journal of San Diego History 15:1 (1969) by Sister Catherine McShane His brother Jos√© Joaqu√≠n was the second alcalde of Yerba Buena, the pueblo that later became San Francisco. Estudillo joined the Spanish Army at the Presidio and eventually made lieutenant around 1824. He received the Rancho Janal Mexican land grant in 1829 and Rancho San Jacinto Viejo in 1842. He was a member of the assembly from 1833 to 1835. By the time he reached adulthood, settlement around the fort (presidio) that his father had commanded had grown to become the early pueblo San Diego; Estudillo \\"followed\\" in his father's footsteps when, during 1837‚Äì38, he was Alcade and Juez de Paz of San Diego. At various times he was also the treasurer and tax collector. In 1827 Estudillo built a large L-shaped adobe house for his father on land granted by Governor Jos√© Mar√≠a de Echeand√≠a . The adobe was later enlarged and became U-shaped. It was considered one of the finest homes in Alta California. The house is still standing, known as Casa de Estudillo, and is one of the oldest surviving buildings in California. It is located in Old Town San Diego State Historic Park, on the southeast side of the Old Town San Diego plaza, and is designated a National Historic Landmark in its own right. The Estudillo family lived there until 1887, after which the home became a tourist attraction popularly known as \\"Ramona's Marriage Place,\\" based on the fictional character in Helen Hunt Jackson's novel Ramona. The house was obtained by the State of California in 1968, was restored to its original condition, and is now a museum open to the public. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War Estudillo remained neutral. After California became part of the United States in 1850, he was the first San Diego County assessor. Estudillo married Mar√≠a Victoria Dominguez (July 28, 1800\\"The Huntington Library, Early California Population Project Database, 2006.\\" ‚Äì October 19, 1875) in the Presidio of San Diego on March 1, 1824.\\"The Huntington Library, Early California Population Project Database, 2006.\\" She was the daughter of Mar√≠a de los Reyes and Sergeant Cristobal Dominguez, grantee of Rancho San Pedro.

Blair lies along West Virginia Route 17. According to the Geographic Names Information System, Blair has also been known as Ginseg, Ginseng, and Seng. In 1921, nearby Blair Mountain was the site of the West Virginia Mine Wars between thousands of coal miners who were attempting to unionize and federal troops which came to the aid of coal mine operators and local authorities. The federal troops prevailed and an unknown, but relatively small, number of people were killed in the fighting. Also, during the Battle of Blair Mountain, a part of the West Virginia Mine Wars, federal troops used bombs against miners that attempted to reach the top. Since the mid-1990s, Blair has been quickly depopulated by the expansion of Arco Coal Company's surface mine on Blair Mountain just above the town. Arco has bought out many local residents and filled in part of the valley upon which Blair rests with blasted rock from the mountain. About two-thirds of the approximately two hundred homes that constituted Blair in the early 1990s have since been demolished. In December 2005 a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit to stop Arco from getting the necessary permits to create more valley fills. At the time of writing, this lawsuit was not resolved.

The Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration was established by an Act of Parliament under Prime Minister R. B. Bennett in 1935 in response to the widespread drought, farm abandonment and land degradation of the 1930s. Its mandate was to: \\"... secure the rehabilitation of the drought and soil drifting areas in the Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, and to develop and promote within those areas, systems of farm practice, tree culture, water supply, land utilization and land settlement that will afford greater economic security...\\" With this mandate, the PFRA served to promote sustainable development on the rural prairies for over seven decades in the areas of air, water, soils, and biodiversity. Its mandate included detailed examination of various methods for soil conservation and enrichment. The PFRA tree nursery at Indian Head, Saskatchewan, which opened in 1901, distributed tree seedlings free of charge to prairie farmers to promote shelterbelt planting to reduce soil erosion caused by wind. PFRA also operated a network of Community Pastures across the prairies, which provided grazing for cattle and reproductive services on a cost-recovery basis. PFRA was also responsible for promoting and developing water supply projects across the prairie provinces, which included providing technical and financial assistance for individual farm water supply projects such as dugouts, wells, and pipelines, through a network of offices located across the Canadian prairie provinces. PFRA also planned and developed large scale, multi-use projects such as the St. Mary River irrigation district, the Bow River Irrigation Project, and the South Saskatchewan River Project (Gardiner Dam/Lake Diefenbaker).http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/prairie-farm- rehabilitation-administration/ PFRA was also responsible for the development of numerous community water supplies across the Canadian Prairies, and built and operated a network of flood irrigation projects in southwestern Saskatchewan. PFRA expanded its role in promoting soil conservation in the 1980s, staffing agrologists in most field offices to provide expertise and administer funding programs, such as the Permanent Cover Program, which provided funding to farmers in exchange for seeding marginal lands to forages and grasses for extended periods. PFRA also promoted rural development in the 1990s, becoming involved in a diverse range of activities intended to create value-added enterprises (e.g., agroforestry, aquaculture) across the Canadian prairies. In 2008, PFRA was integrated with the National Land and Water Information Service (NLWIS) and Agri-Environmental Policy Bureau (AEPB), as part of the Agri-Environment Services Branch (AESB). The Deficit Reduction Action Plan, which was part of the Federal Budget of 2011, mandated departments to identify savings proposals amounting to 5% and 10% of their total operating and grants and contributions expenditures. In 2012, the Federal government announced that it would be ending the Community Pastures Program. Shortly afterward, PFRA's field offices were phased out and workforce adjustment was implemented. Federal funding for the PFRA's shelterbelt program to provide free seedlings of trees and shrubs to prairie farmers was discontinued in 2013 by the Conservative Federal Minister of Agriculture, Gerry Ritz, thus ending a long era of very low cost erosion and drought control measures throughout the prairies.

An All- American at the University of Southern California in 1976, Jeter was drafted by the New York Giants in the first round (fifth overall) in the 1977 NFL Draft. College career After his graduation from Cathedral Latin School, Cleveland, Ohio, Jeter started every game at Defensive end for USC from his 3rd game in 1974 until his final game in the Rose Bowl in 1977 and was a member of 1974 National Championship team. In 1976 First-team All-American and while at USC he started in three Rose Bowls (1974, 1975, and 1977).

It has some re-recorded songs from Buckethead's band Deli Creeps, as well his earlier demo tape Bucketheadland Blueprints. Giant Robot has a more professional sound than its predecessor in terms of recording and production value; the re-recorded tracks have lost their initial \\"basement\\" or \\"video game\\" sounding beats and guitar licks. As with Bucketheadland, the album was originally only released in Japan. Unlike later Buckethead solo albums, the Bill Laswell produced Giant Robot contains many vocal contributions from guests such as Iggy Pop, Bill Moseley, Throatrake and Julian Schnabel's kids Stella and Vito. The album also features many high profile instrumentalists such as Sly Dunbar, Bootsy Collins and Karl Berger. The reason \\"Binge and Grab\\" is noted as being an \\"instrumental version\\" is because it was originally a Deli Creeps song with lyrics by Maximum Bob. There is no known studio recording of the Deli Creeps version but there are many bootleg copies from live shows which can be found among collectors. The track \\"Pure Imagination\\" features an introduction message that recalls Mudbone, a character that regularly appeared in the stand-up routines of comedian Richard Pryor. The cover art features a shadow of a giant robot and sets the tone for the music on the album. The original release contained a comic inside the booklet. Overall, the music has been described as \\"an equally unique sound from P-Funkadelic grooves, shoddy sci-fi dialogue samples and the wickedest six-string shredding this side of Steve Vai.\\" The album was re-issued in 2000 through CyberOctave, making it more widely available. Track listing =Welcome to Bucketheadland= \\"Welcome to Bucketheadland\\" is the second song of the album and was produced by Bill Laswell. An earlier version of the song, the Bootsy Collins produced \\"Park Theme\\", can be found on Buckethead's 1992 debut album Bucketheadland, featuring a different voice-over reciting of the song's title, as well as some other spoken words and a more \\"electronic feel\\", due to the use of a drum machine in contrast to the drumming of P-funk's Jerome Brailey on the 1994 version. Another version, \\"Park Theme Extension\\", is included on the second disc of Bucketheadland (the \\"dance remixes\\"), being longer and more electronica orientated. In 2007 Buckethead re-issued his 1991 demo tape Bucketheadland Blueprints with what might be the original version of the theme, \\"Intro to Bucketheadland\\". The song is used as the official theme to Buckethead's fictional \\"abusement\\" park Bucketheadland whose concept spans several of the artist's releases up to present. It is a fan-favourite and therefore often played as the last encore at concerts. JazzTimes wrote: \\"[I]t can leave you wondering if [Buckethead's] tongue is in his cheek or in his frontal lobes.\\"Grooves, JazzTimes, January/February 2001 Influences \\"Welcome to Bucketheadland\\" is highly influenced by early 1980s hard rock, incorporating a main riff reminiscent of Van Halen's \\"Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love\\" as well as using a bridge which reminds of the first guitar bars and 16th triplet note pull off runs of \\"Crazy Train\\" by Ozzy Osbourne. The song also contains a riff very similar to \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\" by Skid Row.Destroy All Monsters, Guitar Player magazine, 1996 Osbourne's then guitar player Randy Rhoads reportedly influenced Buckethead's playing. =Binge and Grab= Binge and Grab is a song written and originally performed by the Deli Creeps. Deli Creeps guitarist Buckethead's version Giant Robot is more commonly known. The Deli Creeps never recorded the song in the studio, but regularly played the song live. Live performances of the song were included on the Young Buckethead DVDs.  Buckethead version  Buckethead recorded an instrumental version for his second album, which also featured reinterpretations of the Deli Creeps' songs \\"Smilin' Charlie\\" (known as \\"Post Office Buddy\\" on the album) and \\"Random Killing\\" (Known as \\"I Come In Peace\\" on the album). The song met mixed reviews, ranging from \\"unironic 80s arena rocker\\" to getting high marks. The song is often mentioned as a fan favorite, becoming somewhat of a signature song, along with \\"Jordan\\" and \\"Nottingham Lace\\".50 fastest guitarists of all time, Guitar World, November 2008 Personnel ;Musical personnel *Buckethead ‚Äì guitars (all tracks), bass (tracks 3, 5, 17 and 19) *Bill Laswell ‚Äì sound effects (tracks 1, 5, 8, 15, 17 and 19), production *Throatrake ‚Äì vocals (tracks 4, 7, 10 and 19) *Bill Moseley ‚Äì vocals (tracks 3 and 11) *Iggy Pop ‚Äì vocals (tracks 4 and 17) *Stella Schnabel ‚Äì vocals (tracks 6 and 14) *Moma Collins ‚Äì vocals (track 5) *Julia Schnabel ‚Äì vocals (track 14) *Vito Schnabel ‚Äì vocals (track 14) *Kristen Gray ‚Äì vocals (track 17) *Bootsy Collins ‚Äì bass (tracks 2, 4, 7 and 8), vocals (tracks 5) *Jerome Brailey ‚Äì drums (tracks 2, 4, 7, 8, 14 and 15) *Ted Parsons ‚Äì drums (tracks 5, 10, 11 and 17) *Pinchface ‚Äì drums (tracks 3 and 18) *Karl Berger ‚Äì string arrangements (tracks 6, 13 and 14) *Sly Dunbar ‚Äì drum programming (track 19) ;Production personnel *Oz Fritz ‚Äì engineering, mixing *Imad Mansour ‚Äì engineering assistance *Howie Weinberg ‚Äì mastering ;Additional personnel *Stephen Walker ‚Äì artwork (booklet) *Jam Suzuki ‚Äì artwork (comic) *Mike Belongie ‚Äì photography References Category:1994 albums Category:Buckethead albums Category:Albums produced by Bill Laswell ","title":"Giant Robot (Buckethead album)"},{"id":"3678235","text":"Cumbria County Council in England is elected every four years.

He was the founder of Bethany Ashram order of monks and Bethany madom Order Of Nuns. He was the first M.A. degree holder in the Malankara Church. He also served as the Principal of the Kottayam M.D Seminary High School and as a professor at Serampore College.  Family history, childhood and education  Geevarghese Panicker was born in Mavelikkara, Kerala, India, on 21 September 1882 to Thomas Panicker and Annamma Panicker. He was a descendant of the aristocratic tharavad of Panickervettil in Mavelikkara within the erstwhile Indian princely state of Travancore, currently in the Alappuzha district of Kerala. The Panickervettil family was honored with the title of 'Mylitta Panicker' bestowed upon by Marthanda Varma, the Maharaja of Travancore. Panicker's family lineage also includes his being a grandson of the aristocratic Saint Thomas Christian family Polachirackal with their tharavad in Mavelikkara. The Polachirackal House held the highest-ranking hereditary title for a Christian family in Travancore being of nobility titled Tharakan and were of the highest-ranking Christian peer to the Maharaja of Travancore. The Polachirackal House through Saint Thomas Christian Syro-Malankara Catholic Church is acknowledged by Pope Pius XI (and continues to be so by the Holy See of the Vatican City) as one of the oldest Saint Thomas Christian families. The House had evolved from accumulating great wealth from their oligopoly in black pepper trading as part of the spice trade controlled by the Dutch East India Company during the age of discovery between the 16th and 18th centuries. The House's great wealth allowed them to become the court financiers to Marthanda Varma and finance the Kingdom of Venad during the Travancore‚ÄìDutch War in the 18th century against the Dutch East India Company. This culminated in funding the Battle of Colachel in 1741 leading to Marthanda Varma's defeat of the Dutch East India Company which was the first loss of its kind by a European naval superpower in the Indian sub-continent. The House were signatories to the Treaty of Mavelikkara in 1753 contributing to the establishment of the Kingdom of Travancore, diminishing the role of the Dutch East India Company in the Indian subcontinent and leading to the rise of Marthanda Varma and the Travancore royal family. Geevarghese Panicker had his early education in Protestant and government schools. From 1897 he attended M. D. Seminary High School, Kottayam and pursued his higher studies at Serampore College and Madras Christian College (M.C.C.). He completed his matriculation education in 1899: before which he received minor orders (of clerical life) on 20 September 1898. From a book \\"Archbishop Mar Ivanios\\" by Rev Fr Thomas Injakalodi,Vol. 1,(2006) Chapter-2 Page-27  Deacon  He was ordained deacon by Pulikkottil Dionysius then the Malankara Metropolitan of Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church on 9 January 1900, he then continued his studies at CMS College, Kottayam and obtained a bachelor's degree in Economics and Indian History from Madras Christian College. In 1907 he took a Master's Degree (MA) with distinction from the same college. On his return from Madras he was appointed principal of his Alma Mater, M.D.Seminary High School. During this time he led various schemes for the renewal of the Malankara Church. He organized basic church communities, commenced Bible conventions, because of this he was popularly entitled \\"Koodasa Semmasan\\" (Deacon of Sacraments).Fr. Thomas Inchakkalody, Archbishop Mar Ivanios, Vol. 1, (2006) pp. 72-74.  Priestly life  Newly ordained Ivanios in 1908 He was ordained to the priesthood as P.T. Geevarghese on 15 September 1908 by Vattasseril Dionysius then the Malankara Metropolitan of Malankara Orthodox Church. Geevarghese was popularly known as M A Achan, as he was the first priest with an MA degree in Malankara.Malayala Manorama, 29 July 1908 quoted in Fr. Thomas Inchakkalody, Archbishop Mar Ivanios Vol. 1 (2006), p. 89. At the same time, he took the initiative to empower the Malankara Church with hierarchical autonomy. He became instrumental to erect Catholicate for the Malankara Church on 5 September 1912. After the establishment of Catholicate in 1912 Malankara Church divided into two, one under the leadership of Malankara Metropolitan Vatteseril Dionysius (bishop's party) and one under Anthiochan Jacobite Patriarch(Bava Party). Fr.P.T Geevarghese was belonging to Bishop's party.  Professorship in Serampore  In 1912 Vattasseril Dionysius received an invitation to attend a conference at Calcutta. Dionysius selected Fr. Geevarghese to accompany him to Calcutta to attend the conference. At the conference, they met Dr. Howels the principal of Serampore College who requested the Metropolitan to avail the service of Geevarghese as the professor of the College. The Metropolitan permitted Geevarghese to take up the task. He made use of this opportunity to educate the Malankara Youth. About 20 young people from Kerala reached Calcutta for higher education.Fr. Thomas Inchakkalody, Archbishop Mar Ivanios Vol. 1, (2006), pp. 146-147 At Serampore, Geevarghese got more time for prayer and contemplation. He came across the writings of St. Basil on monasticism. The Basilian monastic vision had a great influence on him. Besides the visits to the Sabarmati Ashram of Mahatma Gandhi and Santiniketan of Rabindranath Tagore gave him a new vision of Indian Sanyasa (monasticism). These experiences made him to reflect upon starting an order of missionaries to carry out the task of evangelization in India.L. Moolaveettil, The Spiritual Life of Mar Ivanios, Kottayam, 1977, p.74 Slowly the residence of Geevarghese and his followers at Serampore became an Ashram (Monastery), and they began to live a sort of religious life according to the monastic rules of St. Basil, adapting them to Indian culture.Fr. Thomas Kuzhinapurath, \\"Mar Ivanios: Bharata Christava Sanyasathinte Pravachakan\\", Deepika, 15 July 1997. As he accepted this as his way of life, he resigned from the Serampore College.  Foundation of the Bethany Ashram  On his return from Calcutta, Geevarghese looked for a location to establish an ashram. One of his friends E. John Vakeel donated of land at Mundanmala, Ranni-Perunadu, Kerala at the meeting place of the rivers Pampa and Kakkatt. The place was thickly filled with thorny bushes and herbs. Geevarghese and his followers built a small thatched hut made out of the branches of trees and bamboo. This turned to be the first Ashram in Malankara on 15 August 1919. He prayerfully searched for a name for the Ashram and opened the Bible and he got the word \\"Bethany\\". He meditated upon it and came to the conclusion that it is an apt name for a religious order which upholds both contemplation and action.Fr. Thomas Inchakkalody, Archbishop Mar Ivanios (Vol.1), pp. 152-171 Eventually the Bethany Ashram became a place of pilgrimage and spiritual experience. Spiritual retreats and discourses were given by Geevarghese especially in Passion Week. Geevarghese envisioned the Ashram also being a shelter for the poor and the marginalized. Along with the Ashram, he started a house for the orphans. While at Serampore Geevarghese was thinking of the empowerment of the Syrian Christian women through education. To realize this idea, he took initiative to give education and training to the selected group of young girls with the help of the Epiphany Sisters of England working at Serampore. He founded the Bethany Madom (literally Bethany Great House or convent) for the women religious in 1925.  Bishop of Bethany  It was decided by the Malankara Synod to ordain P.T. Geevarghese as the Bishop of Bethany. He was ordained a bishop of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church by Baselios Geevarghese I on 1 May 1925. He received the name Geevarghese Ivanios.  Ecclesial communion  Benziger (front left) with other Indian bishops, on the far right Ivanios On 20 September 1930, Theophilos, John Kuzhinapurath OIC, Alexander Attupurath OIC, and Chacko Kiliyileth made the Catholic profession of faith before Aloysius Maria Benziger OCD, then the Bishop of Kollam. Many of the members of both the Bethany orders also came into full communion with the Roman Catholic Church. This spawned the Syro- Malankara Catholic Church.  Establishment of the Syro-Malankara Catholic hierarchy  In 1932 Ivanios made a pilgrimage to Rome for the reunion as per the letters from Rome and met Pope Pius XI. Ivanios received the pallium. He also participated in the thirty-second Eucharistic Congress held at Dublin, Ireland. There he met G.K. Chesterton, who said to Ivanios \\"The dignified Indian gentleman, who represented this far off triumph in the Orient, had changed his neighbours by bringing them to the Roman Communion.\\"G.K. Chesterton, From the Universe, quoted in Fr. Thomas Inchakkalody, Archbishop Mar Ivanios, Vol. 2, Kottayam, 2006, p. 125. On his return from Rome, Ivanios made efforts to build up the Unite Rite establishment of the Malankara Christian Community. Pope Pius XI established the Malankara Catholic hierarchy, Syro-Malankara Catholic on 11 June 1932 through the apostolic constitution Cristo pastorum principi.Pius XI,Cristo pastorum principi in Acta Apostolicae Sedis, XXIV (1932) 289-292.  Ecumenical endeavours and cultural development of the society  Ivanios sent missionaries to different parts of the land. Besides the newly joined Bishops and Priests from different Malankara denominations, he received missionaries from the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church. Joseph Kuzhinjalil, the founder of the congregation of the Daughters of Mary, was a missionary appointed by Ivanios to work in the southern parts of the land. Under Ivanios's leadership about 75 priests were joined from different denominations of the Malankara Church. About 150 parishes including mission stations were established.Syro-Malankara Catholic Directory, 1973 A lot of hindus (especially from Nadar (caste) community) also joined the Syro Malankara Catholic Church. Ivanios established about 50 schools, and one 'A' grade college, named Mar Ivanios College.Fr. Thomas Inchyakkalody, Archbishop Mar Ivanios, Vol. 2, Kottayam, 2006, p. 225. He visited U.S. President Harry S Truman, G.K. Chesterton, King George V of the United Kingdom, and George Bernard Shaw.  Silver Jubilee of Episcopal Ordination  The Silver Jubilee of the Episcopal Ordination of Ivanios was celebrated in 1951, and Pope Pius XII wrote to him remembering the reconciliation.Pius XII, \\"Letter to Archbishop Mar Ivanios\\" quoted in M. Gibbons, Mar Ivanios (1882-1953) Archbishop of Trivandrum: The Story of a Great Conversion, Dublin, 1962, p.127.

The group also has a chapter in Northern California. The organization's methodology revolves around the 'transference of pain' and it has been described as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. As of November 2009, the Saveourstate.org has become inactive and bears the message, \\"Saveourstate.org forums and website have been closed indefinitely.\\" The Northern California Chapter has since taken over direction of the organization. Origin The group takes its name from California's 1994 Proposition 187, known as the \\"Save Our State\\" initiative. The proposition, which would have denied taxpayer-funded health care and education to undocumented residents of California, was approved by a majority of voters in 1994 but was immediately challenged in court and was eventually struck down by a US district court four years later. The group was incorporated in July 2004 by Ventura resident Joseph Turner, who was unsatisfied with the existing immigration-reform groups whose letter-writing campaigns he deemed ineffectual. In an interview, Turner stated, \\"Our belief is that if that worked or had any sort of positive influence, we wouldn‚Äôt be in the situation we‚Äôre in.\\" In contrast, SOS's tactics are statedly \\"aggressive\\", and \\"in-your-face\\". Their language reflects this, intentionally eschewing what they perceive to be the political correctness that characterized the language of the 1990s. In the opinion of Turner and many of his supporters, political correctness and multiculturalism are both factors that contribute to the continued entry of illegal aliens into the United States. Tactics Laguna Beach, September 25, 2005. Members of Save Our State frequently travel outside of their hometowns to protest day labor sites in other communities, sometimes eliciting criticism from locals for doing so. They are known to carry signs, pepper spray and other weapons, and video cameras with which to post footage from the day's events to video-sharing services. The underlying philosophy of the protests is referred to by Turner as \\"the transference of pain\\", a tactic for which he credits his wife. Activities SOS and counterdemonstrators outside of a Home Depot in Glendale, California, December 10, 2005. SOS's first action was in December 2004, when, after launching a website with a forum, they announced a boycott of Home Depot for funding day labor centers on or near their store locations. This campaign continues to the present, and SOS members routinely travel to Home Depot locations to protest. =Baldwin Park= The group's next action provoked a great deal of controversy. SOS protested the monumental artwork Danzas Indigenas at the Metrolink station in Baldwin Park, California. The work, commissioned by the city and designed by UCLA professor, Chicana artist, and SPARC founder Judy Baca with community input, featured several inscriptions on Mission-style arches, two of which drew the ire of anti- illegal immigration activists. A quote from the Chicana writer Gloria Anzald√∫a reads, \\"This land was Mexican once, was Indian always and is, and will be again.\\" The other read \\"It was better before they came.\\" About the first quote, Turner stated, \\"It's seditious. It essentially talks about returning this land to Mexico.\\" About the second quote, which Baca states was actually uttered by a white Baldwin Park resident lamenting the influx of Mexicans after World War II, Baca has stated that it is deliberately ambiguous to allow the viewer's interpretation of \\"they\\" to reveal something about the viewer. SOS claims the referent of \\"they\\" is \\"white people\\". On May 14, 2005, approximately 25 members of Save Our State held signs in front of the monument. 300 counterprotesters also showed up, shouting such slogans as \\"Racists go home\\" and displaying the flag of Mexico when squaring off against the American flags carried by Save Our State. Police in riot gear were called in from several neighboring departments to maintain a wall of separation between the groups. One woman was injured; she was held overnight for observation but was released the next day. The event was covered in local newspapers, as well as by writers for the Los Angeles Independent Media Center, and in broadcast media by KPFK's Uprising and What's Right With America (WRWA), a conservative public-access television cable TV talk show in Santa Barbara, California. Baldwin Park Mayor Manuel Lozano has publicly defended the language of the monument as a work of art, therefore free expression, and has demonstrated his support for counterprotesting organizations with \\"handshake walk\\" among their ranks. He has publicly described Save Our State as a 'hate group'. Mayor Lozano led the Baldwin Park City Council to formally proclaim that the monument would remain intact on June 25, 2005. Alleged ties to extremist groups Save Our State has been described as an anti-immigrant hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.Southern Poverty Law Center Intelligence Project, 2005 In 2005, the SPLC reported that white supremacists had participated in Save Our State demonstrations, and stated that the Save Our State online forums frequently contain derogatory or hate-based statements about Mexicans and other Latinos.SPLCenter.org: Immigration protesters joined by neo-Nazis in California The same report quotes Turner as saying \\"there seems to be very little we can do to keep them from piggybacking off our activism. ... [W]e are unable to really do anything about it.\\" And admits that he has kicked several white supremacists off the forums, though he allows offensive comments to remain, as long as they do not advocate violence. SOS leaders have forced the most extremist of racist skinheads to leave their protests, and banned them from the group's events. However, protesters with Confederate flag clothing are still routinely reported to be seen at protests.

Founded in 1973 to supply the Bamangwato Concessions, Ltd copper and nickel mine, operations have expanded considerably since then to supply regional power plants and industries, especially the nearby Morupule Power Station. A small wash plant, with a production capability of 120 tonnes per hour, was commissioned in January 2008 to supply a higher quality coal to local and regional consumers. This project was supported by the Botswana government as a means of stimulating the local economy, producing a less polluting form of coal than the run-of-mine coal, and to provide an alternative to the unsustainable use of wood for cooking and heating. A major expansion to the colliery is planned for 2010 and 2011. The primary purpose of the expansion is to supply coal to the adjacent Botswana Power Corporation B phase 1 power station (600 MW) that is under construction in 2010 and 2011. The power station is required to allow Botswana to become self-sufficient in power generation (in 2010, around 84% of the country's power needs were imported, mostly from Eskom in South Africa, and Eskom has indicated a phased reduction in power supply starting in 2008). The colliery expansion will see production levels increase from just under 1 million tonnes per annum to 2.8 million tons per annum. The project began with feasibility studies and designs in 2007, construction on site began in September 2010, and first coal from the expanded mine and plant is expected in November 2011. The project budget is some P1.47 billion. The colliery currently employs around 320 people (mostly drawn from the nearby town of Palapye) and after the expansion will provide permanent employment to around 480 people. The expanded mine consists of increasing the number of continuous miner sections from two to four, constructing a new crushing and screening plant to replace the existing plant, and upgrading or constructing new offices and workshops. New houses will be constructed to house the expanded workforce. A connecting pipeline has been constructed to the North-South Carrier water pipeline some 15 km away near Palapye in order to supply surface water to the mine. While any coal mine has a negative environmental impact, and the coal burnt in a power station results in carbon dioxide emissions, the colliery has taken steps to make the negative environmental impact as low as possible: the colliery received ISO 14001 certification in 2010, and activities are controlled using a formal Environmental Management System. All required environmental permitting is in place and EIAs are publicly accessible on the Expansion Project website*. Use of water in a water scarce country is reduced by performing dry screening in the plant, storm water is captured and re-used, and replenishable surface water from the North-South carrier is used. Care was taken during design to construct a plant with a small footprint and the plant will be placed on previously disturbed ground. Energy saving initiatives (energy efficient motors, lighting and solar water heating etc.) have been incorporated into the design. The mine does not produce any discards, does not deposit fines on a slimes dam (these are dispatched to BPC to be burnt in the power station) and does not discharge any effluent water into the environment. While the colliery has mining rights over an area of some 170 square kilometers, mining is conducted below surface, and current land-use owners' rights to farm and graze cattle on tribal land have not been affected. No forced relocation of people living within the mining area has occurred. The colliery operates a small game park of some 1700 hectares in the area around the mine village, and this is used for conservation and to provide people of the area with recreation and environmental education. The coalfield is composed of four main seams, only one of which, the No. 1 Seam, is currently being mined, below surface, using bord and pillar mining methods and continuous miners. No pillar extraction occurs, and the mine design is conservative to prevent surface subsidence. The No. 1 Seam has an average height of 8.5 meters (28 ft), an average CV of around 23.5 MJ/kg (air-dry) and is located at an average depth of 80 meters (260 ft) below surface. Production over a recent 7-year stretch averaged 877,000 tonnes per year. Overall coalfield resources within the mining lease area estimated at 5 billion tonnes of coal.

Watts The Lark Ascending is a poem of 122 lines by the English poet George Meredith about the song of the skylark. Siegfried Sassoon called it matchless of its kind, \\"a sustained lyric which never for a moment falls short of the effect aimed at, soars up and up with the song it imitates, and unites inspired spontaneity with a demonstration of effortless technical ingenuity... one has only to read the poem a few times to become aware of its perfection\\".Siegfried Sassoon, Meredith (Constable, London 1948), pp. 163‚Äì64. The poem inspired the English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams to write a musical work of the same name, which is now more widely known than the poem. He originally composed it in 1914 for violin and piano. It premiered in 1920 in Shirehampton, Bristol, the same year the composer re- scored it for solo violin and orchestra.

It first appeared in The Fortnightly Review for May 1881, at a time when (as Meredith wrote in March 1881 to Cotter Morison) he was afflicted by \\"the dreadful curse of Verse\\". It was then included in his volume Poems and Lyrics of the Joy of Earth, which first appeared in an unsatisfactory edition in June 1883, and a month later was reprinted by Macmillan at the author's expense in a second issue with corrections. Siegfried Sassoon in his commentary on the 1883 Poems (\\"one of the landmarks of 19th-Century poetry\\") observed, \\"to write of such a poem is to be reminded of its incomparable aloofness from the ploddings of the journeyman critic\\".Sassoon, Meredith, pp. 159‚Äì164. ;Summary of themes It is a pastoral, devotional in feeling. The poem describes how \\"the press of hurried notes\\" run repeating, changing, trilling and ringing, and bring to our inner being a song of mirth and light like a fountain piercing the \\"shining tops of day\\". The joyfulness, purity and unrestrained delight of the \\"starry voice ascending\\" awakens \\"the best in us to him akin\\". The lark's song is the wine which lifts us with him in the golden cup, the valley of this world: the lark the woods and brooks, the creatures and the human line, the dance and the marriage of life within it. The hearts of men shall feel them better, shall feel them celestially, \\"as long as you crave nothing but the song\\". The poet's voice becomes choric. The human voice (the song proceeds) cannot express so sweetly what is inmost. Unlike the skylark, Man has not such a \\"song seraphically free/Of taint of personality\\". In the lark's song, the human \\"millions rejoice/For giving their one spirit voice\\". Yet there are those revered human lives, made substantial by trials and in loving the earth, which though themselves unsinging yet come forth as a song worthy to greet heaven. It rises in that pure song into the highest heavens and is maintained there, so that our soul rises with theirs \\"through self-forgetfulness divine\\", filling the skies, showering the world \\"from human stores\\", soaring nearer towards silence. Consciously or unconsciously, Meredith's theme expands upon the sonnet False Poets and True by Thomas Hood (1799-1845), addressed to William Wordsworth,\\"Sonnets. IV: False Poets and True\\", in Poems by Thomas Hood, 2 vols (Edward Moxon, London 1846), II, p. 39 (Google). and is of course in debt to Shelley's Ode To a Skylark.

She achieved success in the late 1980s and early 90s as the lead singer of the band All About Eve. AllMusic describes Regan as \\"certainly one of the more talented singers of the late eighties British goth rock scene\\". Early life (1962‚Äì1981) Julianne Regan was born in Coventry to a working class Catholic family of Irish and English descent. She has a younger sister, Lise. At the age of 15 she was given a Woolworths electric guitar by a male cousin and taught herself to play. From Zig Zag to The Swarm (1982‚Äì1984) Regan moved to London at the age of 19 and found work as a journalist for music magazine ZigZag, while also studying at the London College of Fashion. In her capacity as a journalist, she interviewed Gene Loves Jezebel and then subsequently joined that band on bass guitar. Soon after, apparently unhappy with the tension between the group's twin frontmen, she left to make music with good friend and former Xmal Deutschland drummer Manuela Zwingmann, while working in a book shop on Charing Cross Road after Zig Zag went bust. During this period she met, though friends of friends, both Andy Cousin and Tim Bricheno then both playing for goth band Aemotii Crii. The band that resulted, at first consisting of Regan, Zwingman, Bricheno and James Richard Jackson, was originally called The Swarm, but was changed to All About Eve after Regan and Zwingman watched the classic film at Regan's parents' house in Southport, Lancashire. All About Eve (first era) (1985‚Äì1992) The first line-up recorded the single \\"D For Desire\\" in 1985, but following disagreements around artistic direction between Zwingmann and Regan, the former left the band. Soon after this, Andy Cousin replaced Jackson on bass, thus creating the first well-known All About Eve line-up of Bricheno, Cousin and Regan, plus a drum machine. The group recorded demos and played several gigs. In 1986, Regan met ex-The Sisters of Mercy guitarist Wayne Hussey. Hussey was then recording the first Mission album God's Own Medicine and was so impressed with Regan's voice that he asked her to contribute backing vocals to the song \\"Severina\\". This started a close collaboration between the two bands that continues to this day, and at the time got All About Eve signed to the Mission's record label (on the back of them being support to the Mission's first tour and Regan appearing on several TV programmes with the Mission for performances of \\"Severina\\"). Regan also provides backing vocals on The Mission song \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and \\"Wishing Well\\", which appears on the US version of their early songs collection album The First Chapter. A full-time drummer Mark Price was recruited to All About Eve in 1988. Following a now- infamous appearance on the BBC television music programme Top of the Pops in July 1988, All About Eve soon hit the big-time with the first album and the single \\"Martha's Harbour\\" peaking within the top ten of the UK Albums Chart and UK Singles Chart respectively, along with four other top forty hits on the latter chart between the summers of 1988 and 1989. Bricheno left the band at the end of 1990 (and join The Sisters of Mercy), to be replaced by Church guitarist Marty Willson-Piper for All About Eve's third album, Touched by Jesus, for which David Gilmour from Pink Floyd also contributed guitar work on two songs. Touched By Jesus did not quite enjoy the commercial success of the first two albums and All About Eve subsequently changed record labels to MCA in 1992. Here they were to record their fourth (and final) studio album Ultraviolet ‚Äì a somewhat psychedelic move in which, as Regan later admitted, her vocals were mixed too far down into the swirling guitars, with the net result sounding something akin to Cranes or Spiritualized. This alienated fans, and the record did not make the Top 40. MCA dropped the band from their contract. Into the wilderness (1993‚Äì1995) Regan and the rest of the band parted company during the recording of what would have been All About Eve's fifth album. Cousin, Price and Willson-Piper completed it without her, and it eventually saw the light of day under the group name and title of Seeing Stars. Under the group name The Harmony Ambulance, Regan did release one single very soon after the All About Eve split for Geoff Travis' Rough Trade label. The double A-side, \\"Nature's Way\\" and \\"All This And Heaven\\", was something of a departure from the All About Eve style, and possibly for this reason, Regan turned down an offer to work full-time with that band. She also recorded vocals for the Schaft track \\"Broken English\\". Regan also occasionally performed live with Fairport Convention, singing some of the lead vocals on \\"Who Knows Where the Time Goes\\", \\"Blackwaterside\\", and \\"After Halloween\\". Some of these tracks can be found on the albums Circle Dance ‚Äì The Hokey Pokey Charity Compilation, Fairport Convention: 25th Anniversary Concert, and Cropredy Capers ‚Äì 25 Years of the Festival. Regan then dropped off the public radar. Rumours of a collaboration with Suede's Bernard Butler fluttered briefly and then died out. It later transpired that the rumours were true, but that during the recording session, she and Butler had fallen out in a spectacular fashion. \\"I don't really know why it exploded the way it did, but it did. It was a small thing that turned into a big thing, that turned into an enormous thing\\" was Regan's later analysis of these events. Mice (1995‚Äì1997) Revolving around a central core of Regan, Tim McTighe, former Levitation member Christian Hayes (aka 'Bic') and original All About Eve drummer Mark Price, Mice released their first single, \\"Mat's Prozac\\", in November 1995, which charted in the UK. This was followed by a second UK charting EP single \\"The Milkman\\" released in April 1996 with the Lynsey De Paul song Martian Man. Countrywide touring followed as did an album Because I Can recorded for indie label Permanent Records. Many collaborators took part in this band, including both Marty Willson-Piper and Andy Cousin which led to people questioning why this band was not launched as another incarnation of All About Eve. Regan said that this was deliberate in that she had wanted the new band to be just that. Musically, it did indeed sound somewhat harsher than All About Eve and Regan would later say of it, \\"It showed that I could be pre- raphaelitic but I still had to get on the bus and go to Tesco's.\\" With Because I Can making the Indie Top Ten, the future began to look fairly positive for Mice, but Permanent Records went out of business in 1997, owing Regan (and others) a lot of money and leaving the album and the three singles \\"Mat's Prozac\\", \\"The Milkman\\" and \\"Dear Sir\\" hanging in the shops without promotion or replacement. Jules et Jim (1999‚Äìpresent) Jules et Jim is a collaboration between Regan and Jean-Marc Lederman (formerly of The Weathermen and Gene Loves Jezebel). In 1999 they released a single, \\"Swimming\\", followed by a six-track EP, Subtitles in 2002. Regan also featured on Lederman's soundtracks for the computer games Fairies and Mystic Inn by Funpause, and Rock Legend by Positech; and also vocals on a number of tracks on Lederman's La Femme Verte album project.  All About Eve (second era) (1999‚Äì2006) Despite having previously been on public record expressing absolutely no wish to resurrect All About Eve, in late 1999 a Mission re-launch was underway and lead singer Hussey ‚Äì in a repeat of the first time All About Eve had become successful ‚Äì again asked Regan if she would like to support him on tour. Although she was already involved with Jules et Jim (who had put out an EP called Swimming earlier that year), Regan acquiesced, rounded up Price, Cousin and Wilson-Piper, and All About Eve were back (for full details see Recent times). When asked in 2001 why she had had a change of heart in terms of resurrecting All About Eve and their music, she replied: > I think I just really needed a break from it. It had lost its magic for me. > Totally. Also, for some reason, I had to have a bit of a rebellion against > AAE. Maybe it's something along the lines of why teenagers fall out with > their parents and find everything about them embarrassing... Then they grow > up a bit and realise that their Mum and Dad aren't too bad at all. All About Eve became dormant again in mid-2004 following a disagreement between Regan and Cousin, but 2006 has seen this rift apparently healed upon the release of Keepsakes ‚Äì an anthology of the group with extremely honest sleeve-notes. This record has seen even Bricheno recalled to the line-up, collaborating with Regan for a new song entitled \\"Raindrops\\". Although material for a fifth full All About Eve album had been worked on by Regan and fellow band-member Andy Cousin, it seemed unlikely that this album will be completed. In April 2009, Regan stated on her Facebook page: > All About Eve are dormant and may never happen again. I don't ever like to > say never though, but it seems we've all moved on and are exploring other > avenues.  Recent work  Regan's work since the last split of All About Eve includes: *Tim Bricheno ‚Äì with whom she wrote and recorded the song \\"Raindrops\\", which appeared on the All About Eve retrospective collection Keepsakes. In 2008, the duo recorded a new version of \\"Ophelia\\", a song which had originally been demo-ed for the All About Eve album Scarlet and Other Stories, but was never released.

Personal life  Regan graduated in 2014 from Bath Spa University in Bath, Somerset with a master's degree in Songwriting. As of 2016, she is a lecturer on the BA Commercial Music programme and MA Songwriting at the university's College of Liberal Arts. In a March 2008 BBC News Magazine article regarding gender stereotypes too often influencing which musical instrument schoolchildren learn, the electric guitar is still seen as a male instrument, despite great female exponents in recent years, according to Regan. Based on her own experiences, she said: > There was no opportunity to learn anything other than traditional orchestral > instruments at school and so I muddled along on my own and felt quite > isolated as I went to an all-girl school and none of my peers seemed to have > any interest in electric guitar. It seemed like a freakish thing for me to > be interested in. I was quite popular at school and had a load of friends, > but this was just seen as 'one of my little quirks'.

The genus has about 500 species and has a cosmopolitan distribution. The highest diversity is in eastern Asia, with about 208 species in China alone; the region from Mexico to Brazil has at least 100 additional species; Africa (at least 17 species), North America (at least 18 species), and Europe (at least 5 species) have much lower diversity. Polystichum species are terrestrial or rock-dwelling ferns of warm-temperate and montane-tropical regions (a few species grow in alpine regions). They often are found in disturbed habitat such as road cuts, talus slopes, and stream banks. Description Many ferns of this genus have stout, slowly creeping rootstocks that form a crown, with a vase-like ring of evergreen fronds long. The sori are round, with a circular indusium, except in South American species which lack an indusium. The stipes have prominent scales with often have hair- like cilia, but lack any true hairs. The genus differs from the well-known and allied fern genus Dryopteris in the indusium being circular, not reniform, and in having the leaf segments with auricles‚Äîasymmetrical blades where one side of the segment is much longer than the other at the base. =Apomixis= Apomixis, the development of an embryo without the occurrence of fertilization, is particularly common among ferns. Apomixis evolved several times independently in three different clades of polystichoid ferns.Hong-Mei Liu, Robert J. Dyer, Zhi-You Guo, Zhen Meng,Jian-Hui Li, Harald Schneider (2012) The Evolutionary Dynamics of Apomixis in Ferns: A Case Study from Polystichoid Ferns Journal of Botany Volume 2012 (2012), Article ID 510478, 11 pages https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2012/510478  Taxonomy  Polystichum is one of the 10 largest fern genera and is grouped within the Dryopteridaceae. Polystichum s.l. is well defined as its own monophyletic group, including species from the genera Cyrtomidictyum, Cyrtogonellum, Cyrtomium, and Phanerophlebia. Research concerning taxonomy within Polystichum s.s. is ongoing, with high levels of hybridization, allopolyploidy, and apomixis making distinctions difficult. Based on genetic analysis Little & Barrington (2003) originally defined a monophyletic Polystichum s.s. by removing Cyrtomium as its own genus. It was further separated by Li et al. (2008) into a separate clade along with Phanerophlebia. =Selected species= The genus has a large number of species. The PPG I classification suggested that there were about 500 species; , the Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World listed 397 species and 58 hybrids, noting that \\"many undescribed species remain\\". The genus Polystichum includes, but is not limited to, the following species.

Missouri Botanical Garden. 20 Jan 2012  Distribution  With species in six continents and many islands, Polystichum is remarkable for its global spread. Polystichum ferns first emerged in Asia during the late Eocene, around 49 million years ago. During this period there were high temperatures across the globe, which may have contributed to the diversification of flora. Polystichum's spread to the New World took place during the late Eocene to early Oligocene. The most likely dispersal method was across a paratropical forest on a Pacific Ocean land bridge, such as the Bering Land Bridge. For a period before the height of the Ice Age temperatures froze enough seawater to lower the sea level but still allowed a forest to grow in Northern latitudes. From there Polystichum was able to spread through North American and into Central America. Original theories described Polystichum spreading further into South America from Central America, but recent research has shown that South American Polystichum instead spread through long-distance dispersal from Australia. Genetic study has revealed close evolutionary relationships between Polystichum species in these two areas. Both Austral and Austral South American species lack and indusium. Austral Polystichum lack cilia, while South American species have marginal cilia. Hawaiian Polystichum also spread through long-distance dispersal, with two separate dispersal events leading to the three Polystichum now observed in Hawaii. Ecology Polystichum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Pharmacis fusconebulosa. Specimens of some of these can be found at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney. Cultivation Several species are grown as ornamental plants in gardens, notably P. setiferum. One species, P. tsus-simense of eastern Asia, is commonly offered as a houseplant.

Early history Juan Bandini was born in 1800 in Lima, Peru to Jos√© Bandini, a Spanish sea captain. His father came to California in 1819 and in 1821 participated in the Mexican War of Independence. After the revolution, his father's family moved to San Diego, arriving on September 1, 1834 on the brig Natalie. Marriage and family Bandini married Marie de los Dolores Estudillo on November 20, 1822. She was born c. 1808, daughter of Captain Jos√© Mar√≠a Estudillo. They had three daughters, Arcadia, Ysidora, and Josefa, and two sons, Juanito and one who died in childhood. Bandini's second wife was Refugia Arg√ºello, daughter of Santiago Arg√ºello. They had three sons, Juan de la Cruz, Alfredo, and Arturo, and two daughters, Dolores and Victoria. Bandini built a large U-shaped house, Casa de Bandini, in 1829. Initially it had 12 rooms and was one-story. Bandini was forced to sell his house in 1859 due to financial losses. Part of the building was converted into a store. His house was later converted to the Cosmopolitan Hotel in 1869, with a second story and wraparound porch added. The house still stands in Old Town San Diego, at the east corner of the town square, and has recently been fully remodeled and reopened as a hotel and restaurant. Originally the house and hotel were not stuccoed‚Äîthat was added in modern times to make it look \\"Spanish Colonial\\". The Casa de Bandini, now the Cosmopolitan Hotel in San Diego Civic life Bandini served various public offices such as member of the assembly, sub-comisario of revenues, and substitute congressman. Rancho Jurupa Juan Bandini was granted and occupied Rancho Tecate in 1836. However he was soon driven to abandon it by raids to plunder the ranchos around San Diego by bands of fugitive neophytes, rancho employees, and natives from the interior in 1836-1837. This is now the town of Tecate.Hubert Howe Bancroft, History of the Pacific States of North America (Volume 15), CALIFORNIA, VOL. III. 1825-1840, A. L. BANCROFT & COMPANY, PUBLISHERS, 1885, p. 614 In 1838, the Mexican government granted him Rancho Jurupa in modern-day San Bernardino County and Riverside County.Jurupa grant (Riverside and San Bernardino counties, Calif.): Juan Bandini, claimant : case no. 213, Southern District, 1838-1879. from cdlib.org accessed May 21, 2014 During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Bandini supported the Americans. With Santiago Arguello he issued an appeal to not resist the Americans. After the war, Bandini was increasingly critical of the U.S. government, especially the Land Act of 1851 that allowed Mexican land grants to be challenged. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with Mexico, in 1848, had guaranteed the land grants would be recognized. During March 29‚ÄìSeptember 27, 1848 he was Juez de Paz (Justice of the Peace) of San Diego Pueblo. In 1850 he opened a store in San Diego and built the Gilla House hotel. Soon after he moved to Mexico then in 1855 to Los Angeles where he died in 1859. Public perception Bandini was dressed elegantly and always gracious, and cut a refined presence wherever he went. He was known as a charming public speaker, fluent writer, excellent dancer, fair musician, and fine horseman. His home was the social center of San Diego. Bandini had a gift of sardonic humor and enjoyed sarcasm. Richard Henry Dana Jr. in Two Years Before the Mast said of him: :He had a slight and elegant figure, moved gracefully, danced and waltzed beautifully, spoke the best of Castilian, with a pleasant and refined voice and accent, and had throughout the bearing of a man of high birth and figure. Seeing him again one evening, Dana said he :gave us the most graceful dancing that I had ever seen. He was dressed in white pantaloons, neatly made, a short jacket of dark silk gaily figured, white stockings and thin Morocco slippers upon his very small feet. His lifestyle and hospitality often got him into trouble financially, requiring his children to bail him out in later years.

Origins Its origins go back to the Charles City-Henrico County Regiment of Militia founded in 1652. During the French and Indian War, the Virginia Regiment was organized and was the only colonial regiment incorporated into the British line (1754-1763) and saw action at the Battle of Jumonville Glen, Fort Necessity, and the Braddock and Forbes expeditions. Its most notable Commander was Colonel George Washington. Involvement in American Revolutionary War With the heightened political tensions of the 1770s, the regiment was raised again, on July 17, 1775, at Williamsburg, Virginia. As the primary state militia unit, the Virginia regiment later saw service with the (U.S.) Continental Army. The regiment saw action at the Battle of Great Bridge, New York Campaign, Battle of Trenton, Battle of Princeton, Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Germantown, Battle of Monmouth, Battle of Stony Point and the Siege of Charleston. Most of the regiment was captured at Charlestown, South Carolina, on May 12, 1780, by the British and the regiment was formally disbanded on November 15, 1783. Later Years During the Mexican American War 1846‚Äì1848, the 19th regiment of the Virginia Militia was mustered into Federal Service and renamed the 1st Virginia Volunteers. However, this regiment did not have the regimental lineage of the original Virginia Regiment, but was the descended from the Richmond City Regiment. During the American Civil War (1861-1865) there was a 1st Virginia Infantry raised in the Confederate Army, but disbanded after the war. Today the 276th Engineer Battalion (United States) of the Virginia National Guard maintains the regimental lineage of the 1st Virginia Volunteers.

History The lyrics were written by Theodor \\"Dr. Seuss\\" Geisel, the music was composed by Albert Hague, and the song was performed by Thurl Ravenscroft. The song's lyrics describe the Grinch as being unpleasant, foul-smelling, bad-mannered, despicable, and diabolical, using increasingly creative put-downs, metaphors, similes and off-hand comments by the singer, beginning with the opening line \\"you're a mean one, Mr. Grinch\\". Because Ravenscroft was not credited in the closing credits of the special, it is often mistakenly attributed to Boris Karloff, who served as narrator and the voice of the Grinch in the special but who himself could not sing.

He has previously featured in the Football League for Lincoln City and Cheltenham Town after starting his career with Nottingham Forest. Finnigan has also featured in non-league football for the likes of Bishop's Cleeve and the season after arriving at Kidderminster Harriers he took charge of the team as manager on an interim basis following the departure of Mark Yates to Cheltenham Town. Career Born in Wakefield, Finnigan began his career with Nottingham Forest however failed to make an appearance at the City Ground and was loaned out to Lincoln City for his first spell with the club in 1998. He made his first league appearance for Lincoln in April 1998 against Macclesfield Town and featured in the Imps promotion to Division Two. On his release by Nottingham Forest, Finnigan signed permanently for Lincoln City and for the 2000/01 season he was made team captain. Finnigan missed a large chunk of the 2001/02 season with a neck injury and after four years at Sincil Bank he left the club in March 2002 to join Cheltenham Town. In his first season with Cheltenham Town, Finnigan helped Cheltenham to promotion via the play- offs, scoring in the play-off final against Rushden & Diamonds at the Millennium Stadium, and also received the 'Player of the Season' award at Whaddon Road. He was made captain at the club and in 2006 he signed a new two- year contract under manager John Ward to keep him at Cheltenham until the summer of 2008. Finnigan then signed a contract extension to keep him at Cheltenham until 2010 alongside striker Steven Gillespie in August 2007. Finnigan suffered an injury which kept him out of action for a year in 2007. In the close season of 2009, Finnigan was released by Cheltenham, with the remaining one year on his contract cancelled by mutual consent, quoting 'it was time to move on'.

Joe. The series led to widespread usage of the term \\"G.I. Joe\\" during World War II and later.Famous Artists and Writers, King Features Syndicate, 1949. Dave Breger was his signature and the byline on his books. During World War II, his cartoons were signed Sgt. Dave Breger. Early life Growing up in Chicago, where he was born of native Russian parents, butcher Benjamin Breger and Sophie Passin Breger, only a few weeks after they arrived in the United States from Ukraine. As a youth, Breger had encounters with the local gangsters while working at his father's sausage factory. In 1926, he acquired his high school diploma from Crane Technical School, where he drew cartoons signed Irving Breger for the school paper. He studied architectural engineering at the University of Illinois and then transferred to Northwestern University, where he edited the campus humor magazine, Purple Parrot, while studying pre-med and psychology. He had no schooling in art or cartooning, and his college cartoons were drawn in a style similar to John Held, Jr.Harvey, Robert C. American National Biography: Supplement 2. Oxford University Press, 2005. Graduating from Northwestern in 1931 with a degree in abnormal psychology, he spent a year traveling the world, visiting Russia and Africa; during that period he sold cartoons to the German magazine, Lustige Bl√§tter. He returned to Chicago and the sausage stockyard, rising to the position of office manager of his father's firm, where he devised the company slogan, \\"Our Wurst Is the Best\\". His first marriage, with fashion model Evelyn Breger, lasted five years. In 1937, after receiving a $30 check from The Saturday Evening Post, Breger arrived in New York and began freelancing to Collier's, Parade, This Week, Esquire, Click and The New Yorker. World War 2 Dave Breger's World War 2, Private Breger postcard #306. Caption: \\"That soldier's here, Sir, about a new paratrooper uniform to deceive the enemy.\\" Early in 1941, he was drafted into the United States Army and sent to Camp Livingston in Louisiana, where he repaired trucks. He drew at night in the bakery or while sitting in a truck with netting overhead to keep the bugs away. The Saturday Evening Post, under the heading Private Breger, began publishing these cartoons as a series starting August 30, 1941. The Army became aware of his talent and transferred him to the Special Services Division in New York, where he married Brooklyn- born art agent Dorathy Lewis on January 9, 1942. In the early spring of 1942, he was assigned to the New York staff of Yank, the Army Weekly.\\"The Press: Cartoonist Soldier\\". Time, April 5, 1943. Yank wanted Breger to do cartoons like those in The Saturday Evening Post, but the editors asked him to devise a new title. He came up with the title G.I. Joe from the military term \\"Government Issue\\", and the character's full name was Joe Trooper. His G.I. Joe cartoon series began in the first issue of Yank (June 17, 1942). That summer, Breger arrived in the UK in 1942 as one of the first two Yank correspondents, covering the American military in England as a photo- journalist, while also producing his weekly G.I. Joe cartoon for Yank. King Features Syndicate took an interest and signed Breger on to do a Private Breger (aka Private Breger Abroad) daily panel for domestic distribution. It was launched October 19, 1942 and continued until October 13, 1945. He soon became one of the most famous and widely read of the World War II cartoonists, and the term \\"G.I. Joe\\" was adopted first by soldiers and then the homefront as the popular term for the American foot soldier. (Hasbro's G.I. Joe is a different character, developed by Larry Hama and trademarked as \\"G.I. Joe, A Real American Hero.\\") In 1942, Breger illustrated the sheet music for Irving Berlin's \\"I Left My Heart at the Stage Door Canteen\\".Markstein, Don. Toonopedia: Private/Mister Breger (aka G.I. Joe) G.I. Jerry Breger also produced G.I. Jerry, satirical cartoons about Hitler and others in the Nazi regime. There also was a postcard series titled Private Breger.Private Breger Postcards The character remained a private throughout World War II, while Breger himself was promoted through the ranks to corporal, sergeant and eventually lieutenant. His August 25, 1945 cartoon was signed Lt. Dave Breger, indicating his final military rank. From 1943 to 1946, Private Breger was reprinted in David McKay's Ace Comics (1943‚Äì46) and Magic Comics (1945). Mister Breger Dave Breger's Mister Breger (1945‚Äì1970) was originally Private Breger during WWII.Returning to civilian life after World War II, Breger also had his character become a civilian. Private Breger was discharged, and on October 22, 1945, the title was altered from Private Breger to Mister Breger. The Mister Breger Sunday strip was added on February 3, 1946. Vacationers could write friends with the set of Mister Breger postcards, Mister Breger on Vacation.Mister Breger on Vacation Recurring themes in the strips and panels included jail, weddings and Breger employed as a bank teller. In one cartoon, Breger predicted that since television showed so many old movies, the day would come when movie theaters would turn to vintage television for product. This prediction came true with the advent of such TV- based films as Mission: Impossible and Star Trek. Mister Breger also received comic book reprints in The Katzenjammer Kids (1947), Popeye (1967), Beetle Bailey (1969) and Flint Comix and Entertainment (2009‚Äì10). In 1946, Breger became a founding member of the National Cartoonists Society. Dave and Dorathy Breger settled in West Nyack, New York, where they had three children--Dee, Lois and Harry. They were, according to Breger, \\"all three artistic\\".National Cartoonists Society In the 1960s, Breger taught a cartooning course at New York University, developing his lesson plans into a book, How to Draw and Sell Cartoons (1966). When Breger died in 1970, he was cremated at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. Mister Breger continued to run as a daily panel until March 21, 1970. The final Sunday was published the following day, two months after his death. Books Between 1942 and 1951, Breger did five books collecting his Army cartoons. Private Breger in Britain (1944), published in London by Pilot Press Ltd., included an introductory discussion on Anglo-American humor between Breger and Michael Barsley. Squads, Write was a 1951 postcard book with 32 cards printed 6\\" √ó 11\\" on postcard quality paper. In But That's Unprintable (1955) Breger wrote about newspaper and magazine taboos and illustrated his text with 135 unpublished cartoons by leading cartoonists, including Bo Brown, Milton Caniff, Irwin Caplan, Eric Ericson, Stan Fine, Rube Goldberg, Leo Garel, Don Flowers, Phil Interlandi, Reamer Keller, Fred Lundy, Jack Markow, Charles E. Martin, Fred Neher, Russell Patterson, Mort Walker and George Wolfe. The material is arranged in such chapters as bodily functions, clothing, death, mental illness, sex and words. Awards and exhibitions Northwestern University honored him in 1946 with an Alumni Merit Award for distinguishing himself in his field of endeavor. An exhibition of Breger cartoons, WWII and Private Breger, was displayed at Syracuse University's Ernest S. Bird Library from February 28 to April 6, 1979. Syracuse University Library's Special Collections Research Center has Breger's papers (more than 90 items of correspondence) plus 2,414 of his cartoons, including 377 of the World War II cartoons.

Southern theater 1775‚Äì1776  While Colonel Patrick Henry of the 1st Virginia Regiment was technically the commander-in-chief of Virginia's forces, correspondence between the President of Virginia's Committee of Safety Edmund Pendleton and Colonel Woodford indicates that this was a political decision in recognition of Henry's efforts prior to the outbreak of hostilities. While Henry was a politician, Woodford had served in the French and Indian War and had real military experience. For this reason, the Pendleton decided to keep Henry in Williamsburg, Virginia, while dispatching the 2d Virginia Regiment to meet Governor Dunmore's small \\"army\\" composed of detachments of the 14th Regiment of Foot, Marines, runaway slaves who had been formed into the Ethiopian Regiment. The 2d Virginia Regiment, along with elements of the Culpeper Minute Battalion, engaged the British at the battle of Great Bridge (modern day Chesapeake Virginia), which was a decisive victory. Colonel William Woodford, reporting on the 2d Virginia Regiment's Service at the Battle of Great Bridge, wrote in a letter published in Purdie's Virginia Gazette, December 15, 1775: \\"This was a second Bunker's Hill affair, in miniature; with this difference, that we kept our post, and had only one man wounded in the hand.\\" Minor fighting would continue in Hampton and Norfolk, including the burning of Norfolk, which at the time was not only Virginia's largest city, but also a Loyalist stronghold. Originally raised for one year's state service, the 2d Virginia was accepted by Congress for Continental service on February 13, 1776, and reorganized at Suffolk as part of the Continental Army. Dunmore would remove his force to Gywnn's Island, a small island where the Rappahannock River meets the Chesapeake Bay, where they would stay for several months along with a small flotilla of Royal Navy and loyalist ships. By July 1776, Virginia had expanded its forces to include several more infantry regiments and an artillery regiment under the command of General Andrew Lewis. The Virginia forces, including the 2d Virginia Regiment, would bombard Dunmore's position from a shore battery before launching an amphibious assault on the island. By the time the Virginians made it ashore, Dunmore's force withdrew to its ships and sailed away. They would raid Stafford County in late July 1776 before sailing for New York City.  Philadelphia campaign, 1777‚Äì1778  In December 1776, the 2d Virginia Regiment was ordered to join Washington's Main Army in New Jersey. Colonel Woodford was promoted to brigadier general and Alexander Spottswood became colonel of the 2d Virginia Regiment on February 21, 1777. The regiment marched to Baltimore, Maryland, where it was equipped and then dispatched to Maryland's Eastern Shore to suppress local Loyalists, before making their way to Philadelphia for clothing, and finally joined the Main Army as part of Weedon's Brigade in Greene's Division. In August 1777, Washington marched his army to counter the British landing at Head of Elk, Maryland, with the objective of Philadelphia. A detachment of the 2d Virginia Regiment fought as part of Maxwell's Light Corps, a provisional formation made up of drafts of 100 men from each brigade, under Lt. Colonel Richard Parker at the battle of Cooch's Bridge on September 3, 1777. Greene's Division of Virginians had held off the British advance at the closing of the Battle of Brandywine, allowing the rest of the army to withdraw in good order. They were in the thick of confusion at the Battle of Germantown, so thick in fact that the 9th Virginia Regiment of Mulenburgh's Brigade fought with such success that it found itself cut off and captured to a man. Stephen's Brigade was engaged in an embarrassing example of \\"friendly fire\\" with Wayne's Brigade as they too had to retreat after pressing so much further than the Pennsylvanians mistook them for the British in the fog of battle because of the direction they were coming from. The 2d Virginia Regiment again served with distinction, as reflected in the Virginia Gazette, October 17, 1777: \\"The heroism and gallantry of the second Virginia regiment I cannot help particularly mentioning; they would do honour to any country in the world. It is universally believed they behaved the best of any troops in the field.\\" Colonel Spotswood resigned after the Battle of Germantown to return to Virginia to take care of the family as he mistakenly thought his brother had been killed (he had in fact been wounded and captured). He was replaced by Colonel Christian Febiger, a Danish-born officer, who would command the regiment the rest of its existence. The 2d Virginia Regiment entered winter quarters at Valley Forge, emerging in June 1778 to fight at the Battle of Monmouth on June 28, 1778. The Philadelphia Campaign had left the Virginia Line in shambles, depleting both men and supplies. On September 14, 1778, the 2d Virginia Regiment is officially consolidated with the 6th Virginia Regiment to make a \\"new\\" 2d Virginia Regiment. Colonel Febiger retains his command and Lt. Colonel Simms of the 6th Virginia Regiment becomes his new second in command. Even with this new consolidation, the regiments were understrength, and from this point forward would never operate as a \\"regiment\\" again. While encamped around New York City in both the Hudson Highlands and Northern New Jersey, officers deemed supernumerary were given new assignments (while officially holding their prior titles) and parties of men would be assigned duties under various captains. A return written by Inspector General Steuben indicates that the regiment only had 180 rank and file, which could form two divisions. It was decided that it would brigade with the 5th and 11th Virginia Regiments to \\"compose a Battalion\\" and that these there regiments would \\"furnish 61 Men for the Light Infantry\\". This light infantry \\"company\\" would be attached to Wayne's Corps of Light Infantry and took part in the storming of Stony Point in July 1779. Colonel Febiger would be one of these \\"supernumerary\\" officers and was assigned to command one of the composite battalions of light infantry in this attack. A month later, Captain Catlett and 50 men of the regiment would be under \\"Light Horse Harry\\" Lee at Paulus Hook (present day Jersey City) and was credited with covering the retreat from capturing this post. At this point, regimental history becomes very confusing to track. Given the number of men fit for duty, these \\"regiments\\" are not really \\"regiments\\" at all any more, yet they are still named as such. In 1780, the word \\"Detachment\\" comes into use, describing a 700-man conglomeration of these \\"regiments\\" ‚Äì larger than a regiment or battalion, smaller than a division. Colonel Febiger is sent to Philadelphia to arrange supplies for the Southern Army and then onto Virginia for recruiting. Three detachments are made out of recruits in Virginia and the remaining Virginia Continentals outside of New York City. The 2d Virginia Detachment is formed out of various regiments under the 2d Virginia Regiment's original colonel, Brigadier General William Woodford, including elements of the 2d Virginia Regiment and Lt. Colonel Gustavus Brown Wallace, Major Charles Pelham, Captains Alexander Parker and Benjamin Taliaferro can be placed with this detachment. The 3rd Virginia Detachment would be formed under Colonel Abraham Buford and was composed of elements of the 7th Virginia, as well as various pieces of other units, including two companies of the 2nd, Capt. Alexander Parker's and Capt. Thomas Catlett's. It is known that Captains Francis Cowherd and John Stokes were also with this detachment.  Southern theater 1780  The 1st and 2d Virginia Detachments were sent to Charlestown, South Carolina, where they were captured with the surrender of the town on May 12, 1780. The 3rd Virginia Detachment, delayed in marching, was also sent to Charleston, but as Buford approached the city, he learned of its fall and began a march to Hillsborough, NC. Lt. Colonel Banastre Tarleton of the British Legion caught up to Buford at Waxhaws, asked for his surrender, and when it was not given, cut the 3rd Virginia Detachment to pieces. Captain Stokes would receive several cuts to the face and Captain Catlett was killed. Captain Alexander Parker escaped what Americans later termed a \\"massacre\\" and made it back to Virginia. Some stragglers would make it back to Chesterfield Courthouse, south of Richmond, where Colonel Christian Febiger was now in charge of the recruiting effort to raise new Virginia Continental regiments. These men would find themselves in new Virginia regiments including two regiments of 18-month levies raised in December 1780 under Colonel John Green and Lt. Colonel Samuel Hawes (former captain of the 2d Virginia Regiment in 1775) which would eventually be named the 1st and 2d Virginia Regiments, as well as a Continental regiment technically commanded by Colonel Febiger, but operationally in the field commanded by Lt. Colonel Thomas Gaskins. The \\"new\\" 1st and 2d Virginia Regiments would fight with General Nathanael Greene's army in the Carolinas at the Battle of Guilford Court House, the siege of Ninety- Six, Battle of Hobkirk's Hill, and Battle of Eutaw Springs. Gaskins' Battalion would be assigned to a Continental detachment under General Lafayette during the Virginia Campaign in 1781, and later the Main Army under Washington at Yorktown, but were consistently held in reserve and never saw actual fighting. The men of Gaskins' Battalion were reorganized in December 1781 under Thomas Posey, another former 2d Virginia Regiment officer, and join General Anthony Wayne's detachment sent south to South Carolina and Georgia. They would see fighting against Loyalists and Indians outside of Savannah at the Battle of Ogeechee Creek in the spring of 1782. They would also be present at the evacuation of Charleston. Some men also were part of a company of Virginia Continentals who survived Charleston and the Waxhaws which fought at the Battle of Cowpens in January 1781. While these officers and men had served in the 2d Virginia Regiment, none of these regiments can officially be tied to the lineage of the original regiment formed in 1775. The regiment was formally disbanded on November 15, 1783.

Built in 1732-35, it is notable for its unique Georgian design, and is one of the best-preserved colonial churches in the southern United States. The church is the only colonial Virginia church that still has its original high-backed pews and one of two that has maintained its original three-tiered pulpit. History The first church erected at the site was a wooden building, the construction of which was funded by powerful landowner John Carter in 1670. Carter died before the construction was completed, but was buried on the church grounds alongside four of his five wives. John Carter's son Robert, a wealthy vestryman and planter, decided that the parish deserved a more substantial place of worship and, in 1730, funded and supervised the construction of a brick building on the approximate foundations of the old wooden church. Christ Church was connected to Robert Carter's Corotoman mansion by way of a cedar-lined road, in order to emphasize the importance of the benefactor and his family. The church thrived until the disestablishment of the Anglican church in Virginia in 1786. This event, coupled with the Glebe Act of 1802, which authorized the state to seize church property, crippled the Anglican (now Episcopal) church in the state, and Christ Church lost both money and parishioners. Operating only intermittently in the 19th century, the church fell into disrepair; the Carter family tombs in the yard were subject to weathering and neglect, and vandals stole bricks from the exterior. Still, the church fared better than many other colonial churches, and in 1927 the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities began work on restoration of the site. Architecture The unknown original architect endowed the structure with many of the hallmarks of the Georgian style, including a formal, symmetrical layout, pedimented facades, and classical detail. Among the more noted features of the church's interior are its high-backed box pews, which held entire families at service. Its unique wineglass pulpit reflected contemporary Anglican church practice to deemphasize mystery in religious observance‚Äîit is located in the building's center, and the three levels of lecterns were intended to show the relative importance of the readings delivered there. The bottom tier was for community announcements, the middle for the gospel, and the top tier was reserved for the delivery of the sermon. Current use Today, Christ Church is owned and operated as a museum by the non-profit Foundation for Historic Christ Church, which has almost completely restored its 18th-century appearance. The church was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961. Religious services are still held at 8:00 a.m on Sundays in the summer months in cooperation with nearby Grace Church.http://www.graceepiscopalkilmarnock.com/history Gallery Christ church lancaster pulpit photo.jpgPulpit of Christ Church Christ Church - Lancaster.jpgChrist Church with graveyard and restored brick wall in foreground Christ church lancaster walkway.jpgCedar-lined road to Robert Carter's Corotoman plantation Christ church lancaster doorway.jpgMain entrance, showing decorative brickwork Christ church lancaster soundboard.jpgIntricate woodwork on the sounding board above the pulpit See also *List of National Historic Landmarks in Virginia *National Register of Historic Places listings in Lancaster County, Virginia References  External links  * Church website run by Historic Christ Church Foundation * Church at Virginia.org * \\"Christ Church, Lancaster Co., Virginia\\" at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania *Christ Church, State Route 3, Kilmarnock, Lancaster County, VA: 16 photos, 28 measured drawings, and 3 data pages at Historic American Buildings Survey Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Virginia Category:National Historic Landmarks in Virginia Category:Georgian architecture in Virginia Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Category:Episcopal churches in Virginia Category:Museums in Lancaster County, Virginia Category:Churches completed in 1712 Category:History museums in Virginia Category:Religious museums in Virginia Category:Churches in Lancaster County, Virginia Category:18th-century Episcopal church buildings Category:National Register of Historic Places in Lancaster County, Virginia ","title":"Christ Church (Lancaster County, Virginia)"},{"id":"3678598","text":"John Frederick Smerdon Stone (20 July 18991939 England and Wales Register ‚Äì 12 May 1957) was a British archaeologist, most famous for his work in and around Wiltshire, especially at Stonehenge and the Woodhenge area. Stone was born in Bath, Somerset.England & Wales, Civil Registration Birth Index, 1837-1915 In 1947, Stone excavated the first ever trench across the Stonehenge cursus, at a site near the Fargo Plantation a little north west of the stone circle. This permitted its dating for the first time and Stone was able to establish its prehistoric date and that it had been constructed using antler picks in irregular sections. In the cursus ditch fill, he also found a piece of Welsh stone, incorrectly described as a fragment from the Cosheston Beds of Milford Haven. Coupled with the finds of bluestone fragments found between the cursus and Stonehenge, Stone hypothesised that an earlier bluestone monument, predating the megalithic stages of Stonehenge, had stood near the cursus and been subsequently moved and re-erected on its current spot.Chippendale, C \\"Stonehenge Complete\\" (Thames and Hudson, London, 2004) In 1950, Stone joined R. J. C. Atkinson and Stuart Piggott in an excavation at Stonehenge itself. Commissioned by the Society of Antiquaries, their work recovered many cremations and developed the phasing that still dominates much of what is written about Stonehenge.

The format focuses primarily on rhythmic hits aimed towards an adult audience, often resembling a mixture of the classic hits and hot adult contemporary formats in practice. It typically focuses on genres such as disco, classic hip-hop, dance pop, and house music of the late 1980s/early 1990s. Format history The first station to try this approach was WHBT/Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which lasted from 1986 to 1987, although it was more Hot AC in nature. But eight years later in 1996, another Milwaukee outlet, WAMG, \\"Magic 103.7\\", would be the first to pioneer the \\"Official\\" rhythmic AC format, calling itself \\"Rhythm & Romance\\" which featured Mid-tempo Rhythmic R&B;/Pop tracks (ironically, Milwaukee would once again pick up a Rhythmic AC for the third time in December 2014, when WZTI filled the void after an eighteen-year gap, although that station leaned towards rhythmic oldies; it returned to a True Oldies Channel-led oldies format in August 2015). In February 1996, WYNY in New York City flipped to the format under the name \\"103-5 The New KTU\\", utilizing a \\"Rhythmic Hot AC\\" approach with Dance-Pop tracks added to the mix. The station instantly skyrocketed to #1 in the New York City Arbitron ratings in the next book. Because of this, other stations, like KBKS/Seattle, WDRQ/Detroit (which likewise referred to itself as \\"93-1 The New DRQ\\") and KIBB/Los Angeles flipped to the format. While WDRQ was a moderate ratings success (the station's true ratings boom came after it evolved into a rhythmic-oriented Contemporary Hit format by 1999), KBKS and KIBB were less successful, resulting in KBKS flipping to Top 40/CHR in May 1997, and KIBB flipped to a format they pioneered: \\"rhythmic oldies\\", in November 1997. Beginning in 2006, there was a trend of several stations in the United States switching to the rhythmic AC format using the brand Movin, which debuted on Seattle station KQMV in May of that year. Clear Channel Communications also enjoyed a fair amount of success with Rhythmic AC during this time period, using the continued success of WKTU as its basis for several of its stations, including WDTW-FM Detroit, WMIA Miami, and WISX Philadelphia. This boom screeched to a halt by the early 2010s, with many of the stations evolving into Mainstream or Rhythmic Top 40 (like KQMV or KMVQ San Francisco), or flipping to other formats, in part due to declining ratings and trying to adapt currents into this niche genre. As of July 2016, only a handful of \\"Movin'\\" branded stations remain with a Rhythmic AC format (see list below). Rhythmic AC came to Canada in 1999, when French-language CFGL-FM in Montreal, Quebec made its debut as \\"Rythme FM\\" name. However, the Rythme FM network is now adult contemporary. During the mid-2000s, when the format started to gain popularity, many hot adult contemporary stations in Canada started to follow a Rhythmic AC approach, but still remain Hot AC because of pop-rock content still being played. This was first pioneered by CHUM-FM in Toronto, who had a significant ratings success after starting to lean rhythmic. This approach has worked well in Montreal, where CKBE has had more success with the Rhythmic Hot AC format since its shift from AC in 2011. Unlike CHUM-FM, the currents on CKBE's playlist are more Dance and Rhythmic leaning. By 2013, the Rhythmic AC format began to make a comeback in certain markets. In January of that year, former news/talk outlet WTKK in Boston flipped to the format. The station's ratings, which were low, have significantly improved to compete effectively with Rhythmic Top 40 WJMN. The station's playlist, initially, had a balance of dance-pop tracks and rhythmic classics, as well as current rhythmic/pop material, but by July 2013, the playlist has shifted to a more urban lean. This revival success story of the format spawned a few similar stations later that year, including KHTP in Seattle, KSSX in San Diego and KRBQ in San Francisco, as well as (for a short time) WIQI in Chicago. KHTP and KRBQ have since shifted in a more Classic Hip-Hop direction, positioning themselves as all-\\"Throwback\\" stations, while KSSX flipped to Mainstream Urban in May 2016. The Rhythmic AC renaissance has been particularly felt in the state of Florida: in March 2016, WMIA-FM in Miami, which had switched from Rhythmic AC to Hot AC in August 2014, returned to Rhythmic AC with the slogan \\"Rhythm from the '80s to Now,\\" and four months later, WJSJ in Jacksonville adopted a \\"Classic Dance\\" approach. And in Canada, former Urban outlet CFXJ-FM Toronto went Rhythmic AC as \\"93.5 The Move\\" in February 2016. In January 2015, KKGQ/Wichita was relaunched with the same Rhythmic AC presentation that was previously offered by its successor KMXW from 2004 to 2007, except this time around, it was more focused on current Rhythmic and Mainstream Pop hits and recurrents from the 1990s and 2000s (KMXW's presentation had an emphasis on 1970s and 1980s product). (That station would completely shift towards Hot AC by October 2015, with most of the Rhythmic material being moved to evening hours.) Also in 2015, KJHM in Denver shifted to the format after spending its first 5 years with rhythmic oldies, marking the second station with the format in the market, the first being KPTT from 2006 to 2009. The new crop of Rhythmic AC stations varies by market as to how much hip-hop and R&B; product are included in the music mix. Whereas the aforementioned KHTP and KRBQ have repositioned themselves as all-\\"Throwback\\" stations specializing in Classic Hip-Hop, WKTU, WMOV in Norfolk and the newest incarnation of WMIA-FM lean toward pop and dance, with the latter two continuing to incorporate \\"throwbacks\\" from as far back as the disco era of the 1970s.

Initially, the brand name \\"Peds\\" was chosen for the company from the Latin word for feet, but the name was already trademarked. Keds was founded in 1916 and was later acquired by Stride Rite Corporation. Because the shoes had a soft rubber sole, they became known as sneakers as the rubber soles allowed \\"sneaking around silently\\". By the early 1920s, the shoes were worn by Olympic soccer players, national and international tennis champions, and college athletes. In 1926, the Keds Triumph shoe was introduced. =1930‚Äì2000= Keds released \\"Kedettes\\", a line of washable high-heeled shoes for women, in 1938. In 1949, Pro-Keds were introduced as a line of sneakers designed for athletic performance. Designed specifically for basketball players, the original style, the Royal Tread, was endorsed by George Mikan. In 1953, the Minneapolis Lakers were outfitted with Pro-Keds. Pro-Keds were intended to compete with the industry standard, Converse. Pro-Keds were worn by NBA stars including Willis Reed, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Nate \\"Tiny\\" Archibald, JoJo White, Bob Love, Lou Hudson, Bob Lanier and \\"Pistol\\" Pete Maravich, as well as music icons, The Ramones. The shoe earned cult status in the hip-hop community by the late 1970s. Stride Rite Corporation purchased Keds and Sperry Top-Sider from Uniroyal in 1979 for $18 million. From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, Keds were very popular and fashionable with girls from elementary school age through college age and adults, especially after the 1987 movie Dirty Dancing was released, in which Jennifer Grey wore Keds. Many cheerleaders also wore Keds as part of their uniform during the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s. In the 1990s, Demi Moore voiced a television campaign for Keds. Mischa Barton, who starred in The O.C., became the face of Keds in an ad campaign in the late 2000s. =Post-2000= In January 2012, Rick Blackshaw was appointed brand president of Keds. Collective Brands Inc., the parent company of Stride Rite Corporation and Keds, was acquired by Wolverine World Wide for $1.32 billion in May 2012. In September 2014, Chris Linder, former CMO and senior vice president of business development for Sperry Top-Sider, became president of Keds. Keds launched the \\"Ladies First Since 1916\\" campaign in July 2015, which focuses on female empowerment and featured celebrities including Taylor Swift. In 2016 Keds celebrated its centennial and the continuation of its \\"Ladies First Since 1916\\" campaign with a birthday celebration held during New York Fashion Week. The company also announced that its shoe manufacturing was moving to Michigan, in the U.S. for the first time in 35 years.

He has been declared a saint by the Catholic Church.Vatican News Service Life =Early life= He was born Youssef Kassab, in 1808 in the village of Hardine, in the North Governorate of Lebanon, one of the seven children of George Kassab and Marium Raad, the daughter of a priest of the Maronite Church.Saint Hardini As a boy, Youssef attended the school run by the monks of the Lebanese Maronite Order at the Monastery of St. Anthony in the village of Houb. After he finished his studies there in 1822, he entered the Monastery of St. Anthony in Qozhaya, entering the novitiate of the Order which had taught him in November 1828, at which time he took the monastic name of Nimatullah, which means \\"the grace of God\\".\\"Saint Nimatullah Hardini\\", Maronite Heritage =Monk= As a new monk, Father (the title given to all Eastern monks) Nimatullah was assigned by the abbot of the monastery to learn how to bind books. He spent the period of his initial formation in the monastic life in frequent prayer, sometimes passing the night in prayer in the monastery church, praying to the Blessed Sacrament. Kassab made his religious profession of vows on 14 November 1830, after which he was sent to the Monastery of Saints Cyprian and Justina in Kfifan, in the Batroun District, to pursue higher studies in preparation for ordination, which took place on Christmas Day 1833. Nimatullah Al-Hardini founded a free school in Kifkan and later in Bhersaf.\\"St. Nimatullah Kassab Al-Hardini, ‚ÄúEnamored of the Eucharist‚Äù, Zenit, May 16, 2004 After ordination, he was assigned by the abbot to teach at the Order's seminary and to be the director of the seminarians. Among his students was a famed member of the Order, St. Charbel Makhlouf, venerated by the entire Catholic Church. As a monk, Kassab spent his entire life in prayer and the service of his Order. He served on its General Council for most of the period 1845-1858, also serving as Assistant Abbot General by appointment of the Holy See, in addition to his duties in the seminary. He refused, however, to be named Abbot General. He was severe on himself but a model of patience and forbearance to his fellow monks, to the point where he was reprimanded for his leniency. He bore all this as part of the challenge of monastic life. One of his brothers, who had also entered the monastery and had become a hermit, advised him to seek a similar solitude. Nimatullah declined, saying that community life was the true challenge for a monk. =Death= Kassab fell ill in the winter of 1858, dying after suffering nearly two weeks of high fever on 14 December. In 1864, his tomb was opened for re-burial and, to the surprise of the monks, his body was found to be intact. Such was the reverence with which he was held during his life, that his body was exposed to the veneration of the public until 1927, when a Committee of Inquiry into his possible canonization had completed its work. His body was then buried in a small chapel. Miracles Kassab is believed to have performed many miracles during his life due to his deep spirituality and his high virtues. He is commended for having a radiant soul, and it was said that he was deeply united to his creator. \\"The Saint of Kfifan\\" was stated to have the gift of prophesy and hence became known as \\"a man of vision.\\" * According to some sources, on one occasion when he was teaching his students and facing a large wall outside the monastery of Kfifan, he had a sense that the wall was suddenly going to fall. Thereupon, he asked his students to move away just before the wall fell down, sparing all present from injury. * On another occasion, according to Maronite folklore, Father Nimatullah was divinely made aware that the barn where the cows of the monastery of Kfifan were kept was going to collapse on them (cows were then considered to be vital assets of the monastery). Father Nimatullah asked the monk in charge to change the place of the cows. At first the monk hesitated, but Father Nimatullah insisted and urged him to do so. After the cows were removed the roof of the barn collapsed while none of the cows were lost. =Healing of the Altar Boy= On another occasion, it is believed Father Nimatullah wanted to celebrate his daily Mass but his usual altar boy did not arrive at church on time. Father Nimatullah then went to the boy's room and asked him to get up and serve mass. The altar boy was not able to because he had a high fever. Father Nimatullah then requested the boy to stand up, whereupon he ordered the malady to \\"Leave him...\\" Immediately, the boy was cured and he went and served Father Nimatullah's mass with joy and liveliness. =Provisions Box= Father Nimatullah was thought to have once prayed over and blessed the provisions' box (which contained wheat and other foodstuffs) at the monastery of El- Kattara which was almost empty. After a little while the box was filled and spilled over. Everyone was stunned and praised God at what they saw. While still alive, his fellow monks and the ordinary people who knew him considered Father Nimatullah to be a saint. Often they would come asking him to pray for them and even bless water to be used on their land and for their livestock. His presence always imposed a special respect, reverence and solemnity. =Moussa Saliba= According to the Catholic communion, after his death, God granted many healings and miracles through the intercession of the \\"Saint of Kfifan.\\" One such healing was supposedly granted to an Orthodox blind man, Moussa Saliba, from the town of Bteghrine (El-Maten). Moussa Saliba visited Nimatullah's tomb, praying and asking for his blessing. A deep sleep overcame Moussa Saliba, and then Father Nimatullah appeared to him and healed his eyes, enabling him to see clearly. =Michael Kfoury= Another miracle apparently occurred to a Melkite man, Mickael Kfoury, from the town Watta El-Mrouge. An incurable illness was attacking both of his legs, which rendered them dry, devoid of flesh, and twisted to the point of crippling him. His doctors had abandoned all hope of a cure. Having heard of the miracles that Father Nimatullah was performing this man decided to visit Father Nimatullah's tomb in Kfifan and ask for his healing. He slept the night at the monastery, and while he was in deep sleep an old monk appeared to him saying: \\"Stand up and go and help the monks carry in the grapes from the vineyard.\\" He immediately replied: \\"Don't you see me paralysed, how can I walk and carry the grapes?\\" The monk answered: \\"Take this pair of shoes, wear them and walk.\\" The sick man then took the shoes and tried to stretch out his right leg, and, to his surprise, he was able to do so. He woke up and started to feel both of his legs which were now full of blood and flesh, and after he stood up he found himself totally healed. =Andre Najm= According to other sources in the church; on September 26, 1987, Andre accompanied family and friends to the monastery of Kfifane where he prayed fervently at the grave of Fr. Hardini. The people around him heard him say \\"I beg you, Fr. Al-Hardini, give me a drop of blood for I am so tired to the point where I can't even beg for blood on the street.\\" He then asked to wear the monastic habit, moments later he was cured, and cried out with joy, \\"I wore the monastic habit, I am cured, I don't need blood anymore!\\" Andre has not required any blood transfusions since that day, and in 1991 he married Rola Salim Raad. They have three children, a son named Charbel and two daughters named Rafca and Maria. Today, Andre is in excellent health and has become a Maronite priest. Veneration The cause for Kassab's canonization was formally accepted by the Holy See on 7 September 1978 and he was declared Venerable. On 2 May 1996, Bishop Khalil Abi-Nader, retired Bishop of the Maronite Diocese of Beirut, obtained the permission of Cardinal Sfeir to start the investigation of the miracle of Andre Najm. On 26 September 1996, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome began to study the miracle. On 27 February 1997, the five-member medical team unanimously voted to accept the cure of Andre Najm as a miracle. On 9 May 1997, the seven-member theological team also voted unanimously to accept the miracle. On 1 July 1997, the General Assembly of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, which includes twenty-four cardinals, accepted the miracle attributed to the intercession of the Servant of God Nimatullah Kassab. On 7 July 1997, in the presence of Pope John Paul II, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints published the decree accepting the miracle. Kassab's beatification by Pope John Paul II was held at Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome on Sunday, 10 May 1998.\\"Saint Nimatullah Kassab al Hardini\\", Our Lady of Good Help, Maronite Catholic Church of Edmonton He was later canonized on Sunday, 16 May 2004, by the same pope.

The Lawn Ground also hosted local cup finals as well as being home to Forest Green's Ladies and youth sides. The ground was located at the top of a steep hill in the hamlet of Forest Green and had a total capacity of 5,141 people. Forest Green matches drew approximately 1,000 spectators on average at the Lawn Ground. The ground's record attendance is 3,002 for a match between Forest Green and St Albans City, in a FA Trophy semi-final on 18 April 1999. Until the 1950s, the Lawn was little more than an open field, but the Rovers' success required upgrades to the stadium. At this point, terraces were constructed for fans and a \\"famously partial leveling of the pitch\\" occurred. In 1996, the Trevor Horsley Stand, named after the chairman of the club, Trevor Horsley, was constructed for over ¬£200,000. This stand seated 300 and included three hospitality boxes, underground changing rooms, a board room, function room, bar, a health suite and offices. It also featured a quirky watermill behind the stand. Aside from the Trevor Horsley Stand, the rest of the ground, about 80 percent, was terraced. The biggest terrace stand was the covered Barnfield Terrace. The terrace was built during 2001 and 2002 to increase the ground's capacity, and Forest Green fans paid to have their names engraved onto bricks inside that stand. The Barnfield Terrace was sponsored by Rockwool. When the club left the ground at the end of the 2005-2006 season, the stand was transferred brick by brick to their new ground. Other sections of the Lawn Ground included the Nympsfield Road Terrace which was located behind a goal at the northern end of the ground. The Lawn Ground was demolished and turned into housing after the club moved into the new, modern The New Lawn Stadium, which now hosts all their matches. Forest Green began playing at the new stadium which is only a few hundred yards from the old Lawn, from the start of the 2006-2007 season.

The novel is a parody, for its setting is a mock high fantasy world, similar to that Jones covered in The Tough Guide to Fantasyland (U.K., 1996), a humorous travel guide on the Rough Guide model. The story continues in Year of the Griffin and the two novels have been called the Derkholm series (which ISFDB does not explicitly link to The Tough Guide).  Plot introduction  A fantasy world is dominated by its destructive tourist industry. \\"Mr. Chesney's Pilgrim Parties\\" arrange for annual group tours, evidently from our world, to experience all the cliches: wise Wizard Guides, attacks from Leathery-Winged Avians, the Glamorous Enchantress, the evil Dark Lord. It is a devastating show: farmlands are laid waste, people slain, and so on. The head of Wizards University, Querida, determines a way to end the tours. The apparently incompetent wizard Derk will be the next Dark Lord, and son Blade the Wizard Guide for the final tour. Querida overcomes objections all around and the plan is underway. The Wizard Derk has seven children with his wife the Enchantress Mara: Shona and Blade, the former being the older; Kit (black with gold eyes), the oldest griffin and a magic-user; Callette (brown with green-grey wings), who makes all 126 of the Dark Lord's \\"gizmos\\" with Mr. Chesney's world's technology; Don (gold), who is a rather forgotten griffin who doesn't really do much special; Lydda (gold), who is a great cook (her food is called \\"godlike snacks\\" by the rest of the family\\") and long-distance flier who plants the Dark Lord's \\"clues\\" that lead to his lair; and Elda (also gold), the youngest, with the most cat cells, and who is discovered to be a strong magic user as well.  Plot  In a meeting about the Pilgrim Parties, High Chancellor Querida takes a wizard, a high priest and a thief to see the Oracles, who determine that the next person the group sees will play the role of the Dark Lord, and the second person will be the Wizard Guide that they need. They meet Wizard Derk, who has taken his son Blade to see the Oracles, who say that he will be coached by Deucalion. Derk undertakes to \\"evil-fy\\" his home, Derkholm, for its role as the Dark Lord's capital. He summons a demon to bind there, but it escapes. An ancient dragon mistakes him for a ruling Dark Lord, takes offense when it learns the commercial truth, and burns Derk so badly that he cannot play Dark Lord or help with other arrangements. His children take over. The eldest griffin and most commanding personality among several human and griffin children, Kit takes the lead. With the dragon's help, they manage to settle the Dark Lord's soldiers (Violent and drugged criminals whom Mr. Chesney contracts to get rid of) in permanent camp. Meanwhile, Derk is convalescing back at Derkholm/The Dark Citadel but his wife, Mara, seems to be on the brink of leaving him, enjoying too much playing the part of the Glamorous Enchantress. Blade and Shona, Derk's human son and daughter, take charge of the Pilgrim Party that Blade was assigned to as the wizard guide. Among other things, they must deal with their own attractions to tourists, and with unwanted affections, and with tourists helplessly in love with each other. The party gets lost in wastelands, Blade and two tourists get separated from the group, and Shona leads the rest toward Derkholm. Blade's trio discovers a mining and export operation run by Mr. Chesney. The magical properties inherent in plain fantasy earth make it a valuable power source in Chesney's world (ours)! Blade is captured by guards and sent off to fight as a gladiator, where he meets in the arena his griffin brother, Kit, captured in battle. Back at Derkholm, father Derk is badly depressed by the apparent death of Kit, and does not carry out any of the Dark Lord's duties, nor eat, sleep, or wash. Pilgrims are camped in the valley, having been barred from the Dark Citadel by Derk, and many denizens of fantasyland (Dragons, Elves and Dwarves) have gathered in the Dark Citadel or its vicinity, by the time Mr. Chesney arrives to assess the situation and determines to levy fines. Deucalion, the dragon helps the demon in Mr. Chesney's pocket escape and return to its mate, the one that Wizard Derk summoned. The gods, which Mr. Chesney had demanded to appear, show up and shrinks him, and leaves with him. The arrival of the Final Pilgrim Party precipitates a showdown and the successful consummation of Querida's plan. Her retirement from the University sets the stage for a sequel, Year of the Griffin, when Derk's youngest daughter goes for training in magic. Main characters *Wizard Derk: A wizard specialising in genetics, especially the creation of new animals. He is considered by others to be an incompetent bungler, but really is just a different sort of magic user from everyone else. He is selected as this year's Dark Lord. *Mara: Derk's wife. She is this year's chosen Glamorous Enchantress. *Mr Chesney: An off-worlder who runs the Pilgrim Parties. Cruel and unrepentant, he doesn't really think that Blade's world is real, and therefore has no hesitation in exploiting everyone in it. *Querida: One of the most powerful wizards in the world. She runs the University of Magic. She is rather amoral, causing Mara to leave and not understanding why Derk is devastated when he believes Kit and Blade to be dead. Derk and Mara have five griffin children and two human children: *Shona: Derk's human daughter and eldest child. She aspires to be a bard, and is devastated when the Bardic College expels her for taking part in the Pilgrim Parties. She is very attractive, musically talented, and very bossy. *Kit: Derk's elder griffin son. He is distinctive for his large size and black colouring. He is aggressive and forthright most of the time and enjoys the battles and the Wild Hunt, but is brought under control partly by his father and partly by Deucalion, who is the only person he knows who is bigger than him. *Blade: Derk's human son and one of this year's Wizard Guides. *Callette: Derk's eldest griffin daughter. She is very creative, and creates the gizmos for the Pilgrim Parties. She is a high-energy flier, and can only go for twenty miles at most without needing a break to rest and eat. *Don: Derk's younger griffin son. He is lazy, but because of his exceptionally beautiful golden coat and attractive appearance, finds it easy to manipulate others. *Lydda: One of Derk's griffin daughters. Her hobby is cooking, and due to this she is rather overweight. She is a long-distance flier, and able to go for a hundred miles without stopping. *Elda: Derk's youngest child, a griffin female. Like a human child, she likes glitter and sequins, and is much smaller than the other griffins. She wants to be a wizard. Other characters: *Deucalion (Scales): King of the dragons and a powerful magic user. Over 300 years old. *Tripos: Demon King. A blue demon, his mate is held hostage by Mr. Chesney. *Barnabas: Wizard friend of Derk. Somewhat of a drunk, secretly working for Mr. Chesney. *Prince Talithan: An elf, Captain of the \\"Dark Elves\\". His brother is held hostage by Mr. Chesney. *Anscher: a god.

The crystal is inside the metal capsule under the vertical needle (right). The leaf springs and thumbscrew allow fine adjustment of the pressure of the needle on the crystal. A crystal detector is an obsolete electronic component used in some early 20th century radio receivers that consists of a piece of crystalline mineral which rectifies the alternating current radio signal and was employed as a detector (demodulator) to extract the audio modulation to produce the sound in the earphones. It was the first type of semiconductor diode, and one of the first semiconductor electronic devices. The most common type was the so-called cat whisker detector, which consisted of a piece of crystalline mineral, usually galena (lead sulfide), with a fine wire touching its surface. Greenleaf Whittier Pickard, Detector for Wireless Telegraphy and Telephony, filed: 30 August 1906, granted: 20 November 1906 The \\"asymmetric conduction\\" of electric current across electrical contacts between a crystal and a metal was discovered in 1874 by Karl Ferdinand Braun. Crystals were first used as radio wave detectors in 1894 by Jagadish Chandra Bose in his microwave experiments.although at the microwave frequencies he used these detectors did not function as rectifying semiconductor diodes like later crystal detectors, but as a thermal detector called a bolometer. Bose first patented a crystal detector in 1901. Jagadis Chunder Bose, Detector for Electrical Disturbances, filed: 30 September 1901, granted 29 March 1904 The crystal detector was developed into a practical radio component mainly by G. W. Pickard, Greenleaf Whittier Pickard, Means for Receiving Intelligence Communicated by Electric Waves, filed: 30 August 1906, granted: 20 November 1906 archived: part1, part2, part3, part4 who began research on detector materials in 1902 and found hundreds of substances that could be used in forming rectifying junctions. The physical principles by which they worked were not understood at the time they were used, but subsequent research into these primitive point contact semiconductor junctions in the 1930s and 1940s led to the development of modern semiconductor electronics. The unamplified radio receivers that used crystal detectors were called crystal radios. The crystal radio was the first type of radio receiver that was used by the general public, and became the most widely used type of radio until the 1920s.\\"...crystal detectors have been used [in receivers] in greater numbers than any other [type of detector] since about 1907.\\" It became obsolete with the development of vacuum tube receivers around 1920, but continued to be used until World War 2. How it works Diagram showing how a crystal detector works The contact between two dissimilar materials at the surface of the detector's semiconducting crystal forms a crude semiconductor diode, which acts as a rectifier, conducting electric current in only one direction and resisting current flowing in the other direction. In a crystal radio, it was connected between the tuned circuit, which passed on the oscillating current induced in the antenna from the desired radio station, and the earphone. Its function was to act as a demodulator, rectifying the radio signal, converting it from alternating current to a pulsing direct current, to extract the audio signal (modulation) from the radio frequency carrier wave. The audio frequency current produced by the detector passed through the earphone causing the earphone's diaphragm to vibrate, pushing on the air to create sound waves. This diagram shows a simplified explanation of how it works: :(A) This graph shows the amplitude modulated radio signal from the receiver's tuned circuit, which is applied as a voltage across the detector's contacts. The rapid oscillations are the radio frequency carrier wave. The audio signal (the sound) is contained in the slow variations (modulation) of the size of the waves. If this signal were applied directly to the earphone, it could not be converted to sound, because the audio excursions are the same on both sides of the axis, averaging out to zero, which would result in no net motion of the earphone's diaphragm. :(B) This graph shows the current through the crystal detector which is applied to the earphone and bypass capacitor. The crystal conducts current in only one direction, stripping off the oscillations on one side of the signal, leaving a pulsing direct current whose amplitude does not average zero but varies with the audio signal. :(C) This graph shows the current which passes through the earphone. A bypass capacitor across the earphone terminals, in combination with the intrinsic forward resistance of the diode, creates a low-pass filter that smooths the waveform by removing the radio frequency carrier pulses and leaving the audio signal. When this varying current passes through the earphone voice coil, it creates a varying magnetic field which pulls on the earphone diaphragm, causing it to vibrate and produce sound waves. Crystal radios had no amplifying components to increase the loudness of the radio signal; the sound power produced by the earphone came solely from the radio waves of the radio station being received, intercepted by the antenna. Therefore, the sensitivity of the detector was a major factor determining the sensitivity and reception range of the receiver, motivating much research into finding sensitive detectors. In addition to its main use in crystal radios, crystal detectors were also used as radio wave detectors in scientific experiments, in which the DC output current of the detector was registered by a sensitive galvanometer, and in test instruments such as wavemeters used to calibrate the frequency of radio transmitters. Types The crystal detector consisted of an electrical contact between the surface of a semiconducting crystalline mineral and either a metal or another crystal. Since at the time they were developed no one knew how they worked, crystal detectors evolved by trial and error. The construction of the detector depended on the type of crystal used, as it was found different minerals varied in how much contact area and pressure on the crystal surface was needed to make a sensitive rectifying contact. Crystals that required a light pressure like galena were used with the wire cat whisker contact; silicon was used with a heavier point contact, while silicon carbide (carborundum) could tolerate the heaviest pressure. Another type used two crystals of different minerals with their surfaces touching, the most common being the \\"Perikon\\" detector. Since the detector would only function when the contact was made at certain spots on the crystal surface, the contact point was almost always made adjustable. Below are the major categories of crystal detectors used during the early 20th century: =Cat whisker detector= Patented by Karl Ferdinand Braun and Greenleaf Whittier Pickard in 1906, this was the most common type of crystal detector, mainly used with galena but also other crystals. It consisted of a pea-size piece of crystalline mineral in a metal holder, with its surface touched by a fine metal wire or needle (the \\"cat whisker\\"). The contact between the tip of the wire and the surface of the crystal formed a crude unstable point-contact metal‚Äìsemiconductor junction, forming a Schottky barrier diode.\\"The cat‚Äôs-whisker detector is a primitive point-contact diode. A point-contact junction is the simplest implementation of a Schottky diode, which is a majority-carrier device formed by a metal-semiconductor junction.\\" The wire whisker is the anode, and the crystal is the cathode; current can flow from the wire into the crystal but not in the other direction. Only certain sites on the crystal surface functioned as rectifying junctions. The device was very sensitive to the exact geometry and pressure of contact between wire and crystal, and the contact could be disrupted by the slightest vibration. Therefore, a usable point of contact had to be found by trial and error before each use. The wire was suspended from a moveable arm and was dragged across the crystal face by the user until the device began functioning. In a crystal radio, the user would tune the radio to a strong local station if possible and then adjust the cat whisker until the station or radio noise (a static hissing noise) was heard in the radio's earphones. This required some skill and a lot of patience. An alternative method of adjustment was to use a battery-operated buzzer connected to the radio's ground wire or inductively coupled to the tuning coil, to generate a test signal. The spark produced by the buzzer's contacts functioned as a weak radio transmitter whose radio waves could be received by the detector, so when a rectifying spot had been found on the crystal the buzz could be heard in the earphones, at which time the buzzer was turned off. The detector consisted of two parts mounted next to each other on a flat nonconductive base: :Crystal Galena crystals sold for use in crystal detectors, Poland, 1930s :A crystalline mineral formed the semiconductor side of the junction. The most common crystal used was galena (lead sulfide, PbS, varieties were sold under the names \\"Lenzite\\" and \\"Hertzite\\"), a widely occurring ore of lead, although other crystalline minerals were also used, the more common ones were iron pyrite (iron sulfide, FeS2, \\"fool's gold\\", also sold under the trade names \\"Pyron\\" and \\"Ferron\\"), molybdenite (molybdenum disulfide, MoS2), and cerussite (lead carbonate, PbCO3) Not all specimens of a crystal would function in a detector, often several crystal pieces had to be tried to find an active one. Galena with good detecting properties was rare and had no reliable visual characteristics distinguishing it from galena samples with poor detecting properties. A rough pebble of detecting mineral about the size of a pea was mounted in a metal cup, which formed one side of the circuit. The electrical contact between the cup and the crystal had to be good, because this contact must not act as a second rectifying junction, creating two back-to-back diodes which would prevent the device from conducting at all. To make good contact with the crystal, it was either clamped with setscrews or embedded in solder. Because the relatively high melting temperature of tin-lead solder can damage many crystals, a fusible alloy with a low melting point, well under , such as Wood's metal was used. One surface was left exposed to allow contact with the cat-whisker wire. :Cat whisker :The \\"cat whisker\\", a springy piece of thin metal wire, formed the metal side of the junction. Phosphor bronze wire of about 30 gauge was commonly used because it had the right amount of springiness. It was mounted on an adjustable arm with an insulated handle so that the entire exposed surface of the crystal could be probed from many directions to find the most sensitive spot. Cat whiskers in simple detectors were straight or curved, but most professional cat whiskers had a coiled section in the middle that served as a spring. The crystal required just the right gentle pressure by the wire; too much pressure caused the device to conduct in both directions. Precision detectors made for radiotelegraphy stations often used a metal needle instead of a \\"cat's whisker\\", mounted on a thumbscrew-operated leaf spring to adjust the pressure applied. Gold or silver needles were used with some crystals. =Carborundum detector= Invented in 1906 by Henry H. C. Dunwoody, Henry H. C. Dunwoody, Wireless Telegraph System, filed: 23 March 1906, granted: 4 December 1906 this consisted of a piece of silicon carbide (SiC, then known by the trade name carborundum), either clamped between two flat metal contacts, or mounted in fusible alloy in a metal cup with a contact consisting of a hardened steel point pressed firmly against it with a spring. Carborundum, an artificial product of electric furnaces produced in 1893, required a heavier pressure than the cat whisker contact. The carborundum detector was popular because its sturdy contact did not require readjustment each time it was used, like the delicate cat whisker devices. Some carborundum detectors were adjusted at the factory and then sealed and did not require adjustment by the user. It was not sensitive to vibration and so was used in shipboard wireless stations where the ship was rocked by waves, and military stations where vibration from gunfire could be expected. Another advantage was that it was tolerant of high currents, and could not be \\"burned out\\" by atmospheric electricity from the antenna. Therefore, it was the most common type used in commercial radiotelegraphy stations. Silicon carbide is a semiconductor with a wide band gap of 3 eV, so to make the detector more sensitive a forward bias voltage of several volts was usually applied across the junction by a battery and potentiometer. The voltage was adjusted with the potentiometer until the sound was loudest in the earphone. The bias moved the operating point to the curved \\"knee\\" of the device's current‚Äìvoltage curve, which produced the largest rectified current. =Silicon detector= Patented and first manufactured in 1906 by Pickard, this was the first type of crystal detector to be commercially produced. Silicon required more pressure than the cat whisker contact, although not as much as carborundum. A flat piece of silicon was embedded in fusible alloy in a metal cup, and a metal point, usually brass or gold, was pressed against it with a spring. The surface of the silicon was usually ground flat and polished. Silicon was also used with antimony and arsenic contacts. The silicon detector had some of the same advantages as carborundum; its firm contact could not be jarred loose by vibration, so it was used in commercial and military radiotelegraphy stations. =Crystal-to-crystal detectors= Another category was detectors which used two different crystals with their surfaces touching, forming a crystal-to-crystal contact. The \\"Perikon\\" detector, invented 1908 by Pickard Greenleaf Whittier Pickard, Oscillation receiver, filed: 15 September 1908, granted: 16 February 1909 was the most common. Perikon stood for \\"PERfect pIcKard cONtact\\". It consisted of two crystals in metal holders, mounted face to face. One crystal was zincite (zinc oxide, ZnO), the other was a copper iron sulfide, either bornite (Cu5FeS4) or chalcopyrite (CuFeS2). In Pickard's commercial detector (see picture), multiple zincite crystals were mounted in a fusible alloy in a round cup (on right), while the chalcopyrite crystal was mounted in a cup on an adjustable arm facing it (on left). The chalcopyrite crystal was moved forward until it touched the surface of one of the zincite crystals. When a sensitive spot was located, the arm was locked in place with the setscrew. Multiple zincite pieces were provided because the fragile zincite crystal could be damaged by excessive currents and tended to \\"burn out\\" due to atmospheric electricity from the wire antenna or currents leaking into the receiver from the powerful spark transmitters used at the time. This detector was also sometimes used with a small forward bias voltage of around 0.2V from a battery to make it more sensitive. Although the zincite-chalcopyrite \\"Perikon\\" was the most widely used crystal-to-crystal detector, other crystal pairs were also used. Zincite was used with carbon, galena, and tellurium. Silicon was used with arsenic, antimony and tellurium crystals. History The graphic symbol used for solid-state diodes originated as a drawing of a point contact crystal detector.A. P. Morgan, Wireless Telegraph Construction for Amateurs, 3rd ed. New York: D. Van Nostrand Co., 1914, p. 135, Fig. 108 During the first three decades of radio, from 1888 to 1918, called the wireless telegraphy or \\"spark\\" era, primitive radio transmitters called spark gap transmitters were used, which generated radio waves by an electric spark. These transmitters were unable to produce the continuous sinusoidal waves which are used to transmit audio (sound) in modern AM or FM radio transmission. Instead spark gap transmitters transmitted information by wireless telegraphy; the user turned the transmitter on and off rapidly by tapping on a telegraph key, producing pulses of radio waves which spelled out text messages in Morse code. Therefore, the radio receivers of this era did not have to demodulate the radio wave, extract an audio signal from it as modern receivers do, they merely had to detect the presence or absence of the radio waves, to make a sound in the earphone when the radio wave was present to represent the \\"dots\\" and \\"dashes\\" of Morse code. The device which did this was called a detector. The crystal detector was the most successful of many detector devices invented during this era. The crystal detector evolved from an earlier device, the first primitive radio wave detector, called a coherer, developed in 1890 by √âdouard Branly and used in the first radio receivers in 1894‚Äì96 by Marconi and Oliver Lodge. Made in many forms, the coherer consisted of a high resistance electrical contact, composed of conductors touching with a thin resistive surface film, usually oxidation, between them. Radio waves changed the resistance of the contact, causing it to conduct a DC current. The most common form consisted of a glass tube with electrodes at each end, containing loose metal filings in contact with the electrodes. Before a radio wave was applied, this device had a high electrical resistance, in the megohm range. When a radio wave from the antenna was applied across the electrodes it caused the filings to \\"cohere\\" or clump together and the coherer's resistance fell, causing a DC current from a battery to pass through it, which rang a bell or produced a mark on a paper tape representing the \\"dots\\" and \\"dashes\\" of Morse code. Most coherers had to be tapped mechanically between each pulse of radio waves to return them to a nonconductive state. The coherer was a very poor detector, motivating much research to find better detectors. It worked by complicated thin film surface effects, so scientists of the time didn't understand how it worked, except for a vague idea that radio wave detection depended on some mysterious property of \\"imperfect\\" electrical contacts. Researchers investigating the effect of radio waves on various types of \\"imperfect\\" contacts to develop better coherers, invented crystal detectors. =Braun's experiments= The \\"unilateral conduction\\" of crystals was discovered by Karl Ferdinand Braun, a German physicist, in 1874 at the University of W√ºrzburg. He studied copper pyrite (Cu5FeS4), iron pyrite (iron sulfide, FeS2), galena (PbS) and copper antimony sulfide (Cu3SbS4). This was before radio waves had been discovered, and Braun did not apply these devices practically but was interested in the nonlinear current‚Äìvoltage characteristic that these sulfides exhibited. Graphing the current as a function of voltage across a contact made by a piece of mineral touched by a wire cat whisker, he found the result was a line that was flat for current in one direction but curved upward for current in the other direction, instead of a straight line, showing that these substances did not obey Ohm's law. Due to this characteristic, some crystals had up to twice as much resistance to current in one direction as they did to current in the other. In 1877 and 1878 he reported further experiments with psilomelane, . Braun did investigations which ruled out several possible causes of asymmetric conduction, such as electrolytic action and some types of thermoelectric effects. Thirty years after these discoveries, after Bose's experiments, Braun began experimenting with his crystalline contacts as radio wave detectors. In 1906 he obtained a German patent on a galena cat whisker detector, but was too late to obtain patents in other countries. =Bose's experiments= The first person to use crystals for radio wave detection was Indian physicist Jagadish Chandra Bose of the University of Calcutta in his landmark 60 GHz microwave optics experiments from 1894 to 1900. also reprinted on IndianDefenseSarkar, Tapan K.; Sengupta, Dipak L. \\"An appreciation of J. C. Bose's pioneering work in millimeter and microwaves\\" in Like other scientists since Hertz, Bose was investigating the similarity between radio waves and light by duplicating classic optics experiments with radio waves. Sarkar, et al (2006) History of Wireless, pp. 477‚Äì483 He first used a coherer consisting of a steel spring pressing against a metal surface with a current passing through it. Dissatisfied with this detector, around 1897 Bose measured the change in resistivity of dozens of metals and metal compounds exposed to microwaves. He experimented with many substances as contact detectors, focusing on galena. His detectors consisted of a small galena crystal with a metal point contact pressed against it with a thumbscrew, mounted inside a closed waveguide ending in a horn antenna to collect the microwaves. Bose passed a current from a battery through the crystal, and used a galvanometer to measure it. When microwaves struck the crystal the galvanometer registered a drop in resistance of the detector. At the time scientists thought that radio wave detectors functioned by some mechanism analogous to the way the eye detected light, and Bose found his detector was also sensitive to visible light and ultraviolet, leading him to call it an artificial retina. He patented the detector 30 September 1901. This is often considered the first patent on a semiconductor device. =Pickard: first commercial detectors= \\"Microphone\\" coherer detector from 1909 similar to one Pickard discovered rectification with, widely used in the first receivers. It consists of a steel needle resting on two carbon blocks. A semiconducting layer of corrosion on the steel may have been responsible for the rectification. Greenleaf Whittier Pickard may be the person most responsible for making the crystal detector a practical device. Pickard, an engineer with the American Wireless Telephone and Telegraph Co. invented the rectifying contact detector, discovering rectification of radio waves in 1902 while experimenting with a coherer detector consisting of a steel needle resting across two carbon blocks. On 29 May 1902 he was operating this device, listening to a radiotelegraphy station. Coherers required an external current source to operate, so he had the coherer and telephone earphone connected in series with a 3 cell battery to provide power to operate the earphone. Annoyed by background \\"frying\\" noise caused by the current through the carbon, he reached over to cut two of the battery cells out of the circuit to reduce the current The generation of an audio signal without a DC bias battery made Pickard realize the device was acting as a rectifier. During the next four years, Pickard conducted an exhaustive search to find which substances formed the most sensitive detecting contacts, eventually testing thousands of minerals, and discovered about 250 rectifying crystals. In 1906 he obtained a sample of fused silicon, an artificial product recently synthesized in electric furnaces, and it outperformed all other substances. He patented the silicon detector 30 August 1906. In 1907 he formed a company to manufacture his detectors, Wireless Specialty Products Co., and the silicon detector was the first crystal detector to be sold commercially. Pickard went on to produce other detectors using the crystals he had discovered; the more popular being the iron pyrite \\"Pyron\\" detector and the zincite‚Äìchalcopyrite crystal-to-crystal \\"Perikon\\" detector in 1908, which stood for \\"PERfect pIcKard cONtact\\". =Use during the wireless telegraphy era= Marconi Type 106 crystal receiver made from 1915 to around 1920. Detector is visible at lower right. Until the triode began to replace it in World War 1 the crystal detector was cutting-edge technology. Guglielmo Marconi developed the first practical wireless telegraphy transmitters and receivers in 1896, and radio began to be used for communication around 1899. The coherer was used as detector for the first 10 years, until around 1906. During the wireless telegraphy era prior to 1920, there was virtually no broadcasting; radio served as a point-to-point text messaging service. Until the triode vacuum tube began to be used around World War 1, radio receivers had no amplification and were powered only by the radio waves picked up by their antennae. Long distance radio communication depended on high power transmitters (up to 1 MW), huge wire antennas, and a receiver with a sensitive detector. Crystal detectors were invented by several researchers at about the same time. Braun began to experiment with crystal detectors around 1899, around when Bose patented his galena detector. Pickard invented his silicon detector in 1906. Also in 1906 Henry Harrison Chase Dunwoody, Some biographical information on General Henry H.C. Dunwoody is available at Arlington National Cemetery. a retired general in the U.S. Army Signal Corps, patented the silicon carbide (carborundum) detector, Braun patented a galena cat whisker detector in Germany, German patent 178871 Karl Ferdinand Braun, Wellenempfindliche Kontaktstel, filed: 18 February 1906, granted: 22 October 1906 and L. W. Austin invented a silicon‚Äìtellurium detector. Around 1907 crystal detectors replaced the coherer and electrolytic detector to become the most widely used form of radio detector.The 1911 edition of the US Navy's manual of radio stated: \\"There are but two types of detectors now in use: crystal or rectifying detectors and the electrolytic. Coherers and microphones [another type of coherer detector] are practically obsolete, and comparatively few of the magnetic and Audion or valve [triode] detectors have been installed.\\" Until the triode vacuum tube began to be used during World War 1, crystals were the best radio reception technology, used in sophisticated receivers in wireless telegraphy stations, as well as in homemade crystal radios.The 1913 edition of the US Navy's manual of radio stated: \\"Only one type of detector is now in use: the crystal. Coherers and microphones are practically obsolete, and comparatively few magnetic and Audion or valve [triode] detectors have been installed.\\" In transoceanic radiotelegraphy stations elaborate inductively coupled crystal receivers fed by mile long wire antennas were used to receive transatlantic telegram traffic.Marconi used carborundum detectors beginning around 1907 in his first commercial transatlantic wireless link between Newfoundland, Canada and Clifton, Ireland. Much research went into finding better detectors and many types of crystals were tried. The goal of researchers was to find rectifying crystals that were less fragile and sensitive to vibration than galena and pyrite. Another desired property was tolerance of high currents; many crystals would become insensitive when subjected to discharges of atmospheric electricity from the outdoor wire antenna, or current from the powerful spark transmitter leaking into the receiver. Carborundum proved to be the best of these; it could rectify when clamped firmly between flat contacts. Therefore, carborundum detectors were used in shipboard wireless stations where waves caused the floor to rock, and military stations where gunfire was expected. In 1907‚Äì1909, George Washington Pierce at Harvard conducted research into how crystal detectors worked. Using an oscilloscope made with Braun's new cathode ray tube, he produced the first pictures of the waveforms in a working detector, proving that it did rectify the radio wave. During this era, before modern solid-state physics, most scientists believed that crystal detectors operated by some thermoelectric effect. Although Pierce didn't discover the mechanism by which it worked, he did prove that the existing theories were wrong; his oscilloscope waveforms showed there was no phase delay between the voltage and current in the detector, ruling out thermal mechanisms. Pierce originated the name crystal rectifier. Between about 1905 and 1915 new types of radio transmitters were developed which produced continuous sinusoidal waves: the arc converter (Poulsen arc) and the Alexanderson alternator. These slowly replaced the old damped wave spark transmitters. Besides having a longer transmission range, these transmitters could be modulated with an audio signal to transmit sound by amplitude modulation (AM). It was found that, unlike the coherer, the rectifying action of the crystal detector allowed it to demodulate an AM radio signal, producing audio (sound). Although other detectors used at the time, the electrolytic detector, Fleming valve and the triode could also rectify AM signals, crystals were the simplest, cheapest AM detector. As more and more radio stations began experimenting with transmitting sound after World War 1, a growing community of radio listeners built or bought crystal radios to listen to them. Use continued to grow until the 1920s when vacuum tube radios replaced them. =Crystodyne: negative resistance diodes= oscillator constructed by Hugo Gernsback in 1924 to Losev's instructions. The zincite point contact diode which serves as the active device is labeled (9). Some semiconductor diodes have a property called negative resistance which means the current through them decreases as the voltage increases over a part of their I‚ÄìV curve. This allows a diode, normally a passive device, to function as an amplifier or oscillator. For example, when connected to a resonant circuit and biased with a DC voltage, the negative resistance of the diode can cancel the positive resistance of the circuit, creating a circuit with zero AC resistance, in which spontaneous oscillating currents arise. This property was first observed in crystal detectors around 1909 by William Henry Eccles and Pickard. They noticed that when their detectors were biased with a DC voltage to improve their sensitivity, they would sometimes break into spontaneous oscillations. However these researchers just published brief accounts and didn't pursue the effect. The first person to exploit negative resistance practically was self-taught Russian physicist Oleg Losev, who devoted his career to the study of crystal detectors. In 1922 working at the new Nizhny Novgorod Radio Laboratory he discovered negative resistance in biased zincite (zinc oxide) point contact junctions. Lee, Thomas H. (2004) The Design of CMOS Radio-Frequency Integrated Circuits, 2nd Ed., p. 20 He realized that amplifying crystals could be an alternative to the fragile, expensive, energy- wasting vacuum tube. He used biased negative resistance crystal junctions to build solid-state amplifiers, oscillators, and amplifying and regenerative radio receivers, 25 years before the invention of the transistor. and \\"The Crystodyne Principle\\", Radio News, September 1924, pages 294-295, 431. Later he even built a superheterodyne receiver. However his achievements were overlooked because of the success of vacuum tubes. His technology was dubbed \\"Crystodyne\\" by science publisher Hugo Gernsback one of the few people in the West who paid attention to it. After ten years he abandoned research into this technology and it was forgotten. The negative resistance diode was rediscovered with the invention of the tunnel diode in 1957, for which Leo Esaki won the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physics. Today, negative resistance diodes such as the Gunn diode and IMPATT diode are widely used as microwave oscillators in such devices as radar speed guns and garage door openers. =Discovery of the light emitting diode (LED)= In 1907 British Marconi engineer Henry Joseph Round noticed that when direct current was passed through a silicon carbide (carborundum) point contact junction, a spot of greenish, bluish, or yellowish light was given off at the contact point. Round had constructed a light emitting diode (LED). However he just published a brief two paragraph note about it and did no further research. While investigating crystal detectors in the mid-1920s at Nizhny Novgorod, Oleg Losev independently discovered that biased carborundum and zincite junctions emitted light. Losev was the first to analyze this device, investigate the source of the light, propose a theory of how it worked, and envision practical applications. He published his experiments in 1927 in a Russian journal, English version published as and the 16 papers he published on LEDs between 1924 and 1930 constitute a comprehensive study of this device. Losev did extensive research into the mechanism of light emission. He measured rates of evaporation of benzine from the crystal surface and found it was not accelerated when light was emitted, concluding that the luminescence was a \\"cold\\" light not caused by thermal effects. He theorized correctly that the explanation of the light emission was in the new science of quantum mechanics, speculating that it was the inverse of the photoelectric effect discovered by Albert Einstein in 1905. He wrote to Einstein about it, but did not receive a reply. Losev designed practical carborundum electroluminescent lights, but found no one interested in commercially producing these weak light sources. Losev died in World War 2. Due partly to the fact that his papers were published in Russian and German, and partly to his lack of reputation (his upper class birth barred him from a college education or career advancement in Soviet society, so he never held an official position higher than technician) his work is not well known in the West. =Use during the broadcast era= Family listening to the first radio broadcasts on a crystal radio in 1922. Since crystal radios cannot drive loudspeakers they must share earphones. In the 1920s, the amplifying triode vacuum tube, invented in 1907 by Lee De Forest, replaced earlier technology in both radio transmitters and receivers.The 1918 edition of the US Navy's manual of radio stated: \\"There are two types of detectors now in use: the Audion [triode] and the crystal or rectifying detector. Coherers and microphones [another type of coherer detector] are practically obsolete... but the use of Audions...is increasing.\\" AM radio broadcasting spontaneously arose around 1920, and radio listening exploded to become a hugely popular pastime. The initial listening audience for the new broadcasting stations was probably largely owners of crystal radios. But lacking amplification, crystal radios had to be listened to with earphones, and could only receive nearby local stations. The amplifying vacuum tube radios which began to be mass-produced in 1921 had greater reception range, did not require the fussy adjustment of a cat whisker, and produced enough audio output power to drive loudspeakers, allowing the entire family to listen comfortably together, or dance to Jazz Age music. So during the 1920s vacuum tube receivers replaced crystal radios in all except poor households.The 1920 \\"British Admiralty Handbook of Wireless Telegraphy\\" stated that: \\"Crystal detectors are being replaced by [triode] valve detectors which are more stable, easier to adjust, and generally more satisfactory\\". The 1925 edition said valves were \\"replacing the crystal for all ordinary purposes\\" Commercial and military wireless telegraphy stations had already switched to more sensitive vacuum tube receivers. Vacuum tubes temporarily put an end to crystal detector research. The temperamental, unreliable action of the crystal detector had always been a barrier to its acceptance as a standard component in commercial radio equipment and was one reason for its rapid replacement. Frederick Seitz, an early semiconductor researcher, wrote: The crystal radio became a cheap alternative receiver used in emergencies and by people who couldn't afford tube radios: teenagers, the poor, and those in developing countries. Building a crystal set remained a popular educational project to introduce people to radio, used by organizations like the Boy Scouts. The galena detector, the most widely used type among amateurs, became virtually the only detector used in crystal radios from this point on. The carborundum junction saw some use as a detector in early vacuum tube radios because it was more sensitive than the triode grid-leak detector. Crystal radios were kept as emergency backup radios on ships. During World War 2 in Nazi-occupied Europe the radio saw use as an easily constructed, easily concealed clandestine radio by Resistance groups. After World War 2, the development of modern semiconductor diodes finally made the galena cat whisker detector obsolete. =Development of the theory of semiconductor rectification= Semiconductor devices like the crystal detector work by quantum mechanical principles; their operation cannot be explained by classical physics. The birth of quantum mechanics in the 1920s was the necessary foundation for the development of semiconductor physics in the 1930s, during which physicists arrived at an understanding of how the crystal detector worked. The German word halbleiter, translated into English as \\"semiconductor\\", was first used in 1911 to describe substances whose conductivity fell between conductors and insulators, such as the crystals in crystal detectors. Felix Bloch and Rudolf Peierls around 1930 applied quantum mechanics to create a theory of how electrons move through a crystal. In 1931, Alan Wilson created quantum band theory which explains the electrical conductivity of solids. Werner Heisenberg conceived the idea of a hole, a vacancy in a crystal lattice where an electron should be, which can move about the lattice like a positive particle; both electrons and holes conduct current in semiconductors. A breakthrough came when it was realized that the rectifying action of crystalline semiconductors was not due to the crystal alone but to the presence of impurity atoms in the crystal lattice. Michael Riordan, Lillian Hoddeson (1998) Crystal Fire: The Invention of the Transistor and the Birth of the Information Age, p. 89-93 In 1930 Bernhard Gudden and Wilson established that electrical conduction in semiconductors was due to trace impurities in the crystal, a \\"pure\\" semiconductor did not act as a semiconductor, but as an insulator (at low temperatures). The maddeningly variable activity of different pieces of crystal when used in a detector, and the presence of \\"active sites\\" on the surface, was due to natural variations in the concentration of these impurities throughout the crystal. Nobel Laureate Walter Brattain, coinventor of the transistor, noted: The \\"metallurgical purity\\" chemicals used by scientists to make synthetic experimental detector crystals had about 1% impurities which were responsible for such inconsistent results. During the 1930s progressively better refining methods were developed, allowing scientists to create ultrapure semiconductor crystals into which they introduced precisely controlled amounts of trace elements (called doping). This for the first time created semiconductor junctions with reliable, repeatable characteristics, allowing scientists to test their theories, and later making manufacture of modern diodes possible. The theory of rectification in a metal-semiconductor junction, the type used in a cat whisker detector, was developed in 1938 independently by Walter Schottky Schottky, W. \\"Halbleitertheorie der Sperrsschicht.\\" Naturwissenschaften Vol. 26 (1938) pp. 843. Abstract in English as \\"Semiconductor Theory of the Blocking Layer\\" in Sze, S.M. Semiconductor Devices: Pioneering Papers. (World Scientific Publishing Co., 1991) pp. 381 at Siemens & Halske research laboratory in Germany and Nevill Mott reprinted in at Bristol University, UK. Mott received the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1949 at Bell Labs William Shockley derived the Shockley diode equation which gives the nonlinear exponential current‚Äìvoltage curve of a crystal detector, observed by scientists since Braun and Bose, which is responsible for rectification . 1N23 silicon diode. Grid 1/4 inch. =The first modern diodes= The development of microwave technology during the 1930s run up to World War 2 for use in military radar led to the resurrection of the point contact crystal detector. Microwave radar receivers required a nonlinear device that could act as a mixer, to mix the incoming microwave signal with a local oscillator signal, to shift the microwave signal down to a lower intermediate frequency (IF) at which it could be amplified. The vacuum tubes used as mixers at lower frequencies in superheterodyne receivers could not function at microwave frequencies due to excessive capacitance. In the mid-1930s George Southworth at Bell Labs, working on this problem, bought an old cat whisker detector and found it worked at microwave frequencies. Hans Hollmann in Germany made the same discovery. The MIT Radiation Laboratory launched a project to develop microwave detector diodes, focusing on silicon, which had the best detecting properties. By about 1942 point-contact silicon crystal detectors for radar receivers such as the 1N21 and 1N23 were being mass-produced, consisting of a slice of boron-doped silicon crystal with a tungsten wire point pressed firmly against it. The cat whisker contact did not require adjustment, and these were sealed units. A second parallel development program at Purdue University produced germanium diodes. Such point-contact diodes are still being manufactured, and may be considered the first modern diodes. After the war, germanium diodes replaced galena cat whisker detectors in the few crystal radios being made. Germanium diodes are more sensitive than silicon diodes as detectors, because germanium has a lower forward voltage drop than silicon (0.4 vs 0.7 volts). Today a few galena cat whisker detectors are still being made, but only for antique replica crystal radios or devices for science education.

Basic theory of tracker time Traditional music trackers cut time into \\"ticks\\" based on the system clock of the hardware the software is running on. For every tick, one event can take place. This event could be a sample playing, a volume changing, an effect taking place or a sample ceasing to play. This allows the musician to visually organize time in a gridwork of cells in which to set these events into motion, and thus decide the overall tempo of the music. This \\"time signature\\" can be altered programmatically throughout the piece of music, allowing tempo to rise, shift, swerve erratically or any combination of these as the musician sees fit. The retrigger effect For tracker musicians working at very slow speeds, the need to escape the confines of this time-grid is often apparent. For instance a musician might want to add a drum roll, but lack the time resolution to do so effectively. The retrigger effect allows this by calling an event that tells the software to replay the triggered sample at a set rate within the timeframe of the tick on which the event transpires. This ability to circumvent this one rigid limitation of the typical music tracker software has become a staple of the tracker scene, in some cases inspiring artist names and album titles based on the concept of retriggering.

The Coral business was established by Joe Coral in 1926. It grew into an entertainment conglomerate before undergoing a series of ownership changes starting in 1981. As of 2015, Coral had 1,845 shops across the country. History Joe Coral (born Joseph Kagarlitski, 11 December 1904 ‚Äì 16 December 1996) began his bookmaking business in 1926 and, although primarily concerned with operating betting pitches at racecourses, together with his friend Tom Bradbury-Pratt, he ran speedway meetings at Harringay and opened a credit office in the West End of London in 1943. He had greyhound racing pitches at Harringay Stadium and then White City Stadium followed later by Clapton Stadium and Walthamstow Stadium before branching into betting offices. He was one of the first to take advantage of the new legislation and opened his first licensed betting office in 1961. The new law was not intended to encourage betting and therefore shops were unattractive in appearance and devoid of any comforts. Coral arranged a merger with another bookmaker, Mark Lane in 1971. By 1979, the company had become the Coral Leisure Group and had diversified to include a variety of other businesses, including casinos, hotels, restaurants, Pontins holiday camps, squash clubs, bingo clubs, and real estate. In January 1981, the Coral Group was acquired by Bass plc and although it continued to retain the Coral name it became an integral part of the growing Bass Leisure. In September 1998, Bass sold Coral to the Ladbroke Group for ¬£363 million. The UK Government, however, ordered Ladbroke to sell Coral after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that the acquisition was anti-competitive. The Coral business, except for 59 shops in Ireland and Jersey, was sold in a management buyout financed by Morgan Grenfell Private Equity for ¬£390 million in February 1999. In November 1999, Coral acquired Eurobet, an online betting operation based in Gibraltar, for ¬£7.1 million. The company changed its name to Coral Eurobet in May 2000. Coral Eurobet was then sold in a further management buy out in September 2002, which was backed by Charterhouse Development Capital. In October 2005, Coral Eurobet was acquired for ¬£2.18 billion by casino and bingo firm Gala, which changed its name to Gala Coral Group, creating the United Kingdom's third largest bookmaker and largest bingo operator. Coral and Eurobet continued to operate as divisions of Gala Coral. A Coral betting shop in Cross Gates, Leeds. In July 2009, Coral announced the relocation of their broadcasting department to Milton Keynes to a purpose built studio to manage the inception of its new television channel, Coral TV. In May 2010, Coral bookmakers launched the Coral Dugout which was designed to offer in-depth football knowledge from ex-Premier League referee Graham Poll and sports presenter Jeff Stelling during the FIFA World Cup 2010. In November 2011, Coral announced they had signed for 30,793 sq ft of offices at One Stratford Place at Westfields ¬£1.45bn Stratford City scheme opposite the Olympics stadium in east London. In November 2016, Gala Coral was acquired by Ladbrokes, which changed its name to Ladbrokes Coral. Coral and Ladbrokes shops continued to operate under their respective names. GVC Holdings acquired Ladbrokes Coral in March 2018. Marketing and advertising As part of their experimental marketing campaign strategy, Coral engaged in the ‚ÄòRUN 4 IT‚Äô campaign, requiring brand ambassadors dressed in trademark robber costumes, to physically ‚Äòsteal‚Äô customers from competitor bookies. Over the course of this three week campaign, punters were encouraged to change their betting habits with the lure of a guaranteed win loyalty card and then walked by the ambassadors to the nearest Coral. This campaign saw a 7% conversion rate and 2,447 customers were ‚Äòstolen‚Äô from 900 bookies.

Regular clear skies give excellent visibility. Observation Hill is a lava dome and one of many volcanoes comprising the Hut Point Peninsula. Memorial Cross After their deaths in early 1912, the last members of Robert Falcon Scott's party were found by a search party led by the surgeon Edward L. Atkinson. The relief party took their photographic film, scientific specimens, and other materials. They had to leave Scott and his men in their tent, and later parties could not locate the campsite, since that area had been covered in snow. A century of storms and snow have covered the cairn and tent, which are now encased in the Ross Ice Shelf as it inches towards the Ross Sea. In 2001 glaciologist Charles R. Bentley estimated that the tent with the bodies was under about 75 feet (23 m) of ice and about 30 miles (48 km) from the point where they died; he speculated that in about 275 years the bodies would reach the Ross Sea, and perhaps float away inside an iceberg. The search party returned to their base camp in McMurdo Sound to await the relief ship.

Born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Parrish was usually known by his middle name \\"Dillwyn\\", or \\"Tim\\" or \\"Timmy\\" by those close to him. He was the son of Thomas Parrish, who came from an artistic Philadelphia family, and Anne Lodge, who had studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, becoming a respected portrait painter, and becoming a friend of Mary Cassatt in Paris. Dillwyn Parrish was the younger brother of author Anne Parrish; they were cousins to the artist Maxfield Parrish who used them as models in some of his paintings. Dillwyn's father Thomas gained success in the Colorado mining business but died when Dillwyn was relatively young. His mother moved the family back to her hometown of Claymont, Delaware. Dillwyn Parrish studied art in Philadelphia, then attended Harvard University, where he made the acquaintance of Conrad Aiken and E. E. Cummings. During World War I he volunteered to drive ambulances for the American Field Service in France, but after being diagnosed with severe malnutrition he was sent back to the U.S. to recover. A year later he was drafted into the United States Army and served in a military hospital. While still in his twenties, medical problems began to plague him, exacerbated by the fact that he was a heavy cigarette smoker. In 1923, Dillwyn Parrish did the illustrations for a 209-page children's novel written by his sister Anne, Knee-High to a Grasshopper. They followed this publication with two more books for children, publishing Lustres in 1924 and then earning a Newbery Honor in 1925 for their third collaboration, The Dream Coach. On a trip to Switzerland the two purchased \\"Le Paquis,\\" a cottage in a meadow overlooking Lake Geneva not far from Lausanne between Vevey and Chexbres. For a time, Dillwyn Parrish tutored the children of a wealthy family, and eventually fell in love with Gertrude \\"Gigi\\" McElroy, the family's youngest girl. In 1926, Harper & Bros published his novel Smith Everlasting, and between then and 1934 three more of his books came out. In 1927 he married the fifteen-year-old \\"Gigi\\", and for their honeymoon the couple started out on motorcycles from his home in Claymont, Delaware, intending to drive across the country to California. However, his new bride was severely injured in an accident in the Southwestern United States and, once she was able to travel, they completed the remainder of the journey via train. In 1929, they moved permanently to California, where a few years later, the beautiful Gigi Parrish was signed to a contract with Samuel Goldwyn's motion picture company and in 1934 she became one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars. Dillwyn and Gigi Parrish rented a beach house in Laguna Beach, next door to Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher and her husband Alfred Fisher, with whom they became friends. Dillwyn Parrish fell in love with Mary Fisher, and after encouraging her writing, helped get her culinary essays published in 1937 under the title Serve it Forth. Their relationship came at a point when his marriage was already in difficulty, and eventually both couples divorced. He married M.F.K. Fisher in 1938 and next year Harper published their co-written novel Touch and Go under the pseudonym of Victoria Berne. They lived at Le Paquis in Switzerland until 1939, when war broke out again in Europe. In January 1940 they bought land with a pinewood cabin in the San Jacinto Mountains near Hemet, California. Parrish had already developed Buerger's disease, which resulted in the amputation of a leg. During this time, he returned to painting, creating a series of works dominated by images of angels of death that formed part of an exhibition organized by the University of California, Los Angeles. His health rapidly deteriorated, and he lived in constant pain. Faced with the necessity of further limb amputations, on August 6, 1941 he shot himself in the countryside near his home in the San Jacinto Mountains. He was cremated, his ashes buried under an overhanging rock on the mountain rim overlooking their home. He was 47 years old.

It lies on the east end of the MƒÉrginimea Sibiului area. At the 2011 census, 95.3% of inhabitants were Romanians, 3.3% Roma, 0.8% Hungarians and 0.6% Germans. Geography TƒÉlmaciu is situated at the confluence of the Sadu and Cibin rivers, two km before the confluence of the Cibin with the Olt. It lies on one of the main access routes between Transylvania and Wallachia, at the north entrance of the Olt River Gorge; the European route E81 passes through it. The town administers two villages: *Colonia TƒÉlmaciu (Feltrinellitelep), three km towards the north *TƒÉlmƒÉcel (Kistalm√°cs), three km towards the west It also administered four other villages until 2004, when they were split off to form Boi»õa Commune. History The first documents referring to TƒÉlmaciu (Tholmach) are from 1318. After the Saxon colonisation of Transylvania, TƒÉlmaciu was the administrative center for the settlements of TƒÉlmƒÉcel, Boi»õa, Turnul Ro»ôu, Racovi»õa, Sebe»ôul de Jos, and Plopi. After 1453 the administrative center was moved to Sibiu. In 1987 TƒÉlmaciu was granted town status. Because using the Olt pass to the south requires passing through TƒÉlmaciu, it has witnessed numerous historical events: * The Romans passed through during the battles between the troops of Emperor Trajan and King Decebalus of Dacia. * 1599: Mihai Viteazu's troops regrouped here before the battle of »òelimbƒÉr. * 1848: the Czarist troops battled General Bem's army. * 1916: the Romanian Army used the town to stage the battle for Sibiu. =De facto capital of the Romanian 1st Army's occupation zone in Transylvania (16 - 28 September 1916)= On 29 August 1916, during the Battle of Transylvania, TƒÉlmaciu - then part of the Hungarian half of Austria-Hungary - was occupied by General Ioan Culcer's Romanian 1st Army. The most powerful unit of the 1st Army was the I Corps. It was its only army corps and as such the only unit of the 1st Army to comprise multiple divisions. The I Corps was commanded by General Ioan Popovici. In the middle of September, Culcer moved the I Corps headquarters to TƒÉlmaciu, to direct the operations of the two divisions located there. Popovici arrived in TƒÉlmaciu along with his staff on 16 September. TƒÉlmaciu was evacuated by the Romanians on 28 September, towards the end of the Battle of Nagyszeben.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 21-23, 103-104 and 111 TƒÉlmaciu also served as the air base for the 1st Army's squadron, consisting of - depending on source - 3 or 6 aircraft.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916‚Äì17, p. 341Ronald L.

Alongside his communications management roles he specialised in crisis management and counterterrorist issues, and his final posting was to create and lead Britain's civil crisis management unit and the government's communication specialists. He is regularly interviewed in the media on the handling of terrorism and major emergencies. Early life Granatt attended Westminster City School from 1961, then Queen Mary College, University of London where he ran the students' union newspaper for two years. He briefly appeared in what its members considered the legendary folk/rock band Pig Rider penning some of the lyrics for the curiously mis-titled Paeolithic Transport Blues. Career After working as a trade and local news journalist, Granatt joined the civil service in 1979 as an information officer. After junior postings in the Department of Employment and the Home Office, he joined the Department of Energy and became director of information within three years. In this role he managed the response to the Piper Alpha oil rig disaster. He went on to hold similar posts, becoming Director of Public Affairs and Internal Communication for the Metropolitan Police in 1989, Director of Communication at the Department of the Environment in 1992, and Director of Communication at the Home Office in 1994. He was nicknamed \\"Metal Mickey\\" due to his always having the latest gadgets. While at the Home Office he was appointed head of profession for the Government Information Service, becoming full-time in that post on transfer to the Cabinet Office in 1998. This move, to provide direct support to Sir Richard Wilson (now Lord Wilson of Dinton), then cabinet secretary, was made to help deliver changes facing the renamed Government Information and Communication Service (GICS) after Labour won power in 1997. Much of his work concentrated on reforms, including founding a media monitoring unit in September 1997 due to ministers' dissatisfaction with the work of the GIS, and criticising the government's advertising campaigns as fragmented and wasteful. He was also the central adviser on the ethics and guidance governing the work of the GICS and other government communication staff. He wrote guidelines for the general election period in 2001 advising press officers to \\"Stay paranoid, stay boring, stay safe\\". Granatt describes Alastair Campbell, who was Tony Blair's special advisor at the time, as \\"an extraordinarily good operator\\", though he thought he was given too much power. =Crisis management= Granatt took a leading role in co-ordinating public information from government in the run up to the Millennium, during the nationwide fuel protests of 2000, and the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001. Granatt said of the existing systems that \\"we've got a system that was put in place for nuclear war.\\" In 2001 Granatt was asked to set up the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, to reform Whitehall's civil emergencies arrangements and carry out \\"horizon scanning\\" after the earlier failures in the government's communication responses to crises. CCS was established in July 2001, and replaced the Home Office's Emergency Planning Division, which had replaced the Home Defence and Emergency Services Division of Cold War days, but its mission to update the UK's emergency planning arrangements was swept up in the counterterrorist reforms following 11 September 2001. Having established CCS, in late 2002 Granatt reverted to the sole job of leading the GICS and was promoted to director-general, at the second highest rank in the civil service. At the end of December 2003, Granatt took early retirement following a review into the GICS led by Sir Bob Phillis that abolished his post. =Consulting and PR= Granatt then joined George Pitcher's city consultancy Luther Pendragon in 2004. In this role he was Michael Martin's media advisor when Martin was Speaker of the House of Commons from 2005 until February 2008. He resigned saying he had been misled over a scandal involving the Speaker's expenses. One of his clients in 2007 was the BBC Trust. Currently he is senior associate fellow at the Advanced Research and Assessment Group of the Defence Academy of the UK, a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Public Relations, a past master of the City of London Guild of Public Relations Practitioners, chair of the governors and trustees of Mary Hare School, and chairman of the UK Press Card Authority. The IPR awarded him the Sir Stephen Tallents medal in 2002. He was previously a visiting professor at the University of Westminster. In 2005 he wrote a code of ethics for media commentators with Patrick Lagedec. In 2007, he was the author of Luther Pendragon's code of conduct, which formed part of their submission to the House of Commons Public Administration Select Committee inquiry into lobbying in 2008. Mike Granatt is also National Advisor to Community Resilience UK.

From his third wife Nig√¢rnik Hanƒ±m he has 4 great grandchildren; Turkish Diplomat Reha Aytaman, ≈ûira Arƒ±koƒülu, Ok≈üan Aytaman and Murat Aytaman.  Biography  He was born in the Ey√ºp district of Istanbul. He was taught by the famous Dede Efendi. After Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I became aware of his beautiful voice, he was admitted to the Muzika-yi Humayun, which was the Imperial Military Music School in the Ottoman Empire. Due to his closeness to the Sultan, he was responsible for teaching music to the women in the harem. He fell in love with one of the Circassian concubines, √áe≈üm-i Dilber, and had two children with her. He composed several songs after she left him for a merchant. His next wife from the harem also met with a death from tuberculosis, also a cause for several songs by Arif Bey.

She was a runner-up for the Newbery Medal three times from 1925 to 1951. Early life Parrish was born November 12, 1888, in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where she attended the Misses Ferris' and San Luis Schools. Her father was Thomas Clarkson Parrish, an etcher from Philadelphia. Her mother, Anne (n√©e Lodge), had studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, becoming a portrait painter and a friend of Mary Cassatt in Paris. Anne Parrish was the elder sister of the illustrator-writer Dillwyn Parrish and a cousin of the painter Maxfield Parrish. Thomas Parrish was in the Colorado mining business and died in 1899 around age 53. The rest of her childhood was spent in her family hometown of Claymont, Delaware, and she went on to, study \\"painting in Philadelphia, more because my mother and father were painters than because I was one.\\" In 1915, Parrish married industrialist Charles Albert Corliss. Career As a young woman, Parrish trained at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women and studied under Thomas Eakins. She chose a career in literature, with her first romantic novel Pocketful of Poses appearing in 1923, the same year she had a children's book published, with her brother Dillwyn as illustrator. Their collaboration titled Knee-High to a Grasshopper was followed by another book for children in 1924, Lustres. In 1925 she was a runner-up for the Newbery Medal for The Dream Coach, the third collaboration with her brother. That same year, her novel The Perennial Bachelor was the eighth best-selling book for the entire year according to the New York Times and won the Harper Prize from her publisher, Harper & Brothers. An author of stories that mostly featured female protagonists, in 1927, she had another novel make it into the top ten list of bestselling novels in the United States. She repeated on the annual bestsellers list again in 1928 with All Kneeling, that was made into the 1950 film Born to Be Bad, starring Joan Fontaine and Robert Ryan. Monet painting in his garden in Argenteuil, by Pierre-Auguste Renoir Parrish assembled an art collection that included the 1873 Impressionist painting Monet Painting in His Garden at Argenteuil by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Vase with Red Poppies (1886) by Vincent Van Gogh, both of which she bequeathed to the Wadsworth Atheneum museum of art in Hartford, Connecticut. Later life Her husband died in 1936. Two years later, she married the poet and novelist Josiah Titzell (aka Frederick Lambeck). They made their home in Redding, Connecticut. After he died in 1943, she continued to live there for the rest of her life. Parrish died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Danbury, Connecticut, in 1957. She endowed the \\"Anne Parrish Titzell Professor of Neurology\\" chair at Cornell University, originally for research and treatment of mental and emotional disorders.

EFAE, as it is also known, played an old school style of punk, more along the veins of The Exploited or even, some say, Agnostic Front. The punk stylings of EFAE has been compared to fellow countrymen Post Regiment, perhaps mostly due to the common factor of a female vocalist. However, EFAE's Anna Koziel's vocal style is remarkably different from the nowadays disbanded Post Regiment's Dominika \\"Nika\\" Domczyk's style.

Alex Anderson. The song takes its title from the Hawaiian phrase Mele Kalikimaka, meaning \\"Merry Christmas\\".Elbert, S. & Pukui, M.; Hawaiian Dictionary, page 481 One of the earliest recordings of this song was by Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters in 1950 on Decca . It has been covered by many artists and used in several films (including L.A. Confidential, Catch Me If You Can and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation.)  History of the song  Anderson recalled the inspiration for writing the song in 1949 while working at Vonn Hamm-Young: Bing Crosby was a frequent visitor and golf partner of Anderson. Anderson played the song for Crosby, who liked it so much that he surprised Anderson with the 1950 recording. In 1955, the song became part of Crosby's famous compilation album Merry Christmas. According to Anderson's daughter Pam, the family still receives revenues from all over the world every year from his songs including Mele Kalikimaka.  Origin of the phrase  The expression , despite its foreign sound, is actually borrowed directly from English. But since the Hawaiian language has a different phonological system from English, it is not possible to render a pronunciation that is especially close to Merry Christmas. Standard Hawaiian does not have the or sounds of English and its phonotactic constraints do not permit consonants at the end of syllables or consonant clusters. Thus the closest approximation to Merry Christmas is . The earliest record of in print is from 1904, in the Hawaiian language newspaper Ka Nupepa Kuokoa, published between 1861 and 1927.

ARL is headquartered at the Adelphi Laboratory Center (ALC) in Adelphi, Maryland. Its largest single site is at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. Other major ARL locations include Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, Orlando, Florida, and NASA's Glenn Research Center, Ohio and Langley Research Center, Virginia. ARL also has regional sites in Los Angeles (ARL West), Chicago (ARL Central), College Station, TX (ARL South), and Boston (ARL Northeast). In addition to the Army Research Office, ARL has six technical directorates: *Computational and Information Sciences *Human Research and Engineering *Sensors and Electron Devices *Survivability/Lethality Analysis *Vehicle Technology *Weapons and Materials Research History Before the forming of the ARL, the United States Army had research facilities dating back to 1820 when the laboratory at Watertown Arsenal, Massachusetts, studied pyrotechnics and waterproof paper cartridges. This facility would evolve into the Materials Technology Laboratory. Most pre-WWII military research occurred within the military by military personnel, but in 1945, the Army published a policy affirming the need for civilian scientific contributions in military planning and weapons production. Non-military involvement before this time was frequent; however, methods for contribution to warfare technology was on limited and incidental basis. On June 11, 1946, a new research and development division of the War Department General Staff was created; however, due to internal forces within the military which supported the traditional technical service structure the division was closed. A variety of reorganizations took place over the next four decades, which put many organizations in command of Army research and development. Often commanders of these organizations were advocates of the reorganization, while some middle level management was opposed to the change. =Reorganization= The ARL represents the realization of a memorandum dated January 6, 1989 from the LABCOM Commander recommending integrating the corporate laboratories into a single entity. As part of the Base Realignment and Closure of 1989/1991, the consolidated research facilities would be located primarily at Adelphi Laboratory Center and Aberdeen Proving Ground. This would also relocate the majority of operations at MTL to APG. The Federal Advisory Commission reviewed and accepted the creation of ARL in 1992. Directorates =Army Research Office= The Army Research Office (ARO), located in Research Triangle Park, funds extramural basic research, that is, research in outside academic and industrial organizations, providing grants to both single investigators and university-affiliated research centers, as well as outreach programs. =Computational and Information Sciences= The Computational and Information Sciences Directorate (CISD) is the foremost U.S. Army organization for research and development of modern electronic systems. This research supports capabilities in the analysis, distribution, and assimilation of real or simulated digitized battlefield information. In addition to the digitized war initiatives, high performance computing research is performed at a variety of centers under the ARL. The use of supercomputers for mathematical simulations instead of mass fabrication can result in the conservation of human and physical resources. The directorate is a key player in the International Technology Alliance in conjunction with SEDD and HRED directorates. =Human Research and Engineering= The U.S. Army Research Laboratory's Human Research and Engineering Directorate (HRED) is the principal Army organization for research and development (R&D;) in the human dimension. HRED conducts a broad-based program of scientific research and technology directed toward optimizing Soldier performance and Soldier-machine interactions to maximize battlefield effectiveness. HRED also executes an analysis mission that provides the Army with human factors leadership to ensure that Soldier performance requirements are adequately considered in technology development and system design. HRED coordinates technologies within the Army, other services and their laboratories, industry, and academia to leverage basic and applied research opportunities for the benefit of the Army. =Sensors and Electron Devices= Sensors and Electron Devices Directorate (SEDD) is a group dedicated to produce equipment from tiny chips to fully integrated systems. SEDD also helps develop sensors and electronic devices which become an important part of modern warfare. Other components of this directorate include: multifunction radio frequency equipment, autonomous sensing, power generation and management, and signal processing algorithms. One of the best ways to protect the soldier is to develop autonomous sensing systems for all activities, from intelligence gathering to waging warfare. =Survivability/Lethality Analysis= The Survivability/Lethality Analysis Directorate (SLAD) is the primary center for expertise in survivability, lethality, and vulnerability of all army systems, across the full range of battlefield threats: ballistic, electronic warfare, information operations, and nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare. SLAD's mission is to assist technology and system developers in optimizing system designs and to provide analytical data to evaluators and decision makers in the Army and the DOD. =Vehicle Technology= The U.S. Army Research Laboratory's Vehicle Technology Directorate (VTD) manages research and development of vehicle propulsion and structure. In addition, VTD conducts analytical and practical experiments in loads analysis, structural dynamics, aero-elasticity, structural acoustics, and vibration reduction. VTD makes ground combat vehicles lighter, more reliable, safer, and more fuel efficient. Air combat vehicles such as the helicopter are studied to decrease the vibrations caused by the rotors. Metallic materials are engineered to increase strength and decrease corrosion through the use of composites. The divisions of VTD are Loads & Dynamics, Structural Mechanics, Engine & Transmission Systems, Engine Components, and Unmanned Vehicles.U.S. Army Research Laboratory, \\"Vehicle Technology\\" Vehicle Technology Directorate (VTD) =Weapons and Materials Research= The U.S. Army Research Laboratory Weapons and Materials Research Directorate (WMRD) is the principal U.S. Army organization for research and development in weapons and materials technologies. The directorate is charged with making bullets pierce farther and ballistic vests stronger. Although these interests may seem opposed, the goal is to increase the survivability of the soldier. In the WMRD, traditional armaments are studied, as are advanced ballistic defense systems. This directorate is especially linked with VTD in order to produce safer vehicles, transports, and aircraft. One aspect of this directorate's analysis duty is to evaluate military technologies from an economical standpoint in order to reduce overall system costs. Federated Laboratories Beginning in 1996, the Army Research Laboratory entered into innovative cooperative agreements with industrial and academic partners to form \\"federated laboratories,\\" or \\"FedLabs\\", to perform research in broad areas important to the U.S. Army where the ARL could extract significant leverage from work being performed in the commercial and academic arenas. The first three FedLabs were in Advanced Displays, Advanced Sensors, and Telecommunications. Each FedLab was a large consortium of companies, universities, and non-profit organizations, with both an overall industrial leader and an ARL leader. The cooperative agreements forming the FedLabs were somewhat unusual in that the ARL was not a mere funder of research, but an active consortium participant.Brown, Edward (1998).

Gigi Parrish and Lon Chaney Jr., in Girl o' My Dreams (1934) She was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts as Katherine Gertrude McElroy and raised in Hartford, Connecticut. Her mother died in 1918, and McElroy and her siblings were put up for adoption. After adoption by a wealthy family, she and her step-siblings were tutored by author Dillwyn Parrish. Although he was eighteen years her senior, the two fell in love, and at the age of fifteen she married Parrish, under the name Gertrude McElroy.Ancestry.com records of marriage between Dillwyn Parrish and Gertrude McElroy For their honeymoon, she and her husband started out on motorcycles from his family's home in Claymont, Delaware, intending to drive across the country to California. Parrish was severely injured in an accident in the Southwestern United States and, once she was physically able, they completed the remainder of the journey via train. In 1929, she and her husband moved permanently to California, where, a few years later, Parrish was signed to a contract with Samuel Goldwyn's motion picture company. In 1933 she made her film debut in Roman Scandals, starring Eddie Cantor and Gloria Stuart. Parrish became a \\"WAMPAS Baby Star\\", touring the country to promote motion pictures through the Shriners sponsorship. In 1934 she appeared in secondary roles in six more films. Gigi and Dillwyn Parrish rented a beach house in Laguna Beach, next door to Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher and her husband Alfred Fisher, with whom they became good friends. Her husband fell in love with Mary Fisher at a point when the marriage was already in difficulty. By the time both couples divorced, Parrish had already fallen in love with journalist and screenwriter John Weld (1905-2003). After appearing in nine films, she gave up her acting career and married Weld in 1937. From 1949 to 1965 she and her husband published The Laguna Beach Post, at which time she was known as Katherine Weld.

A new bride, playing a game of hide-and-seek or trying to get away from the crowd during her wedding breakfast, hides in a chest in an attic and is unable to escape. She is not discovered by her family and friends, and suffocates or dies of thirst. The body is found many years later in the locked chest as a skeleton in a wedding dress. Notable claimants for the story's location, some still displaying the chest, include Bramshill House and Marwell Hall in Hampshire, Castle Horneck in Cornwall, Basildon Grotto in Berkshire, Minster Lovell Hall in Oxfordshire, Exton Hall in Rutland, Brockdish Hall in Norfolk and Bawdrip Rectory in Somerset. History The tale first appeared in print in the form of a poem by Samuel Rogers entitled \\"Ginevra\\", in his book Italy published in 1822.Samuel Rogers: Italy, A Poem, Part the first. London 1822. pp. 123-130 books.google In notes on this work, Rogers states ‚ÄòThe story is, I believe, founded on fact; though the time and the place are uncertain. Many old houses lay claim to it.‚ÄôSamuel Rogers: Italy, A Poem, London 1830. p. 259 books.google.The Bride of Modena by John Heneage Jesse, in: Tales of the Dead, and Other Poems, London 1830, pp. 35-59, Internet Archive. The popularity of the tale was greatly increased when it appeared as a song in the 1830s entitled 'The Mistletoe Bough' written by T. H. Bayly and Sir Henry Bishop. The song proved very popular. In 1859, its 'solemn chanting' was referred to as a 'national occurrence at Christmas' in English households, and by 1862 the song was referred to as 'one of the most popular songs ever written', 'which must be known by heart by many readers'. Further works inspired by the song include a play of the same name by Charles A. Somerset, first produced in 1835, and two short stories: Henry James's \\"The Romance of Certain Old Clothes\\" (published 1868) and Susan Wallace's \\"Ginevra or The Old Oak Chest: A Christmas Story\\" (published 1887). The song is also played in Thomas Hardy's A Laodicean, after the scene involving the capture of George Somerset's handkerchief from the tower. Kate Mosse reinterpreted the story in her 2013 short-story collection The Mistletoe Bride and Other Haunting Tales. Film versions of the story include a 1904 production by the Clarendon Film Company, directed by Percy Stow; a 1923 version made by the British and Colonial Kinematograph Company; and a 1926 production by Cosmopolitan Films, directed by C.C. Calvert. The Percy Stow film version of the story can be seen on the BFI player with a new specially commissioned score by Pete Wiggs from the band Saint Etienne The story of the Mistletoe Bough is also recounted in the 1948 Alfred Hitchcock film Rope, where it is said to be the favorite tale of the main character, Brandon Shaw. Unbeknownst to the story teller, Shaw has previously murdered his friend, former classmate David Kentley and hidden the body in the chest in front of which they are standing.

The society has passed through a series of changes in direction, including a period during which it offered distance-learning courses in philosophy (although it no longer does today). These courses caused a minor academic tussle in the 1950s over the status of its diplomas of associateship, triggered by an ill-advised attempt to award them to all the then UK university Philosophy Professors an honorary fellowship (FPhS). In the words of its founding statement, the Philosophical Society of England exists 'to promote the study of practical philosophy among the general public'. It aims to bring together professional philosophers and non-professionals, to bring philosophical ideas and problems to the public attention, and to encourage wider discussion of both traditional and topical philosophical issues. To carry out this function, the society published its own journal, The Philosopher, set up local groups for lectures and discussions and held regular conferences, often free of charge. The journal continues to be published to this day, with recent notable contributors including Mary Midgley, Timothy Williamson, and Jason Stanley. Its most high-profile president has been Professor Brenda Almond, well known for her work in the cause of 'Applied Philosophy' in the United Kingdom, who helped shepherd the society to its 100th anniversary, celebrated with a special conference in Malmesbury in 2012. The society has never aligned itself with any particular school of philosophy, nor is it a cover for any political, ideological, religious, or esoteric movement or interests. Membership is open to all interested persons who share the society's aims. Under the chairmanship of Newcastle-based philosopher Michael Bavidge, the Philosophical Society of England continues to run events, workshops, and reading groups around the country, and especially in London and Newcastle upon Tyne. It currently collaborates with various other public philosophy bodies, including the Newcastle Philosophy Society, Bigg Books, and The London Philosophy Club. In October 2019, it is co-organizing a mini UK- tour for Yale philosopher Martin H√§gglund.

History In 1415 St. George became the Patron Saint of England after the English soldiers fighting under the command of King Henry V had beaten the French at the Battle of Agincourt. Ever since then, St George has been the patriotic rallying point for the English people. Before the formation of The Royal Society of St. George and the American Revolution, Societies of St. George had been founded in the then North American Colonies for the relief of British immigrants and to give them general assistance in the new country. The earliest Branches of which there are any records are those of New York (1770), Philadelphia (1772) and Charlestown (1773). Subsequently Branches were formed in all the great cities of the North American continent and celebrations were always held on St. George's Day. At the time of the War of Independence many Loyalists moved to Canada and founded similar Societies in Halifax (1786) and other cities. Howard Ruff was the founder in 1894 and the first Honorary Secretary of the Royal Society of St. George. In 1900 he gave up farming to devote his time exclusively to the Society.Obituary: Mr Howard Ruff. The Times, 2 November 1928. The Society's first Royal Patron was Queen Victoria - each monarch since has been the patron of the Society. The Society is incorporated by a Royal Charter which was presented by Elizabeth II in 1963 and has its own Armorial Bearings granted under Letters Patent in 1990 and also now has members and branches around the world.

Jerrycans and other metal containers filled with gasoline were loaded onto both cruisers and were placed on the ships' open decks.

Rogue finds some beaten H.A.M.M.E.R. agents and after absorbing their memories to see if they know where Paras is, it is revealed they attacked him when he was trying to go home to check on his friends. In self-defense, he attacks them and knocks them out.X-Men: Legacy #226 This act of self-defense causes Paras to have an internal crisis, believing that he violated the most important tenet of his Jain faith‚Äîabsolute nonviolence. Attempting to access his powers causes him great pain, which Paras believes is divine punishment for betraying his beliefs. Rogue attempts to counsel him, suggesting that his inability to access his powers is psychosomatic. Rogue confronts him with the fact that he chose the codename Indra, the Hindu god of war, despite his pacifist beliefs, and states that she believes he did so out of belief in his own potential. She further states that rather than embrace that potential, he is choosing to back away from it. This causes Paras to lose control, claiming that his Indra form is \\"not him\\" before his powers fully remanifest, now as a sophisticated full suit of armor and weaponry. =Collision= Following Second Coming, Rogue and Magneto bring Indra along with fellow students Anole and Loa back to Indra's home in Mumbai to visit his family. Unknown to anyone at the time, Indra's parents planned for him to take his comatose brother's place in an arranged marriage. The X-Men and students visit a local market where strange storms have been placing people, including Indra's brother, in comatose states. During one such storm, the mutants come across a young girl who tells them her name is Luisa and that she's a new mutant with the ability to paint with light. They don't have time to question her before Sentinels arrive to capture her.X-Men: Legacy #238 Anole and Loa manage to finish the Sentinels off, and the X-Men take Luisa back to Indra's family home, where the unruly girl, while flirting with Indra, infuriates his father by creating a light painting of her and Indra in a nude embrace and kissing Indra in his room.X-Men: Legacy #239 After being questioned by Magneto, Luisa reveals her name is really Luz, she's not a mutant and she is from somewhere called Quitado; a high-tech floating city where she was a student meant to be a part of a device called Angelfire. At that moment, The Children of the Vault attack Indra's family home. Indra is attacked by a member of the Children of the Vault who enters his body and causes him severe physical pain. After Luz gives herself up, the Children of the Vault take Rogue and Magneto back to Quitado. Indra plans on going after them but his father demands he stay and marry instead.

Indra possesses retractable sectional armored plates that he uses to cover himself in protective armor. His skin is purple and his hair is red-violet; he has a red-violet tilak-like marking on his forehead, though this marking may be cosmetic and not part of his mutation. Initially, his armor was scaled and plated, similar to a pangolin exoskeleton. Though he religiously believes in absolute non-violence, he is later forced to act in self-defense and attack a corrupt military officer, resulting in an internal struggle that causes him to lose access to his powers. When trying to access his armor plating, he experiences great pain and believes this to be a punishment from the Yakshas for his transgression. After receiving mentoring from Rogue, who believes that Paras chose to name himself after the Hindu god of war for reason, Indra's powers return significantly changed and stronger than before.

Cards are played out to form a layout of sequences going up and down in suit from the agreed starting card (e.g. a Seven or an Unter). The game is won by the player who is first to empty their hand. The game is a cross between dominoes and patience and is suitable for children who have learnt the various card values.  Cards  Domino variants are played with 32- or 52-card packs and French- or German-suited cards. Rules  All cards are dealt to the players, even if as a result some players have one card more than others. The first player begins by leading a card of the agreed rank, say, a Jack or Unter to the table. The next player must then play a Ten or a Queen/Ober of the same suit. Subsequently, players must either add a card of the same suit and one higher or one lower than the sequence of cards on the table. Players may also play another Jack or Unter to start a new suit sequence. A player who cannot place a card passes. The player who is first to shed their cards wins; play usually continues to determine who is second, third, etc. Scoring, if desired, can be done by simply counting the remaining cards in players' hands. Other methods of scoring such as counting the remaining pips (Jacks, Queens and Kings each contributing 10, Aces contributing 15) may lead to greater attention to high-scoring cards. Alternatively points may be awarded or deducted depending on the order in which players 'go out'. The game is well suited for parties of mixed ages; with small children it can be played until all players have finished. Variations = Sevens = In Sevens, the player with the Seven of Hearts leads off. Play continues as above except that new sequences are started with the remaining three Sevens. It often makes sense for players to avoid playing cards close to Seven in order to force others to play cards in other suits in which the blocking player may hold high or low cards. In some variants of the game all players receive the same number of cards and the remainder (if any) is turned face up and can be played by anyone as needed. In some variants, after a seven has been played other cards of the same suit may not be added before the eight is also played. In some variants players are allowed to pass even when they are able to play a card. =Fan Tan= In some editions of Hoyle, the game is called by its common American name, Fan Tan, or Play or Pay. It differs from the Sevens rules given above as follows: the player left of the dealer begins by playing any seven or passing. The game is played with a pool, and penalties are paid for passing, for passing when able to play, and for passing when holding a seven.. Republished 1994 by Wordsworth Editions. The same name is used for the following variant that starts with the aces. When the deal has been decided, the cards are dealt singly, and any that are left over form a stock, which is placed face downwards on the table. Each player contributes a fixed stake or ante. The first player can enter if they have an ace; if they have not, they pay an ante and take a card from the stock; the second player is then called upon and acts similarly until an ace is played. This (and the other aces when played) is put face upwards on the table, and the piles are built up from the ace to the king. The pool goes to the first player to empty their hand. If a player fails to play, having a playable card, they are fined the amount of the ante for every card in the other players' hands. = Showdown = In the variation known as Eights, the Eight of a suit must be played first, followed by the 9 and the 7. Only then can the remainder of the cards be played, increasing from the 9 and decreasing from the 7. In addition, when a player is unable to play, they must take a chip or marker indicating that they were the last player unable to play. Scoring is based on the cards remaining in each player's hands when the first player has played out: face value for numbered cards, 10 for face cards, 15 for aces (which are low), and 25 points to the player holding the marker. If two or more players have the same number of points that round then they \\"showdown\\". Those players will receive a zero for that round and all other players will receive points as normal. = Compendium games = Compendium games such as Rosbiratschka, Kein Stich or Herzeln often have a contract called by various names which is in practice a Domino-type game involving laying cards off onto a starter and aiming to be the first to shed all one's cards.Herzeln at www.spieletest.at. Retrieved 4 Nov 2018  National or regional variants  = Argentina = In Argentina, the game is called Yuto. = Austria = In Austria, a similar game known as Unteransetzen is played using a pack of 32 German-suited cards in which an Unter, usually the Unter of Hearts, is led to the table. Players build on the first Unter, play another or pass. In another variant, Zehnerlegen, the Tens take the place of Unters. The game has numerous other local names. = Finland = In the [Finnish] variant known as Ristiseiska (\\"the seven of clubs\\"), the first card to be played must be the seven of clubs. If a player is unable to play a card, the previous player must choose and hand them a card (usually a worthless or low value card). Both the eight and six of each respective suit must be played before any other cards may be played further on that suit. The game is over when someone runs out of cards. = France = The French also play a card game called Domino, which is essentially the same as Sevens except that the player to the dealer's left leads, and may lead a card of any rank. Subsequent players may then build on that suit or start a new suit with a card of the same rank as that originally led. = Germany =  Karten-Domino  The equivalent of Sevens is usually known as Karten-Domino (\\"Card Domino\\"), may be played with a 32- or 52-card pack and any Eight or Jack (Unters) may be used to start off.Karten-Domino at www.kartenspiele.net. Retrieved 4 Nov 2018Kartendomino at www.casinospiegel.net. Retrieved 4 Nov 2018 A variant called Zehnerlegen, in which the Tens are used as start cards, is played in Bavaria using a Bavarian pattern pack.Sch√ºler und ihre Gro√üeltern beim Aktionstag an der Grundschule zum Thema \\"Mehr Zeit zum Leben\\" Kinder entdecken alte Spiele neu at onetz.de. Retrieved 13 Feb 2020.  Bubenlegen or Buurn- leggen  A simple domino game known as Buurn-leggen (= Bubenlegen or \\"Jack Laying\\") involves playing a Jack on the table, behind and in front of which the suit sequence is built. If a player has no card with which to build, but has another Jack, may start a new sequence. The first player to shed all their cards is the winner.\\"Buurn-leggen\\" in W√∂rterbuch der westm√ºnsterl√§ndischen Mundart at neon.niederlandistik.fu-berlin.de. Retrieved 10 Jul 2019  Elfer Raus!  Another similar game called Elfer Raus! (\\"elevens out!\\") is played with custom cards depicting the numbers from 1 to 20 in four (in some editions three) colours. It is marketed in Germany by Ravensburger. In this game three fourths of the cards remain in the stock, players can play as many cards as they want in one move, and players who cannot play at least one card must draw up to three cards. The score of a card is its face value. The rulebook distributed with the game describes two variants (one permitting each colour to be started with 10 or 12 instead of 11, and one that is similar to the French card game Domino) as well as how to play various children's games with the set.  Siebener raus  The following variant is described under the name Siebener raus (\\"sevens out\\") in a German book. The game starts with the seven of clubs. For any seven that has been played, no other cards of that suit may be played before the six and then the eight. When the six, seven and eight of a suit have been played other cards of the same suit may be played at any time to form stacks on the six (descending to the ace) and eight (ascending to the king). At the end of the game, each player pays the total value of their remaining cards, and the last player who had to pass pays an additional penalty. =India = In Bharat, the game is called Satti Centre (Hindi for seven as centre, also known as 'Badaam Saat'). It starts with the seven of hearts and the subsequent players may use an adjacent card, a seven of any suit, or pass. A player can pass only if no playable card is available, else a penalty is dealt (if discovered). More than one deck of cards can be used. The first card must always be the seven of hearts, but the first move in such cases is decided by the dealer's position (eg. the closest in the direction of dealing), particular deck (if designs are distinguishable) or simply by calling it first. The game ends when a player has no cards left. Points, are scored by adding the value of the cards left in hands of the remaining players for a number of games. (1 point for an ace, 2 for a two, 11 for a jack, 13 for a king and so on. In some variations, the ace and/or the face cards are worth 10 points.) The player(s) with the most points at the end of the set loses. In a variation, the winner gets the sum of all the values of cards left in hands of the remaining players, and the player with the most points wins at the end of a set. = Japan = In the variation known as Shichi Narabe (in Japanese: 7‰∏¶„Åπ), the players remove all sevens from their hands to start the layout before the first card is played. Up to three times per game a player may choose to pass. In some variations, when a player has run out of passes (at their fourth pass) they place all their remaining cards in their places on the playing space and become a Y≈´rei (ghost). Players who have become Y≈´rei are effectively out and no longer active in the game, however if they can trick a player still in the game to speak to them or respond to something they say, the Y≈´rei switches places with that player, taking their hand of cards and becoming \\"back in\\" the game while the other player becomes the new Y≈´rei. The goal of the \\"alive\\" players is to ignore the Y≈´rei and pretend they cannot see or hear them at all costs, hence why they are called \\"ghosts.\\" = Spain = The Spanish variant known as Cinquillo is played with the Spanish deck of 40 cards. In this game the sequences start with the four fives, and the five of oros must be played first. = Sweden = In the Swedish variant known as Sjuan (\\"Seven\\"), the first card to be played must be the seven of hearts. If a player is unable to play a card, a the previous player hands them a card, usually the most useless card they have, and the turn passes on to the next player. The highest card in sjuan is king while the lowest is ace. If someone can play out all their cards, they may do so. = Russia = The variant played in Russia is called Deviatka (Russian for nine). The game is played with either 52 or 36 (aces to sixes in each suit) cards, it always starts with the nine of diamonds. References  Literature  * G√∂√∂ck, Roland (1967).

It ceased publication on September 19, 1982. History The Courier-Express was created in 1926 by a merger of the Buffalo Daily Courier and the Buffalo Morning Express. William James Conners, the owner of the Buffalo Courier, brought the two papers together. The combined newspapers claimed a heritage dating to 1828. One notable part-owner and editor of the Buffalo Express was Samuel Langhorne Clemens, also known as Mark Twain, whose tenure at the newspaper lasted from 1869 to 1871. In August 1979, The Courier-Express was purchased by the Cowles Media Company, a publishing company based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. After a change in corporate leadership, Cowles Media decided to close the paper in September 1982. After the local Newspaper Guild members voted to oppose a deal to sell the Courier Express to Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, the September 19, 1982 issue was the last issue published. That left Buffalo with only one daily newspaper, the Buffalo Evening News, now known as The Buffalo News. Cowles Media donated the library to the Buffalo History Museum and Buffalo State College. The library is now housed in the E. H. Butler Library at Buffalo State College. The library consists of approximately one million news clippings, 100,000 photographs and several pieces of artworks and framed photographs. The news clippings and photographs, arranged by subject and person, cover the late 1950s to September 19, 1982. The collection served as the library for the reporters of the paper. The librarians weeded both the clippings and photographic files, discarding older files on a routine basis. As a result, many subject areas are not covered. The library is currently being digitized.

In addition parts of the woodland are clear-felled, and in these areas a number of plant species associated with heathlands and acidic soils are present. It is notable as a site for scarce birds, and as a result is popular with birdwatchers. It is one of the main breeding sites in northern Somerset for nightjars.

Life Born Kathleen Annie Josephine Madden at 14, Bridge Street, Cork, Ireland, the only daughter of banker Paul J. Madden (who was Mayor of Cork in 1885‚Äì1886, and a friend of Charles Stuart Parnell) and Eliza Madden (born Dwyer). She was educated privately at her family home, Wood's Gift, Blackrock Road. By the end of the 19th century she was contributing short stories to various British and American publications, such as Pall Mall Magazine, Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, Harper's Magazine, Windsor Magazine and others. On 16 February 1901, five weeks after her father's death, she married the writer Ernest Temple Thurston (1879-1933). They separated in 1907 and were divorced in 1910 on grounds of his adultery and desertion. The suit went undefended. Thurston \\"complained that she was making more money by her books than he was, that her personality dominated his, and had said that he wanted to leave her.\\" Katherine Thurston's novels achieved success in Britain and the United States. Her best-known work was a political thriller entitled John Chilcote, M.P. (as The Masquerader in the United States), published in 1904 and on the New York Times bestseller list for two years, ranking as third best-selling book for 1904 and seventh best in 1905. Her next book, The Gambler, came out in 1905 and it too made the US best-selling lists for that year. This was the first time the New York Times had recorded any author, female or male, as having two top-ten books in a single year. In 1910, she was back on the same list at No. 4 with her novel Max, the story of a young Russian princess, who flees disguised as a boy to the Montmartre Quarter of Paris, on the night before her arranged marriage. John Chilcote, M.P. was adapted for the stage by John Hunter Booth and opened on Broadway in 1917. It was filmed four times, the first silent film by American Path√© in 1912 under the title The Compact and starring Crane Wilbur; the second a 1920 Russian/French co-production entitled Chlen parlamenta. Two more films were made using the American book title The Masquerader, in 1922 and then by the Samuel Goldwyn Company in 1933 as a \\"talkie\\" starring Ronald Colman. An epileptic, Thurston's blossoming career was cut short at the age of 37 when she was found dead in her hotel room in Cork. The official enquiry on 6 September 1911 gave the cause of death as asphyxia as result of a seizure. She had been due to remarry later that month. to Dr A. T. Bulkeley Gavin. She was buried in St. Joseph's Cemetery, Cork. The story of her final years and her relations with Bulkeley Gavin are the subject of a published thesis by C. M. Copeland, written while studying at the Napier University, Edinburgh. Partial bibliography *The Circle (1903). *John Chilcote M.P.

She was named after Alberico da Barbiano, an Italian condottiero of the 14th century. Launch and Sea Trials Da Barbiano was launched on 23 August 1930. During her trials she managed to reach a speed of , but to do that the propulsion was pushed to , far beyond the safety limits. She could only maintain this speed for about 30 minutes. Service history During the late 1930s, Da Barbiano participated in the Spanish Civil War, escorting Italian ships that carried supplies for the Spanish Nationalist forces the Western Mediterranean. During World War II, Alberico Da Barbiano was part of the 4th Cruiser Division. On 9 July 1940 Da Barbiano was present at the Battle of Calabria (Punto Stilo). In summer 1940 she also participated in some escort and minelaying missions between Italy and North Africa. Due to the weakness of the class, on 1 September 1940 she was assigned as a training ship in Pola, but on 1 March 1941 was returned to active service. In December 1941 the Italian naval staff, in the face of a deteriorating supply situation between Italy and Libya, decided to use the 4th Cruiser Division, then composed of Da Barbiano (flagship of ammiraglio di divisione Antonino Toscano, the commander of the Division) and her sistership Alberto Di Giussano, for an urgent transport mission to North Africa.Aldo Cocchia, La difesa del traffico con l‚ÄôAfrica Settentrionale ‚Äì Tomo II: dal 1¬∞ ottobre 1941 al 30 settembre 1942, USMM (Historical Branch of the Italian Navy), Rome, 1962, pp. 157 to 173 Da Barbiano and Di Giussano left Taranto at 8:15 on 5 December 1941, reached Brindisi at 17:50 and there loaded about 50 tons of supplies, then proceeded to Palermo on 8 December, where they loaded an additional 22 tons of aviation fuel, which was especially needed in Libya (otherwise, aircraft based there would soon become unable to escort incoming convoys with vital supplies). The fuel, contained in unsealed barrels, was placed on the stern deck, thus posing great danger in case of enemy attacks (not only it would be set afire by mere strafing, but even by the flames of the ships‚Äô own guns, thus preventing the use of the stern turrets). The two cruisers sailed unescorted from Palermo at 17:20 on 9 December, heading for Tripoli, but at 22:56 they were spotted by a British reconnaissance plane north of Pantelleria. The plane, which had located Toscano's ships thanks to Ultra intercepts,Alberto Santoni, Il vero traditore: il ruolo documentato di Ultra nella guerra del Mediterraneo, Mursia, Milan, 1981, p. 130 to 136. started to shadow them. At 23:55 Toscano (who was at that time in the middle of the Sicilian Channel), since the surprise (required for the success of the mission) had vanished, heavy enemy radio traffic foreshadowed upcoming air strikes, and worsening sea conditions would delay his ships, further exposing them to British attacks, decided to turn back to base. Da Barbiano and Di Giussano reached Palermo at 8:20 on 10 December, after overcoming a British air attack off Marettimo. Toscano was heavily criticized by Supermarina for his decision to abort the mission. As for 13 December a new convoy operation, called M. 41, was planned, and the air cover by aircraft based in Libya would only be possible if they received new fuel, on 12 December it was decided that the 4th Division would attempt again the trip to Tripoli. The cruiser Bande Nere was to join Da Barbiano and Di Giussano to carry more supplies, but she was prevented from sailing by a breakdown, thus her cargo had to be transferred to the other two cruisers. Da Barbiano and Di Giussano were overall loaded with 100 tons of aviation fuel, 250 tons of gasoline, 600 tons of naphtha and 900 tons of food stores, as well as 135 ratings on passage to Tripoli. As the stern of Da Barbiano (and, to a lesser extent, Di Giussano) was packed with fuel barrels, so thickly that it was not possible anymore to bring the guns to bear, Toscano held a last assembly with his staff and officers from both ships, where it was decided that, in case of encounter with enemy ships, the barrels would be discarded overboard, and then the cruisers would open fire (otherwise, the fuel would have been set afire by the firing of the cruisers' own guns). Da Barbiano, Di Giussano and their only escort, the Spica-class torpedo boat Cigno (a secondo torpedo boat, Climene, was left in the port due to a breakdown), sailed from Palermo at 18:10 on 12 December. The 4th Division was ordered to pass northwest of the Aegadian Islands and then head for Cape Bon and follow the Tunisian coast; the ships would keep a speed of 22-23 knots (not more, because they were to spare part of their own fuel and deliver it at Tripoli). Air cover, air reconnaissance and defensive MAS ambushes were planned to safeguard the mission. The British 4th Destroyer Flotilla, consisting of the destroyers , , and the Dutch destroyer Hr. Ms. Isaac Sweers, (Commander G. H. Stokes), had departed Gibraltar on 11 December, to join the Mediterranean Fleet at Alexandria. By 8 December, the British had de-coded Italian C-38 wireless signals about the Italian supply operation and its course for Tripoli. The RAF sent a Wellington bomber on a reconnaissance sortie to sight the ships as a deception and on 12 December, the 4th Destroyer Flotilla, heading east from Gibraltar towards the Italian ships, was ordered to increase speed to and intercept. In the afternoon of 12 December, a CANT Z. 1007 bis of Regia Aeronautica spotted the four destroyers heading east at an estimated speed of 20 knots, 60 miles off Algiers; Supermarina was immediately informed but calculated that, even in the case the destroyers would increase their speed to 28 knots, they would have reached Cape Bon around 3:00 AM on 13 December, about one hour after the 4th Division, so Toscano (who learned of the sighting while he was still in harbour) was not ordered to increase speed or alter course to avoid them. Following new Ultra decodes, a new reconnaissance plane was sent and spotted Toscano's ships at sunset on 12 December, after which the 4th Destroyer Flotilla was directed to intercept the two cruisers, increasing speed to 30 knots. This speed, along with a one-hour delay that the 4th Division had accrued (and that Toscano omitted to report to Supermarina), frustrated all previous Supermarina calculations about the advantage that the 4th Division would have. At 22:23 Toscano was informed that he would possibly meet \\"enemy steamers coming from Malta\\", and at 23:15 he ordered action stations. The 4th Destroyer Flotilla sighted the Italian cruisers near Cap Bon, at 02:30 on 13 December. At 2:45 on 13 December, seven miles off Cape Bon, the Italian ships heard the noise of a British plane (a radar-equipped Vickers Wellington, which located the ships and informed Stokes about their position), and at 3:15 they altered course to 157¬∞ to pass about one mile off Cape Bon. Five minutes later, Toscano suddenly ordered full speed ahead and to alter course to 337¬∞, effectively reversing course; this sudden change disrupted the Italian formation, as neither Cigno (which was about two miles ahead of the cruisers) neither Di Giussano (which was following Da Barbiano in line) received the order, and while Di Giussano saw the flagship reverse course and imitated her (but remained misaligned), Cigno did not noticed the change till 3:25, when she also reversed course, but remained much behind the two cruisers. The reasons for Toscano's decision of reverse course have never been fully explained: it has been suggested that, upon realizing that he had been spotted by aircraft, he decided to turn back like on 9 December (but in this case, a course towards the Aegadian islands would have made more sense, instead that the northwesterly course ordered by Toscano; and the change was suddenly ordered more than 30 minutes after the cruisers had been spotted); that he wanted to mislead the reconnaissance plane about his real course, wait for it to go away, and then go back on the previous course to Tripoli; that he thought from the noise that torpedo bombers were coming, and he wanted to get in more open waters (farther away from the shore and the Italian minefields) to obtain more freedom of manoeuvre; or that he had spotted the Allied destroyers astern and, not wanting to present his stern to them (as the aft turrets were unusable and most fuel was stowed there), he decided to reverse course to fire on them with his bow turrets (upon ordering the change of course, he also ordered the gunners to keep ready). Stokes's destroyers were, indeed, just off Cape Bon by then, and they had spotted the Italian ships. Arriving from astern, under the cover of darkness and using radar, the British ships sailed close inshore and surprised the Italians who were further out to sea, by launching torpedoes from short range. The course reversal accelerated the approach between the two groups, and the Allied destroyers attacked together; Sikh fired her guns and four torpedoes against Da Barbiano (the distance was less than 1,000 meters) and Legion did the same, while Maori and Isaac Sweers attacked Di Giussano. Toscano ordered full speed and to open fire (and also, to Di Giussano, to increase speed to 30 knots) and Da Barbiano also started a turn to port (on orders from the ship's commanding officer, Captain Giorgio Rodocanacchi), but at 3:22, before her guns were able to fire (only some machine guns managed to), the cruiser was hit by a torpedo below the forwardmost turret, which caused her to list to port. Da Barbiano was then raked with machine gun fire, which killed or wounded many men and set fire to the fuel barrels, and hit by a second torpedo in the engine room. At 3.26 Maori also fired two torpedoes at Da Barbiano, and opened fire with her guns, hitting the bridge. Moments after, the cruiser was hit by another torpedo in the stern (possibly launched by Legion); meanwhile, Di Giussano was disabled as well. Da Barbiano rapidly listed to port, while the fires quickly spread all over the ship and also into the sea, fueled by the floating fuel, and the crew started to abandon ship. At 3:35, Da Barbiano capsized and sank in a sea of flame. 534 men, including Admiral Antonino Toscano, the commander of Italian Fourth Naval Division, his entire staff and the commanding officer of Alberico Da Barbiano, Captain Giorgio Rodocanacchi, were lost with the ship. 250 survivors reached the Tunisian coast or were picked up by rescuing vessels. Da Barbiano's wreck was located in 2007 by an Italian expedition.https://www.focus.it/cultura/storia/il-ritrovamento-del-relitto- dell-incrociatore-italiano-da-barbiano Citations References  * External links * Regia Marina Italiana - Class: Condottieri tipo Di Giussano - specifications Category:Giussano-class cruisers Category:Ships built in Genoa Category:1930 ships Category:World War II cruisers of Italy Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Mediterranean Sea Category:Maritime incidents in December 1941 Category:Ships built by Gio.

It was directed by Curtis Bernhardt from a screenplay by Sydney Boehm and Lester Cole, based on a play by Alan R. Clark and Bradbury Foote.. Plot Steven Kenet catches his unfaithful wife Helen in the apartment of Willard I. Whitcombe, her boss, and she is strangled to death. He attempts to commit suicide by driving his car into the river, even though they have a six-year-old son. Kenet survives but is sent to the county psychiatric hospital for evaluation to determine if he is sane enough to be charged with murder. He has no memory of what happened, likely due to a pre-existing brain injury from the war. Dr. Ann Lorrison takes an interest in his case, and in him. Surgery could cure Kenet's brain injury, but he refuses to consent to it, preferring a life in an insane asylum to a probable murder conviction. However, when Lorrison informs him that because his mother has died, his son will be sent to an orphanage, Kenet changes his mind. (Lorrison herself has obtained temporary custody of the child.) Henry Cronner, janitor of the apartment building, attempts to blackmail Whitcombe. After being rebuffed, Cronner goes to see Kenet, hinting he can save him but withholding details until Kenet can pay. Whitcombe then sends Cronner plummeting to his death down the building's elevator shaft. Kenet undergoes \\"narcosynthesis\\"‚Äîa light dose of sodium pentathol‚Äîto help him remember what happened. He recalls blacking out just as his hands were around Helen's neck and later regaining consciousness to find her dead body. Kenet escapes from the hospital and, taking a reluctant Lorrison along, breaks into Whitcombe's apartment. He recreates the scene, in hopes of jogging his memory, then returns to the hospital before he is missed. Whitcombe visits him there and provokes Kenet by confessing to the two murders; as he had hoped, he is attacked by Kenet, making the latter look like a homicidal lunatic. In desperation, Kenet breaks out of the hospital again. He manages to get to Whitcombe and subdues him. Under sodium pentathol Lorrison administers, Whitcombe recounts how he had tried to part ways with Helen Kenet after finding her husband unconscious in his apartment, but she threatened to cause a scandal and ruin any chance of becoming a partner in his firm. Taken into custody, Whitcombe is told that anything he said under the truth serum can not be used against him. He vows to get a lawyer and be cleared. Kenet, meantime, is free to go.

Powerheads are often used for spear fishing and against sharks or alligators for sport, defense, or to kill nuisance animals. The term powerhead refers to the firearm-like part of the device; when attached to a shaft to form a spear, it may be referred to as a bang stick or shark stick. The spear in question may be handheld or launchable from a spear gun. Design A powerhead consists of a long length of tubing which is the chamber for the cartridge, a firing pin to fire the cartridge, and usually some form of safety pin or latch that prevents firing when it is engaged. The rear of the power head is fitted with some provision for attaching to a spear. Powerheads are available that chamber a variety of handgun, rifle, and shotgun cartridges, from .22 WMR to 12 gauge and larger. .357 Magnum is probably the most common, as it is fairly powerful yet still compact enough to be used in a spear gun. Large cartridges such as the 12 gauge are generally only used on a handheld spear. Some powerheads use the cartridge to propel a barbed spear point into the target. These are generally used on a bangstick for alligator hunting, to secure a line to the alligator to prevent escape. =Purpose of contact-shooting= Bullets are generally designed to work in air, which has a very low density. The density of water is roughly 800 times higher than that of air at sea level, and that reduces the penetration of a bullet proportionally. A bullet might travel a mile (1.6 km) in air, but travel no more than a few feet (about a meter) in water. Expanding hunting or defensive ammunition, such as that using hollow point bullets, will penetrate even less, as the water is dense enough to cause the bullet to expand. By firing while in contact with the target, a powerhead does not waste energy on traveling through the water, but rather expends all its energy directly on the target. =How they work= Although most commercial powerheads use standard handgun ammunition, such as .357 Magnum or .44 Magnum, many users choose to use larger caliber ammunition to do maximum damage to the intended target. A common misconception of how powerheads function is that the muzzle blast does the damage, as much high-pressure gas is forced into the flesh of the target. While the gas does do minimal damage, it is ultimately the penetration of the slug that causes the damage to the target. Most powerheads function just as traditional firearms do, instead it is the spear which acts as the firing hammer. One commercially produced version used a modified .30-30 Winchester cartridge case, loaded backwards, with a primed .38 Special case loaded in its mouth holding the primer. The cartridge was loaded with the .30-30 case facing outwards, so that the .30-30 case full of burning powder was propelled into the target upon firing. This system is fast to reload and one of the most effective despite the fact that it does not use a bullet. =Ammunition issues= Since most powerheads are designed to use commercial ammunition, which is not designed to be used underwater, the ammunition used must be waterproofed. A coating of nail polish or varnish is commonly used around the primer and case mouth. For shotshells, a layer of rubber, such as a balloon, can be used to seal the crimped front of the shell. Legal issues =Australia= In Australia they are classed as category A firearms requiring a legitimate reason for issuance of a permit to acquire to a weapons licence holder. When not in use, they must be safely stored in a locked container with ammunition stored separately. Regulations vary between states, with some states permitting their use for defense against sharks only, and not for spearfishing. =United States= A powerhead may be considered a firearm under some circumstances. In the US, the ATF considers a powerhead a firearm if it is not permanently affixed to a shaft; generally powerheads are sold spot welded to a temporary steel shaft giving an overall length of greater than 18 inches (45 cm). After installing permanently on a spear shaft, the spot weld is cut, and the temporary shaft discarded. Revenue Ruling 55-569, C.B. 1955-2, 483 says: This ruling is with regard to the National Firearms Act, and not to the 1968 Gun Control Act. (The National Firearms Act defines 'firearm' as machine guns, short barreled rifles, short barreled shotguns, and concealable firearms that are neither pistols nor revolvers.) This means that powerheads may still be under the authority of the 1968 Gun Control Act with regard to shipping them and purchase of them from licensed dealers. Laws may also prohibit the use of powerheads in sport fishing. They are allowed in US federally controlled waters, but many states prohibit their use in state controlled waters. One can be easily in violation of state law despite being compliant with federal regulations.

Land Systems OMC  Land Systems OMC is South Africa's primary military vehicle manufacturing company. OMC is the initialism under which the Olifant Manufacturing Company was most commonly known during its existence. It was established for the task of creating the Olifant tank for the South African Army. Early into its life it was taken over by Reunert, which subsequently turned it into a division called Reumech OMC. It was under this name that OMC saw its most prolific level of vehicle development, as the SA Army's involvement in the Border War in Angola created a massive need for ever more advanced and capable vehicles. Following South Africa's readmittance to the international arena following democratic elections in 1994, a number of foreign defence industry companies expressed significant interest in purchasing the company. In 1999 Britain's Vickers purchased the company and renamed it Vickers OMC. This continued until Alvis plc, also of Britain, purchased Vickers' defence division, including OMC. Alvis renamed the company to Alvis OMC. The most recent chapter in the company's history was written in 2004, when BAE Systems purchased the military vehicle division of Alvis. OMC then became part of BAE Systems' Land Systems, again undergoing a name change to Land Systems OMC. In April 2015, it was announced the company has sold its 75% stake in LSSA, for a total of approximately 855 million Rand ($53 million), to the state-owned group Denel.

Cronin was one of two Australian umpires in the Underarm bowling incident of 1981. He umpired in one Test match in 1980 between Australia and England at Melbourne on 1 February to 6 February 1980, won by Australia by 8 wickets. Cronin's partner was Robin Bailhache. Cronin umpired six One Day International (ODI) matches between 1979 and 1981. Altogether, he umpired 18 first-class matches in his career between 1977 and 1988.  Underarm bowling incident of 1981  Cronin was officiating alongside fellow Australian umpire Don Weser during a match between Australia and New Zealand at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 1 February 1981 when Trevor Chappell bowled the final ball underarm, which caused great controversy. Cronin was standing at the striker's end when Weser was informed by the Australian captain Greg Chappell that his brother Trevor would bowl the final ball underarm, thus denying New Zealand the chance to hit a six and tie the game. This incident, illegal in England though legal at the time in Australia. The match branded as the Underarm incident was notable for several umpiring controversies. During the Australian innings, Martin Snedden claimed a low outfield catch off the batting of Greg Chappell when Chappell was on 58.Wisden Cricketers Almanack ‚Äì 119th edition (1982) In his live commentary former Australian cricket captain Richie Benaud exclaimed \\"that is one of the best catches I have ever seen in my life\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6agc6mYEkE Following a short discussion, Snedden's catch was ruled not out by the two Australian umpires, Weser and Cronin. It was some years before TV replays could be used in umpiring decisions. However the Channel Nine TV broadcast did show viewers a number of slow motion replays of Snedden's catch from various TV angles including a close up of Snedden diving to fairly claim the catch. After reviewing several TV replays Benaud re-affirmed what he had initially seen live, stating in his commentary: \\"there is no question in my mind that that was a great catch - clearly caught above the ground, a superb catch.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6agc6mYEkE Chappell went on to score 90 in his innings.

Description The coprolite was found in 1972 beneath the site of what was to become the York branch of Lloyds Bank and may be the largest example of fossilised human faeces ever found, measuring long and wide. Analysis of the stool has indicated that its producer subsisted largely on meat and bread whilst the presence of several hundred parasitic eggs suggests they were riddled with intestinal worms. In 1991, York Archaeological Trust employee and paleoscatologist, Dr Andrew Jones, made international news with his appraisal of the item for insurance purposes: \\"This is the most exciting piece of excrement I've ever seen... In its own way, it's as irreplaceable as the Crown Jewels\\". The layers that covered the coprolite were moist and peaty. They preserved not only the coprolite but also timber, textiles and leather. Display The specimen was put on display at the city's Archaeological Resource Centre (now known as DIG), the outreach and education institution run by the York Archaeological Trust. In 2003, it broke into three pieces after being dropped whilst on exhibition to a party of visitors. , efforts were underway to reconstruct it. It has been displayed at Jorvik Viking Centre since 2008.

The park consisted primarily of water-based attractions and originally opened to the public in 1978, under the ownership of Great American Recreation (GAR). Action Park featured three separate attraction areas: the Alpine Center, Motorworld, and Waterworld. The latter was one of the first modern American water parks. Many of its attractions were unique, attracting thrill- seekers from across the New York metropolitan area. Action Park's popularity went hand-in-hand with a reputation for poorly designed rides, under-trained and under-aged staff, intoxicated guests and staff, and a consequently poor safety record. At least six people are known to have died as a result of mishaps on rides at the park, and it was given nicknames such as \\"Traction Park\\", \\"Accident Park\\", and \\"Class Action Park\\". Little effort was made by state regulators to address these issues, despite the park's history of repeat violations. In its later years, personal injury lawsuits led to the closure of increasing numbers of rides and eventually the entire park closed in 1996. On February 9, 1998, resort developer Intrawest announced the purchase of the majority of the Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area, including Action Park and other developable real estate lands that GAR owned.http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Intrawest+Adds+Ninth+Resort+to+Network-a020216861 The park received a massive overhaul, which included extensively renovating and repairing attractions, especially those deemed either outright unsafe or inappropriate relative to Intrawest's vision of the park, with some being removed entirely. Afterwards, the park reopened as Mountain Creek Waterpark. History The idea for the park began in 1976 when Eugene Mulvihill and his company Great American Recreation (GAR), the owners of the recently combined Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area, wanted to find a way to generate revenue during the summer. That year they followed the trend of many other ski areas and opened a alpine slide down one of the steep ski trails. For the summer of 1978, Mulvihill added two water slides and a go-kart track, and named the collection of rides the \\"Vernon Valley Summer Park\\".https://archive.org/stream/towntopicsprince3328unse/towntopicsprince3328unse_djvu.txt The following year, more water slides and a small deep-water swimming pool, as well as tennis courts and a softball field, were added to what became known as the Waterworld section of \\"Action Park\\". By 1980, Motorworld had been carved out of swampy lands the ski area owned across Route 94. Combined, these areas formed one of North America's earliest modern water parks. Ultimately, the small park consisting of the alpine slide and two water slides evolved to a major destination with 75 rides (35 motorized, self-controlled rides and 40 water slides). Action Park's most successful years were the early- and mid-1980s. Most rides were still operating, and the park's dangerous reputation had not yet developed. In 1982, two guests died at the park within a week of each other, leading to the permanent closure of one ride. Despite this, people continued to come in massive numbers. The park's fortunes began to turn with two deaths in the summer of 1984, and the legal and financial problems that stemmed from the ensuing lawsuits. A state investigation of misconduct in the leasing of state land to Action Park led to a 110-count grand jury indictment against the nine related companies that ran the park and their executives for operating an unauthorized insurance company.McKay, Martha; May 12, 2005; Ultimate wine snob ; New Jersey Herald, retrieved August 27, 2006. Many took pretrial intervention to avoid prosecution; CEO Eugene Mulvihill pleaded guilty that November to five insurance fraud-related charges.New Jersey State Commission of Investigation, date not given, Concrete Results: Ensuring Justice, Saving Taxpayers' Money, 47, retrieved August 27, 2006. Still, attendance remained high and the park remained profitable, at least on paper. The park entertained over one million visitors per year during the 1980s, with as many as 12,000 coming on some of the busiest weekends. Park officials said this made the injury and death rate statistically insignificant. Nevertheless, the director of the emergency room at a nearby hospital said they treated from five to ten victims of park accidents on some of the busiest days, and the park eventually bought the township of Vernon extra ambulances to keep up with the volume. In September 1989, GAR negotiated a deal with International Broadcasting Corporation that would result in the sale of Vernon Valley/Great Gorge, and Action Park, for $50 million. IBC, however, backed out of the deal, feeling the site was not suitable for their needs upon further inspections of the properties. By the 1990s, the Action Park was being advertised as the world's largest water park.Action Park commercial from 1994 (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoqAmcgovZwMTV's Headbanger's Ball with Alice in Chains at Action Park, Vernon, NJ, July 1993 (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpdCGfaxl7w Additionally, the park launched a website on which visitors could find information about rides, directions to the park, and lodging, and even enter a lottery for a chance to win park tickets.\\\\- Internet Archive copy of actionpark.com from December 27, 1996\\\\- Internet Archive copy of actionpark.com from April 12, 1997 In September 1991, Great American Recreation attempted to petition the Vernon Township Committee to put a referendum on the November ballot that, if passed, would have legalized the operation of games of skill and chance at Action Park. On September 23, the petition was rejected by the committee because only 643 of the 937 signatures on the petition came from registered voters. A few rides were closed and dismantled due to costly settlements and rising insurance premiums in the 1990s, and the park's attendance began to suffer as a recession early in that decade reduced the number of visitors. In early 1995, GAR operated Vernon Valley/Great Gorge and Action Park with no liability insurance. New Jersey did not require it, and GAR found it more economical to go to court than purchase liability insurance, since they relied on their own self-insurance. However, they ultimately purchased liability insurance from Evanston Insurance Company in May of that year to cover Action Park and the skiing facilities. As 1995 progressed, GAR's financial woes continued to accumulate. First Fidelity Bank, who lent $19 million to GAR and some 15 other connected corporations, filed suit against them in an effort to begin the process of foreclosing on the debt owed to them. Law firms owed money for services rendered between 1991 and 1993 also began filing suit. As November approached, GAR negotiated a deal with Noramco Capital Corp. and the Praedium Fund of CS First Boston, in which they would purchase the debt owed to First Fidelity, temporarily fending off an impending foreclosure. In February 1996, the creditors who had taken on GAR's debt petitioned to force GAR into bankruptcy over the $14 million owed by the struggling company. GAR filed for Chapter 11 protection that following March, but remained optimistic that they could regain their financial footing \\"within a year.\\" Action Park closed at the end of the season as usual on Labor Day, September 2, 1996. As the 1997 summer season approached, GAR remained optimistic that Action Park would open as expected on June 14, in spite of massive layoffs that occurred at the end of the prior ski season. The opening date was pushed back to June 28, then mid July. On June 25, 1997, GAR announced the cessation of all its operations, including Action Park. Following the demise of GAR in 1997, Praedium Recovery Fund purchased the Vernon Valley/Great Gorge resort, including Action Park, for $10 million. The investment group put Angel Projects in charge of managing the resort, and aimed to spend $20 million to upgrade the ski resort's equipment and trails and to remodel the water park. Canadian resort developer Intrawest, however, purchased the park and surrounding ski area in February 1998. The company revamped the Waterworld section of Action Park and reopened it for the 1998 season as Mountain Creek Waterpark, while the Motorworld and Alpine Center sections were demolished.  Alpine Center  =Action Park Gladiator Challenge= The Gladiator Challenge attraction, loosely based on the television series American Gladiators, opened in 1992. It allowed guests to compete against other guests in an obstacle course, and against park- employed \\"Gladiators\\" in jousting matches. Former bodybuilders Michael and Vince Mancuso designed the attraction, and the employees that guests would compete against in the jousting matches were found by scouting local gyms. Over the course of a day, there were three shows, with the guests that ran the fastest obstacle course times in the earlier shows brought back to compete against each other later in the day. By 1995 the attraction was removed and replaced with a beach volleyball court. =Alpine slide= Chairlift to alpine slide. Action Park's alpine slide descended the mountain beneath one of the ski area's chairlifts, which provided guests access to the top of the slide. Riders sat on small sleds that had only a brake/accelerator control stick, and rode down the slide in long chutes built into the slope. The ride, and more specifically the sleds, became notorious for causing injuries. The stick that was supposed to control the sled's speed in practice offered just two options on the infrequently maintained vehicles: extremely slow, and a speed described by one former employee as \\"death awaits\\". The chutes the sleds traveled in were made of concrete, fiberglass, and asbestos, which led to serious abrasions on riders who took even mild falls. The tendency of guests to ride in bathing suits made the problem worse. The path underneath the chairlift resulted in verbal harassment and spitting from passengers going up for their turn.Gethard, Chris; October 2005, \\"Brothers in Wounded Arms (And Legs) Serving Together at Action Park,\\" Weird NJ, 23. The slide led to the first fatality at the park, a head injury suffered in 1980 by an employee (according to an interview with family members in the 2020 HBO Max documentary \\"Class Action Park\\" the park owners falsely reported to the press he was an employee as regulations at the time did not require the reporting of fatalities of employees) whose sled ran off the track; he then fell down an embankment and hit his head on a rock, killing him (according to the same documentary the sled was unserviceable and he died after being in a coma for several days). Hay bales at the curves were put in place in an attempt to cushion the impact of guests whose sleds jumped the track, a frequent occurrence. While park officials regularly asserted its safety, in the early years of the park the slide was responsible for the bulk of the accidents, injuries, lawsuits, and state citations for safety violations. According to state records, in 1984 and 1985 the alpine slide produced 14 fractures and 26 head injuries. When Intrawest reopened the water park as Mountain Creek in spring 1998, they announced the slide would remain open for one final season. However, riders were required to wear helmets and kneepads. The last day of the slide's operation was September 6 of that year, the day before the park closed for the season, as that year's Labor Day was rainy and the slide had to be closed. The chutes were torn out afterwards, but the route can still be seen from the gondola that replaced the chairlift. The resort's mountain bike route travels down the site, and crosses over a few wooden footbridges that provided access over the alpine slide. Mountain Creek recently introduced an alpine coaster, which combines elements of an alpine slide and a roller coaster. =Snapple Snap-Up Whipper Snapper Ride= In 1991, Action Park opened up a , two-station bungee jumping tower near the alpine slide. The next summer, the tower was upgraded to four jumping stations. Guests could not drop very far, however, and were tethered to a weight that prevented them from bouncing back up to the top of the tower. The attraction closed with the park in 1996. =Skateboard park= A skatepark briefly existed near the ski area's ski school building, but closed after one season due to poor design. Bowls were separated by pavement, which in many cases did not meet the edges smoothly. Former park employee Tom Fergus was quoted in the magazine Weird NJ as saying that the \\"skate park was responsible for so many injuries we covered it up with dirt and pretended it never existed\\".Fergus, Tom; May 2006; \\"Another Action Park Employee Spills His Guts\\", in \\"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\\"; Weird NJ, 29 =Transmobile= The Transmobile was a monorail that took riders from the Alpine Center across Route 94 to the Cobblestone Village shopping complex and the park's Motorworld section. Riders would sit sideways in cars built for two people. Each stop had two stations, one for guests heading towards the Alpine Center, and one for guests heading to Motorworld. Rides were one way, and riders were not allowed to stay on the ride and travel round-trip without getting off at either end. This restriction sometimes caused conflicts between park staff and riders who either did not understand or did not want to follow the rules.http://thecenteroftheaction.blogspot.com/2010/05/showdown-at- transmobile.html Much of the Transmobile was dismantled when Intrawest took over the park in 1998. However, the Cobblestone Village station remains in place, as does the right of way through the Village's mini golf course.http://abnf.co/NJ-action_park.htm  Motorworld  Action Park's Motorworld section consisted of rides based around powered vehicles and boats on the west side of Route 94, opposite the main part of the park. This area closed with Action Park in 1996 and never reopened; they have since been replaced with a condominium development, a restaurant, and additional parking for the Mountain Creek ski resort. = Land rides = * Super Go Karts: The Super Go Karts allowed guests to drive around a small loop track at a speed of about , controlled by the governor devices on the karts. However, park employees knew how to circumvent the governors by wedging tennis balls into them, and they were known to do so for guests. As a result, an otherwise standard small-engine kart ride became an opportunity to play bumper cars at , and many injuries resulted from head-on collisions. Also, the karts' engines were poorly maintained and some riders were overcome by gasoline fumes as they drove. * Lola Cars: The Lola Cars were miniature open-cockpit race cars on a longer track. Extra money was charged to drive them, and they, too, could be adjusted for speed by park employees, with similarly harmful consequences to riders. Former employees have said that, after park management briefly set up a microbrewery nearby, employees would break into the brewery, steal the beer, and then take the cars out and ride them on Route 94. * Battle Action Tanks: Battle Action Tanks was one of the most popular rides in Motorworld, and it was featured prominently in television ads. For an additional fee, guests could enter a chainlink fence-enclosed area and operate small tanks for five minutes at a time. The tanks were equipped with tennis ball cannons that enabled riders to shoot at a sensor prominently mounted on each tank. If hit, the tank stopped operating for 15 seconds, while other guests often took advantage of the delay to hit the disabled vehicle with more fire. Visitors on the outside could also utilize less-costly cannons mounted on the perimeter fence. When workers had to enter the cage to attend to a stuck or crashed tank, which often happened several times a day, they were commonly pelted with tennis balls, despite prohibitions against such behavior. This gave the ride a reputation for being more dangerous for the employees than the guests, making it one of the least popular places to work in the park. It is not known if there were any serious injuries from the tank ride. As of 2018, the area has not been redeveloped and only a vacant lot remains. = Watercraft rides = * Super Speedboats: The Super Speedboats were set up in a small pond, known by park staff to be heavily infested with snakes. They could be driven around a small island at . While, unlike the land vehicles, there was no way to tamper and increase their speed, many riders nonetheless used them to play bumper boats, and one seriously inebriated rider had to be rescued by the attendant lifeguard after his boat capsized following a collision. * Bumper Boats: Bumper Boats was a supposedly safer ride than the Super Speedboats, but the engines often leaked gasoline, at least once requiring medical attention for one rider who got too much of it on his skin. Tall riders also often were unable to fit their legs on the small-sized boats, resulting in them hanging off of the sides of the boats and being fractured during collisions. = Air rides = * Space Shot: The Space Shot attraction was a tower drop ride, common in many amusement parks. This ride was opened for the park's final season in 1996, and again under Mountain Creek management in 1998. In July 1998 the ride was purchased by the Six Flags-owned La Ronde theme park in Montreal, Quebec. * Sling Shot: Sling Shot was a bungee cord ride in which two riders sat in a seat and were strapped in while the ride was shot up in the air and supported by a bungee cord. Riders looped upside down. There are a few similar rides still standing in a handful of major amusement parks, the most common name being the Slingshot found at many Six Flags parks, but they are upcharge attractions (an additional charge to admission) due to insurance issues. At Action Park, the extra fee was only $5. This particular ride was open from 1993 to 1995. \\"We often wondered how many whiplash cases came out of that ride\\", one former employee recalled.  Waterworld  Water-based attractions made up half of the park's rides and accounted for the greatest share of its casualty count. Mountain Creek Waterpark and its currently revived Action Park still operates some of these attractions. In addition, there was also a miniature golf course as well as standard pools and rides for children. These were sometimes smaller, safer versions of the park's main attractions. = Cannonball Loop = Cannonball Loop, the infamous looping water slide, was only opened for brief periods in Action Park's existence. In the mid-1980s GAR built an enclosed water slide, not unusual for that time; in fact, the park already had several such slides. On this one, however, they decided to build a complete vertical loop at the end, similar to that of a roller coaster.See picture on this discussion thread The resulting slide, called the \\"Cannonball Loop\\", was so intimidating, that employees have reported they were offered $100 () to test it. Fergus, who described himself as \\"one of the idiots\\" who took the offer, said, \\"$100 did not buy enough booze to drown out that memory.\\" The slide was opened for only one month in summer 1985 before it was closed at the order of the state's Advisory Board on Carnival Amusement Ride Safety, a highly unusual move at the time. One worker told a local newspaper that \\"there were too many bloody noses and back injuries\\" from riders, and it was widely rumored, and reported in Weird NJ, that some of the test dummies sent down before it opened had been dismembered and decapitated. A rider also reportedly got stuck at the top of the loop due to insufficient water pressure, and a hatch had to be installed at the bottom of the slope to allow for future extractions. The ride supposedly reopened a few more times over the years. In the summers of 1995 and 1996, it was opened for several days before further injuries forced its permanent shutdown. Those who rode the Cannonball Loop have said that more safety measures were taken than was otherwise common at the park. Riders were weighed, hosed down with cold water, instructed to remove jewelry, and then carefully instructed in how they had to position their bodies to complete the ride.Braybrook, Steve; May 2006; \\"A Survivor from Action Park Writes In\\", in \\"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\\"; Weird NJ, 29. For the remainder of the park's existence, Cannonball Loop remained visible near the entrance of Waterworld. It was dismantled shortly after the park closed. In 2014, video footage that appeared to show riders going down the Cannonball Loop was unearthed and published online. In 2015, Action Park planned to debut another water slide, the \\"Sky Caliber\\" developed by Sky Turtle Technologies, which would encase riders inside a bullet-like capsule for a vertical drop and a loop, at and 6 Gs. = Other notable water attractions = Less buoyant chlorinated water made the wave pool harder to swim in than salt water in the ocean. * The Tidal Wave Pool: The first patron death occurred here in 1982; another visitor drowned in this common water-park attraction five years later. It was, however, the number of people the lifeguards saved from a similar fate that made this the only Waterworld attraction to gain its own nickname, \\"The Grave Pool\\". It was wide by long and could hold 500 to 1,000 people. Waves were generated for 20 minutes at a time with 10-minute intervals between them, and could reach as much as in height. It was not always obvious that pool depth increased as one got closer to the far end, and there were patrons who only remembered or realized that they could not swim when they were in over their heads and the waves were going full blast. Even those who could swim sometimes exhausted themselves, causing patrons to crowd the side ladders as the waves began, leading to many accidents. Twelve lifeguards were on duty at all times, and on high-traffic weekends they were known to rescue as many as 30 people, compared to the one or two the average lifeguard might make in a typical season at a pool or lake. Mountain Creek continues to operate this attraction as the \\"High Tide Wavepool\\" but made the pool much shallower. * Aqua Skoot: Invented by Ken Bailey in the early 1980s,http://www.slideshare.net/amusementrides/amusement- rides-by-bailey riders would carry a hard, solid plastic sled up to the top of the ride, go down a slide consisting of rollers akin to those found in factories, warehouses, or assembly lines, and end up in a pool that in most areas was no deeper than a puddle. The idea of the ride was to, once the sled hit the water, skip across the water like a stone. In order to do this the rider had to be in a certain position, leaned back. If the rider was not in this position, the sled would sink into the water as soon as it hit the pool, flinging the rider off head-first, which often resulted in head injuries. Other times, riders would be leaving the pool only to have others crash into them as they were riding. This ride consisted of parallel slides originally. At some point in the mid 1980s, a third slide was added. Each slide was long.http://articles.mcall.com/1990-07-29/entertainment/2760035_1_water-rides- water-slides-water-park/2 The slides were removed when Intrawest took over the resort in 1998; the pool was redesigned into the Lost Island River which is part of the children's section. The platform / tower riders climbed to ride the Aqua Skoot became the Treetop Cabanas in 2003. * Kamikaze: This was the more \\"tame\\" water slide near the Geronimo slides. It was blue in color and featured several drops and rises. Riders would lie on their backs with their arms and legs crossed and go down a \\"chute\\" which pitched steeply at first and then went up and down several times before ending in a pool. It survived the Mountain Creek redesign, but was removed and scrapped following the 2009 season. * The Kayak Experience: It was an imitation whitewater course that used submerged electric fans to agitate the water above. Frequently the kayaks got stuck or tipped over, and people had to get out of them to remedy the situation. In 1982, a man died after trying to get back on his kayak and touching the wiring of the fans, sending him into cardiac arrest and leading to its permanent closure. Taking the Tarzan swing into a cold pool. * The Tarzan Swing: This was a steel arch hanging from a cable over a spring-fed pool. Patrons waited in long lines for the chance to hang from it, swing out over the water, then jump off as the beam reached its height. In early years the area patrons jumped off from was not over the water but a cushioned area. Some people who let go as soon as they started their swing would land on the cushion and then slide/crash into the water. In the mid-1980s the starting position was shifted so that patrons started over the water. Some patrons hung on too long and scraped their toes on the concrete at the far side. Others used the ride properly, but were then surprised to find out the water underneath was very cold. It was cold enough, in fact, that the lifeguards sometimes had to rescue people who were so surprised by the sudden chill that they could not swim out of the pool. In 1984, one man died from a heart attack after experiencing the swing. * Roaring Rapids: This was a standard raft-based whitewater ride. Reports that the park filed with the state in 1984 noted fractured femurs, collar bones and noses, and dislocated knees and shoulders. This attraction is still open. The left side is known as The Gauley and riders use a single tube. The right side is known as Thunder Run and is a double tube rafting ride. * Surf Hill: This ride, common to other water parks at the time, allowed patrons to slide down a water-slick sloped surface on mats into small puddles, until they reached a foam barrier after an upslope at the end. Barriers between lanes were minimal, and people frequently collided with each other on the way down, or at the end. The seventh lane was known as the \\"back breaker\\", due to its special kicker two-thirds of the way down intended to allow jumps and splashdowns into a larger puddle. Employees at the park used to like eating at a nearby snack bar with a good view of the attraction, since it was almost guaranteed that they could see some serious injuries, lost bikini tops, or both. Mountain Creek kept this attraction open through 2005, then reopened it in 2012. * Super Speed Water Slides: These two water slides, also known as Geronimo Falls, were set slightly apart from the rest of the park and took advantage of nearly vertical slopes to allow riders to attain higher speeds than usually possible. One started with riders going almost vertically downwards and was covered with screening for the first several feet. As barriers on the side of the slides were very low, lifeguards reminded every user to remain flat on their back with their arms at their side as they descended, since there was no way to ride it otherwise and stay on. The fall from both slides had the potential for very serious injury. Those who made it to the bottom found their progress arrested by water‚Äîwhich made a large splash‚Äîand then a small pool. Only one of these slides remains today; however, the track was replaced with one that was not as steep. The tracks the old slides followed are still visible. Today it is known as the H-2-Oh-No. Vertigo and Vortex, two adjacent enclosed tube slides, still use the same end splash pool that two of the other old speed slides used. * Diving cliffs: The area around Roaring Rapids was (and still is) laid out like a kind of grotto, with many lower-intensity attractions. One was a pair of diving cliffs‚Äîone , the other ‚Äîabove a pool. However, the pool below was not blocked off from those who might be swimming in or away from other attractions, and nothing at water level gave any indication to swimmers below that they could expect people to dive in right next to them‚Äîor right on top of them. The sole lifeguard on duty often had his or her hands full dealing with the results of those collisions. Also, nonswimmers would jump off the cliffs, not fully appreciating how deep the water below was, and have to be rescued. Former employee Tom Fergus says the bottom of the pool was eventually painted white to make it easier to spot any bodies on the bottom. The large pool into which people jumped is no longer used for regular swimming, only to deposit used tubes. Carrying tubes up the mountain. * Colorado River Ride: The Colorado River Ride, which still exists, is a 2-person raft ride that winds its way down a heavily wooded area on the side of the park, with numerous forks allowing riders to take different routes. Unlike in other parks, the river trough was crafted to look like a natural river bed, with jets in the bed at various points adding to the rapid roughness. Riders carried their rafts from the bottom of the ride up to the starting point. Once on the ride, riders would travel down a short incline, propelling them down the ride. As they make it past the first turn, it was common to gain speed. After a few turns, the riders would come to a fork. ** The Main Fork: Riders would ride under a drenching waterfall into a dark tunnel with many twists, turns, and jagged rocks. Upon exiting the tunnel, riders would twist and turn some more until they reached a small rock pool, and slowly floated out. The final stretch of the river consisted of a large downhill portion complete with bumps, and a jump where the rafts would momentarily catch air and then slam back onto the surface. ** The Alternative Forks: Riders would float along a relatively smooth path until they rounded a corner with a waterfall,1991 footage of Action Park (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xXcQdVr1Zg and another fork. One path would take riders back to the main path, and dump them at the tunnel's end. The other fork would reconnect with the main path before the rock pool.Mountain Creek Colorado River Ride footage from 2013 showing both points where the alternative pathways reconnected with the main path of the ride. (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyiD_lk-4Fk Originally, a fork carried riders down a set of steep drops, before a curved drop into the main path right at the end.1987 footage of Action Park (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iJoL1Q9FY In the late 1980s, this path was merged into the main pathway, creating the rock pool, and final hill, that are still in use today. Today, the first fork is closed off, but the points where the forks reconnect to the main path are still connected to the ride. : Originally, riders rode this attraction two at a time, in yellow inflatable dinghies. This was later replaced with large circular four-person rafts. In the Mountain Creek era, a lift was put in place that carried rafts to the beginning of the ride, eliminating the need for riders to carry them all the way up the hill. Because the ride trough was designed to look and feel like actual river bed, the ride was rough. It was not uncommon for people to hit heads with the other riders, or for the rafts to climb the walls after hitting them at high speed, so now they wear football helmets. A rider recounted to Weird NJ how a friend's mother suffered a broken nose when their raft was thrown into a rock wall.Shpunder, Greg; May 2006; \\"Action Park Designed to Hurt People\\" in \\"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\\"; Weird NJ, 28. On the curve before the first fork, it was common for rafts to get stuck ‚Äì requiring riders to have to jump out, and push the raft ‚Äì or wait for the raft behind them to hit them.More Action Park footage from 1991 (Youtube link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz2gxQGF1Wc Inside the tunnel were jagged rocks, which could cause cuts or scrapes if riders placed their hands out. =The Aerodium= The Aerodium is a skydiving simulator wind tunnel invented in Germany in 1984. In 1987, Action Park built and opened their own Aerodium in the Waterworld section of the park, becoming the first American amusement park to open an Aerodium. The attraction was operated by Aerodium Inc., who would act as a concessionaire for the park through 1997.http://www.aerodium.com/general_information.htm Stadium seating encircled the perimeter of the Aerodium, allowing friends and spectators to watch riders fly. Riders wearing a special skydiving suit, helmet, and earplugs would join the bodyflight instructor one by one on a trampoline-like netting directly over the fan. The instructor would grab each rider's wrists and guide the rider to fall forward, allowing the fan to lift the rider skyward. After a few seconds of flight, the attendant operating the fan would cut the power, causing the rider to fall onto the air cushions surrounding the fan. Park guests' flights were limited to a maximum of above the ground, approximately over the instructor's head. The Aerodium also caused severe injuries, for example, when a rider instinctively tried to break his fall by extending his arm, which caused shoulder dislocation, severed nerves, and near-permanent paralysis of the arm. Factors contributing to the park's safety record A range of factors contributed to accidents at the park, from the design and construction of the rides themselves to the makeup of both visitors and staff, and lax government oversight. =Ride design= Action Park and its defenders often pointed out that it was one of the first water parks in the nation and thus pioneered ideas that were later widely copied. This meant that visitors were using rides that had not been tested through practical use for very long. Ride designers may have had insufficient training in physics or engineering. \\"They seemed to build rides,\\" one attendee recalled, \\"not knowing how they would work, and [then let] people on them.\\"Callan, Matthew; November 22, 2000, In Memoriam: Action Park, Freezerbox. GAR, as its legal troubles would suggest, was accused of cutting corners to maximize its profits. For example, it was accused of building rides cheaply, sporadically maintaining many of them, and failing to renovate rides to take advantage of later safety improvements to its ideas made by other facilities. These practices may have taken place in a range of its operations, including customer safety. For example, in the park's last year, it kept part of the ski area open despite being unable to obtain liability insurance. =Employees= The vast majority of workers at Action Park, at least the ones regularly seen by visitors, were teenagers. Jim DeSaye, a security director for the park, says he got that job at the age of 21, after having worked at the park for two years. His experience was not uncommon.DeSaye, Jim; May 2006; \\"From Former Vermin Valley Great Gorge Manager\\" in \\"The Reaction to Traction at Action Park\\"; Weird NJ, 29. Most were underaged, undertrained, often under the influence of alcohol and cared little for enforcing park rules and safety requirements. Height- and weight-based restrictions were often ignored. =Visitors= Since it was closer and slightly cheaper than Six Flags Great Adventure, Action Park attracted many visitors from urban enclaves of the New York metropolitan area. Many of them were often from lower-income neighborhoods where they had few, if any, opportunities to swim, much less learn how. The park greatly overestimated these abilities, and this was a factor in many accidents as well as the drownings, according to park officials. DeSaye faults management's decision to broaden the customer base by advertising in Spanish-language media as contributing to the accident rate, since few employees spoke Spanish and no written information was made available in that language. The staff's indifference to many of the park's own rules led to a similarly lawless culture among visitors, who generally liked the high level of control they had over their experience. Accidents were usually deemed by park employees to be the fault of the riders. A state official lamented that many water-slide accidents were due to guests who, in blatant violation of an explicitly posted rule, would often discard their mats midway down the slide and wait at a turn for their friends so they could go down together. Since many rides routed their lines so that those waiting could see every previous rider, many played to the audience with risque and bawdy behavior when it did finally come to be their turn. The Tarzan Swing in particular was known for outbursts of foul language (not always planned) and exhibitionism as people jumped off the swing in full view of the whole line behind them. = Availability of alcohol on grounds = The park also sold beer in many kiosks on the grounds, with similarly relaxed enforcement of the drinking age as with other restrictions in the park. Doctors treating the injured often reported that many of them were intoxicated. =Lax regulatory climate= Despite many citations for safety violations between 1979 and 1986, including allowing minors to operate some rides and failing to report accidents (which was unique among New Jersey's amusement parks), an investigation by the New Jersey Herald, Sussex County's main daily newspaper, later found that the park was fined only once. It was also unique in that department in that all other amusement parks were fined for first offenses‚Äîexcept Action Park. It asked if there was some sort of special relationship between GAR and the state. Some of the state's regulations failed to adequately address the situation. After the 1987 drowning, it was reported that the Tidal Wave Pool was considered a pool by the state, not a ride. Under state regulations at the time, that meant that the company merely had to keep the water clean and make sure that certified lifeguards were on duty. Fatalities Six people are known to have died directly or indirectly from rides at Action Park: * July 8, 1980: A 19-year- old man was riding the Alpine Slide when his car jumped the track and his head struck a rock, killing him. Gene Mulvihill told reporters that the man was an employee because if he was an employee then he wouldn't have to report his death to the state. The man worked at the park as a ski lift operator the prior season, he never worked at Action Park. * July 24, 1982: A 15-year-old boy drowned in the Tidal Wave Pool. * August 1, 1982: A 27-year-old man from Long Island got out of his tipped kayak on the Kayak Experience to right it. While doing so, he stepped on a grate that was either in contact with, or came too close to, a section of live wiring for the underwater fans that somehow became exposed, and he suffered a severe electric shock, which sent him into cardiac arrest. Several other members of his family nearby were also injured. He was taken to a hospital in nearby Warwick, New York, where he died later of the shock-induced cardiac arrest. The park at first disputed that the electric current caused his death, saying there were no burns on his body, but the coroner responded that burns generally do not occur in a water-based electrocution. The ride was drained and closed for the investigation. Accounts differed as to the extent of the exposed wiring: the park said it was \\"just a nick\\", while others argued it was closer to . The state's Labor Department found that the fan was properly maintained and installed, and cleared the park of wrongdoing; however, it also said that the current had the possibility to cause bodily harm under certain circumstances. The park claimed it had been vindicated, although it never reopened the ride, saying that people would be afraid to go on it afterwards. * 1984 (Date Unknown): A fatal heart attack suffered by one visitor was unofficially believed to have been triggered by the shock of the cold water in the pool beneath the Tarzan Swing. The water on the ride and in that swimming area was , while other water areas were in the range more typical of swimming pools. The Tarzan Swing and the Cannonball ride in this area were operated by spring water. * August 27, 1984: A 20-year-old from Brooklyn drowned in the Tidal Wave Pool. * July 19, 1987: An 18-year-old drowned in the Tidal Wave Pool. Legacy Action Park was a cultural touchstone for many Generation X-ers who grew up in North and Central Jersey, as well as nearby locales in New York and Connecticut. A popular list of \\"You Know You're from New Jersey When ...\\" that circulates in email begins with, \\"You've been seriously injured at Action Park.\\"\\"You Know You're from New Jersey When ...\\" at inav.net, retrieved January 10, 2006. Some even credit the park for making them learn some difficult lessons. In 2000, Matthew Callan recalled Action Park thusly: Chris Gethard, a writer for Weird NJ and the associated book series, concurs: On August 1, 1993, MTV's Headbanger's Ball taped an episode at the park. The host, Riki Rachtman, interviewed and went on the rides with the band Alice in Chains. Action Park was the topic of the first episode of the Relay FM podcast Ungeniused in June 2016, which explores the legacy of the park, how unsafe it was, and why people continued to visit it. The original version of the park's notoriety for its unsafe reputation inspired a film by Jackass star Johnny Knoxville; filming started in March 2017 and wrapped in June 2017. The film was released under the title Action Point by Paramount Pictures on June 1, 2018. Action Park is the subject of Mashable's documentary video, \\"The Most Dangerous Theme Park In America\\" (September 24, 2019). Action Park is the subject of the 2020 HBO documentary \\"Class Action Park\\".  2014 revival  In 2010, the whole Mountain Creek ski area and water park was sold to a group led by Eugene Mulvihill, the former owner of Great American Recreation and the owner of the adjacent Crystal Springs Resort; however, he died two years later. Under the new ownership the name of the water park was changed back to Action Park, starting with the 2014 season. In 2016, the Mountain Creek Waterpark name was restored to the park, thus retiring the Action Park name again. Spinoff locations =Pocono Action Park and Motorworld= On April 14, 1980, Pocono Action Park Inc. was formed by Great American Recreation, which later opened Pocono Action Park and Motorworld. Located in the town of Tannersville, Pennsylvania, it had a Waterworld section with slides and tube rides, as well as a Motorworld section featuring many of the same racing themed attractions‚Äîincluding Lola race cars and go-karts‚Äîas the Vernon park. By late 1991,\\"http://www.videoparadise- sanjose.com/1990arcades.htm\\" A listing of amusement park locations that had arcades as of January 1, 1991, which lists Pocono Action Park of Tannersville, PA the park was closed.

Even after the park closed, however, Pocono Action Park Inc. continues to exist and is listed as an active business.\\"http://www.bizapedia.com/pa/POCONO-ACTION-PARK-INC.html\\" Business information for Pocono Action Park, Inc. =Action Mountain= In June 1984, Stony Point Recreation, a subsidiary of GAR, opened Action Mountain in Pine Hill, New Jersey. The park offered an alpine slide, go-karts, Lola race cars, bumper boats, speed slides, tube slides, swimming pools, as well as a diving platform.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7IQMukct3E By 1986, Stony Point Recreation had accumulated $398,697 in back taxes owed to the town of Pine Hill, and in an effort to relieve the debt sold off the park. In 1999, the site was redeveloped into the Pine Hill Golf Course.

The E&W; Railroad had already established a line from Cartersville, Georgia to Pell City, Alabama through the cities of Rockmart, Georgia, Cedartown, Georgia, and Piedmont, Alabama. The SAL then merged the E&W; into a new subsidiary called the Atlanta and Birmingham Air Line Railway. With this new subsidiary, a 37-mile extension was built from Coal City, Alabama (renamed to Wattsville in 1917) to Birmingham, AL. In addition, a 43-mile connection from Howells, Georgia (located in Northwest Atlanta) was constructed to meet the former E&W; at Rockmart. Some of the sights on the line include the Pumpkinvine Creek Trestle located in Paulding County, Georgia which was built in 1901 by the E&W; and is 126 feet high and 750 feet long. Because of the mountainous terrain in Alabama, 3 tunnels were constructed on this line. At the time, SAL had no tunnels anywhere on their entire system. The tunnels constructed were the Divide Tunnel (now called Bushy Mountain Tunnel) located near Braswell, Georgia, the Hardwick Tunnel located between Odenville and Wattsville, Alabama, and the Roper Tunnel located near Trussville, Alabama. The 3 tunnels totaled 2,964 ft. in length. Currently, the Hardwick and Roper tunnels are being used by the Alabama and Tennessee River Railway, a subsidiary railroad of OmniTRAX. In 1904 the A&BAL; reached Birmingham where it interchanged with the Louisville & Nashville Railroad (L&N;), the St. Louis‚ÄìSan Francisco Railway (Frisco) and the Illinois Central Railroad (IC). The A&BAL; also reached Howells (located in Northwest Atlanta), which became the location of the Seaboard Georgia Division offices, and a switching yard and Locomotive servicing and repair shop. After the A&BAL; opened in late 1904, the 22-mile Rockmart-Cartersville link and the Coal City-Pell City tracks became branches off the main line. The line officially opened for freight traffic on December 5, 1904 and passenger service July 2, 1905. SAL fully absorbed the A&BAL; in 1909. All tunnels on the line were eventually concrete-lined, starting in 1909. The rebuilding of the original E&W; line in 1909 also included straightening of curves on the existing trackage which required deep cuts through granite rock, resulting in the removal of over 6 miles of circuitous trackage. The original SAL Atlanta-Birmingham line was eventually abandoned in 1988 by successor railroad CSX from Cedartown to Wattsville and from Rockmart to Smyrna, Georgia. A large portion of the former right of way from Smyrna to Anniston, Alabama is now part of the Silver Comet biking and walking trail in Georgia as well as the Chief Ladiga biking and walking trail in Alabama.

The regiment participated in the Battle of Brandywine and the Battle of Germantown. At Germantown, under the command of Colonel George Mathews, the unit became separated from the remainder of General Nathanael Greene's division and over 400 men were taken prisoner by the British.

Plot summary Nita's family goes on vacation with Kit and his dog, Ponch, to the South Shore of Long Island. While swimming in the ocean at night, Nita encounters a dolphin (nicknamed 'Hotshot'), and Kit reports the local rocks' memory of disaster. In the following night, they are carried by the dolphin to a nearby beach, where they see a pack of sharks attacking a humpback whale wizard named S'reee, whom they rescue. Nita heals S'reee, and Nita and Kit return to shore. From S'reee, they hear of a 'Song of the Twelve', in which twelve cetacean wizards were tempted by the Lone Power to embrace entropy; and of the Twelve, three whales accepted this, three were undecided, and three rejected it. A Tenth whale, the Silent Lord, instead sacrificed herself, and was eaten by the Master Shark. This action bound the Lone Power for a time, and succeeding Songs (re-enacting the first) have kept it bound. Upon learning of an absence of wizards willing to join the Song, Nita volunteers herself as the Silent Lord, not knowing the implications; whereafter S'reee takes Nita and Kit to find other whales for the upcoming Song. Nita, having shared blood with S'reee while healing her, becomes a humpback whale without external aid, while Kit is given a 'whalesark' (a cloak containing the 'character' of a particular species) changing him into a sperm whale. The next day, Nita and Kit sneak out of their beach house to help S'reee, and are introduced to Ed'Rashekaresket (nicknamed 'Ed' by Nita): the 'Master-Shark' of the Song. From him, Nita learns that the Song requires her own death, and becomes reluctant to continue her r√¥le; but is persuaded on grounds that a failure of the Song will destroy millions of innocent lives, and that her own memories of Kit and their adventures will be excised. As the Lone Power's binding weakens, large kraken attack the wizards underwater, and volcanic vents become active. Nita and Kit, in the face of her parents' demands for an explanation, reveal wizardry to her parents, but do not explain Nita's r√¥le in the Song. Nita's sister Dairine becomes able to read Nita's book of magic, suggesting her own innate abilities thereof (explored in the sequel). On return to the ocean, Nita meets the other participants in the Song (called the 'Celebrants), and befriends Ed. Thereafter the Celebrants descend into Hudson Canyon, where they are attacked by kraken and other monsters until they reach the Sea's Tooth, where the Song is held. The Song continues according to plan, until one of the whales succumbs to the Lone Power, and allows the Krakens to attack the Singers. Kit then takes her place; but the Lone Power emerges from its binding as an enormous serpent. In the succeeding battle, Ed requests Nita to temporarily give him her wizardry, and he finishes her part of the Song. He then attacks the Serpent, who wounds him; prompting all the sharks in the area to attack him and the serpent, whereupon the Lone Power withdraws, bound anew. Nita and Kit return to the beach house, where Nita learns that Ed's sacrifice pays a debt owed by herself to the godlike 'Powers' governing wizardry. A rough epilogue then forms in which Ed appears in 'Timeheart', the Heavenly realm preserving affectionate memories, to Nita and Kit.

The park is accessible only by charter boat (with or without captain), private boat, ferry or helicopter.  History  Cayo Costa was occupied by Calusa people until about 1700. Native Americans built a number of shell mounds on the island. Starting early in the 18th century, fishermen from Cuba began establishing ranchos, stations for catching and processing fish for the Havana market, along the southwest coast of the Florida peninsula from Tampa Bay to the Caloosahatchee River, possibibly including on Cayo Costa. The ranchos operated through the period of British rule (1763-1783), the second period of Spanish rule (1783-1821), and into the period of American rule, until they were forced out during the Second Seminole War. Tervio (Tariva, Toribio) Padilla, commonly known as \\"Captain Pappy\\", settled on Cayo Costa in the second half of the 19th century. Born in the Canary Islands, Padilla became a U. S. citizen in 1862, while a resident of Key West. Padilla operated a rancho on Cayo Costa, where he and his workers caught and processed fish for the Cuban market. A cemetery on the island holds the graves of Padilla and his wife, as well as of approximately 30 Cuban fishermen who died in a 1910 hurricane. Geography Cayo Costa Island is one of a chain of barrier islands that shelter Charlotte Harbor and Pine Island Sound. The park contains nine miles (14 km) of soft white sandy beaches and of pine forests, oak-palm hammocks, and mangrove swamps. Fauna There is a variety of wildlife that can be seen at the park. Among the most looked-for animals found in Cayo Costa State Park are the sea turtles. There are four species found on the island, the loggerhead (Caretta caretta), hawksbill (Eremochelys imbriata), green (Chelonia mydas), and Kemp's ridley (Lepidochelys kempii). Cayo Costa has many volunteers who check the entire nine mile beach each morning during sea turtle nesting season to find new nests and document them which is during the months of March through October in Southwest Florida. The loggerhead turtle is found far more than the others, and the green turtle is a distant second. The loggerhead turtle and green turtle's eggs have the most diverse niches awhile hawksbill and Kemp's ridley do not. Their niches rely on climate and weather which allow the eggs to survive on land and eventually hatch.Pike,http://search.proquest.com/docview/1352287353/ \\"Climate influences the global distribution of sea turtle nesting\\" Global Ecology and Biogeography, 2013 Cayo Casta State Park is a major nesting site for turtle nesting in Florida. These nests are protected by Florida State Parks and are regulated by volunteers and staff. The nests are patrolled and marked off so that guests can avoid interrupting them. Another species found on the island is the common raccoon (Procyon lotor). These animals pose a big problem during the sea turtle nesting season due to the fact that they are the most common species of predation on the eggs. Others types of predation on the eggs include: high tide, foxes, ants, ghost crabs, and looting humans.Bravo, Estrella, \\"Marine Turtles Nesting Monitoring in El Cuyo, Yucatan, Mexico Season 1997\\", NOAA Technical Memorandum, 1998 The West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus) is also found coming up to the island beaches. This is considered an endangered animal, but the population is currently growing.Hunter, Margaret, Mignucci, Tucker, King, Bonde, Gray, McGuire, \\"Puerto Rico and Florida manatees represent genetically distinct groups\\", Conservation Genetics, 2012 They can be seen from the beach or near the canals and docks of the island. The West Indian manatee is found in Florida and Puerto Rico. Although they are part of the same species, there is genetic diversity and allele frequency between the two populations. The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncates) can also be seen jumping, swimming, and playing along the all nine miles of beaches on the island.Janik, \\"Identifying signature whistles from recordings of groups of unrestrained bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus)\\", Marine Mammal Science, 2013 Each dolphin has its own personal whistle just like any human would have a distinct voice. Dolphins are able to recognize these sounds and communicate through them. Scientists are able to measure these sounds and put them with the individual dolphin that made them. The snowy egret (Egretta thula) can be found on the island.Parsons, Master, \\"Snowy Egret (Egretta thula)\\", The Birds of North America Online, 2000 They usually stay near the beaches. They are a small white heron with long, slender black legs and yellow feet. Both sexes of the snowy egret have the same features even during the breeding season. The southern bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) can be found flying about the island or sitting up on the high trees.Buehler, \\"Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus)\\", The Birds of North America Online, 2000 This is another threatened species. The eagles eat a variety of animals, but prefer fish. They scavenge and steal food when they are able to, and the eagle hunts for live prey only as a last resort. Flora The mother-in-law's tongue (Sansevieria trifasciata) is found on the island. This plant is most commonly seen as a house plant, but this invasive species came from one of the houses on the island and has spread widely. Staff is currently trying to rid the island of this invasive plant. The resurrection fern (Pleopeltis polypodioides) is found growing on trees throughout Cayo Costa. It is an epiphyte that if it is dehydrated, will turn brown and curl up its leaves looking dead. When the plant receives water or rain, the plant will \\"come back to life\\" and reappear green and alive.Wang, Xiaonan, Zhang, Cao, Yan, Dai, \\"Desiccation tolerance mechanism in resurrection fern-ally Selaginella tamariscina revealed by physiological and proteomic analysis\\", Journal of Proteome Research, 2010 Seagrape (Coccoloba uvifera) is found at Cayo Costa. The fruit comes about in the summer time during the wet season of southwest Florida. It starts out at a bright green grape then ripens to a purplish color. The fruit mainly consists of a large seed with little flesh. It is well known of Florida natives to make jellies or wines from the grapes. This plant is native to South Florida and the Caribbean.Jackson, \\"With the Wild Things: Seagrape\\", Florida Gulf Coast University, 2007 This plant can grow up to fifty feet tall, and is usually close to the ocean because they are one of the few salt tolerant plants. Recreational activities Activities include hiking, off-road bicycling, swimming, kayaking, snorkeling, picnicking, fishing, shelling, wildlife viewing, camping, and sunbathing.

A burh () or burg was an Old English fortification or fortified settlement. In the 9th century, raids and invasions by Vikings prompted Alfred the Great to develop a network of burhs and roads to use against such attackers. Some were new constructions; others were situated at the site of Iron Age hillforts or Roman forts and employed materials from the original fortifications. As at Lundenburh (medieval London), many were also situated on rivers: this facilitated internal lines of supply while aiming to restrict access to the interior of the kingdom for attackers in shallow-draught vessels such as longships. Burhs also had a secondary role as commercial and sometimes administrative centres. Their fortifications were used to protect England's various royal mints.

' was the plural form of and : \\"forts\\", \\"fortifications\\". It was also the dative form: \\"to the fort\\" or \\"for the fort\\". This developed into \\"bury\\" and \\"berry\\", which were used to describe manor houses, large farms, or settlements beside the fortifications.Oxford English Dictionary, 1st ed. \\"‚Ä† Ààbury, n.\\" Oxford University Press (Oxford), 1888. In addition to the English foundations described here, these names were sometimes used in Old English calques or variants of native placenames, including the Brittonic and Welsh , as at Salisbury. Background The burh wall at Wallingford, Oxfordshire. Burhs were originally built as military defences. According to H. R. Loyn, the burh \\"represented only a stage, though a vitally important one, in the evolution of the medieval English borough and of the medieval town\\".Loyn, Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman Conquest, 2nd ed. 1991:138. The boundaries of ancient burhs can often still be traced to modern urban borough limits. Most of these were founded by Alfred the Great in a consciously planned policy that was continued under his son Edward the Elder and his daughter, √Üthelfl√¶d, the 'Lady of the Mercians', and her husband √Üthelred, Ealdorman of Mercia. The Mercian Register tells of the building of ten burhs by √Üthelfl√¶d, some as important as Tamworth and Stafford, others now unidentifiable.Loyn 1991:138. Some were based upon pre-existing Roman structures, some newly built, though others may have been built at a later date. √Üthelstan granted these burhs the right to mint coinage and in the tenth and eleventh centuries the firm rule was that no coin was to be struck outside a burh.Loyn 1991:137f. A tenth-century document, now known as the Burghal Hidage and so named by Frederic William Maitland in 1897, cites thirty burhs in Wessex and three in Mercia. At the time, Mercia was ruled by the West Saxon kings. These burhs were all built to defend the region against Viking raids.Hill/ Rumble. The Defence of Wessex. p. 1 Only eight of the burhs achieved municipal status in the Middle Ages: Chester, Bridgnorth, Tamworth, Stafford, Hertford, Warwick, Buckingham and Maldon.Loyn 1991:139f, noting Tait The largest were at Winchester, Wallingford and Warwick, whilst Wallingford and Wareham are the best-preserved examples, with substantial ditches and banks still visible. It has been estimated that construction of Wallingford's of bank would have taken more than 120,000 man hours. Burh towns also usually had regular street layouts, some of which are still preserved.Lavelle. Fortifications in Wessex c. 800-1066. pp. 33-38 Burhs are widely thought to have been the origins of urban life in England. In most cases, Alfred's rebuilding of a burh did not cause any change of name, as the sites chosen had already been some sort of fortified structure.Tait. The Medieval Borough. pp. 1-29 Construction The walled defence around a burh. Alfred's capital, Winchester. Saxon and medieval work on Roman foundations. The burhs were made in a variety of different ways, depending on materials available locally, and the size of the settlement or area it was intended to defend.Welch. Anglo- Saxon England. pp. 125-131 Frequently, a burh was built on the site of pre- existing fortifications. Sometimes, the Anglo-Saxons would simply repair old Roman walls in towns such as Winchester, Exeter, York, Burgh Castle, Portchester and Dover. At other times, they would build on the site of old Iron Age forts, such as Dover, utilising the old ditches and ramparts. However, the Anglo-Saxons did not just use old fortifications. Many of the burhs built by the Saxons were entirely new fortified sites, built on strategic sites on the coast, near ports or overlooking roads and trade routes. Substantial new towns were built on flat land with a rectangular layout, at for example Oxford, Wallingford, Cricklade and Wareham. Traditionally, burhs were constructed first with a massive series of banks fronted by a ditch. The bank was typically timber faced and timber revetted.Lapidge. Anglo-Saxon England. p. 191 This was topped by a wooden palisade of stakes, up to high, with a walkway. At towns such as Tamworth, the ramparts would decay and push outwards over time, meaning that the ditch and bank would deteriorate. To solve this, Anglo-Saxon builders faced banks with stone, thus further reinforcing the defences and improving their life span. Purpose  The purpose was primarily to provide defence for a port or town, and the surrounding farms, villages and hamlets. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Alfred constructed a series of burhs, listed in the Burghal Hidage numbering over 30. Apparently, it was Alfred's intention that no English farm or village be any more than away from a burh. He built a network of well maintained army roads, known as herepaths, that interconnected the burhs, allowing the population quick access to shelter (in their local burh). The herepaths enabled Alfred's troops to move swiftly to engage the enemy. It also meant that reinforcements could be called up easily, from other burhs if needed. Ryan Lavelle believes that each burh would have had a mounted force that would be ready for action against the Vikings. It is probable that there was a system of beacons on the high hills of Wessex that gave advance warning of any invader.Lavelle. Fortifications in Wessex c. 800-1066. p. 26 Thus with this integrated network of fortifications and defence with the burhs at its centre, Alfred was able to make it difficult for the Vikings to seize strategically important towns and ports. Burhs also had secondary roles as economic centres, safe havens in which trade and production could take place. Armouries, blacksmiths, royal mints and trading posts were all located within the burh. They would be used as supply depot for the Saxon army when it was in the field, thus ensuring that the Anglo-Saxon troops had a continual supply of weapons, fresh horses and food.Lavelle. Fortifications in Wessex c. 800-1066. pp. 39-46 During Alfred's reign there was a definite demarcation between the royal fyrd (royal army) and those of the local fyrd (local defence force). The local fyrd were responsible for the construction and defence of their burh, whereas members of the royal fyrd served under the king.Powicke.

Presented by Victoria Coren, it was a companion to the dictionary's Wordhunt project. The OED panel consisted of John Simpson, the Chief Editor of the OED; Peter Gilliver, who was also the captain of the Oxford University Press team in University Challenge: The Professionals; and etymologist Tania Styles, who also appeared in the \\"dictionary corner\\" in Countdown. Series 1 The first series of Balderdash and Piffle was originally broadcast in January 2006, each programme being based around a letter. Following the conclusion of the first series, a follow-up episode aired on 16 April 2006 with updates on the discoveries members of the public had made, resulting in several further changes to the dictionary. Series 2 A new Wordhunt began in January 2007 and the results featured in the second series of the programme which premiered on Friday 11 May at 10pm on BBC Two. The second series was divided thematically. Victoria Coren was joined by guest reporters who attempted to trace the etymology and first documentary use of words, based on suggestions from the British public. Victoria Coren then took the evidence they had found to a panel of OED staff, who decided whether this evidence was sufficient to include in the dictionary. The books Balderdash and Piffle is also the name given to two books written by Alex Games. The first, titled Balderdash and Piffle was published by BBC Books in 2006. A second book, also by Alex Games and published by BBC Books, is titled Balderdash and Piffle: One sandwich short of a dog's dinner and accompanied the second series of the show.

It was published in 1990. Plot introduction In this book, Dairine becomes a wizard and much more of a major character than a supporting one in this novel, since the plot revolves around her Ordeal. Plot summary When Dairine, Nita's younger sister, finds Nita's copy of the Wizard's manual, she then proceeds to take the Wizard's Oath. Dairine is given her Wizard's manual in the form of a computer, which Dairine nicknames \\"Spot.\\" Dairine uses her new power to travel to Mars, then to the Crossings, where she is attacked by agents of the Lone Power. When she uses a worldgate to flee, assisted by an unnamed man she meets in a bar, she finds herself on a giant planet consisting entirely of silicon. In the meantime, Nita and Kit discover she is missing and chase after her. Dairine awakens the massive computer embedded in the planet and gets to work designing and naming 'mobiles' after the planet begins to create quicklife (computer-based) creatures. She names them in a variety of ways ranging from computer programs to Star Wars characters. The Lone Power overshadows a mobile and stirs up animosity against Dairine, convincing a number of them to support him instead. Nita and Kit arrive in time to help her, assisted by the macaw Machu Picchu (Peach), who reveals herself as the One's Champion incarnate. With Peach's assistance, the Lone Power is defeated by stopping the universe from expanding. The resulting light that explodes as a result of this destroys the Lone Power. The Lone Power then returns to \\"home\\" with one of the Powers That Be. As he leaves, he tells Kit and Nita to destroy the \\"shadows\\" of him that remain. The universe continues to expand and Nita, Kit and Dairine return to their home, where Dairine's computer sprouts legs and follows her upstairs as Nita and Kit talk to their parents.  Themes  The Lone Power, so far depicted as a destructive villain, is here \\"redeemed\\" by being accepted by the One who made the Powers That Be. However, this does not make It automatically \\"good\\" but ambivalent, rather than pure evil, which It then refers to in Wizard's Holiday as \\"boring\\". Duane confirmed that a character briefly seen in a cameo is the Fifth Doctor from the series Doctor Who.

The Nextwave team learns that H.A.T.E. is funded by the Beyond Corporation¬©, an organization formerly known as terrorist group S.I.L.E.N.T. As a result, the heroes leave H.A.T.E., stealing a vehicle called the Shockwave Rider. They destroy the U.W.M.D.s that the Beyond Corporation and H.A.T.E. have hidden around the United States, while being pursued by H.A.T.E. Director Dirk Anger, a parody of Nick Fury. The U.W.M.D.s include Fin Fang Foom,Nextwave #1-2 Broccoli Men, Ultra Samurai,Nextwave #5-6 and the Mindless Ones. Using the Shockwave Rider as a mobile base of operations (the vehicle is larger on the inside than out, much like the TARDIS of Doctor Who), Nextwave is able to rapidly mount missions in widely separated locations including central Illinois, Wyoming, North Dakota, and Nevada. Nextwave consistently features extreme violence and comedy, and simultaneously satirizes and celebrates Marvel's superhero comics. The series frequently uses flashback scenes in which existing Marvel characters such as Captain America, Ulysses Bloodstone and the Celestials act grossly out of character for comedic purposes. In an interview, Ellis said, \\"I took The Authority and I stripped out all the plots, logic, character and sanity.\\" \\"It's an absolute distillation of the superhero genre. No plot lines, characters, emotions, nothing whatsoever. It's people posing in the street for no good reason. It is people getting kicked, and then exploding. It is a pure comic book, and I will fight anyone who says otherwise. And afterwards, they will explode.\\" In a 2005 interview, writer Warren Ellis commenting on his Nextwave stories stated, \\"I think it has to be a self contained universe. It takes from Marvel history, but I wouldn't necessarily want to drag mainstream Marvel into it for fear of what I would do to it.\\" In 2006, Marvel Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada stated that \\"for the time being\\" Nextwave was to be considered set in a universe separate from the main Marvel continuity. In contradiction to these earlier statements, Marvel publications such as Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe and Civil War: Battle Damage Report seemed to portray Nextwave's activities as occurring in the mainstream Marvel continuity. To further complicate matters, Nextwave's entry in Civil War: Battle Damage Report states: \\"Recent intelligence suggests some or all Nextwave members unknowingly had their memories and/or personalities altered by their new employers (H.A.T.E.).\\" In Captain America and the Mighty Avengers, it is definitively stated that Nextwave happened, with the Beyond Corporation, now revealed to be members of The Beyonders returning, and tauntingly telling Luke Cage and Jessica Jones to ask Monica about \\"Beyond\\", making her realize those events were, in fact, real, and reverting to her Nextwave outfit.Captain America and the Mighty Avengers #6 Publication history Nextwave debuted in 2006 and was cancelled after issue #12, which was published in February 2007. The run of the series was written by Warren Ellis, drawn by Stuart Immonen and colored by Dave McCaig. Warren Ellis (on his website) stated in October 2006 that he had initially planned to write the series for twelve issues, then pass it off to another writer. However the initial plan was changed and the series was placed on hiatus until Ellis should choose to return. According to Ellis, this was at least partly because monthly sales could not justify keeping artist Stuart Immonen on the project at his then current pay rate. Ellis has stated that \\"there will be more Nextwave to come, presented as a sequence of limited series.\\" Starting with issue #3, Marvel had changed the series title to Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E. Artist Stuart Immonen has stated that the title change was due to trademark issues. A variant edition of issue #5, called the \\"Crayon Butchery Variant\\", was printed in black and white on newsprint. Marvel (through the website Comic Book Resources) encouraged readers to color the issue with crayons and enter the results, for a chance to win original artwork from the issue. The winner was announced in the letter column of the tenth issue. Issue #11 contains a series of splash pages that Warren Ellis and Stuart Immonen devised so that in order to get the full impact of the scene, a reader might have to purchase six copies. On the last of the pages, a caption reads, \\"Nextwave: Blatantly wasting your money since 2006.\\" A theme song was created by series editor Nick Lowe and his brother Matt, by their band Thunder Thighs. It was advertised on their Myspace page and lyrics printed in the \\"Director's Cut\\" edition of the first issue. The tabs and lyrics are also in the Volume 1 hardcover collected edition. Collected editions The series has been collected into a number of volumes: * Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E. Volume 1 ‚Äì This Is What They Want (2006), collects issues #1‚Äì6 ** Hardcover edition: ** Softcover edition: * Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E. Volume 2 ‚Äì I Kick Your Face (2007), collects issues #7‚Äì12 ** Hardcover edition: ** Softcover edition: In March 2010, all twelve issues were collected into a paperback Ultimate Collection ().

They are killed off-panel by the infected Power Pack.Marvel Zombies vs. the Army of Darkness #3 Awards The Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA) has released their Best of 2007 lists and Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E. were named among the 2007 Top Ten Great Graphic Novels for Teens. Nextwave writer Warren Ellis was happy to learn of the title's recognition by YALSA, saying, \\"I do it all for the children.\\" In keeping with the off-beat humor of his book, Ellis added, \\"It is good to know that the young people of today are ready and waiting for me to form a Church.\\" Nextwave also won three Eagle Awards for Favourite New Comicbook, Favourite Comics Story Published During 2006 (for issues #1-6), and Favourite Comics Villain (for Dirk Anger). Merchandise The entire Nextwave team was represented in HeroClix form in the Giant Size X-Men (GSX) set. The team of five figures equals an even 500 points. Captain The Captain (formerly Captain ‚ò†‚ò†‚ò†‚ò†, with the crosses denoting censorship of an expletive) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is a satiric superhero appearing in the book Nextwave. He was created by Warren Ellis and Stuart Immonen and first appeared in Nextwave #1 (January 2006). In 2006 Editor-in- Chief Joe Quesada stated that Nextwave's setting was in a universe separate from the main Marvel continuity.Wade Gum (2006-07-01). \\"Heroes Con: Joe Quesada Panel\\", However, recent issues of Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, as well as Civil War: Battle Damage Report, consistently place Nextwave's activities in mainstream continuity. According to Warren Ellis' series proposal (within Volume 1's collection of stories), he stated that the Captain was pretty much every pointless character who utilized \\"Captain\\" in his codename. =Nextwave= Little is known about the Captain's past before he joined H.A.T.E., the organization which assembled Nextwave. One flashback shows that when he was a child, his mother hanged his favorite teddy bear, Special Bear; due to this, he dislikes teddy bears even in adulthood. (As with all of the flashbacks shown in the series, the accuracy of this memory is suspect, as Civil War: Battle Damage Report states that members of Nextwave may have had memories altered by the Beyond Corporation¬©) He claims to be \\"from ‚ò†‚ò†‚ò†‚ò† Brooklyn\\". The Captain gained his powers from \\"the Heartstar of the space between the galaxies\\",Nextwave #4 also referred to as the \\"Messianic Siddhe-complex,\\" which was bestowed upon him by a pair of small, green, altruistic extraterrestrials named Spa-Fon and Squa-TrontSpa-Fon (1968-?) and Squa Tront (1967-?) were the names of EC fanzines that have been published and republished intermittently since the late 1960s. Apparently the 'zines names were drawn from EC science fiction comic dialog. \\"Spa-Fon!\\" and \\"Squa Tront!\\" were derived from alien-language phrases expressing surprise, equivalent to \\"Oh, My Lord!\\" (both first used in \\"The Aliens\\", drawn by Al Williamson, Weird Fantasy #17 [Jan-Feb 1953]). in order to make Brooklyn a better place. As the Captain was incredibly drunk at the time, it is unknown if he remembers this event exactly, as he immediately attacked both aliens, believing them to be gold-bearing leprechauns. By his own admission, he used to go by Captain ‚ò†‚ò†‚ò†‚ò†, a moniker so offensive that, when he met Captain America, the Avenger beat him severely and left him unconscious in a dumpster with a bar of soap in his mouth. The Captain used a lot of codenames as well, all of them starting with 'Captain', and had to abandon them all because someone else was already using them. In Nextwave #7 he mentions that he had to pay a \\"marine-looking melon farmer\\" to even use his current codename. The Captain continues to use his codename in the Nextwave group while the other members have dropped them; according to Aaron Stack, this is due to an inability to remember his real name. According to the official theme song of the comic, in tone with the satirical quality of the stories, he doesn't have a name anymore at all, with \\"The Captain\\" serving both as a moniker, and as an impromptu first name. Similar to the rest of Nextwave, the Captain dresses in civilian clothes‚Äîsneakers, camouflage pants, a trenchcoat, and a white T-shirt with a black star which resembles the Heartstar‚Äîdespite becoming a superhero \\"for the mask,\\" as he stated in issue #1. The Captain is extremely cynical, foul- mouthed, and hard-drinking. His age is as yet undetermined, but he has said his mother conceived him while listening to Roxy Music's 1982 album Avalon. A text box in one issue states that, despite his name, he is not actually the captain of anything. =Initiative= The Captain and other Nextwave members appear on the solicited cover to Avengers: The Initiative.Avengers: The Initiative #1 Character Map =\\"Civil War II\\"= The Captain resurfaces in the 2016 \\"Civil War II\\" storyline, reduced to possible homelessness and whiling away his time in New York City's dive bars. He is spurred back into action when Nova's battle with the forces of Mole Monster causes his beer to spill, an innocuous occurrence that the Captain interprets as an epiphany-inducing \\"metaphor for something\\".

He is the official deputy to the Lord High Admiral, an office vested in Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh since 2011. He is appointed by the Sovereign on the nomination of the First Sea Lord. History The Lieutenant of the Admiralty (or Lieutenant-Admiral) is first found in about the middle of the 15th century, as the Deputy or Assistant to the Lord High Admiral of England. In 1545 the Lieutenant of the Admiralty presided over the Council of the Marine. In 1546, when the Navy Board was formed, the Lieutenant of the Admiralty was appointed as its Head , but this ceased in 1564 when the Treasurer of the Navy became the Head of the Board. The post was revived in 1604 when it appears to have been given as a mark of honourable distinction - with a salary of -¬£100p.a., including two clerks and certain travelling expenses. In 1672 the post of Lieutenant of the Admiralty was merged into that of Vice-Admiral of England until 1707. The title became part of the office of the Vice-Admiral of Great Britain until 1800. From 1801 the office was joined with that of Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom, and was the second most powerful position in the Royal Navy.

Mesembryanthemum cooperi; common names Trailing Iceplant, Hardy Iceplant, or \\"Pink Carpet\\") is a dwarf perennial plant, native to South Africa. It forms a dense lawn with abundant, long-lasting flowering. It will reach sizes of approximately tall, with fleshy leaves and a trailing stem that hangs down. The flowers are the most brilliant aspect of this plant, with the production of a great quantity of vermillion, magenta or pink flowers that will often cover the entire site, hence the popular name \\"pink carpet\\". The plant contains ramified stems that are spread out, carrying sheets opposed, and are long and narrow, with the end of the stems increasing into a quantity of isolated small flowers, with diameters ranging from . These abundant and long-lasting flowers will remain in bloom from July to September. The plant is sun-loving, and thrives well in very dry and hot environments. While it adapts well to various soil types, it will suffer under water stagnation, and thus prefers well drained soils, or even rocky terrain. According to the New Mexico State University extension, the common name, \\"ice plant\\" is because \\"they have bladder-like hairs on the leaf surface that reflect and refract light in a manner to make it appear that they sparkle like ice crystals\\" (or tiny glass beads). However, many other species of succulent so-called \\"ice plant\\" ground covers have smooth and hairless leaves. Cultivation and uses It can be cultivated in a wide range of areas with a Mediterranean climate. Unlike many ice plants, this species is hardy to , successfully overwintering at locations such as Denver, Colorado and Chicago, Illinois. The leaves turn red in cold winter temperatures. Due to the low need for maintenance, it is suitable for urban environments and high temperature regions. It can often be found in large, extensive patches. The trailing stems also make it suitable for flowerpots and terraces. Propagation can be accomplished by taking a flowerless cutting, stripping a couple of bottom leaves off, and then replanting in the same soil. The plant contains the halucinogen chemicals DMT and 5-MeO-DMT, which can be extracted from the leaves. The concentration of these chemicals varies over the year. The content of 5-MeO-DMT rises during the summer and the content of DMT instead rises during the winter.  Sources  *Leistner, O. A. (ed.). 2000. Seed plants of southern Africa: families and genera.

Covering the years 1935 to the 1960s, it stars Jennifer Love Hewitt, who also produced the film. Emmy Rossum and Sarah Hyland appear as Hepburn in her early years. The film was shot in Montreal, Canada, and premiered on ABC on March 27, 2000. Plot The film opens with Hepburn acting in the title sequence from Breakfast at Tiffany's and reminiscing about her life up to that point. These include her experiences in early childhood, studying to be a ballerina, coming to grips with her parents' divorce, and life in Nazi-occupied Netherlands during World War II. She then settles in the United States where she succeeds in making it big as an actress. The film also looks at the men who woo her and her marriage to Mel Ferrer. The closing credits feature footage of the real Hepburn during one of the UNICEF missions she undertook in her later years.

She halted the script after the birth of Hepburn's first child, due to the age of her lead actress. Jennifer Love Hewitt, who was 21 at the time of the filming, and \\"[W]e would not be able to successfully age her past 33\\", Rubin explained. Hewitt had been recommended for the role by director Steven Robman, who had previously directed her in Party of Five. The $7 million production was filmed on location in Montreal between April 13 and May 29, 1999. Nearly 80 roles were cast. Canadian professionals involved with the film included Jean- Baptiste Tard, production design; Ren√©e April, costume design; and Pierre Letarte, director of photography. Release Several versions of the film were aired. In the United States. It aired as a three-hour film on ABC on March 27, 2000, while in other countries a longer version was broadcast over two nights. Reception Critical reviews noted that the film overcame several potential pitfalls, including the usual insipidness of television movies and the difficulty of mounting a biopic of a revered actress who had died only seven years earlier. Entertainment Weekly wrote that Jennifer Love Hewitt had \\"guts\\" to take on the role, and called her \\"excellent at conveying Hepburn's studied modesty\\". While the review describes the other actors as \\"a cast of impersonators who are mostly much worse than herself [Hewitt]\\", it sums up the film as a \\"corny, curious, but achingly sincere and fitfully enjoyable TV movie\\". Variety praised the performances of the two young actresses who played Hepburn as a youth, Sarah Hyland and Emmy Rossum, saying they gave \\"depth and likability\\" to Hepburn's character and gave Hewitt, who plays Hepburn as an adult, \\"a ball that's already rolling\\". This review commended Hewitt for her \\"onscreen maturity\\". The Apollo Guide called the screenplay \\"a mildly pleasant surprise\\" for a television film and praised Hewitt's performance for conveying the \\"mannerisms and accent\\" of Hepburn without taking on a full-blown impersonation. It reserved its greatest praise for Rossum's performance, which \\"demonstrates both her [Hepburn's] heart and the development of her strength of character and explains, in part, why she was unique\\". A Moviehole.com review agreed that Hewitt conveyed \\"both the look, and the voice\\" of Hepburn, but disliked the script for presenting such a large number of scenes in Hepburn's life rather than the \\"most gripping\\" ones. Negative reviews focused on Hewitt's inability to portray Hepburn's physical qualities. According to The Baltimore Sun review: \\"What's impossibly wrong with this film is that Hewitt has no physical grace while Hepburn was the very embodiment of it. ... Director Steve Robman ... has to use every trick from slow motion to shooting only legs and arms of body-doubles to make it look as though Hewitt could have been a ballerina\\". Radio Times noted the incongruity of the \\"buxom\\" actress portraying the gamine Hepburn. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 20% based on reviews from 5 critics.

Its name reflects its main occupation: hunting rats and mice hidden between barrels in the wineries of Andalusia in Spain. It was recognised as an indigenous Spanish breed in 2000 by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture and by the Spanish Kennel Club, the Real Sociedad Canina de Espa√±a.Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz from the Spanish Kennel Club in Spanish  Appearance  The Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz is of medium size, measuring between at the withers, with an appearance very similar to that of the Jack Russell Terrier, to the extent that it has on occasion been called the Spanish Jack Russell. The breed is an agile dog with a lean and athletic build; the head is triangular with a semi-flat skull. The eyes are very dark and the Ratonero has a long muzzle, and high set ears that bend over at the tip. The tail is traditionally docked to one quarter of its length, however they may also be born with a natural bobtail. The coat is short and dense, which is typically white. Its facial markings are a mixture of brown, white and black markings (known as tricolor), usually with tan- colored eyebrows, and always with a black melanistic mask.  Temperament  The breed is lively and brave with strong hunting instincts. It must also be friendly and according to the breed club this breed is good with children.  History  Inside a bodega English wine merchants settling in the Sherry making region of Spain, Marco de Jerez, brought with them the ancestors of today's Fox Terrier breeds as long as several hundred years ago, where they were crossed with local dogs and used for vermin control of rats and mice in the wineries. In the 1900s, the Toy Terrier was crossed into the breed. In 1993, the first breed club, the Club Nacional del Perro Andaluz Ratonero Bodeguero, was formed, and a breed standard was written. In 2000 the breed was recognised as a native Spanish breed by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, although it is not yet recognised internationally by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale.Breed Club, Germany The breed is recognised by numerous minor kennel clubs - such as the Nordic Kennel Union - and dog registries, especially in North America. As some of these groups require little to no verification before registering dogs as being of a certain breed, puppy buyers should research their dog's pedigree to make sure it is from Spain and not one of the many similar breeds of dogs derived from fox terriers. Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz puppies  Health  No diseases specific to this breed, or claims of extraordinary health, have been documented for the Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz, though an undescended testicle is not uncommon in male pups.  Similar breeds  Breeds similar in appearance to (but not the same as) the Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz include the Jack Russell Terrier, the Parson Russell Terrier, and the Rat Terrier. Differences and similarities between the Terrier Brasileiro and the Japanese Terrier are detailed on the breed club's website.Articles (in Spanish) The breed has been compared with other ratting dog breeds that originated in Spain, namely: Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz; Ratonero Murciano de Huerta and Ratonero Valenciano. Their traits, intelligence, trainability, sociability, and behavior are all similar, but they differ only in size, color and conformation.

Geography Jimtown is located in Roaring Creek District of Randolph County on present day County Route 151 (formerly U.S. Route 33), about seven miles west of Elkins, West Virginia. History Jimtown was formerly known as Fair Hope for the one-room school (late 1800s ‚Äì c. 1952) which was located at the present-day intersection of Fair Hope, Findley, and Yeager roads. It was named for James Jefferson \\"Squire Jim\\" Phillips (1855‚Äì1937), a farmer who served as a justice of the peace for Roaring Creek District and whose family owned a majority of the land that now encompasses the community. Community Jimtown is served by the Norton- Harding-Jimtown Public Service District, which provides water services to the area. Major roads include County Route 151, which bisects the community, and Jimtown Road, which connects Jimtown to nearby Coalton. Phillips Chapel Church The Phillips Chapel United Methodist Church is the center of the community. The congregation was organized in the early 1940s by Rev. Meade Gutshall and local families. Services were held outdoors, weather permitting. A church was finally constructed in 1951 with the help of many residents of the community who pulled together the funds and their own labor to complete the building. The land on which the church stands was sold to the congregation by the Midland Corporation, aka the West Virginia Coal and Coke Company, for the sum of $1.00 in 1945. Many family reunions and civic groups utilize the church's adjacent park and pavilion. =Church Bell= On September 22, 2007, the school house bell from the old Norton Grade School in Norton, West Virginia, was placed in the steeple at Phillips Chapel. The number 28 C.S. Bell Company steel alloy bell, cast on July 8, 1921, was purchased for the school around 1929 by the West Virginia Coal and Coke Company, the same company which donated the land for the church. Phillips Cemetery The Phillips Cemetery was established by the Moses J. Phillips family around the 1870s as a burial ground for the poor and indigent. Civil War veteran, farmer, and coal miner Moses J. Phillips served as a county Overseer of the Poor from 1872 through 1877. The oldest known grave is that of War of 1812 veteran Dudley A. Gibson, which dates back to the year of 1873. Both Union and Confederate veterans of the Civil War are buried there. Many Phillips family descendants, as well as residents of Jimtown, are also resting there. Residents Many descendants of town's founders still reside in Jimtown or find themselves connected to the community through family ties, including members of the Broschart, Elmore, Harlan, Miller, and Phillips families, who either reside in Jimtown or participate in their yearly reunions at the Phillips Chapel park and pavilion.

Early life and career John Gregg was born in Lawrence County, Alabama, to Nathan Gregg and Sarah Pearsall Camp. He graduated from LaGrange College (now the University of North Alabama) in 1847, where he was subsequently employed as a professor of mathematics. He later studied law in Tuscumbia, Alabama. Gregg relocated to Freestone County, Texas, in 1852 and settled in the town of Fairfield, Texas. He was elected as a district judge and served in that position from 1855 until 1860. In 1858, Gregg married Mary Francis Garth from Alabama, daughter of Jesse Winston Garth, a Unionist who was willing to give up his hundreds of slaves if it meant saving the Union. Gregg was one of the founders of the Freestone County Pioneer, the first newspaper in Freestone County. He used his paper and political clout to call for a secession convention following the election of Abraham Lincoln as president in 1860. Gregg served as a delegate to the Texas Secession Convention in Austin, in January 1861. The delegation issued the Ordinance of Secession on February 1, 1861. Gregg was one of six members of the convention that were elected to represent Texas in the Provisional Confederate Congress in Montgomery, Alabama, and later in Richmond, Virginia.

Gregg's 10th Brigade was then assigned to the 3rd District of the Department of Mississippi & Eastern Louisiana from March to May 1863. His command, now styled Gregg's Brigade, was attached to William H. T. Walker's Division in the Department of the West on May 10, 1863. Gregg's first major action in Mississippi came at the Battle of Raymond, on May 12, 1863, where his 3000-man brigade fought a tough 6-hour battle against the XVII Corps, 10,000 strong, under the command of Union Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson. Gregg was forced to retreat back to Jackson, Mississippi after the battle, where he would be involved in the Battle of Jackson on May 14, 1863. Gregg's Brigade formed part of the Reserve Corps of the Army of Tennessee briefly that September. During the Battle of Chickamauga he was assigned to Bushrod Johnson's Division, Third Corps in the Army of Tennessee on September 19. Gregg was severely wounded on September 20, when he was hit in the neck. After recovering from his wounds, Gregg was given command of the famous Hood's Texas Brigade in Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Gregg and his brigade participated in the Eastern Campaigns of the spring of 1864, seeing action at the Battle of the Wilderness, the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, the Battle of Cold Harbor, and the Siege of Petersburg.

Whitehead‚Äôs partner was Mel Johnson. Whitehead stood in all three Test matches in that series against India. In the third match, at Melbourne, India won by 59 runs, in spite of nearly forfeiting the match. Whitehead gave the Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar out LBW at a critical point in the match, but the batsman indicated he had edged the ball and reluctantly started to leave the field. Gavaskar urged his partner Chetan Chauhan to follow him. The Indian team manager intervened before Chauhan had left the field, ordering him to continue, and the match resumed. Wisden (1982 ed.) described the event as ‚Äúa dreadful scene‚Äù, saying that ‚Äúsuch a bizarre incident ‚Ä¶ brought controversy over the umpiring to a head‚Äù. Gavaskar later claimed he ordered Chauhan to join him in leaving the field in response to a racist remark made by Lillee, but there was no evidence to suggest this was true. Whitehead‚Äôs last Test match was between Australia and England at Melbourne on 26 December to 30 December 1982, a remarkable match won by England by 3 runs only after a valiant 10th wicket partnership of 70 runs between Allan Border and Jeff Thomson was ended by a juggled catch.

In June 2020, a man was bitten by an Eastern Diamondback rattlesnake in Palisades Interstate Park in New Jersey. This is the farthest known reach of the snake to date. The species was confirmed by a photo that the man took right before he was bit. Conservation status This snake species is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List (v3.1, 2001). Species are listed as such owing to their wide distribution or presumed large population, or because they are unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. The population trend was down when assessed in 2007. In North Carolina, the eastern diamondback rattlesnake is protected by state law and considered endangered within the state.Hubbs, Brian; O'Connor, Brendan (2012).

Habitat The eastern diamondback rattlesnake inhabits upland dry pine forest, pine and palmetto flatwoods, sandhills and coastal maritime hammocks, longleaf pine/turkey oak habitats, grass-sedge marshes and swamp forest, cypress swamps, mesic hammocks, sandy mixed woodlands, xeric hammocks, and salt marshes, as well as wet prairies during dry periods. In many areas, it seems to use burrows made by gophers and gopher tortoises during the summer and winter. Behavior Eastern diamondback rattlesnake The eastern diamondback rattlesnake frequently shelters by tunneling in gopher and tortoise burrows, emerging in the early morning or afternoon to bask.Mehrtens JM (1987). Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. . Like most rattlesnakes, this species is terrestrial and not adept at climbing. However, it has on occasion been reported in bushes and trees, apparently in search of prey. Even large specimens have been spotted as high as above the ground. It is also known to be an excellent swimmer. Specimens have often been spotted crossing stretches of water between barrier islands and the mainland off the Georgia coast, in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Florida Keys, sometimes miles from land. Individual disposition varies, with some allowing close approach while remaining silent, and others starting to rattle at a distance of . The rattle is well developed and can be heard from relatively far away. When threatened, it raises the anterior half of the body off the ground in an S-shaped coil, and can strike to a distance of at least a third of its body length.Ashton RE Jr, Sawyer-Ashton P (1981). Handbooks of Reptiles and Amphibians of Florida, Part 1, The Snakes. Miami, Florida: Windward Publishing Inc. 176 pp. LCCCN 81-51066. . Many will stand their ground and may strike repeatedly, but if given the opportunity, they will usually retreat while facing the intruder and moving backwards towards shelter, after which they disappear. One popular myth is that the eastern diamondback rattlesnake must rattle before striking. To the contrary, it is quite capable of striking while remaining completely silent.Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake at Florida Museum of Natural History. Accessed 2 July 2008. Hawks, eagles, and other snakes have been known to prey upon young and adolescent specimens of the eastern diamondback rattlesnake. Feeding The eastern diamondback rattlesnake forages actively or lies in ambush for small mammals, especially rabbits and rice rats (Oryzomys). The diet also includes birds. Prey is struck and released, after which the snake follows the scent trail left by the dying prey. Because of their large size, adults have no problem eating prey as large as fully grown cottontail rabbits. As the juveniles are capable of swallowing adult mice, they do not often resort to eating slimmer prey, such as lizards. In fact, eastern cottontails and marsh rabbits (Sylvilagus) form the bulk of the diet in most parts of Florida. Squirrels, rats, and mice are also eaten, along with birds such as towhees and bobwhite quail. Other prey that have been reported include a king rail, a young wild turkey, and a mother woodpecker along with four of her eggs. It also eats large insects. Reproduction Rattlesnakes, including the eastern diamondback, are ovoviviparous. Gestation lasts six or seven months and broods average about a dozen young. However, the young only stay with the mother 10‚Äì20 days before they set off on their own to hunt and find cover. Females give birth to between 7 and 21 young at a time, usually between July and early October. Neonates are in lengthBehler JL, King FW (1979).

Knopf. 743 pp. LCCCN 79-2217. . and are similar in appearance to the adults, except for having only a small button instead of a rattle on the tip of their tails. Captivity The eastern diamondback can live beyond 20 years, but life expectancy in the wild is now typically shorter because of hunting and human expansion. In the Universeum science center, Gothenburg, Sweden Adult wild-caught specimens are often difficult to maintain in captivity, but captive-born individuals do quite well and feed readily on killed laboratory rodents. The eastern diamondback requires a dry and well- ventilated cage with a hide-box, maintained at a temperature of for normal activity. Venom An eastern diamondback rattlesnake showing one of its venomous fangs, Louisville Zoo, Louisville, KY The eastern diamondback rattlesnake has the reputation of being the most dangerous venomous snake in North America. While not usually aggressive, it is large and powerful. Wright and Wright mentioned a mortality rate of 30%, but other studies show a mortality rate of 10‚Äì20% (untreated).Clinical Resource Center (Crotalus adamanteus) In proportion to its length, it has the longest fangs of any rattlesnake species, with calculations leading one to expect an specimen would have fangs with a total length of over . For comparison, a specimen had fangs measuring in length. It has a very high venom yield, an average of 400‚Äì450 mg, with a maximum of 858‚Äì1,000 mg.Norris R (2004). \\"Venom Poisoning in North American Reptiles\\". In: Campbell JA, Lamar WW (2004). The Venomous Reptiles of the Western Hemisphere. Ithaca and London: Comstock Publishing Associates. 870 pp. 1,500 plates. . Brown gives an average venom yield of 410 mg (dried venom), along with values of 1.3‚Äì2.4 mg/kg IV, 1.7‚Äì3.0 mg/kg IP and 14.5‚Äì10 mg/kg SC for toxicity.Brown JH (1973). Toxicology and Pharmacology of Venoms from Poisonous Snakes. Springfield, Illinois: Charles C. Thomas. 184 pp. LCCCN 73-229. . The estimated human lethal dose is 100‚Äì150 mg. The venom contains a thrombin-like enzyme, \\"crotalase\\", capable of clotting fibrinogen, leading to the secondary activation of plasminogen from endothelial cells. Although the venom does not activate platelets, the production of fibrin strands can result in a reduced platelet count, as well as the hemolysis of red blood cells. Even with this defibrination, however, clinically significant bleeding is uncommon.Hasiba et al., 1975. Nevertheless, the venom does exhibit high hemorrhagic activity.Minton, 1974. It also contains a low-molecular-weight basic peptide that impedes neuromuscular transmissionLee, 1972. and can in theory lead to cardiac failure. This peptide is similar to crotamine from C. durrisus terrificus, and makes up 2‚Äì8% of the protein found in the venom. In general, the venom can be described as highly necrotizing, mildly proteolytic and containing a large phosphodiesterase fraction. It stimulates the release of bradykinin that can result in severe pain, as well as profound, transient hypotension. Klauber described one case in which the symptoms included instant pain \\"like two hot hypodermic needles\\", spontaneous bleeding from the bite site, intense internal pain, bleeding from the mouth, hypotension, a weak pulse, swelling and discoloration of the affected limb, and associated severe pain. The symptoms were further described as strongly hemolytic and hemorrhagic. CroFab and Wyeth's ACP are effective antivenoms against bites from this species, although massive doses may be needed to manage severe cases of envenomation. Generally, ACP is very effective at countering the defibrination syndrome that is often seen, but may do little for low platelet counts. Wyeth's ACP is no longer being manufactured.

It tells the story of a couple's courtship and marriage, and their subsequent descent into poverty and violence as the result of jealousy and greed. The book was the basis for the films McTeague (1916) and Erich von Stroheim's Greed (1924). It was also adapted as an opera by William Bolcom in 1992. Plot summary McTeague is a dentist of limited intellect from a poor miner's family, who has opened a dentist shop on Polk Street in San Francisco (his first name is never revealed; other characters in the novel call him simply \\"Mac.\\"). His best friend, Marcus Schouler, brings his cousin, Trina Sieppe, whom he is courting, to McTeague's parlor for dental work. McTeague becomes infatuated with Trina while working on her teeth, and Marcus graciously steps aside. McTeague successfully woos Trina. Shortly after the two have kissed and declared their love for each other, Trina discovers that she has won $5,000 from a lottery ticket. In the ensuing celebration Trina's mother, Mrs. Sieppe, announces that McTeague and Trina are to marry. Marcus becomes jealous of McTeague, and claims that he has been cheated out of money that would have been rightfully his if he had married Trina. The marriage takes place, and Mrs. Sieppe, along with the rest of Trina's family, move away from San Francisco, leaving her alone with McTeague. Trina proves to be a parsimonious wife; she refuses to touch the principal of her $5,000, which she invests with her uncle. She insists that she and McTeague must live on the earnings from McTeague's dental practice, the small income from the $5,000 investment, and the bit of money she earns from carving small wooden figures of Noah's animals and his Ark for sale in her uncle's shop. Secretly, she accumulates penny-pinched savings in a locked trunk. Though the couple are happy, the friendship between Marcus and McTeague deteriorates. More than once the two men come to grips; each time McTeague's immense physical strength prevails, and eventually he breaks Marcus's arm in a fight. When Marcus recovers, he goes south, intending to become a rancher; before he leaves, he visits the McTeagues, and he and McTeague part apparently as friends. Catastrophe strikes when McTeague is debarred from practicing dentistry by the authorities. It becomes clear that before leaving, Marcus has taken revenge on Mac by informing city hall that he has no license or academic degree. McTeague loses his practice and the couple are forced to move into successively poorer quarters, as Trina becomes more and more miserly. Their life together deteriorates, with McTeague escalating in his abuse, until he steals all of Trina's domestic savings (amounting to $400 or roughly $10,000 in 2010 values) and abandons her. Meanwhile, Trina falls completely under the spell of money and withdraws the principal of her prior winnings in gold from her uncle's firm so she can admire and handle the coins in her room, at one point spreading them over her bed and rolling around in them. When McTeague returns, destitute once more, Trina refuses to give him money even for food. McTeague beats her to death. He takes the entire hoard of gold and heads out to a mining community that he had left years before. Sensing pursuit, he makes his way south towards Mexico. Meanwhile, Marcus hears of the murder and joins the hunt for McTeague, finally catching him in Death Valley. In the middle of the desert, Marcus and McTeague fight over McTeague's remaining water and, when that runs out, over Trina's $5,000. McTeague kills Marcus, but as he dies, Marcus handcuffs himself to McTeague. The final, dramatic image of the novel is one of McTeague stranded, alone and helpless. He is left with only the company of Marcus's corpse, to whom he is handcuffed, in the desolate, arid waste of Death Valley. Original murder case For details of the murder which inspired Norris to write the novel, see Greed. Adaptations Fania Marinoff and Holbrook Blinn in Life's Whirlpool (1916) * A 1916 film adaptation titled Life's Whirlpool (also known as McTeague) starred Holbrook Blinn and Fania Marinoff. No copies of this film are known to exist. * Greed, Erich von Stroheim's film version of McTeague, was made in 1924. In its original form, it lasted approximately eight hours but was cut drastically by the studio, MGM, and most of the excised footage has been lost. * Karen Kearns produced a radio drama version of McTeague in 1989, under a fellowship for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The program featured Stacy Keach, Carol Kane, Hector Elizondo, JoBeth Williams, Michael York, Katherine Helman, Ed Asner, Joe Spano, and many other well-known actors. * McTeague was the basis of an opera of the same name by composer William Bolcom and librettist Arnold Weinstein, which premiered on October 31, 1992. * Slow Burn is a 2000 drama film directed by Christian Ford and starring Minnie Driver, James Spader, Stuart Wilson, and Josh Brolin. It is a very loose adaptation of the 1899 novel McTeague by Frank Norris.

He thought that a pipe organ should be able to imitate the instruments of an orchestra, and that the console should be detachable from the organ.Biography at American Theatre Organ Society website Early life Jones was born in Hooton, The Wirral, Cheshire, to William and Agnes Hope-Jones. He was one of nine children. His younger brother was the horologist Frank Hope-Jones. He started learning the organ at an early age, and by the age of nine, he was playing for occasional services at St Mary's Church, Eastham. When fifteen he became voluntary organist and choir-master to the Birkenhead School Chapel. Two or three years later he simultaneously held a similar office at St Luke's Church, Tranmere, where he trained a boy choir that became widely celebrated. For this church he bought and set up a fine organ. He subsequently served as churchwarden and was active in many other church offices. He erected an organ in the Claughton Music Hall and organized and conducted oratorio performances in aid of various church funds, training a large voluntary chorus and orchestra for the purpose. For psalms, whose verses are arranged in groups of three, he wrote what he called \\"triple chants\\", a form of composition later adopted by other church writers; he also composed canticles, kyries and other music for the services of the church. He became choirmaster and honorary organist of St John's Church, Birkenhead, doing similar work in connection with that institution. It was at this church and in connection with this organ that Hope-Jones did his first great work in connection with organ-building. The improved electric action, movable console and many other matters destined to startle the organ world, were devised and made by him there, after the day's business and the evening's choir rehearsals. He had voluntary help from choirmen and boys, who worked far into the night, certain of these men and boys later occupying positions with the Hope-Jones Organ Company. As a child, he was sickly and was privately tutored. He was sent to the South of France annually to improve his health. After his father's death, when he was about fourteen, he attended Birkenhead School for a couple of years. After school, he was apprenticed to Laird's Shipbuilders in Birkenhead. After going through practical training in the various workshops and the drawing office, he then secured appointment as chief electrician of the Lancashire and Cheshire (afterwards the National) Telephone Company.George Laing Miller (1913) The Recent Revolution in Organ Building, Charles Francis Press, New York In connection with telephony he invented a multitude of improvements, some of which were later in universal use. About this time he devised a method for increasing the power of the human voice, through the application of a relay furnished with compressed air. The principle was later utilized in phonographs and other voice-producing machines. He also invented the diaphone, later used by the Canadian Government for its fog signal stations and, in a modified form, also adapted to the church organ. About 1889, he resigned from the telephone company to devote himself to improving the church organ, a subject which had occupied much of his spare time for years. At first Hope-Jones licensed a score of organ- builders to carry out his inventions, but as this proved unsatisfactory, he entered the field as an organ-builder himself, being supported by Thomas Threlfall, chairman of the Royal Academy of Music; J. Martin White, Member of Parliament, and other friends. By 1890, Hope-Jones had set himself up in business to build electric organs. When he became a rival and a competitor to those who had previously profited from his inventions, they became hostile and abusive. For nearly twenty years he met concerted opposition ‚Äì attacks in turn against his electrical knowledge, musical taste, voicing ability, financial standing, and personal character. Hope-Jones built more than 100 church organs in the United Kingdom before emigrating to the United States.\\"Tribute to the musical daddy of them all\\" (4 Jan 2002) Liverpool Echo His very sudden removal to the United States was to avoid prosecution when his partner, Eustace Ingram, discovered him in flagrante delicto at the Hereford factory with a boy.David H. Fox, Robert Hope-Jones. Richmond, Virginia: Organ Historical Society (1992), 42 Opposition and sabotage In the year 1895, what was practically the first Hope-Jones electric organ sold was set up in St George's Church, Hanover Square, London. The furor it created was cut short by a fire, which destroyed the organ and damaged the tower of the church. With curious promptitude, attention was directed to \\"the danger of allowing amateurs to make crude efforts at organ-building in valuable and historic churches, and to the great risk of electric actions\\". Arson being more than suspected, the authorities of the church ordered from Hope-Jones a similar organ to take the place of the one destroyed. About the same time, a gimlet was forced through the electric cable of a Hope-Jones organ at St Mary's Church, Hendon, London.\\"Hendon Parish Organ\\" (5 October 1894) Middlesex Courier Shortly afterwards the cable connecting the console with the Hope-Jones organ at Ormskirk Parish Church, Lancashire, was cut through. At St Modwen's, Burton upon Trent, sample pipes from each of his special stops were stolen. At the Auditorium, Ocean Grove, New Jersey, an effort was made to cripple the new Hope-Jones organ, shortly before one of the opening recitals in 1908. In the same year, on the Sunday previous to Edwin Lemare's recital on the Hope-Jones organ in the First Universalist Church, Rochester, New York, serious damage was done to some of the pipes in almost each stop in the organ. Organbuilding innovations His organ at St John's Church, Birkenhead, became famous. It was visited by thousands of music lovers from all parts of the world. Organs built on the St John's model were ordered for the United States (Taunton, Mass., and Baltimore, Maryland), for India, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, France, Germany, Malta, and for numbers of English cathedrals, churches, town halls, etc. Nothing whatever was spent on advertisement. The English musical press for years devoted columns to somewhat heated discussion of Hope-Jones' epoch-making inventions, and echoes appeared in the musical periodicals of the US and other countries. Among his innovations in the field of organ design were improvements to electro- pneumatic action and the invention of such stops as the Diaphone and the modern Tibia Clausa with its strong 8‚Ä≤ flute tone. The Tibia eventually became a staple of theatre organs. The thunderous 32‚Ä≤ Diaphone was less successful, but made an impression on audiences of the era. Hope-Jones organs were also noted for such innovations as stoptabs instead of drawknobs, and very high wind pressures of 10‚Ä≥-50‚Ä≥ to imitate orchestral instruments. He used expression liberally, sometimes enclosing the entire organ behind thick swell shades for great expressive power. He also used a system of unification which multiplied considerably the number of stops relative to the number of ranks. United States Wurlitzer Hope-Jones Unit Orchestra plate, Nethercutt Collection In the spring of 1903, Hope-Jones visited the United States. At the instigation of R. P. Elliot, the organizer, vice-president and secretary of the Austin Organ Company of Hartford, Conn., Hope-Jones decided to remain in the US and join that corporation, taking the office of vice-president. Subsequently a new firm, Hope-Jones & Harrison, was tentatively formed in Bloomfield, New Jersey, in July 1904; but as sufficient capital could not be obtained, in 1905 Hope-Jones and his corps of skilled employees joined the Ernest M. Skinner Company, of Boston, Hope-Jones taking the office of vice- president. Working in connection with the Skinner Company, Hope-Jones constructed and placed a fine organ in Park Church, Elmira, New York, erected in memory of Thomas K. Beecher. He there met Jervis Langdon, treasurer of the Elmira Chamber of Commerce, who secured the industry for his city by organizing a corporation to build exclusively Hope-Jones organs. This \\"Hope- Jones Organ Company\\" was established in February 1907, the year of a financial panic. It failed to secure the capital it sought and was seriously embarrassed throughout its three years' existence. It built about forty organs, the best known being the one erected in the great auditorium at Ocean Grove, New Jersey. In early 1908, Hope-Jones was arrested upon complaint of the mother of a boy, age 15, who worked at the organ factory and was molested.Elimira Star Gazette (27 Apr. 1908): 7. Hope-Jones subsequently paid the $500 fine with company money which deterred future investment and led to the firm's demise.David H. Fox, Robert Hope-Jones. Richmond, Virginia: Organ Historical Society (1992), 88. The patents and plant of the Elmira concern were acquired by the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company in April 1910, and Hope-Jones entered its employ, with headquarters at its mammoth factory at North Tonawanda, New York, continuing to carry on the business under his own name. Hope-Jones was a poor businessman and tended to operate his affairs without regard to profitability. The Wurlitzers took a very dim view of this and eventually forced him to work outside the factory when he became disagreeable. They had him bound by a contract and were fearful of his working for other firms if he was terminated.David H. Fox, Robert Hope-Jones. Richmond, Virginia: Organ Historical Society (1992) He built 246 organs between 1887 and 1911 and his company employed 112 workers at its peak.David H. Fox, Robert Hope-Jones. Richmond, Virginia: Organ Historical Society Marriage In August 1895 in St Nicholas's Church, Leeds, Kent, England, Hope-Jones married Cecil Laurence, a musical member of one of the leading families of Maidstone. Her father was William Laurence, JP of Hollingbourne. Death In 1914, Hope-Jones committed suicide, age 55, by inhaling gas fumes in a hotel in Rochester, New York, some months after leaving the Wurlitzer company. He had written a suicide note stating that he had legal trouble and that a suit was pending. This however was not the case and as a result the coroner declared his death \\"suicide while insane.\\" He is buried in Elmlawn Cemetery, Kenmore, Erie County, New York. He was survived by his wife.\\"Death of Robert Hope-Jones\\" (19 September 1914) Music Trade Review Some have claimed that there were childrenRobert Hope-Jones (great-great-grandson) (2003) \\"Interview with Ed Stout\\", Sierra Chapter, American Theatre Organ Society or least two daughters.\\"Organ Society Told of Builder\\" (26 February 1969) Kittanning Simpson Leader Times, p.15, Kittanning, PA However the 1910 United States Census shows no family members other than the wife. Likewise, the 1903 immigration records show none. Legacy Few Hope-Jones organs have survived to the present time. Probably the largest and most complete example in the UK was the partially restored 1901 organ at Battersea Old Town Hall, now the home of Battersea Arts Centre, but much of the instrument was destroyed in a fire in 2015. The organ at the Great Auditorium in Ocean Grove, New Jersey, built by Hope-Jones in 1908, has most of its original Hope-Jones ranks still intact and playable, although it has been vastly enlarged since then. Another fully preserved Hope Jones organ is his Opus 2 at the First Universalist Church in Rochester, New York, which has been described as sounding \\"weighty and lush\\", with large-scaled 8‚Ä≤ stops. The Anglican Cathedral of St John The Baptist, St John's, Newfoundland is home to the one of only two Hope-Jones organs ever installed in Canada (built in 1904); the organ was rebuilt by Casavant Fr√®res in 1927, however many original components remain. The other Canadian organ was that of Vancouver's Christ Church Cathedral of 1911, replaced by a Casavant in the 1940s. All Saints' Church, Upper Norwood, had an interesting example of a three-manual Hope-Jones organ within a parish church setting, complete with diaphones and Wurlitzer- style console. It was hoped that it might be restored at some point in the future, but the organ has now been dismantled. The historic Hope-Jones 16‚Ä≤ open wood rank complete with chest from All Saints' Church was moved in February 2011 to West Ashling Chapel belonging to The Clock Trust, where it is on public display with many other Hope-Jones pipes from this organ. There is also part of the great organ in Worcester Cathedral in the UK. In recent work, only one Hope-Jones rank of pipes Viol d'Orchestre has been retained. As long ago as the early 1970s, the diaphones, solo division, and orchestral oboe were removed. Hope-Jones was the subject of an episode titled \\"Robert Hope-Jones and his Wurlitzer\\" from the 1990 cable television series Invention! on the Discovery Channel. On 6 June 2014, a scrapbook of newspaper cuttings and letters, which had been the property of Hope-Jones, was donated to the Theatre Organ Heritage Centre of the Lancastrian Theatre Organ Trust in Eccles, Greater Manchester. The 190-page book was compiled by Hope-Jones and his company secretaries, Arthur Speed and Alfred Foxworthy, and contains many annotations by Hope-Jones himself. The book is being indexed by the Trust and it is hoped that a book will be published. The scrapbook has been added to many other Hope-Jones related items in the Heritage Centre.\\"Hope-Jones‚Äôs scrapbook discovered\\" (17 February 2013) Choir & Organ\\"Robert Hope-Jones's Own 1890s Scrapbook Discovered!\\" (1 April 2015) The Tracker References Further reading * Jonathan Ortloff (December 2014) \\"A Magnet for Every Pipe: Robert Hope-Jones, the Invention of Unification, and Its Application in the Theater Organ\\", Journal of American Organbuilding, Vol. 29, No. 4 pp. 8‚Äì15 * \\"Boothby Pagnell Irish evening will support rare church organ fund\\" (3 June 2013) Grantham Journal, Grantham, UK * \\"Farewell to our FRIEND IN THE FOG: As GPS puts an end to our last foghorns, one last nostalgic blast\\" (22 Oct 2010) Daily Mail (Eire Region) p. 15 * \\"Cathedral of All Saints, Episcopal\\" (2006) Organ Atlas, Organ Historical Society, Inc., Richmond External links * Save the Organ * The Lancastrian Theatre Organ Trust * Colin Pykett, Robert Hope-Jones: The evolution of his organ actions in Britain from 1889 to 1903 Category:1859 births Category:1914 deaths Category:People from Cheshire Category:English inventors Category:Organ builders of the United Kingdom Category:Inventors of musical instruments Category:People educated at Birkenhead School Category:English expatriates in the United States Category:Suicides by gas Category:Suicides in New York (state) Category:Wurlitzer Category:Inventors who committed suicide Category:Male suicides Category:Musical instrument manufacturing companies of the United Kingdom ","title":"Robert Hope-Jones"},{"id":"3679513","text":"No Pass No Play is a Texas public education policy that came about as a result of the passage of House Bill 72 by the Texas Legislature in 1984, and became effective in 1985. Under No Pass No Play students must pass all their school courses to be allowed to participate in extracurricular activities such as athletics or music. History An account cited that the root of No Pass No Play policy can be traced back to the beginning of the 20th century when athletics started to become more popular than academics. For decades, the divergence of curricula became controversial and the adverse impact of extracurricular activities to core subjects such as mathematics, history, and reading, among others, became the subject of debate. In 1984, then-Governor Mark White appointed Dallas businessman Ross Perot to lead a commission to study public education reform in Texas. As a result of the study, a sweeping package of educational reforms were proposed to the Texas Legislature, including No Pass No Play. The reforms were ultimately enacted as part of a series of reforms included in House Bill 72, which was passed in 1984 under White's direction, and became effective the following year. The law was finally passed by the second called session of the 68th Texas legislature, and signed by White on July 13, 1984. The rule stipulates that Texas public school students who participate in extracurricular activities must achieve a passing grade (70% or higher, 60% or higher for Advanced Placement (AP), Pre-AP or GT) in order to qualify to continue participating in extracurricular activities such as athletics, band, and orchestra. Progress is assessed following each six-week grading period. If students receive at least one failing grade on their report card, they are ineligible to participate in extracurricular activities until the failing grade(s) reach acceptable levels. No Pass No Play affects all students involved in extracurricular activities in all school districts.  Effect  The rule went into effect between semesters of the 1984‚Äì1985 school year. At the Houston Independent School District, the percentages of failing report card grades for all high school campuses decreased from 16 percent to 13 percent. 23 of the district's 26 high schools had decreases in \\"F\\" grades.Hunt, Dianna. \\"Fewer failing grades since start of no-pass rule.\\" Houston Chronicle. Saturday June 29, 1985. Section 1, Page 22. Retrieved on December 8, 2011. Later studies also revealed that students reported favorable attitudes towards the policy. However, it was found that extracurricular participation of at-risk students have decreased. Versions of No Pass No Play were also enacted in other states. For instance, Arizona imposed a policy that required a passing grade in every class while California adopted a 2.0 or C average requirement while allowing local districts to impose higher restrictions. In popular culture The animated sitcom King of the Hill, which is set in Texas, deals with the policy in its 2000 episode \\"Peggy Makes the Big Leagues.\\" See also *Texas Education Agency References External links *Texas State Library and Archives Category:Public education in Texas ","title":"No Pass No Play"},{"id":"3679526","title":"Oxford Archaeology"},{"id":"3679533","text":"Terry St Clair in Covent Garden, March 2008 Terry St Clair (born Terry Sharrott, 1951, Burslem, Staffordshire, England) is a British folk musician, guitarist and composer. Terry St. Clair is a trustee and director of the Covent Garden Area Trust.  Background  As a child St Clair demonstrated his desire to become a musician. He would try to play anything that could produce a tune. He grew up alongside his elder brother Ian Sharrott, who was also interested in music, but who chose to pursue a career in computers. St Clair and his family moved to Hinckley, Leicestershire in 1953. His parents encouraged his love of music, arranging for piano lessons at the age of nine. He also practised his singing skills as a member of the local church choir, where he also played the church organ. He was educated at Hinckley Grammar School, and it was at a school concert that he heard older pupil Geoff Richardson (later joining progressive rock group Caravan) performing the folk blues of Bert Jansch and Jackson C. Frank, inspiring St. Clair to take up the guitar. His first guitar was home-made, and hardly stayed in tune. Whilst working at the local printers W. Pickering and Sons. he and friends Pete Thomas and Mervin Wallace took over the running of the Bar W Folk Club in Barwell. Early career After he left school, worked as an apprentice book- binder, enrolling at the Matthew Bolton College in Birmingham. During this five-year period he spent most of his time playing guitar and singing in local folk clubs. St Clair started to write songs during this period. The first being \\"You Don't Need Me\\", written for a friend who used heroin and died in 1993. \\"You Don't Need Me\\" was not recorded until 1994, on Basically. In 1968 St Clair met Toni Savage. Savage was a local folk club organiser and agent. He ran a private press from his workshop in Leicester, where he printed and published material for Spike Milligan among others. Savage supported St Clair's career, and booked him into folk clubs and concerts around the country. St Clair's television debut was on ITV's New Faces on his birthday in 1974, singing one of his own songs, \\"So Many Empty Mornings'\\". That same year he headed south for London and a professional life as a singer-songwriter, playing in wine bars and restaurants. In 1977 St Clair moved back to the Midlands, got married, and had a daughter Anna (born 1978). He also took a job as a sales representative with a record distributor. During this period he formed a folk-rock band called Millstone Bill with old friend Steve Southorn; they played pub and club venues around the Midlands. St Clair was still writing songs and the band performed most of the material. 1980 to present St Clair's marriage broke up in 1980, and he moved back to London, first working as a driving instructor for BSM where in 1981 he met Kim his current partner and Sarah Kim's daughter. St Clair now says he has two daughters ‚Äì Anna and Sarah. Between 1982/84 St Clair travelled extensively around Europe. Initially by hitch-hiking to France, Italy and Greece. St Clairt set up home in North London; by this time being booked to play in Italy, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland as well as all over the UK. Street Theatre became popular and St Clair enjoyed this freedom to perform in towns and cities throughout Europe. It was during this period that he performed alongside comedians such as Eddie Izzard, Sarah Crow and Ann Bryson (then known as the Flaming Hamsters). Not between Two and Five St Clair's first album came out in 1985. Financed by businessman Nelson King; recorded and produced by Bob Lamb at his studio at Kings Heath, Birmingham, it has now sold well in excess of 60,000 copies. Keyboards and arrangement were by Phil Johnstone. St Clair continued to write songs and perform throughout the 1980s, gaining bigger audiences. He played at a Barry Manilow concert at Blenheim Palace, and in 1988 St Clair performed to 5000 people at the Festival of Voices in the Wembley Conference Centre. His second album, From the Little Back Room was released in 1991, having taken eighteen months to record. The production and arrangements using electronic sequencing and samples were all completed by St Clair. In 1994 St Clair recorded Basically... Terry St. Clair, his first completely acoustic album. In 1997 St Clair was approached by an American record label, to record a new album in New York City, although the deal ultimately fell through. At this time st Clair performed in the United States for the first time. St Clair was introduced to music journalist John Tobler by Dave Cousins of the Strawbs. St Clair's next release, Black White was recorded and released on his own label, having been recorded at the Denton Studios in Chiswick. St Clair's composition \\"Different World\\" was used in the soundtrack to the film Iffy; whilst \\"If I Fall in Love with You\\" was in the Mike Binder film, The Upside of Anger (2005), starring Kevin Costner. In January 2011 Terry released his fifth album titled Hard Times and other Riddles. It is a collection of contemporary and traditional folk song. Terry continues to write music and performs throughout the United Kingdom and Europe. In November 2018 Terry St.Clair was nominated as an elected trustee and director of the Covent Garden Area Trust.

Taking strong influence from blues rock, the band consisted of Ben Swank on drums, Johnny Walker on guitar and vocals, and Oliver Henry (formerly of The Greenhornes and who was recruited just before the release of their second album) on sax and guitar. The band produced four albums: Soledad Brothers (2000), Steal Your Soul and Dare Your Spirit to Move (2002), Voice of Treason (2003), and The Hardest Walk (2006). History Taking their name from a trio of convicted members of the Black Panther Party ‚ÄîGeorge Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo, and John Clutchette‚Äî incarcerated at Soledad Prison, the Soledad Brothers formed in 1998 in their hometown of Maumee, Ohio (near Toledo). The band's foundations began with Johnny Walker (Johnny Wirick) joining the punk blues band Henry And June, in which Benjamin \\"Swank\\" Smith was already performing as drummer. Henry and June existed from 1994 until 1996. Wirick continued playing with drummer Doug Walker in the two-piece blues outfit 'Johnny Walker'. The Soledad Brothers began in early 1998 after guitarist/vocalist Johnny Wirick (a.k.a. Johnny Walker) asked drummer Ben Smith (a.k.a. Ben Swank) if he wanted to play a show. When traveling north to Detroit for a few gigs, the duo was approached by Italy Records owner Dave Buick. The label recorded the band, releasing the single \\"Sugar and Spice\\", which attracted Estrus Records. This led to the release of \\"The Gospel According to John\\" single along with a number of others, the success of which prompted Estrus Records to put out the band's first full-length album. The self-titled album was engineered by Jack White of The White Stripes, who also produced their second single. Meg White performs some percussion on this album. While both the Soledad Brothers and the White Stripes were Detroit bands heavily influenced by blues, the relationship between the two was also personal. Ben was Jack's roommate for some period of time, and Johnny played slide guitar on two songs from The White Stripes' debut album, as well as teaching Jack how to play slide. Oliver Henry and Meg White had a long-term relationship while the Soledad Brothers were still together. The band followed up with the 2002 album, Steal Your Soul and Dare Your Spirit to Move. The blues influence is still very prevalent, but also saw the introduction of the heavier '60s and '70s Brit-rock influence. The Soledads' third release came in 2003, Voice of Treason, on Loog Records in the UK. It saw the band expand their sound with some jazz influence, and some strange atmospheric sounds. The bulk of the album still retained their distinctive blues-rock style. Their fourth album The Hardest Walk, released in 2006 on Alive Records in the US and Loog in the UK, transcends the rampant garage blues that had so characterized the band's previous work by taking in a diverse range of influences, from Dr John and Albert Ayler to Syd Barrett and early Neil Young, with some Britpop melodies and soul grooves added. It was announced within weeks of the album's release, however, that the band was breaking up. Upcoming shows were cancelled and the band's final gigs were at the Magic Stick in Detroit and the Southgate House (The birthplace of the Tommy Gun) in Newport, Kentucky.  Post break- up: Cut in the Hill Gang  * Walker is now playing in a band called Cut in the Hill Gang, based in Covington, Kentucky. The band released their debut, a vinyl single on Little Room Record Co. This marks the first release of Little Room Record Co. The tracks on the single are \\"Quixotic Dream\\" and a White Stripes cover, \\"Sugar Never Tasted So Good\\". The single became available February 12, 2008. There were 500 7-inch records pressed on black vinyl. A full-length LP was released by the Little Room Record Co. on May 19, 2009. Henry Oliver reclaimed his real name Brian Olive and released a solo CD for Alive in 2009 self-titled as Brian Olive. Johnny Walker founded the trio All- Seeing Eyes in 2013, who recorded a 45rpm record that was released in 2016 by Cincinnati USA Music Heritage Foundation. Ben Swank became one of the co- founders of Jack White's Third Man Records along with Dirtbombs drummer Ben Blackwell and White himself in 2009.

Most of the inmates were Communists, Social Democrats and other political opponents of Nazism, Jews, Jehovah's Witnesses, Romani, homosexual men and others whom the regime wanted to lock up. In 1936, the Gestapo began running the camp, then called Polizeigef√§ngnis Fuhlsb√ºttel (police prison). Over 700 people were interned in the camp following Kristallnacht in 1938. Fuhlsb√ºttel concentration camp was referred to in common parlance as KolaFu (abbreviated from Konzentrationslager Fuhlsb√ºttel) and became a synonym for oppression and death through hard labor. Fuhlsb√ºttel was often an initial point of incarceration for prisoners who were sent on to other camps such as Buchenwald, Esterwegen, Neuengamme, Ravensbr√ºck or Sachsenhausen. The camp was liberated on 3 May 1945, by which time over 250 people had been murdered there. There is a memorial for the camp nearby. A famous political prisoner held at the camp was First World War veteran - turned pacifist - Kapit√§nleutnant Hellmuth von M√ºcke.

It serves as an important part of the diet of several endangered species, including cloud rats of the genus Phloeomys. Arenga pinnata illustration by Francisco Manuel Blanco from Flora de Filipinas (1880-1883) Uses =Sap= The sap is harvested for commercial use in southeast Asia, yielding a sugar known in India as gur or in Indonesia as gula aren. The sap is collected and made as lahang, a traditional cold sweet drink, and is also fermented into vinegar (Filipino sukang kaong) and palm wine (Filipino tub√¢, Malaysian and Indonesian tuak). Edmund Roberts talks about drinking an alcoholic beverage made in the Cavite area. He described it as a \\"fermented\\" and \\"intoxicating liquor\\". He said that it was \\"the pith furnished with sugar ‚Äì when the liquor was properly boiled down, a farina...and of the inside of its triangular-shaped fruit a sweetbread was made.\\" Sugar (jaggery) is also commonly derived from the fresh sap in Indonesia and the Philippines. These are traditionally prevented from fermenting by placing crushed chili or ginger in the collecting container. The sap is boiled until it reduces to a thick syrup which is then dried into a brown sugar. Similar sugar extraction methods are also traditionally used for other sugar palms, like the buri palm (Corypha elata). The raw juice and pulp are caustic. This crop may develop into a major resource of biofuel (ethanol). =Fruit= The immature fruits are widely consumed in the Philippines (called kaong) and Indonesia (called buah kolang-kaling or buah tap) and are made into canned fruits after they are boiled in sugar syrup. =Fibres= The dark fibrous bark (known as doh in India; ijuk in Indonesia; and yumot or cabo negro in the Philippines), is manufactured into cordage, brushes, brooms, thatch roofing, or filters. According to the study on bas-reliefs of Javanese ancient temples such as Borobudur, this type of roof are known in ancient Java vernacular architecture. It can be found today in Balinese temple roof architecture and Minangkabau Rumah Gadang gonjong horn-like curved roof architecture, such as those found in Pagaruyung Palace. =Leaves= The leaves as well as the leaf midribs can be used to weave baskets and marquetry work in furniture. =Starch= In Indonesia, starch can also be extracted from sugar palms and used in place of rice flour in noodles, cakes, and other dishes. Cultural significance In the Philippines, an annual Irok Festival is celebrated in the municipality of Indang in Cavite which is a major producer of kaong fruits, sukang kaong, and tub√¢ in the country. Irok is a local name for Arenga pinnata in the northwestern Philippines.

She was one of the founders and longest serving missionaries of the Baptist Mid- Missions in the CAR. In recognition of her service as a medical missionary and her many other activities in the CAR, Margaret was awarded the French Legion of Honor (1952), the Central African Republic Knight of the Order of Merit (1961), the Distinguished Alumni of the Year of the Women's College of Colorado (1962), and the Anna Eleanor Roosevelt Memorial Award for the Daughters of Hadassah (1962). Childhood and early adulthood Born Margaret Suzanne Nicholl in Englewood, Colorado to a Finnish Lutheran mother and an Irish Episcopalian father, Margaret was baptized in the Lutheran Church three days after birth. She attended Colorado Women's College in Denver, Colorado, where she joined the Bible class of one of her teachers, Miss Jessie Robbins. On 16 September 1917, she entered Moody Bible School, from which she graduated in on 7 August 1919. She then returned to Denver to study to be a nurse in order to qualify as a medical missionary. Although offered a salary by several evangelical missionary societies, she was inspired by the example of Hudson Taylor, founder of the China Inland Mission, to become a faith missionary, with no regular income. With the initial financial support of the Hoover family of her church in Englewood, Colorado, Margaret decided to join Reverend William Haas who was organizing a Baptist Mid-Missions missionary group to start work in the French colony of Ubangi-Shari. First years in Ubangi- Shari After briefly studying French in Paris, she traveled to Ubangi-Shari and arrived in the town of Fort-Sibut in 1922, where she joined Baptist Mid- Mission missionary Rosenau. After studying the Sango language at Fort-Sibut for only four months, she was asked by the director of the mission, Mr. Haas, to move to the town of Bangassou in southeastern CAR to run a French school which the French colonial administration wanted to have opened there. In Bonjanou she came to know another missionary named Guy Laird, a widower with a young son named Lawrence. Although initially reluctant to marry a man who had already had another wife, she soon overcame these reservations and married Guy Laird in 1924. In 1925 Margaret gave birth to Eleanor Louise, who died only four months later. In 1927, while on furlough in Englewood, Colorado, Margaret gave birth to her first daughter, Arlene, and in 1928, two weeks after returning to Fort-Sibut in Ubangi-Shari, she gave birth to a second daughter, Marian. Working as a nurse at Ippy In 1928, Fort-Sibut‚Äôs local French administrator F√©lix √âbou√© asked the Lairds to open a mission station among the Banda people of central Ubangi-Shari at a town called Ippy in Ouaka Region. The French wanted the Lairds to help gain the trust of the Banda in this region where diamonds and gold had been found and was beginning to be exploited. So the Lairds moved to Ippy where Margaret worked as a nurse until 1964. The dispensary she helped establish at Ippy became an important medical center for the whole region. She described her life as a missionary in the CAR in a book entitled They Called Me Mama (1975). Working on Sango materials Margaret Laird contributed significantly to the preparation of the Bible in the Sango language. References * Davis, Rebecca.

His career began in the earliest days of U.S. commercial aviation; his determined, scrappy, risk-taking nature paid off for Continental Airlines, the company that would for 45 years be forged in his image. Owing in large part to the foundation he laid, Continental became one of the largest and most profitable legacy airlines in the world. Six was one of the last of the group of innovators, pioneers, and visionaries (including Juan Trippe, William A. Patterson, Jack Frye, C.R. Smith, and Eddie Rickenbacker) who built the airline industry into what it is today. Six saw his own airline grow from a tiny, three-stop operation into a major global network airline with services spanning the U.S. and Canada, extending to Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and Latin America. Early years Born in Stockton, California, He graduated from Weber Grammar School. At age 17 he dropped out of high school. Robert Six started his business career in sales for a public utility company, but was fired for taking flying lessons on company time. Six learned to fly in an Alexander Eaglerock biplane with an OX-5 engine. After about 10 hours aloft, he received pilot's license (number 5772) in 1929, at the age of 22. In that same year, he bought an OX-5-powered Travel Air biplane from Walter Beech, founded the Valley Flying Service, and proceeded to sell scenic rides to passengers, and to race on weekends. Though many credit Six with being the founder of Continental Airlines, the airline's history dates to 1934 when it was operated under the name of Varney Speed Lines by its owners Walter Varney and Louis Mueller. The future international airline had humble beginnings, with Varney operating single-engine Lockheed Vega aircraft between El Paso, Texas, and Pueblo, Colorado, with stops in Albuquerque, Santa Fe, NM, and Las Vegas, NM. Mueller gained control of the carrier in 1936 and sold 40% of the company to Six. In July 1937, Robert Six changed the name of Varney Speed Lines to Continental Airlines and the carrier moved its headquarters to Denver, Colorado, which would become the airline's central hub for the next 55 years. World War II and the postwar years During the 1940s and 1950s, Continental Airlines, led by Six, was able to expand its fleet of aircraft with profits from World War II when it provided air transportation to the military. Continental also performed military aircraft modification work at its Denver maintenance facilities. Six spent some time during the war in the United States Army Air Corps and was involved in planning improved routes to ferry American aircraft to the European theater. Six's work there represented significant improvements over original routes which had seen aircraft losses due to weather. He returned to Continental before the war ended and resumed his leadership role. In 1951 Six met Broadway legend Ethel Merman in a New York city nightclub. Merman, a two- time divorcee, felt enchanted by Six's strong demeanor and common sense. Following a courtship, they married in 1953, and she took a hiatus from her Broadway career and moved to Colorado with him, settling into a 27-room mansion in Cherry Hills Village, Colorado near Denver. There, life with Six became oppressive, and, according to Merman's son, he, his sister and mother and even his elderly grandparents suffered dramatic episodes of emotional and physical violence from a regularly explosive Six, who, behind his back, was called Jumbo and Big Meanie by his stepchildren. Merman found Denver society rural and limited after that of New York. Six and Merman divorced in 1960. In Six's view, Merman had failed him in not becoming a public relations prop for Continental. In 1953 Continental merged with Pioneer Airlines, gaining access to 16 more cities in Texas and New Mexico. This merger allowed Continental Airlines to operate routes between Texas and Colorado/New Mexico, connecting with the line's Denver-Albuquerque-El Paso services. Dramatic expansion and move to Los Angeles By the end of the 1950s, Continental Airlines had seen a broad expansion of its routes. In 1957, it flew for the first time from Chicago to Los Angeles (both nonstop and via Denver), and from Denver and Los Angeles to Kansas City. Continental was one of the first operators of the Boeing 707, taking delivery of its first 707s in spring of 1959. Six, not being satisfied with jet service alone, introduced dramatic service innovations with Continental's 707 operations, which were described as \\"...nothing short of luxurious\\" by the Los Angeles Times, and, \\"...clearly, the finest in the airline industry\\" by the Chicago Tribune. In 1961 in Honolulu, Six married Hollywood star Audrey Meadows of The Honeymooners television fame (Meadows played the role of Alice Kramden). The feisty Meadows was a good match for Six's sometimes stubborn nature. She served effectively as an advisory director on Continental's board, offering many of the suggestions that made Continental's inflight and ground services preeminent. The Sixes were socially prominent in Beverly Hills, where they lived. Meadows' television and acting career afforded the Sixes opportunities for their close relationships with prominent Hollywood stars such as John Wayne, Henry Fonda, James Stewart, and Bob Hope. The couple spent many long weekends at their Lazy 6 Ranch near Montrose, Colorado, where Hollywood stars were frequent guests. In 1963, Continental moved its headquarters from Denver to Los Angeles. This change coincided with rapid growth of the carrier's route network. Continental added all-jet service from Los Angeles to Houston (both nonstop and with services via Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso, Midland/Odessa, Austin, and San Antonio), and from Denver and to Seattle, Portland, New Orleans, and Houston (both nonstop and with services via Wichita and Tulsa/Oklahoma City). In a separate route award, Continental was selected to serve the route from the Pacific Northwest to San Jose and Ontario, California. The introduction of service from Los Angeles to Honolulu/Hilo was in 1969; Continental's first Boeing 747s arrived in May 1970. McDonnell Douglas DC-10s were added to the fleet in 1971, giving Continental the ability to carry its burgeoning traffic on key routes between Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, Honolulu, Houston, and Seattle. During the Vietnam War, Continental provided cargo and troop transportation for the United States Army and Marine Corps to Asian and Pacific bases. Continental's 707s were the most common nonmilitary aircraft transiting Saigon Tan Son Nhat airport. As a result of Continental's experience in Pacific operations, the carrier formed subsidiary Air Micronesia, picking up island-hopping routes between Yap/Majuro/Saipan/Guam and Honolulu, which were served with Boeing 727 aircraft. One of Six's long- cherished goals was for Continental to become a major player in the Pacific basin, something the airline would achieve only after his retirement. At Six's insistence, Continental (with Pan Am and Trans World Airlines) was a launch airline for the Boeing 747 aircraft. Its upper-deck first-class lounge won awards worldwide for the most refined cabin interior among all airlines, as did meal services developed by Continental's Cordon Bleu-trained executive chefs. Continental's 747 services from Chicago and Denver to Los Angeles and Honolulu set the standard for service in the western U.S. When asked by one Denver customer service agent in 1974 why he flew Continental wherever he could, Hollywood legend Henry Fonda remarked, \\"This operation is class; strictly class!\\" During the 1970s, Continental's 747 service was short-lived, the airline having concluded that the DC-10 was better suited to the route structure and passenger loads. Triumph and loss Robert F. Six, pictured here in 1978 in Los Angeles After the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, like many U.S. carriers, Continental expanded rapidly. Within two years, new nonstop services from its Denver and Houston hubs included: New York (LGA/JFK), Newark, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington (National and Dulles), Cleveland, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, Tampa, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Las Vegas, Reno, San Jose, and San Francisco, as well as many smaller cities in the Midwest and western U.S., and new international routes to London, Tokyo, Manila, Sydney, and Melbourne, and more destinations in Mexico than served by any other carrier. This rapid growth required the expansion of Continental's existing fleet of 747, DC-10, 727-200, and DC-9 aircraft with large numbers of MD-80, 737-model and Airbus aircraft, and the formation of alliances with larger commuter airlines in Houston and Denver to serve smaller communities in the Rockies, Plains, and Southwest. In 1981, Texas Air Corporation, controlled by airline industry entrepreneur Frank Lorenzo, acquired a controlling interest in Continental Airlines following a contentious battle for control with Continental's management, including Six and then-CEO Al Feldman, who were adamant in their resistance to Lorenzo. Continental's labor unions joined the antitakeover battle because of their fears over \\"Lorenzo's deregulation tactics\\" and his prior dealings with airline labor unions. However, Texas Air prevailed, and in June 1982, Texas International merged into Continental Airlines. Texas International ceased to exist, but the new Continental moved its headquarters to Houston, home of Texas Air. In spite of labor friction and turmoil resulting from the acquisition, by the time of Six's death in 1986, the airline he molded and forged had become one of the largest airlines in the U.S. Continental's innovative and popular services centered on the busy Denver, Houston, and New York/Newark hubs. Six died in his sleep at his home in Beverly Hills, California, on October 6, 1986. Legacy and honors In 1971, Six was nominated and inducted into the Colorado Aviation Hall of Fame. In June 1974, Six was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Colorado at Boulder. He was the 1977 recipient of the Tony Jannus Award for his distinguished contributions to commercial aviation. In 1980, he was inducted into the U.S. National Aviation Hall of Fame at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. Six was a key player in the revealed mystery in the third episode of Starlee Kine's Gimlet Media-produced podcast \\"Mystery Show\\". In 2011, United Airlines, which merged with Continental Airlines, named a plane (N77006) after Robert Six.https://www.airplane-pictures.net/photo/1284586/n77006-united- airlines-boeing-777-200er/ References Sources  Category:1907 births Category:1986 deaths Category:American airline chief executives Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:Aviators from California Category:Burials at Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City Category:Businesspeople from California Category:History of aviation Category:National Aviation Hall of Fame inductees Category:People from Stockton, California Category:United Airlines people Category:United States Army Air Forces soldiers Category:20th-century American businesspeople ","title":"Robert Six"},{"id":"3679687","text":"Netherfield can refer to a number of locations in England: *Netherfield, Nottinghamshire *Netherfield, part of Battle, East Sussex *Netherfield, Milton Keynes, a housing estate in Woughton, Buckinghamshire *Netherfield, Kent See also *Kendal Town F.C. were originally called Netherfield AFC *Netherfield is a fictional estate in Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice ","title":"Netherfield"},{"id":"3679688","text":"Antoni Dunin (1907‚Äì1939) was a Polish nobleman (szlachta), a Hrabia (Count), and an army officer who received the Virtuti Militari award. __TOC__  Biography  The Gran√≥wko estate, Dunin's childhood home Dunin was born on June 5, 1907, the youngest child of Lucia (≈Åucja) Taczanowska (1862‚Äì1917) and her second husband Count Rodryg Dunin (1870‚Äì1928).

Act I Paul Aubier and his wife Ang√®le are guests of Georges and Margu√©rite Dum√©nil. Margu√©rite is sceptical of the fidelity of men in marriage, and she persuades Ang√®le to put their husbands to the test. On their instructions, the chambermaid Hortense writes two identical letters which invite Paul and Georges to Stelldichein to an opera ball at the Paris Opera, where they will meet a lady with a pink domino as part of her dress. Secretly, Hortense writes a third such letter for Henri, because she wants to appear also with the pink domino. Act II The setting is the opera ball, where everyone is masked. Beaubuisson and the singer F√©odara are one couple. Of the three ladies with the pink domino, Henri sees the pink domino on Hortense, Georges sees it on Ang√®le, and Paul on Margu√©rite. Georges and Paul hope to meet the mysterious lady each in a chambre s√©par√©e. However, Ang√®le and Margu√©rite have arranged for a bell signal, at whose sound the lovers are to meet outside the rooms. In the confusion, Paul and Georges meet each other, and not the expected lady. Furthermore, they each then see Hortense with the pink domino, not knowing who she is. Each tries to engage the lady, but in the process, Hortense's pink domino is destroyed. Margu√©rite and Ang√®le are both unaware of the presence of Hortense. Act III Back at his residence, Georges discovers the writing paper on which that the invitation to the opera ball was written, and tries to figure out the situation. Things build to the point where Georges challenges Paul to a duel. Finally, Margu√©rite and Ang√®le show their intact pink dominoes, which nominally proves the fidelity of their husbands.

As a Jewish child, Deutsch was prohibited from joining most athletic clubs in Austria so she began her competitive swimming at Hakoah Vienna, a Jewish athletic club where she was soon winning swim meets and setting national records. Deutsch was elected \\"Outstanding Austrian Female Athlete of 1935\\" by the Austrian Sports Authority. In 1936, she was awarded Austria's \\"Golden Badge of Honor\\" as one of the country's top three athletes that year, and selected to represent her country in the 1936 Summer Olympics. Along with fellow swimmers Ruth Langer (1921 ‚Äì 1999) and Lucie Goldner (1918 ‚Äì 2000), she refused to compete at the Berlin Games in protest of Adolf Hitler, stating, \\"I refuse to enter a contest in a land which so shamefully persecutes my people.\\" This angered Austrian sports authorities who banned her from competition. Deutsch in turn emigrated to Palestine, where she became the Israeli national champion. After her leaving Austria, the sporting authorities there stripped her of her titles and expunged her name from the record books.

By the 1960s he was one of the most prominent clergymen in North Carolina, as well as in the Southern Province of the Moravian Church. Spaugh was born in Salem (now Winston-Salem), North Carolina, the eldest of three sons of Rufus Armenius Spaugh (1865-1953) and Anna Louise (Hege) Spaugh (1872-1933). Spaugh graduated from Tinsley Military Institute in Winston-Salem in 1913, and from Moravian College in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in 1916 (he had earned extra credits at Tinsley, enabling him to graduate from college in three years). He earned a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Moravian Theological Seminary in 1924, and a Master of Arts degree from Davidson College in 1931. During World War I Spaugh served in the United States Army. He was stationed at Fort Jackson (South Carolina). Spaugh married Ida Brown Efird (28 November 1893-10 December 1978) in Winston-Salem on 21 April 1920, his mother's forty-eighth birthday. Herbert and Ida had two sons and a daughter: Earle Frederick, Herbert, Jr., and Carolyn. In 1924, Spaugh became the first full-time minister of the Little Church on the Lane in Charlotte, North Carolina. He held that position for forty-two years. He was consecrated a Bishop of the Moravian Church on 27 December 1959 at Charlotte by Bishops John Kenneth Pfohl, Kenneth Gardiner Hamilton, and Carl John Helmich. He was a syndicated newspaper columnist whose work was carried in newspapers across the South. He also served as a trustee of Salem College and Moravian College, and was active in a number of ecumenical and civic organizations. Spaugh died in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Drexel Furniture Co., 259 U.S. 20 (1922), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled the 1919 Child Labor Tax Law unconstitutional as an improper attempt by Congress to penalize employers using child labor. The Court indicated that the tax imposed by the statute was actually a penalty in disguise.. The Court later abandoned the philosophy underlying the Bailey case. For example, see United States v. Kahriger, 345 U.S. 22 (1953), overruled on other grounds, Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39 (1968). Background On February 24, 1919, Congress passed the Child Labor Tax Law which imposed an excise tax of 10 percent on the net profits of a company that employed children. The law defined child labor as ‚Äúunder the age of sixteen in any mine or quarry, and under the age of fourteen in any mill, cannery, workshop, factory, or manufacturing establishment.‚Äù The definition also included the use of children between the ages of fourteen and sixteen who worked more than eight hours a day or more than six days a week, or who worked between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. Drexel was a furniture manufacturing company in North Carolina. On September 21, 1921, a collector from the Bureau of Internal Revenue (now the Internal Revenue Service) assessed $6,312.79 in excise taxes for employing a child under fourteen during the 1919 tax year. Drexel paid the tax under protest and sued for a refund. Procedural history Drexel's main argument was that the tax was an unconstitutional attempt to regulate manufacturing. The United States argued that, the statute, as an indirect tax, did not need to meet a standard as long as it was geographically uniform. In addition, the government contended that the tax was merely an excise tax levied by Congress under its broad power of taxation under Article One of the Constitution. The lower court ruled in favor of the company. Holding Chief Justice Taft's Court declared the tax on child labor was unconstitutional because it was a disguised criminal penalty, not a tax, on employment of children. In addition, the Child Labor Tax Law is a regulation on businesses instead of a tax. Reasoning Taft argued the law describes a set course for businesses and when they deviate from that course, a payment is enacted. Taft said, ‚ÄúScienters are associated with penalties, not with taxes.‚Äù ‚Äú[A] court must be blind not to see that the so-called tax is imposed to stop the employment of children within the age limits prescribed.‚Äù Taft said that the court must commit itself to the highest law of the land and the duty of the court, even though it requires them to refuse legislation designed to promote the highest good. He went on to say that the good sought in unconstitutional legislation leads citizens and legislators down a dangerous path of breaching the constitution and recognized standards. In addition, Congress could take control of many areas of public interest, which the States have control over reserved by the Tenth Amendment, by enacting regulating subjects and enforcing them by a so- called ‚Äútax.‚Äù This would break down the constitutional limitations on Congress and eliminate the sovereignty of States. A tax is a source of revenue for the government, while a penalty is a regulation and punishment for a certain behavior. Implications One possible criticism is that the decision in Drexel was a reversal of the Supreme Court's position on excise taxes since the early 19th century and that this decision is out of line with Supreme Court rulings before and after. As a general rule, the court repeatedly favored the federal power to tax. In other cases, the court has upheld Congress's excise tax on narcotics, marijuana, and firearms. Even with the firearms case, the Court admitted the law was unmistakably a legislative purpose to regulate rather than tax. Despite this reversal of philosophy regarding Congress's ability to regulate through the tax code, the Court's definition of the Child Labor Tax as a penalty due to its characteristics featured prominently in the majority opinion in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, penned by Chief Justice John Roberts in 2012. The opinion holds that the individual mandate at the center of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act does not fulfill any of the characteristics (i.e., the heavy burden of tax for even slight infractions, the requirement of scienter in levying the tax, and the use of the Department of Labor to aid in enforcement) that allowed the Court to consider the Child Labor Tax as outside of Congress‚Äô ‚ÄúPower To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises‚Äù, and therefore, the individual mandate may be considered within that power. Previously, in Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U. S. 251, the Court ruled a law prohibiting the transportation in interstate commerce of goods manufactured with child labor was unconstitutional. After the court rejected both attempts by Congress to regulate child labor, Congress proposed a constitutional amendment which would give the national government the power to regulate and prohibit child labor, without a deadline for ratification by the states. The proposed amendment was never ratified, as it was made unnecessary by state child labor laws, and a later reversal of the Bailey decision after a suit against Section 212 of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which prohibited the transportation of goods in interstate commerce made from \\"oppressive child labor.\\"http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi- bin/usc.cgi?ACTION=RETRIEVE&FILE;=$$xa$$busc29.wais&start;=571916&SIZE;=4418&TYPE;=TEXT Retrieved 2010-03-26.

He was a member of the Yacht Club de France.  Career  Tabarly was born in Nantes on 24 July 1931 to a family of yachting tradition. His parents took him for sailing excursions on their cutter Annie when he was still a baby. In 1938, Tabarly's father purchased the gaff-rigged cutter Pen Duick.Biographie √âric Tabarly, Cit√© de la Voile. Tabarly's cutter, the Pen Duick. Tabarly enlisted in the Navy as a volunteer in 1953 and joined the French A√©ronavale.Taillemite, p.496 He served at Saint-Mandrier airbase before transferring to French airbases in Morocco. After earning his pilot licence and the rank of Second Ma√Ætre de deuxi√®me classe in December 1954, he fought in the First Indochina War, appointed to Tan Son Nhut Air Base. In August 1956, Tabarly started refitting Pen Duick in his spare time. She was in a state of disrepair since the Second World War, during which she had been decommissioned for fear of being requisitioned, and her wooden hull had rotted. Tabarly endeavoured to rebuild her using polyester resin. The conversion was completed, and Pen Duick was launched in April 1958. In September 1957, he was appointed to Lann-Bihou√© airbase, near Lorient. In 1958, Tabarly entered the √âcole Navale; he was promoted to Aspirant the next year, and Enseigne de Vaisseau de deuxieme Classe in 1959. On 16 November 1960, Tabarly embarked on the school cruiser Jeanne d'Arc, for the ritual circumnavigation that is part of the practical teaching at the √âcole Navale. Jeanne d'Arc returned to Brest on 8 June 1961 and the same month, Tabarly was appointed to the Minesweeper Castor with the rank of Enseigne de Vaisseau de Premiere Classe. He was later given command of the landing craft EDIC 9092. Pen Duick II In 1962, Tabarly raced in the Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race on Pen Duick. Determined to win the next edition set for two years later, Tabarly started building the Margilic V, and in autumn 1963, the Pen Duick II. He ran in the 1964 edition and won, with a time of twenty-seven days and three hours. This achievement earned Tabarly instant fame and the rank of Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur. He received the Blue Water Medal for his victory. In 1965, he earned his Commandos Marine certification. The same year, he transformed Pen Duick II into a wishbone schooner. The next year, Pen Duick II was shortened to match the regulations of the Cruising Club of America, and Tabarly single-handedly sailed her to New York. He achieved a 5th position in the Bermuda Race, and raced in the Bermuda-Copenhaguen race, but had to abandon with a ruptured rudder. In October 1966, he was promoted to Lieutenant de Vaisseau. The Ministry of Defence then detached Tabarly to the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, allowing him to concentrate on his racing career. In 1967, Tabarly won the Channel Race, Round Gotland Race, and Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race on Pen Duick III.Eric Tabarly, an inspiration to distance sailors, Sailing World In 1968, Tabarly raced Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race again, on Pen Duick IV, a brand-new trimaran. The new Pen Duick was damaged by Hurricane Brenda on 11 June, and never finished the race. The year after, he won the San Francisco-Tokyo race. Tabarly returned to naval service in February 1971 and appointed to the Technical Inspection for Physical Education and Sports. The same year, he won the Falmouth-Gibraltar and the Middle Sea Race, and the next, the Transpac. In 1973, he sailed in the first edition of the Whitbread. Tabarly was promoted to Lieutenant Commander in 1976. In 1980, Tabarly sailed Paul Ricard for a transatlantic race, beating Charlie Barr's transatlantic record . In June, he joined the Acad√©mie de Marine. Tabarly was promoted to Capitaine de Corvette in 1982. Tabarly retired from active service in July 1985. He was promoted to Capitaine de Fregate of the naval reserves in August 1988. In 1994, he raced the Whitbread again. In 1997, Tabarly won the Fastnet Race on Aquitaine Innovations. In May 1998, celebrations were held in B√©nodet for the centenary of Pen Duick. In June, she sailed to Scotland, but while in transit in the Irish Sea, the night of 12 to 13 June, a spar threw Tabarly overboard and he drowned.

It is a long circular trail around the Beara Peninsula that begins and ends in Glengarriff, County Cork, also passing through parts of County Kerry. It is typically completed in nine days. It is designated as a National Waymarked Trail by the National Trails Office of the Irish Sports Council and is managed by the Beara Tourism and Development Association. History The Beara Tourism and Development Association began work on planning and developing the Beara Way in 1991 with funding from the West Cork County Development Team, Cosp√≥ir and Bord F√°ilte. Construction was carried out by workers on F√ÅS social employment schemes. The completed trail was formally opened by Toddy O'Sullivan, T. D., Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, in June 1996. A major upgrade of the trail was completed in 2009 and involved the construction of 20 bridges, 200 stiles, 15 information boards and 30 plaques. A review of the National Waymarked Trails in 2010 found the Beara Way to be one of the most heavily used of the trails. It recommended that it be one of five National Waymarked Trails that should be prioritised to be upgraded to a National Long Distance Trail, a proposed new standard of trail in Ireland, intended to meet international standards for outstanding trails. Route left Starting at Glengarriff, the Beara Way enters the Glengarriff Woods Nature Reserve and then climbs into the Caha Mountains to an altitude of as it traverses the pass north of Sugarloaf mountain before descending to reach the village of Adrigole. From Adrigole, the trail follows the southern flanks of Hungry Hill and the Slieve Mish Mountains to reach Castletownbere. A spur route makes a circuit of Bere Island, which is connected to Castletownbere by a ferry service. The route from Castletownbere to Allihies is via an old cattle droving path. Copper mining was the main activity in Ahillies for many years and the remains of abandoned mine working dot the landscape. Another circular spur route starts from Allihies and brings the trail to the very tip of the Beara Peninsula where a cable car connects the trail with Dursey Island. From Ahillies, the trail follows a miners' track and climbs the copper-rich crags above the village, crossing a mountain pass to reach Eyeries. A ridge along the coast connects Eyeries with Ardgroom. The trail then crosses into County Kerry to reach Tuosist, via Lauragh. From Tuosist, the Way crosses the northern slopes of Knockagarrane and then passes between Clonee Lough and Lough Inchiquin before crossing a mountain pass. The route diverges here, continuing north to Kenmare or south to Bonane. The final stage returns to Glengarriff via Bonane Heritage Park and Esk mountain. A spur route connects Glengarriff with Kealkill, Gougane Barra and Ballingeary. Intersecting and connecting paths The route forms part of Beara-Breifne Way, a walking and cycling route under development, intended to run from the Beara Peninsuala to Breifne, County Leitrim/County Cavan area, following the line of Donal Cam O'Sullivan Beare's march in the aftermath of the Battle of Kinsale in 1602. The Mealagh Valley Walking Route is a trail linking the Beara Way with the Sheep's Head Way. The Beara Way also forms the start (or end, depending on direction travelled) of European walking route E8 which runs from Dursey Island to Istanbul, Turkey. The E8 joins the Kerry Way via a link route along roads between Bonane and Kenmare.

The semicircular rotor which winds the mainspring is plainly visible. An automatic watch, also known as self-winding watch or simply automatic, is a mechanical watch in which the natural motion of the wearer provides energy to wind the mainspring, making manual winding unnecessary. It is distinguished from a manual watch in that a manual watch, likewise having no internal battery, must have its mainspring wound by hand at regular intervals. Operation In a mechanical watch the watch's gears are turned by a spiral spring called a mainspring. In a manual watch energy is stored in the mainspring by turning a knob, the crown on the side of the watch. Then the energy from the mainspring powers the watch movement until it runs down, requiring the spring to be wound again. A self-winding watch movement has a mechanism which winds the mainspring using the natural motions of the wearer's body. The watch contains an oscillating weight that turns on a pivot. The normal movements of the watch in the user's pocket (for a pocketwatch) or on the user's arm (for a wristwatch) cause the rotor to pivot on its staff, which is attached to a ratcheted winding mechanism. The motion of the watch is thereby translated into circular motion of the weight which, through a series of reverser and reducing gears, eventually winds the mainspring. There are many different designs for modern self-winding mechanisms. Some designs allow winding of the watch to take place while the weight swings in only one direction while other, more advanced, mechanisms have two ratchets and wind the mainspring during both clockwise and anti-clockwise weight motions. The fully wound mainspring in a typical watch can store enough energy reserve for roughly two days, allowing the watch to keep running through the night while stationary. In many cases automatic wristwatches can also be wound manually by turning the crown, so the watch can be kept running when not worn, and in case the wearer's wrist motions are not sufficient to keep it wound automatically. =Preventing overwinding= Self-winding mechanisms continue working even after the mainspring is fully wound up. If a simple mainspring was used, this would put excessive tension on the mainspring. This could break the mainspring, and even if it did not, it can cause a problem called \\"knocking\\" or \\"banking\\". The excessive drive force applied to the watch movement gear train can make the balance wheel rotate with excessive amplitude, causing the impulse pin to hit the back of the pallet fork horns. This will make the watch run fast, and could break the impulse pin. To prevent this, a slipping clutch device is used on the mainspring so it cannot be overwound. =Slipping spring or \\"bridle\\"= The \\"slipping mainspring\\" device was patented by Adrien Philippe, one of the founders of Patek Philippe, on 16 June 1863,Patent No. 58921 long before self-winding wristwatches. In an ordinary watch mainspring barrel, the outer end of the spiral mainspring is attached to the inside of the barrel. In the slipping barrel, the mainspring is attached to a circular steel expansion spring, often called the 'bridle', which presses against the inside wall of the barrel, which has serrations or notches to hold it. Diagram showing operation of slipping mainspring. As long as the mainspring is less than fully wound, the bridle holds the mainspring by friction to the barrel wall, allowing the mainspring to be wound. When the mainspring reaches full wind, its force is stronger than the bridle spring, and further winding pulls the bridle loose from the notches and it simply slides along the wall, preventing the mainspring from being wound further. The bridle must grip the barrel wall with just the right force to allow the mainspring to wind fully but not overwind. If it grips too loosely, the bridle will begin to slip before the mainspring is fully wound, a defect known as 'mainspring creep' which results in a shortened reserve power time. A further advantage of this device is that the mainspring cannot be broken by excessive manual winding. This feature is often described in watch company advertising as an \\"unbreakable mainspring\\". History =Pocket watches= The earliest reference to self-winding watches is at the end of 1773 when a newspaper reported that Joseph Tlustos had invented a watch that did not need to be wound. page 19 But his idea was probably based on the myth of perpetual motion, and it is unlikely that it was a practical solution to the problem of self-winding watches. In 1776 Joseph Gallmayr also stated that he had made a self-winding watch, but there is no evidence to support this claim. The earliest credible evidence for a successful design is the watch made by the Swiss watchmaker Abraham-Louis Perrelet, who lived in Le Locle. In late 1776 or early 1777, he invented a self-winding mechanism for pocket watches using an oscillating weight inside the watch that moved up and down.Watkins, Origins, page 33 The Geneva Society of Arts, reporting on this watch in 1777, stated that 15 minutes walking was necessary to fully wind the watch. In 1777 Abraham-Louis Breguet also became interested in the idea, and his first attempts led him to make a self-winding mechanism with a barrel remontoire.Watkins, Origins, page 120 Although a successful design, it was too complex and expensive for it to be manufactured and sold. About the end of 1777 or early 1778, Hubert Sarton (:fr: Hubert Sarton) designed a watch with a rotor mechanism. Towards the end of 1778 he sent a watch to the French Academy of Sciences and a report was written which, together with a drawing, gave a detailed description of the mechanism.Watkins, Origins, page 57 Sarton's design is similar to those used in modern wrist watches, although there is no evidence linking the 18th-century design to 20th-century developments. About the beginning of 1779, Abraham-Louis Breguet became aware of Perrelet's watches, probably through Louis Recordon, who travelled from Geneva to London via Le Locle and Paris.Watkins, Origins, page 250 Breguet studied and improved the design, and made many self-winding watches from then to about 1810. Although a few self-winding watches and patents for them were made from 1780 on, for more than one hundred years these watches were rare, until the advent of the wrist watch. 1780 drawing of an automatic watch with side weight. From English patent No. 1249 \\"Recordon's Specification\\". Circa 1778 automatic watch with rotor weight. Signed on the dial \\"Mazzi √† Locarno\\". During the years 1776 to 1810 four different types of weight were used: ; Side-weight : The weight pivots at the edge of the movement and can oscillate up and down. The movement of the weight is limited to about 40¬∞. This is the most common design produced by many makers including Breguet.Watkins, Origins, page 120 : These watches were called jerking watches because, even with buffers, when the weight hit the case the whole watch would jerk. ; Center-weight : The weight pivots in the center of the movement and rotates clockwise and anti-clockwise. The weight is supported by a bridge that blocks the rotation and it is limited to about 180¬∞.Watkins, Origins, page 139 A few movements were made by different makers. ; Rotor-weight : Again the weight pivots in the center of the movement and rotates clockwise and anti-clockwise. However, there is no bridge and it can rotate 360¬∞.Watkins, Origins, page 64 Very few of these movements were made. ; Movement-weight : Here the whole movement is pivoted in the case and acts as the weight. Only one example is known, made in 1806.Jean-Claude Sabrier, The Self-Winding Watch, (Paris, 2011, √âditions Cercle D'Art), pages 108-109 As noted above, some watches used bidirectional winding and others used unidirectional winding. The latter is sufficient and all of Breguet's watches used unidirectional winding. Before the invention of the slipping mainspring, automatic watches had a system for locking the weight. Most common, as in the 1780 drawing, when the mainspring was fully wound a lever K was raised that entered a hole N in the weight to prevent it from moving until the mainspring had unwound enough to lower the lever. Different methods were used in side-weight, rotor and center-weight mechanisms. =Wrist watches= The advent of the wrist watch after World War I led to renewed interest in self-winding mechanisms, and all four types listed above were used: *1922: L√©on Leroy, a side-weight system. This was almost certainly derived from Breguet's design. *1923: Harwood, a center-weight system (invented ca 1917). This is discussed below. It is not known if Harwood was influenced by earlier pocket watch designs. *1930: L√©on Hatot, Rolls watch, where the whole movement moves sideways. This was probably an independent re-invention. *1931: Rolex, a rotor system with unidirectional winding. Harwood \\"Bumper\\" wristwatches: 1923 First automatic wristwatch, Harwood, c. 1929 (Deutsches Uhrenmuseum, Inv. 47-3543) Invented by John Harwood, a watch repairer from Bolton, England, who took out a UK patent with his financial backer, Harry Cutts, on 7 July 1923, and obtained a corresponding Swiss patent on 16 October 1923. The Harwood system used a pivoting weight which swung as the wearer moved, winding the mainspring. The ratchet mechanism wound the mainspring only when moving in one direction. The weight did not rotate a full 360¬∞; spring bumpers limited its swing to about 180¬∞, to encourage a back and forth motion. This early type of self-winding mechanism is now referred to as a 'hammer' or 'bumper'. Like its 18th-century counterparts, Harwood's watch also had a problem with jerking because \\"the brass weight hit too sharply against the banking pins as it pivoted\\".Sabrier, The Self-winding Watch, page 249 When fully wound, Harwood's watch would run for 12 hours autonomously. It did not have a conventional stem winder, so the hands were moved manually by rotating a bezel around the face of the watch. The watches were first produced with the help of Swiss watch manufacturer Fortis and went on sale in 1928. 30,000 were made before the Harwood Self-Winding Watch Company collapsed in 1931 in the Great Depression. 'Bumper' watches were the first commercially successful automatic watches; they were made by several high grade watch manufacturers during the 1930s and 1940s. Rolex The Rolex Watch Company improved Harwood's design in 1930 and used it as the basis for the company's Oyster Perpetual, in which the centrally mounted semi-circular weight could rotate through a full 360¬∞ rather than the about 200¬∞ of the 'bumper' winder. Rolex's version also increased the amount of energy stored in the mainspring, allowing it to run autonomously for up to 35 hours. Information about 18th-century rotor watches was not published until 1949. Although the Oyster Perpetual was probably an original invention, the company may have known of Coviot's 1893 patent that re-invented the 18th- century design.Watkins, Origins, page 317 Eterna ball bearing The next development for automatic watches came in 1948 from Eterna Watch. To wind a watch effectively, one of the chief requirements of a rotor is heft. Until this point, the best bearing used in any watch was a jewel bearing, which perfectly suits the small gears of a watch. A rotor, on the other hand, requires a different solution. In 1948, Eterna introduced the solution that is still in use today: ball bearings. Ball bearings provide robust support for a heavy object to rotate smoothly and reliably even under abnormal stress, such as if the watch were dropped. Carl F. Bucherer weighted geared ring By the 1960s, automatic winding had become widespread in quality mechanical watches. Because the rotor weight needed in an automatic watch takes up a lot of space in the case, increasing its thickness, some manufacturers of quality watches, such as Patek Philippe, continue to design manually wound watches, which can be as thin as 1.77 millimeters. However, in 2007 Carl F. Bucherer implemented a new approach without a rotor, a peripherally mounted power source, where a geared ring made of tungsten encircles the entire mechanism, rotating on carbon rollers whenever the watch moves. A system of clutch wheels captures power. No rotor means thinner watches and an ultradense weight swinging around a greater radius means a better chance of achieving a greater power reserve with same amount of arm movement.

Built on the site of the earlier New Meadowbank and Old Meadowbank sports venues, it was originally built to host the 1970 Commonwealth Games. It also hosted the Games in 1986, becoming the first venue to host the Games twice. The stadium has also regularly hosted football. It was the home ground of Scottish Football League team Meadowbank Thistle between 1974 and 1995. From 1996, it hosted senior non-league football as the home ground of Edinburgh City. League football returned to Meadowbank in 2016 following City's promotion to the Scottish Professional Football League. The Meadowbank complex also hosted Leith Athletic, which played on the Meadowbank 3G artificial pitch adjacent to the main stadium since 2013. In the early months of 2019 the sports centre was demolished and work begun on construction of its replacement. Meadowbank Stadium was also used for rugby union as the home venue of Edinburgh Rugby between 2002 and 2004. Layout Before the stadium was closed for redevelopment work in 2017, the capacity of the stadium was 5,000. The stadium consisted of a main grandstand, with uncovered benches around the rest of the running track. It was built on the site of New Meadowbank stadium, while the indoor sports complex and adjacent pitches to the east were built on the site of Old Meadowbank stadium. The stadium itself contained an eight lane, 400 metre running track, with a grass pitch within this. There was also a velodrome adjacent to the site. Underneath the stand was a covered 100 metre, eight-lane track. The stadium contained indoor facilities, including squash and basketball courts. These were also used for antiques fairs, martial arts competitions, conferences, and church meetings. Other outdoor facilities included field hockey pitches. Uses 800px =Commonwealth Games= Meadowbank Stadium was built for the 1970 Commonwealth Games, at a cost of ¬£2.8 million. It was opened by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent on 2 May 1970. The 1970 Games was one of the most successful in the history of the event. The 1986 Commonwealth Games were also held at Meadowbank, which became the first venue to host the Commonwealth Games twice. The 1986 Games suffered a financial deficit and were widely boycotted due to the support of the British Government for the apartheid regime in South Africa. The stadium once had its own railway station which was built for the 1986 Commonwealth Games. =Football= Meadowbank Thistle played at the stadium from 1974 until the club relocated to the new town of Livingston in 1995. Meadowbank is often cited as one of the worst stadiums used in the Scottish Football League due to the lack of atmosphere in the ground. This was caused by the stadium having a capacity of , but Meadowbank typically attracted crowds of less than 1,000. Most fans were located on one side of the ground, while the running track created a great distance between the fans and the pitch. Meadowbank Thistle announced their intention to leave the stadium and relocate to Livingston in 1995, when their lease expired. Their last game as Meadowbank Thistle was played in May 1995, although they continued to play at Meadowbank Stadium as Livingston until their new Almondvale Stadium was ready in November 1995. Edinburgh City moved into the stadium after Meadowbank left and they have since been joined by Leith Athletic (from the East of Scotland League). Hibernian have also played some of their reserve team matches at Meadowbank. =Music= Meadowbank Stadium prior to performance by Radiohead at the 2006 T on the Fringe, taken from the main seating area Meadowbank was used as a 25,000 capacity concert venue during T on the Fringe, an annual music festival. Muse, My Chemical Romance, Snow Patrol, Radiohead, Pixies, Foo Fighters, Nine Inch Nails, Kaiser Chiefs and Razorlight all played the venue between 2005 and 2007. In 2008, T on the Fringe was renamed The Edge Festival and the stadium was no longer used as one of the main venues. In 1989, Simple Minds played Meadowbank on their Street Fighting Years Tour after switching from Murrayfield. The switch was due to the band's passionate anti- apartheid beliefs clashing with the Scottish Rugby Union's decision to play in South Africa at the time. =Rifle= Meadowbank housed both a 10metre airgun range and a 50metre indoor range for smallbore rifle shooting in the 1970s and 1980s. The range was closed in 1990 but refurbished in 2014 ahead of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow for use as a training venue by Scottish Target Shooting's High Performance Squad. The range remained in use until the site's closure in 2017. The new Meadowbank plans do not include facilities for target sports despite Edinburgh athlete Seonaid McIntosh having earned one of TeamGB's first quota places to the 2020 Summer Olympics. =Basketball= Meadowbank stadium had basketball facilities in three of its large halls, but they were only rarely available to the public. Edinburgh Rocks basketball team used one of the large halls until they moved to the Braehead Arena, and were renamed Scottish Rocks. =Track cycling= Meadowbank Stadium Meadowbank velodrome was home to the East of Scotland regional track cycling academy. The 250 metre track made of African timber was built by Schuermann Architects of Germany for the 1986 Commonwealth Games. It was the home track of Chris Hoy and Craig MacLean. Proposals published in December 2013 suggested that the velodrome be sold off for housing to fund the redevelopment of the main stadium. Usage of the track declined over the years - mainly due to the construction of the Commonwealth Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome, which is a track of a much better standard. A local bicycle club, Edinburgh Road Club, continued to hosted some events on the old track until it was finally closed on Saturday 2nd September 2017Meadowbank Celebration as Velodrome Closes its Doors =Rugby= Professional rugby union club Edinburgh Gunners used the venue from 2002 until they moved to Murrayfield Stadium in 2004. =Boxing= The Meadowbank Stadium was used for many boxing events, Hall 1 was the location for fighters including Alex Arthur, Ricky Burns etc. It was last used on 14 April 2012 when Arthur staged his self-promoted \\"Homecoming\\" fight event for the return of Craig McEwan to Edinburgh. =Taekwondo= The stadium was used in November 2014 to host the Commonwealth Taekwondo Championships. =Juggling= Meadowbank was the venue for the European Juggling Convention in 1998. Redevelopment and renovation Threatened trees outside at Edinburgh's dilapidated Meadowbank Stadium in November 2018 In 2006 the City of Edinburgh Council published plans to demolish Meadowbank Stadium, selling the site for housing. Meadowbank would have been replaced with a smaller community facility on the east side of the city and a stadium for athletics and rugby was to be built to the west of the city, probably in Sighthill. The draft Meadowbank Development Brief was approved by the Council on 7 December 2006 for consultation.(Council's Development Brief ) The Development Brief stated that \\"housing is the most appropriate alternative use of the site\\" and that \\"high density development is acceptable in principle\\". The consultation ran until 28 March 2007, after which the council leader Ewan Aitken admitted that the Council should have consulted more with the users of Meadowbank. More than 6000 people signed a petition objecting to the proposal, while 600 marched from the stadium to the City Chambers, as part of a Save Meadowbank campaign. The proposal was cast into doubt due to problems with the Sighthill Stadium project, which was scrapped in 2007. On 13 March 2008, Edinburgh Council voted to sell the land that is occupied by Meadowbank stadium and build a smaller sports facility on east of the site.National and Regional Sports facilities progress report X-Factor winner Leon Jackson, who was campaigning to save Meadowbank, played at its annual fireworks display on 5 November 2008. The proposals to sell Meadowbank were put on hold in 2009, after a decline in Edinburgh land prices. In February 2013, the City of Edinburgh Council started a new consultation process about its future. Three options for redeveloping Meadowbank were put forward for consideration by Edinburgh Council in December 2013. A planned design was made public in November 2016. Work was expected to begin after the 2016-17 football season ended. Edinburgh City reached an agreement with Spartans to use their Ainslie Park ground for three seasons while Meadowbank was being redeveloped. A final annual fireworks display was held on 5 November 2017. The stadium was closed for the redevelopment works in December 2017, and the new facilities were due to open in the spring of 2020. Planning applications for detailed approval for the new sports centre and in principle for development of the rest of the site were published in January 2018. In July 2018, the Council approved detailed plans for the new Meadowbank Sports Centre and the redevelopment of land surrounding it for housing, student accommodation, hotel and commercial use. A council consultation opened on 20 August 2018 and closed on 31 October.

He subsequently was active in freemasonry in Lisbon and came into conflict with the Portuguese Inquisition. The fallout in the aftermath of this was a major event in the struggle between Catholicism and Freemasonry.

The modern scholar Marsha Keith Schuchard, claims that Coustos, \\"acted as a secret agent for Walpole,\\" the Whig Prime Minister of Britain.. Schuchard claims that Coustos, allegedly of Marrano descent, who came to London in the aftermath of the public fallout of the Francis Francia trial (a Sephardic \\"Jacobite Jew\\", who was involved in Freemasonry) caught the eye of the British government. Prime Minister Walpole, a stalwart of the new Hanoverian regime, allegedly used Coustos (and other spies such as Michel de la Roche) to spy on French masonic lodges in London from 1730-32 and report back on any activities of exiled Jacobites in Paris. =Portuguese Inquisition= While traveling on business he founded a Masonic lodge in Lisbon and was arrested by the Portuguese Inquisition. After questioning he was sentenced to the galleys. Three Portuguese Masons were put to death. He was released in 1744 as a result of the intercession of George II of England.

Life Merz was the eldest son of industrial chemist John Theodore Merz (a Quaker from Germany) and Alice Mary Richardson, a sister of John Wigham Richardson the Tyneside ship builder.Children of Light: How Electricity Changed Britain Forever Gavin Weightman He was born in Newcastle upon Tyne and attended Bootham School, York. He attended Armstrong College in Newcastle, where his father was a part-time lecturer. He then entered an apprenticeship at the Newcastle Electric Supply Company (NESCo), which had been founded by his father, in 1889. In 1898 Merz became the first Secretary and Chief Engineer of the Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company in Cork, Ireland.Tram Tracks Through Cork, Walter McGrath, Tower Books, Cork, 1981 In 1899 Merz set up a consulting firm which, with the arrival of William McLellan in 1902, became Merz & McLellan. Merz and McLellan had first worked together in Cork. His next major project was the Neptune Bank Power Station in Wallsend near Newcastle. It was the first three-phase electricity supply system in Great Britain, and was opened by Lord Kelvin on 18 June 1901. In the same year he toured the US and Canada. Together with Bernard Price, he developed and patented one of the earliest forms of automatic mains protection.Price Patent This system was successful and became known as the Merz-Price system. When Price was succeeded by Philip Vassar Hunter, Merz worked with him to develop an improved version which became known as the Merz-Hunter system. He was known affectionately within the electricity industry as the \\"Grid King\\". He was a consultant to a local tramway company on the electrification of their horse- drawn routes and, subsequently, to the Tyneside local lines of the North Eastern Railway, a pioneer of British mainline railway electrification, whose electric systems were turned on in 1904. As well passenger commuter lines, these included a freight line using the ES1 electric locomotive. In 1905 he first attempted to influence Parliament to unify the variety of voltages and frequencies in the country's electricity supply industry, but it was not until World War I that Parliament began to take this idea seriously, then appointing him head of a Parliamentary Committee to address the problem. In the same war he was appointed Director of Experiments and Research on the Board of Invention and Research an appointment that led to his nationality being questioned in the House of Commons.Hansard Between 1907 and 1913 Merz was hired by Thomas James Tait to electrify the railway system in Melbourne, Australia. The new system began operation in 1919, after World War I. From 1912 to 1915 he was Vice-President of the Institute of Electrical Engineers. In 1916 Merz pointed out that the UK could use its small size to its advantage, by creating a dense distribution grid to feed its industries efficiently. His findings led to the Williamson Report of 1918, which in turn created the Electricity Supply Bill of 1919. The bill was the first step towards an integrated system. He also sat on the Weir Committee, which produced the more significant Electricity (Supply) Act of 1926, leading to the setting up of the National Grid. Merz's own system ran at 40 hertz, 20,000 volts, but he was forced to convert it to 50 hertz to match the European system. Merz received the Faraday Medal in 1931, was awarded an honorary D.Sc by the University of Durham in 1932, was a Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and Fellow of the American Institution of Electrical Engineers. In 1940 Merz designed the electric drive equipment for the TOG 1 tank. In the same year, aged 66, he was killed during an air raid, with his two children, at their house at 14 Melbury Road, Kensington, London, by a German bomb.

It is a comedic point and click adventure game parodying fantasy fiction. It can be played with either of two available protagonists, Thidney or Sha-ron. Kingdom O' Magic was planned for release on four different systems: MS-DOS, PlayStation, Macintosh, and Sega Saturn. However, only the MS-DOS version was ever released. Themes The game is filled with surreal humor. For instance, the instruction manual claims that the game was \\"First published in 1876 under the title '101 fun things To Do with Trolls'. However the version on CD-ROM is specially calibrated for short people with red hair.\\" It was designed by Fergus McNeill. As in his previous games, Bored of the Rings and The Boggit, the game parodies J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth. Various elements in the games are parodies of Middle-earth characters and locations, such as \\"The High Steward of Minar Tragedy, Don Elrondo of Rivendull and Queen Galadrag of De- Lorean.Review of Kingdom O' Magic The game's closing credits sequence plays the theme to the 1970s British cartoon Roobarb, but there appears to be no other relationship between the works. Plot Beginning the game, the player can select between two protagonists: Thidney the Lizard Bloke (voiced by John Sessions) or Shah-Ron the Girlie (voiced by Lani Minella) from planet Comely. According to the on-screen descriptions, Thidney is skilled at combat whereas Shah-Ron is skilled at magic. There are three quests: *The Good, Old Fashioned, Traditional Quest: The player wanders around the Kingdom fighting and completing various side-quests, until finally \\"rescue the dragon, steal the princess and kill the treasure\\". *The Magnificent 7-11 Quest: The player has to find and recruit 7 to 11 characters from the Kingdom in order to protect Flake town from an upcoming invasion. *The Bizarre & Slightly Twisted Quest: The player must find the Lost Lava Lamp Of The Ancient and defeat the Dark Lord, in order to save civilization. Gameplay The player is surrounded by many NPCs moving around, such as karate elves fighting against and ringwraiths. The player can interact with non-hostile characters, triggering a dialogue tree: conversation is handled choosing from multiple responses, leading to different directions of conversation. Combat occurs when approaching a NPC with a weapon selected. Then all violence is covered by a cloud as seen in many cartoons, and then the two combatants walk away as if nothing had happened. There are also magic spells to supplement the combat system, but their effects, while humorous, are largely unhelpful.

The figure shows the three transformation steps of an ordinary Procrustes fit for two configurations of landmarks. (a) Scaling of both configurations to the same size; (b) Transposition to the same position of the center of gravity; (c) Rotation to the orientation that provides the minimum sum of squared distances between corresponding landmarks. In statistics, Procrustes analysis is a form of statistical shape analysis used to analyse the distribution of a set of shapes. The name Procrustes () refers to a bandit from Greek mythology who made his victims fit his bed either by stretching their limbs or cutting them off. In mathematics: * an orthogonal Procrustes problem is a method which can be used to find out the optimal rotation and/or reflection (i.e., the optimal orthogonal linear transformation) for the Procrustes Superimposition (PS) of an object with respect to another. * a constrained orthogonal Procrustes problem, subject to det(R) = 1 (where R is a rotation matrix), is a method which can be used to determine the optimal rotation for the PS of an object with respect to another (reflection is not allowed). In some contexts, this method is called the Kabsch algorithm. When a shape is compared to another, or a set of shapes is compared to an arbitrarily selected reference shape, Procrustes analysis is sometimes further qualified as classical or ordinary, as opposed to Generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA), which compares three or more shapes to an optimally determined \\"mean shape\\". Introduction To compare the shapes of two or more objects, the objects must be first optimally \\"superimposed\\". Procrustes superimposition (PS) is performed by optimally translating, rotating and uniformly scaling the objects. In other words, both the placement in space and the size of the objects are freely adjusted. The aim is to obtain a similar placement and size, by minimizing a measure of shape difference called the Procrustes distance between the objects. This is sometimes called full, as opposed to partial PS, in which scaling is not performed (i.e. the size of the objects is preserved). Notice that, after full PS, the objects will exactly coincide if their shape is identical. For instance, with full PS two spheres with different radii will always coincide, because they have exactly the same shape. Conversely, with partial PS they will never coincide. This implies that, by the strict definition of the term shape in geometry, shape analysis should be performed using full PS. A statistical analysis based on partial PS is not a pure shape analysis as it is not only sensitive to shape differences, but also to size differences. Both full and partial PS will never manage to perfectly match two objects with different shape, such as a cube and a sphere, or a right hand and a left hand. In some cases, both full and partial PS may also include reflection. Reflection allows, for instance, a successful (possibly perfect) superimposition of a right hand to a left hand. Thus, partial PS with reflection enabled preserves size but allows translation, rotation and reflection, while full PS with reflection enabled allows translation, rotation, scaling and reflection. Optimal translation and scaling are determined with much simpler operations (see below). Ordinary Procrustes analysis Here we just consider objects made up from a finite number k of points in n dimensions. Often, these points are selected on the continuous surface of complex objects, such as a human bone, and in this case they are called landmark points. The shape of an object can be considered as a member of an equivalence class formed by removing the translational, rotational and uniform scaling components. = Translation = For example, translational components can be removed from an object by translating the object so that the mean of all the object's points (i.e. its centroid) lies at the origin. Mathematically: take k points in two dimensions, say :((x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2),\\\\dots,(x_k,y_k))\\\\,. The mean of these points is (\\\\bar{x},\\\\bar{y}) where :\\\\bar{x} = \\\\frac{x_1+x_2+\\\\cdots+x_k}{k},\\\\quad \\\\bar{y} = \\\\frac{y_1+y_2+\\\\cdots+y_k}{k}. Now translate these points so that their mean is translated to the origin (x,y)\\\\to(x-\\\\bar{x},y-\\\\bar{y}), giving the point (x_1-\\\\bar{x},y_1-\\\\bar{y}),\\\\dots. = Uniform scaling = Likewise, the scale component can be removed by scaling the object so that the root mean square distance (RMSD) from the points to the translated origin is 1. This RMSD is a statistical measure of the object's scale or size: :s= \\\\sqrt{{(x_1-\\\\bar{x})^2+(y_1-\\\\bar{y})^2+\\\\cdots} \\\\over k} The scale becomes 1 when the point coordinates are divided by the object's initial scale: :((x_1-\\\\bar{x})/s,(y_1-\\\\bar{y})/s). Notice that other methods for defining and removing the scale are sometimes used in the literature. = Rotation = Removing the rotational component is more complex, as a standard reference orientation is not always available. Consider two objects composed of the same number of points with scale and translation removed. Let the points of these be ((x_1,y_1),\\\\ldots), ((w_1,z_1),\\\\ldots). One of these objects can be used to provide a reference orientation. Fix the reference object and rotate the other around the origin, until you find an optimum angle of rotation \\\\theta\\\\,\\\\\\\\! such that the sum of the squared distances (SSD) between the corresponding points is minimised (an example of least squares technique). A rotation by angle \\\\theta\\\\,\\\\\\\\! gives : (u_1,v_1) = (\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\,w_1-\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\,z_1,\\\\,\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\,w_1+\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\,z_1)\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. where (u,v) are the coordinates of a rotated point. Taking the derivative of (u_1-x_1)^2+(v_1-y_1)^2+\\\\cdots with respect to \\\\theta and solving for \\\\theta when the derivative is zero gives : \\\\theta = \\\\tan^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^k(w_iy_i-z_ix_i)}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^k(w_ix_i + z_iy_i)}\\\\right). When the object is three-dimensional, the optimum rotation is represented by a 3-by-3 rotation matrix R, rather than a simple angle, and in this case singular value decomposition can be used to find the optimum value for R (see the solution for the constrained orthogonal Procrustes problem, subject to det(R) = 1). = Shape comparison = The difference between the shape of two objects can be evaluated only after \\"superimposing\\" the two objects by translating, scaling and optimally rotating them as explained above. The square root of the above mentioned SSD between corresponding points can be used as a statistical measure of this difference in shape: : d = \\\\sqrt{(u_1-x_1)^2+(v_1-y_1)^2+\\\\cdots}. This measure is often called Procrustes distance. Notice that other more complex definitions of Procrustes distance, and other measures of \\"shape difference\\" are sometimes used in the literature. = Superimposing a set of shapes = We showed how to superimpose two shapes. The same method can be applied to superimpose a set of three or more shapes, as far as the above mentioned reference orientation is used for all of them. However, Generalized Procrustes analysis provides a better method to achieve this goal.  Generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA)  GPA applies the Procrustes analysis method to optimally superimpose a set of objects, instead of superimposing them to an arbitrarily selected shape. Generalized and ordinary Procrustes analysis differ only in their determination of a reference orientation for the objects, which in the former technique is optimally determined, and in the latter one is arbitrarily selected. Scaling and translation are performed the same way by both techniques. When only two shapes are compared, GPA is equivalent to ordinary Procrustes analysis. The algorithm outline is the following: # arbitrarily choose a reference shape (typically by selecting it among the available instances) # superimpose all instances to current reference shape # compute the mean shape of the current set of superimposed shapes # if the Procrustes distance between mean and reference shape is above a threshold, set reference to mean shape and continue to step 2.  Variations  There are many ways of representing the shape of an object. The shape of an object can be considered as a member of an equivalence class formed by taking the set of all sets of k points in n dimensions, that is Rkn and factoring out the set of all translations, rotations and scalings. A particular representation of shape is found by choosing a particular representation of the equivalence class. This will give a manifold of dimension kn-4. Procrustes is one method of doing this with particular statistical justification. Bookstein obtains a representation of shape by fixing the position of two points called the bases line. One point will be fixed at the origin and the other at (1,0) the remaining points form the Bookstein coordinates. It is also common to consider shape and scale that is with translational and rotational components removed.  Examples  Shape analysis is used in biological data to identify the variations of anatomical features characterised by landmark data, for example in considering the shape of jaw bones.\\"Exploring Space Shape\\" by Nancy Marie Brown, Research/Penn State, Vol. 15, no. 1, March 1994 One study by David George Kendall examined the triangles formed by standing stones to deduce if these were often arranged in straight lines. The shape of a triangle can be represented as a point on the sphere, and the distribution of all shapes can be thought of a distribution over the sphere. The sample distribution from the standing stones was compared with the theoretical distribution to show that the occurrence of straight lines was no more than average.\\"A Survey of the Statistical Theory of Shape\\", by David G.

It was occupied from 1860 to 1865, abandoned, then occupied briefly in 1867 during the construction of Cove Fort. Siting and construction In 1852, Mormon leader Brigham Young sent Charles Willden to Cedar City to work in the ironworks The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was attempting to establish, since Willden had worked in the steel industry in Sheffield, England, prior to immigrating to the United States of America. While traveling between Salt Lake City, and Cedar City, the Willdens camped at Cove Creek and observed it to be a nice place to settle. When the ironworks failed in 1859, Willden decided to settle Cove Creek. He and his son Ellott built Willden Fort near what would later be the site of the still-present Cove Fort. They first constructed an adobe house, then enclosed it with a 150-foot square cedar-post stockade. The posts were 8 to 10 ft high, placed close together to form a solid wall. Occupation Willden Fort was first occupied during the spring of 1860, and the Willden family lived there continuously until 1865 when a combination of Indian attacks due to Utah's Black Hawk War and a very harsh winter that killed most of the family's livestock convinced the Willdens to return to Beaver, Utah. While the Willdens occupied the fort, they received a continuous stream of visitors, because Willden Fort was located along the Mormon Road, a major travel corridor between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles, and was at a convenient stopping place. Some of the prominent visitors who stayed at the fort were Brigham Young, Lorenzo Snow, John Taylor and Ezra T. Benson. After the abandonment of Willden Fort, Brigham Young directed Ira Hinckley to construct a new fort on the same location. The Willden family returned to Willden Fort to assist with the construction of Cove Fort. Willden Fort also briefly housed the telegraph office during the construction of Cove Fort, making it the site of the first telegraph in Millard County, Utah. Archaeological excavation In 1996, the Archaeology Department at Brigham Young University organized and conducted an excavation at the location where Willden Fort is thought to have been located. Willden family descendants were interviewed to determine the most likely location and teams of students and professors from the university carefully excavated the site. No remnants of the fort or house were found. Recognition On September 21, 1996, the LDS Church organized a ceremony and provided a plaque to commemorate the history of the site and honor the Willden family for their contributions to the history of the region and to Cove Fort. The ceremony was attended by 850 descendants of Charles and his wife Eleanor.

The term can mean either the collective set of institutions (the executive, legislative, and judicial branches) or specifically the Cabinet (the executive).  Constitution  According to the Constitution, Turkey's government system is based on a separation of powers. The Constitution states that the legislative power is vested in the Parliament of Turkey (art. 7), that the executive power is carried out by the President of Turkey (art. 8) and that the judicial power is exercised by independent and impartial courts (art. 9) It also states that parliamentary elections and presidential elections shall be held every five years (art. 77). The Parliament accepts the law proposals prepared by the deputies (88 art.) The President promulgates the laws adopted by the Parliament (art. 89). The President may veto some of the provisions of the law and return it to the Parliament for reconsideration, but the approval of the President is not needed if the majority of the Parliament rejects the reconsideration of the law or provisions of the law (art. 89). The President can appeal to the Constitutional Court for the annulment of all or certain provisions of laws on the grounds that they are unconstitutional in form or in content (art. 104/7). In such a case, the decision of the Constitutional Court is final (art. 153).  Branches of government  = Legislative branch = Parliament of Turkey Legislative power is vested in a single-chamber parliament (the Grand National Assembly of Turkey) with 600 members. The members are elected for a period of five years according to the D'Hondt method. Every citizen over the age of eighteen is eligible to be a deputy. Members of the Grand National Assembly can not hold office in state departments and other public corporate bodies and their subsidiaries. Members of parliament can sit on behalf of a political party or as an independent parliamentarian. They are also delegates for the province in which they are elected. A simple majority is required to amend a law and a two-thirds majority to amend the constitution. Bills can be introduced by any member of parliament. The duties and powers of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey are to enact, amend, and repeal laws; to debate and adopt the budget bills and final accounts bills; to decide to declare war; to approve the ratification of international treaties, to decide with the majority of three-fifths of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey to proclaim amnesty and pardon; and to exercise the powers and carry out the duties envisaged in the other articles of the Constitution. = Executive branch = The executive power in the Turkish government is vested in the president of Turkey, where power is often delegated to the Cabinet members and other officials.  President  Seal of the president of Turkey The executive branch, under Part III of the Constitution, consists of the president and those to whom the president's powers are delegated. The president is both the head of state and government, as well as the military commander-in-chief. The president, according to the Constitution, must \\"ensure the implementation of the Constitution\\", and \\"ensure orderly and harmonious functioning of the organs of the State\\". The president may sign legislation passed by the Parliament into law or may veto it, preventing it from becoming law unless a simple majority in the Parliament vote to override the veto. On the approval of the President, laws are published in the Official Gazette and they come into force by virtue of that publication unless a specific effective date is stipulated within the law itself. The President has also the ability to introduce pieces of legislation by issuing presidential decrees. However, laws introduced by the Parliament prevail over the presidential decrees with respect to the same subject in the hierarchy of norms. Furthermore, fundamental and personal rights or duties and political rights or duties cannot be regulated under presidential decrees.  Cabinet, ministries, and agencies  The daily enforcement and administration of federal laws is in the hands of the various executive ministries, to deal with specific areas of national and international affairs. The Cabinet of Turkey includes the president and cabinet ministers. As part of the separtion of the legislative branch from the executive branch, members of the cabinet cannot be a member of the parliament during their ministry. In addition to ministries, a number of staff organizations are grouped into the Executive Office of the President. These include the National Security Council, the State Supervisory Council, the National Intelligence Organization, the Directorate of Communications and the Presidency of Strategy and Budget. There are also State-owned enterprises such as the Turkish Electricity Transmission Corporation. = Judicial branch = The building of the Turkish Court of Cassation in Ankara The Constitutional Court, the Court of Cassation, the Council of State, and the Court of Jurisdictional Disputes are the supreme courts mentioned in the judicial section of the Constitution. The courts operate within the framework of civil law. The Constitutional Court checks whether laws are in accordance with the constitution. Since 2005, the legal principles as laid down in the various international human rights treaties have also been assessed. Government institutions, governing parties, and the opposition have direct access to the Court. Citizens can also plead the alleged unconstitutionality of a particular law in an ongoing lawsuit. International treaties, on ratification by the Parliament, have hierarchically the same effect as codes and statutes. However, international treaty provisions involving basic rights and freedoms prevail against domestic codes and statutes. There are also specialised courts for certain legal areas within the scope of the powers of civil courts such as cadastral courts, commercial courts, consumer courts, intellectual and industrial property courts, and labour courts.  Elections and voting system  All Turkish citizens over 18 years of age have the right to vote in elections and to take part in referenda. Turkish women achieved voting rights in local elections in 1930.T√ºrkiye'nin 75 yƒ±lƒ± , Tempo Yayƒ±ncƒ±lƒ±k, ƒ∞stanbul, 1998, p.48,59,250 Four years later, universal suffrage was implemented in all Turkish elections. Turkey has been a multi-party democracy since 1950. A brief summary of the electoral systems used for each type of election is as follows: *Presidential elections: A two-round system, with the top two candidates contesting a run- off election two weeks after the initial election should no candidate win at least 50% +1 of the popular vote. *Parliamentary elections: The D'Hondt method, a party-list proportional representation system, to elect 600 Members of Parliament to the Grand National Assembly from 87 electoral districts that elect different numbers of MPs depending on their populations. *Local elections: Metropolitan and District Mayors, Municipal and Provincial Councillors, neighbourhood presidents and their village councils elected through a first-past-the-post system, with the winning candidate in each municipality elected by a simple majority.  Local administration  The Constitution enumerates local governments as municipalities, special provincial administrations and villages. The administration of the provinces is based on the principle of devolution of powers. The regulatory and budgetary autonomy of local governments is secured in the Constitution. A governor is representing the government in the province and is also the figurehead and executive organ of the special provincial administration. Governors act as the chairman of the provincial executive committee.  Finances  = Taxation = Most of the taxes are levied by the central government. However some specific taxes are levied by municipalities. Taxation system in Turkey is regulated by the Tax Procedure (TP) Law. It regulates the rights, burdens, carrying out duties along with principals of accrual. This Law consist of procedural and official provisions of all tax laws.

Directed by Cedric Gibbons, it was the second in the Tarzan film series and starred Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan. In 2003, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film \\"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. Plot Tarzan and Jane live in the jungle, along with their chimpanzee Cheeta. Harry Holt and his business partner Martin Arlington, leading a large party of locals, meet them on their way to take ivory from an elephant burial ground. Holt had visited the burial ground with Tarzan on an earlier trip, during which he had also met Jane. Holt had sought Tarzan out, as he was the only one who knew the way to the burial ground. On this trip, Holt tries to convince Jane to return with him to civilization by bringing her gifts such as clothing and modern gadgets. Jane tells him she would rather stay with Tarzan. She does agree to convince Tarzan to act as their guide. When Tarzan calls an elephant, Arlington gets the idea that they can use elephants as pack animals, enabling them to haul much more ivory. When Jane tries to convince Tarzan to call more elephants, she explains to him about hauling the ivory away. Tarzan, thinking that taking the ivory is profaning the burial ground, refuses. In addition, he refuses to even lead them to the burial ground, now that he knows of their intent. Arlington and Holt have everything they own tied up in this venture and are frantic to continue on. Arlington asks Holt how they found the burial ground the first time, and Holt explains that they had followed a dying elephant. Seizing on that idea, Arlington shoots an elephant, mortally wounding it so that it will lead them to the burial ground. Only Jane's intervention keeps Tarzan from murdering Arlington. After being abandoned by Tarzan and Jane, Arlington and Holt lead their baggage carriers, led by Saidi, a friend of Jane and Tarzan's, to the burial ground, following the wounded elephant. Elephants, aware of the impending disgrace of their sacred ground, turn up in the hundreds, and threaten to exterminate Holt and Arlington's party. Tarzan and Jane arrive in time to save them, after which Arlington feigns repentance, promising to leave the next day without the ivory. Satisfied, Tarzan agrees to guide their departure, and sends the elephants away. Early the next morning, Arlington ambushes Tarzan, shooting him out of a tree. Tarzan falls into the water, and Arlington thinks he has killed him. After Arlington leaves, a hippopotamus rescues a semi-conscious Tarzan and carries him to a group of chimpanzees, which tend to him. Tarzan has received a head wound, but the bullet only grazed him, though it has left him very weak. The head chimpanzee applies plant sap to staunch the bleeding. Arlington returns to the group, claiming that he saw Tarzan being killed by an alligator. A distraught Jane agrees to return to civilization. Arlington and Holt have their baggage carriers each take a tusk from the burial ground, and they begin to head back. Cheeta leaves Jane and looks for Tarzan. Chased by a lion, Cheeta escapes and comes upon the chimpanzee group tending to Tarzan. As Tarzan recuperates, the safari makes its way through the jungle. Cheeta returns and lets Jane know that Tarzan is alive. However, shortly after the safari is confronted by a hostile tribe of \\"lion men\\", who kill two of the bearers and intend to kill the entire safari. Under cover of gunfire, most of the safari makes it to some nearby caves, set into the face of a rocky cliff. The bearer who was carrying the ammunition crate is killed on the way. When Saidi makes an attempt to retrieve the crate, he is captured by the lion men. Cheeta escapes and runs off to tell Tarzan. The safari watch in horror the next morning as Saidi is staked out to a tree, as the lion men intend to use him as bait to call lions to attack the safari. When Holt rushes out to save him, he is wounded by a thrown spear. Wounded, he begins to free Saidi when the lions show up and tear him and Saidi to pieces. Meanwhile, Cheeta has returned to Tarzan, who while still weak, sets off after Cheeta. The lions attempt to get at the safari, but are held off by Jane and Arlington and one of the bearers. When the bearer goes down on a ledge, Arlington goes out to save him, and he is attacked by a lion. Arlington is killed, but Jane kills the charging lion. As the lions become more aggressive, Tarzan and the chimpanzees arrive. The chimpanzees begin to throw the lion men out of the trees, where they are set upon by the lions. Jane kills two lions before she runs out of ammunition. As she is about to be attacked by the last lion, Tarzan arrives and kills it with his knife. Shortly after, a large herd of elephants arrives, trampling the lions, killing several and running the remainder off. With the lion men and the lions routed, the elephants, along with Tarzan, Jane, and Cheeta, return the ivory to the burial ground.

Edgar Rice Burroughs, keen to capitalize on the success of the first film (as were M.G.M), began negotiations in March 1932 for future Tarzan films. Discussions between Burroughs‚Äô representative, Ralph Rothmund and M.G.M executives, Irving Thalberg and Sam Marx, had begun in March 1932, and a new contract was signed in May of that year for a second Tarzan feature, with an option for a further two. Burroughs‚Äô received $45,000. Also in May, Burroughs contacted producer Bernard H. Hyman with the suggestion that Tarzan films be released as seasonal events. In mid-June 1932, The Hollywood Reporter announced that former independent producer Bud Barsky was to write the \\"original yarn\\" for the yet to be titled Tarzan sequel, and was to be assisted by M.G.M staffers R. L. Johnson and Arthur S. Hyman.See John Taliaferro's biography of Burroughs, Tarzan Forever, p. 282, Story conferences were held in March, with the author of the play White Cargo Leon Gordon, producer Bernie Hyman, supervising art director Cedric Gibbons, and production manager Joe Cohn. These early drafts toyed with the idea of a fight with a huge mechanical crocodile, and a spectacular jungle fire. By May 1933, a dialogue continuity by Howard Emmett Rogers was completed. This and earlier script and conference ideas became the basis for the various drafts of the eventual screenplay credited to James Kevin McGuinness. Special effects were to be overseen by Cedric Gibbons and executed by M.G.M's A. Arnold Gillespie and Warren Newcombe, James Basevi and Irving Reis. For their day, the special effects of the film were complex, involving such devices as matte paintings, miniatures, split screens, and rear projection. A June 29, 1933 Hollywood Reporter news item announced that W. S. Van Dyke (director of the first Tarzan The Ape Man), was to be Gibbons' co- director. By July 1, 1933, Van Dyke was dropped from the project, and Gibbons was announced as the film's sole director. In September 1933, however, the Hollywood Reporter announced that Jack Conway, was to take over the direction of one of Gibbons' units.Media History Digital Library accessed 6th January 2015 Filming on Tarzan and His Mate began August 2, 1933. Joining Johnny Weissmuller for the sequel were Rod La Rocque (who had just appeared in S.O.S. Iceberg (1933), co-starring Leni Riefenstahl, one of the last German-U.S co- productions, due to the rise of the Nazi Party), Murray Kinnell (The House of Rothschild), and Frank Reicher (one of 17 films he appeared in 1934). Problems soon developed. After 3 ¬Ω weeks of shooting, the first unit was shut down; Gibbons had shot a lot of excess footage, and costs were spiraling. When it resumed, Gibbons was no longer the director, in his place was Jack Conway as dialogue director with James C. McKay directing a number of animal sequences. A late August 1933 Hollywood Reporter news item announced that Rod La Rocque had been pulled from the cast, and replaced by Paul Cavanagh in the role of Martin Arlington, ‚Äòbecause of miscasting‚Äô. The roles of Tom Pierce and Van Ness were also changed, and Frank Reicher and Murray Kinnell were replaced by Desmond Roberts and William Stack, respectively. Some sources report Jack Conway directed most of the picture; however Maureen O‚ÄôSullivan has said James C. McKay actually directed the film. His official credit on the picture was Animal Director. McKay (1894-1971) had a resume full of various credits, and he jumped back and forth between the jobs of director and editor. McKay had received a Production Assistant credit on Trader Horn (1931) directed by W. S. Van Dyke. McKay was initially given the director's chair for the sequel, Tarzan Escapes (1936), indicating M.G.M must have been happy with the work he did on Tarzan and His Mate; however there would be many changes to the cast and crew on that film too (including Elmer Sheeley replacing Cedric Gibbons as art director!). Plans to film in Africa were scrapped and several locations around Los Angeles were used, including Sherwood Forest, Lake Sherwood, Whittier, California, Big Tujunga, and China Flat. Bert Nelson and George Emerson, the M.G.M animal trainers, doubled for Weissmuller. Trapeze artists Alfred Codona and the Flying Codonas, who had performed in the first Tarzan film, also doubled for Weissmuller and O'Sullivan, and acted as the elder Cheeta. Dressed in ape suits, The Picchianis performed in the film, and one of the troupe doubled for Weissmuller in a tree jumping sequence. Nelson also doubled for Paul Cavanagh. As with Tarzan the Ape Man, Indian elephants taken from M.G.M's zoo had attachments fixed to their ears and tusks to suggest African elephants. During the crocodile wrestling scene, a mechanical crocodile, equipped with nigrosine dye sacks to simulate blood, was used. Perhaps the highlight of the action sequences occurs with the elephants vs. lions battle. Travelling matte shots were used to depict lions leaping up and holding on to elephants, who then seized them with their trunks and hurled them down, or crushed them beneath their feet. Tarzan rides a rhinoceros in one scene - a first for film. The rhino, Mary, was imported from the Hagenbeck Zoo in Hamburg, Germany. Weissmuller did the scene himself, sustaining only minor scrapes to sensitive places from Mary's rough hide. Filming was not completed until the end of March 1934, because of re-takes and additional aerial scenes involving Jane and Tarzan. Betty Roth, wife of lion owner Louis Roth, doubled for O'Sullivan in some close contact scenes with lions near the film's conclusion. O‚ÄôSullivan was absent for over a month recovering from an appendectomy. M.G.M had spent $1,279,142 on the production. In early April 1934, after previews M.G.M cut the film, editing out fourteen-and-a-half minutes. Controversy The film has acquired a cult status, largely due to O‚ÄôSullivan wearing one of the most revealing costumes on screen to that time ‚Äî a halter-top and a loincloth that left her thighs and hips exposed. Because Jane was a \\"lady\\" from England (not Baltimore, as in Burroughs' novel), with manners and poise, her wearing such a provocative outfit was particularly naughty and symbolic of her sexual freedom. In this pre-Code film, Jane sleeps in the nude, swims nude with Tarzan, is constantly touched by Tarzan, has a scene in which she is stranded in the jungle without clothes on, and is seen nude in silhouette when dressing in a well lit tent. That Jane and Tarzan sleep together is all the more startling by Hollywood standards because they are not married; the end credits list O'Sullvan as Jane ‚ÄòParker,‚Äô emphasizing that she was single and living in sin.Vieira, Mark A. (1999), Sin in Soft Focus: Pre-Code Hollywood, New York: Harry N. Abrams, p. 180, However, a conversation early in the film suggests that they have been married. Tarzan brings breakfast to Jane in their treetop shelter. When he says, ‚ÄúNever forget, I love you.‚Äù ‚Äú Love who?‚Äù Jane prompts...‚ÄùLove my wife,‚Äù he replies. In its 1934 review, Variety referred to the pair as ‚ÄúMr. and Mrs. Tarzan‚Äù. The scene that caused the most commotion, the \\"underwater ballet\\" sequence, was available in three different versions that were edited by M.G.M to meet the standards of particular markets. Gibbons' wife Dolores del Rio had performed a risqu√© nude swim in Bird of Paradise (1932), a sequence that is said to have inspired the one in Tarzan. Tarzan and Jane (O'Sullivan's swimming double, Josephine McKim, who competed in the 1928 games with Johnny Weissmuller), dance a graceful underwater ballet with Jane completely nude. When she rises out of the water, Jane (now Maureen O‚ÄôSullivan) flashes a bare breast. As TCM's Paul Tatara observes, ‚ÄúSuch big-screen impropriety was virtually unheard of at the time, and the Production Code Office had a fit‚Äù. If seen at all was usually done by dancing girl extras, or non-white actresses due to the time's double standards (witness the topless \\"native\\" girls at the start of the film, or the topless \\"natives\\" in the 1935 Sanders of the River). The new Production Code Office thought O'Sullivan's scant costume, coupled with her sexual charisma, was too much. In April, Joseph Breen, director of public relations of the MPPDA, reported to his president, Will Hays, that Tarzan and His Mate had been rejected because of shots in which \\"the girl was shown completely in the nude.\\" :Breen: \\"The man in the shot wore a loin cloth, but a critical examination of the shot indicated that the woman was stark naked. There were four or five shots of the woman‚Ä¶ which showed the front of the woman's body.\\" When M.G.M production head Irving Thalberg protested the jury's decision by claiming that the 1928 film White Shadows in the South Seas had \\"fifty naked women\\" in it, the jurors screened that film and determined that none of the women were naked. According to film historian Rudy Behlmer: \\"From all evidence, three versions of the sequence eventually went out to separate territories during the film's initial release. One with Jane clothed in her jungle loin cloth outfit, one with her topless, and one with her in the nude. However, by April 24, 1934, all prints of Tarzan and His Mate in all territories were ordered changed. Additionally, the New York Censors previewed the film, and insisted that the scene involving Cavanagh lowering his nude body into a portable bathtub be eliminated as well. It was not until Ted Turner took over the M.G.M film library that a positive print of the original film was discovered in the vaults and released in 1986. Reception Although the film was a hit, it did not earn as much as the first Tarzan film in the United States, makingTarzan and His Mate a box office disappointment for MGM. Internationally, it was a huge success, despite the fact that it was banned in Germany by the National Socialist Party on the grounds that it showed a Nordic man in brutal surroundings. In his April 21, 1934, review, Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times praised the film as ‚Äúif anything, even more fantastic than its predecessor... Aside from the wild tale, this film is a marvel from a photographic standpoint...Needless to say that Miss O'Sullivan and Mr. Weissmuller acquit themselves in the same favorable fashion they did in their former hectic experiences.‚Äù Hall followed up on April 29, 1934, with another New York Times piece headlined ‚ÄúLIFE IN THE JUNGLE‚ÄîTarzan and His Mate a Marvel of Camera Work‚Äù: ‚ÄúFANTASTIC as is the yarn of Tarzan and His Mate, a sequel to the highly successful Tarzan, the Ape Man, it has been produced with such marked cleverness that it affords no little fun and a full measure of excitement...A great deal of credit is due to the expert work of the camera men. Charles Clarke and Clyde DeVinna...the unfailing manner in which they deal with their scenes is little short of marvelous...just as one might hazard that Tarzan is struggling with a stuffed lion, one sees that the animal has a full-toothed jaw...‚Äù Variety observed: ‚Äúthe monkeys do everything but bake cakes and the very human elephants always seem on the verge of sitting down for a nice, quiet game of chess; yet the picture has a strange sort of power that overcomes the total lack of logic.‚Äù Dennis Schwartz from Ozus' World Movie Reviews gives the film a grade A-, calling it the best of the series. In his review, Schwartz praised the film's action sequences, 'brisk' pacing, and cinematography. Kim Newman from Empire Online rates the film three out of five stars, calling it \\"Engaging and surprisingly sexy and raw for its time with luscious production values.\\" Leonard Maltin gives the restored version of the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising it as an ‚Äú Opulent, action-packed entry co- directed by MGM's famed art director Gibbons, and notable for pre-Code sexual candor and a distinct lack of clothes.‚Äú On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Tarzan and His Mate holds an approval rating of 100%, based on 14 reviews, and an average rating of 7.41/10. Legacy The film was nominated for American Film Institute's 2002 AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions list. In 2003, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film \\"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.

In the late 1980s, he wrote two books of fiction that were banned by the Communist regime and gained him repute among dissidents. Following the 1989 Revolution, the books were published but did not attract significant notice during the political upheaval of the time. He left Romania for the United States in 1999, after which the pair of previously banned works was once again released. In the 2000s, he wrote the fictional series Theophil Magus. Biography = Origins and early career = Born in Prejmer, Bra»ôov County, Oprea attended Andrei »òaguna High School in Bra»ôov before undertaking his studies at the Transilvania University of Bra»ôov.

Following publication, he penned a lengthy analysis of the works of Nicolae Steinhardt in the Ia»ôi magazine Opinia studen»õeascƒÉ, which led to a ban on writing by the Communist regime, in particular its Securitate secret police.

His two full-length works were banned by the regime and circulated in samizdat form. Due to this censorship, critic Tudorel Urian says that in the 1980s his name was much better known in dissident circles than his work. Tudorel Urian, \\"Hans Castrop √Æn Rom√¢nia comunistƒÉ\\", Rom√¢nia LiterarƒÉ, 37/2004 Oprea was a participant in the Bra»ôov Rebellion of 1987.

The latter states that in that period, forthright expression had come into fashion, and stories told in parables, such as Oprea's, were no longer favored. In 1999, Oprea emigrated to the United States, following which his novels began to meet with greater success in his native country. Trilogia lui Theophil Magus (\\"The Trilogy of Theophil Magus\\") appeared between 2000 and 2002, followed by new editions of Radiografia clipei (2003) and CƒÉma»ôa de for»õƒÉ (2004). Extensive appreciations were published by cultural commentators such as Mircea MihƒÉie»ô, Vladimir TismƒÉneanu, Sorin Antohi, Liviu Antonesei, Norman Manea, which, Urian states, helped secure Oprea's reputation in contemporary Romanian literature. A fourth volume in the planned trilogy appeared in 2007, turning it into a tetralogy. Urian labels Oprea a \\"true dissident\\" in the manner of Corneliu Coposu and Adam Michnik, having directly confronted the regime, undergone abusive interrogations by the Securitate secret police, and not called for vindictive retribution against former regime figures after 1989. Radiografia clipei, which brings together several short works, deals with alienated intellectuals who are either artists or dreamers. They have been deemed enemies of their society due to their power to escape into their own worlds. They face concerted political and social pressure, and their attempts at resistance are meager, tending to be supplanted by despair and isolation. Crengu»õa Napristoc, \\"ProzƒÉ.

Publication One of the most decisive voices in its field, Artforum is published monthly from September through May along with an annual summer issue. The magazine is distinguished from other magazines by its unique 10¬Ω x 10¬Ω inch square format, with each cover often devoted to the work of an artist. Notably, the Artforum logo is a bold and condensed iteration of the Berthold Akzidenz font, a feat for an American publication to have considering how challenging it was to obtain fonts favored by the Swiss school via local European foundries in the 1960s. John P. Irwin, Jr named the magazine after the ancient Roman word forum hoping to capture the similarity of the Roman marketplace to the art world's lively engagement with public debate and commercial exchange. The magazine features in-depth articles and reviews of contemporary art, as well as book reviews, columns on cinema and popular culture, personal essays, commissioned artworks and essays, and numerous full- page advertisements from prominent galleries around the world. History Artforum was founded in San Francisco in 1962 by John P. Irwin, Jr. Irwin was a salesman for Pisani Printing Company and would make frequent stops to the galleries around Brannan Street and the Financial District for deliveries. Gallerists and artists, like Philip Leider, suggested to Irwin that he should start a local arts publication that catered to the West Coast arts scene since they were tired of reading about the same New York-based artists in Art in America, Arts Magazine, or Art News. Through the backing of Pisani Printing Company, Irwin successfully launched the magazine in a small office off of Howard Street. The first issue featured a cover with a work by the kinetic sculpture by Swiss painter Jean Tinguely suggesting the inchoate and indistinct identity of the fledgling publication. ‚ÄúThat center section will contain a lot of divergent and contradictory opinion[s],‚Äù reads an editorial note in the first issue. The next publisher/owner Charles Cowles moved the magazine to Los Angeles in 1965 before finally settling it in New York City in 1967, where it maintains offices today. The move to New York also encompassed a shift in the style of work championed by the magazine, moving away from California style art to late modernism, then the leading style of art in New York City. One of Leider's final essays for the magazine, ‚ÄúHow I Spent My Summer Vacation, or, Art and Politics in Nevada, Berkeley, San Francisco and Utah,\\" is a reflective first-person account of a cross-country road trip visiting earthworks, such as Michael Heizer‚Äôs Double Negative (1969) and Robert Smithson‚Äôs Spiral Jetty (1970). The essay grapples with the relationship between politics and art. The departure of Philip Leider as editor-in-chief in 1971 and the tenure of John Coplans as the new editor-in- chief roughly coincided with a shift towards more fashionable trends and away from late modernism. A focus on minimal art, conceptual art, body art, land art and performance art provided a platform for artists such as Robert Smithson, Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt and others. In 1980, after opening his own gallery in New York City, Charles Cowles divested himself of the magazine. A sister magazine, Bookforum, was started in 1994. In 2003, the Columbia-Bard graduate Tim Griffin became the editor-in-chief of the magazine. He sought to bring back a serious-tone and invited academics and cultural theorists who were mostly suspicious of art and the market. The writers were mostly European male theorists like Slavoj Zizek, Giorgio Agamben, Alain Badiou, Toni Negri, and Jacques Ranci√®re. The magazine shed light on a new emergence of digital neo-appropriation artists such as Wade Guyton, Seth Price, and Kelley Walker and eventually featured a cover by artist Danh V≈ç. Michelle Kuo, a PhD candidate at Harvard and respected critic, was announced as the editor-in- chief in 2010 after Tim Griffin resigned to pursue other work. The magazine followed a similar, sober tone of under its new leadership with roundtable discussions, book and exhibition reviews, and lively hyper-academic discourse. In October 2017, publisher Knight Landesman resigned in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct with nine women including a former employee who filed a lawsuit.Christie Smythe and Katya Kazakina, \\"Artforum Publisher Quits After Sexual Harassment Complaint.\\" Bloomberg News October 25, 2017. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-25/artforum-publisher-quits- after-sexual-harassment-complaint Artforum initially backed Landesman, saying the allegations were \\"unfounded\\" and suggested that lawsuit was ‚Äúan attempt to exploit a relationship that she herself worked hard to create and maintain.‚Äù The magazine's editor Michelle Kuo resigned at the end of the year in response to the publishers' handling of the allegations. Kuo released a statement in Artnews noting, \\"We need to make the art world a more equitable, just, and safe place for women at all levels. And that can only be achieved when organizations and communities are bound by shared trust, honesty, and accountability.\\" Artforum staff released a statement condemning the way the publishers had handled the allegations. A new era of Artforum emerged under the leadership of David Velasco in January 2018. In his first issue, which featured a self-portrait by the born HIV-positive artist Kia LaBeija, Velasco wrote a poignant statement, ‚ÄúThe art world is misogynist. Art history is misogynist. Also racist, classist, transphobic, ableist, homophobic. I will not accept this. Intersectional feminism is an ethics near and dear to so many on our staff. Our writers too. This is where we stand. There‚Äôs so much to be done. Now, we get to work.‚Äù Art critic Jerry Saltz immediately praised the new direction the magazine had taken, noting, \\"And just like that, an Artforum that needed to disappear was gone,\\" and featured writing and photographic essays by Molly Nesbit, philosopher and curator Paul B. Preciado, critic Johanna Fatemen, and artist Donald Moffet. Artist Nan Goldin published a harrowing text and photographic account of her addiction to the prescription pain-relief drug, OxyContin, in a 2018 piece that prompted the founding of P.A.I.N., a campaign to expose the role that Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family have in the opioid epidemic in America. After reading Patrick Radden Keefe's piece in The New Yorker and Christopher Glazek's piece in Esquire on the Sackler's \\"criminal misbranding\\" of the drug that led doctor's to believe Oxycontin was less addictive that it had been reported, Nan's essay demanded that the Sackler's donate half of their fortune to drug rehabilitation clinics and programs. Writer Thessaly La Force of the New York Times Style Magazine writes of the artist, \\"It is rare these days to see a lone artist like Goldin ‚Äî especially one both critically and commercially successful, whose work is in dozens of important museum collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art ‚Äî step into the ring as an activist.\\" In 2019, Hannah Black, Ciar√°n Finlayson, and Tobi Haslett released an essay in Artforum titled The Tear Gas Biennial, decrying the involvement of Warren Kanders, co-chair of the board of the Whitney Museum, and his \\"toxic philanthropy.\\" Although Kanders has donated an estimated $10 million to the museum, the source of his fortune comes from Safariland LLC, a company that manufactures riot gear, tear gas, and other chemical weapons used by the police and the military to enforce violent order. As of 1925, the Geneva Convention has outlawed the use of tear gas in all international military conflict, however, the tear gas fired at peaceful protesters and civilians by the police and military during the George Floyd protests as well as migrants on the US-Mexico border is the same brand of tear gas manufactured by Defense Technology, a subsidy of Safariland. A wave of artists from the Biennial, including Korakrit Arunanondchai, Meriem Bennani, Nicole Eisenman and Nicholas Galanin, demanded immediate removal of their work from the Biennial within hours after the essay was published. After mounting pressure from additional artists, critics, and gallerists urging the public to boycott the show, Kanders stepped down from his leadership position at the museum. The essay was instrumental in Kanders resignation as well as the museum cutting ties with Kanders financial endowments that are directly connected to the promotion and use of military weaponry and violence during peaceful social unrest. On Artforum A book by Amy Newman chronicling the early history of the magazine, Challenging Art: Artforum 1962‚Äì1974, was published by Soho Press in 2000. Sarah Thornton's documentary book Seven Days in the Art World (2008) contains a chapter titled \\"The Magazine\\" which is set in the offices of Artforum. In it, Thornton says, \\"Artforum is to art what Vogue is to fashion and Rolling Stone was to rock and roll. It‚Äôs a trade magazine with crossover cachet and an institution with controversial clout.\\" Notable contributors *Hilton Als *Walter Darby Bannard *Dodie Bellamy *Andrew Berardini *Maurice Berger *Hannah Black *Yve-Alain Bois *Dennis Cooper *Arthur C.

It was subdivided into 100 centavos with the macuta worth 5 centavos and was equivalent to the Portuguese escudo. History The introduction of the escudo in Portugal's colonies took place in 1914, three years after it occurred in Portugal. The escudo replaced the real at a rate of 1000 r√©is = 1 escudo. In 1928, the angolar was introduced. Banknotes were exchanged at a rate of 1.25 escudos = 1 angolar, whilst centavo coins used with the escudo continued to be used with the angolar with no change in value. The angolar was pegged at parity with the Portuguese escudo, as the Angolan escudo had been before 1928. Thus, the currency reform constituted a devaluation of the escudo banknotes. In 1953, Portugal began unifying the currencies of its colonies. This process was completed in Angola at the end of 1958, with the reintroduction of the escudo. The escudo was replaced in 1977 by the kwanza at par. Coins In 1921, bronze 1, 2 and 5 centavo and cupro- nickel 10 and 20 centavo coins were introduced, followed the next year by nickel 50 centavos. In 1927, cupro-nickel 1, 2 and 4 macuta and 50 centavo coins were introduced. These coins continued to circulate when the angolar was introduced, with bronze 10 and 20 centavo coins introduced in 1948. In 1952, the first escudo coins were introduced, although the escudo did not officially replace the angolar until the end of 1958. Silver 10 and 20 escudos were introduced in 1952, followed by bronze 50 centavos and 1 escudo, and cupro- nickel 2¬Ω escudos in 1953. Cupro-nickel replaced silver in the 10 escudos in 1969, with nickel replacing silver in the 20 escudos in 1971. Cupro-nickel 5 escudos were introduced in 1972. Banknotes In 1914, the Banco Nacional Ultramarino introduced notes in denominations of 10, 50 and 50 centavos. 5 centavo notes followed in 1918, with 50 escudos introduced in 1920. In 1921, 1, 2¬Ω, 5, 10, 20 and 100 escudo notes were added. State notes for 50 centavos were also introduced in 1921. In 1958, notes (dated 1956) were introduced by the Banco de Angola in denominations of 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 escudos. These five denominations were issued until the introduction of the kwanza.

There is a half-timbered cottage with a large barn and a farmhouse with a Dutch gable. Wiggins Hill was a major meeting place for Quakers, with a meeting house and cottage being built there in 1724 by the group.

There are various residential care options available, depending on the needs of the individual. People with disabilities, mental health problems, learning difficulties, Alzheimer's disease, dementia or who are frail aged are often cared for at home by paid or voluntary caregivers, such as family and friends, with additional support from home care agencies. However, if home-based care is not available or not appropriate for the individual, residential care may be required.  Child care  Children may be removed from abusive or unfit homes by government action, or they may be placed in various types of out-of- home care by parents who are unable to care for them or their special needs. In most jurisdictions the child is removed from the home only as a last resort, for their own safety and well-being or the safety or others, since out-of-home care is regarded as very disruptive to the child. They are moved to a place called a foster home.M. Mattingly et al., Out-of-home care by state and place, Carsey Institute, Spring 2010 = Residential schools = A residential school is a school in which children generally stay 24 hours per day, 7 days per week (often called a boarding school). There is divided opinion about whether this type of schooling is beneficial for children. A case for residential special schooling has been advanced in the article: Residential special schooling: the inclusive option! in the Scottish Journal of Residential Child Care, Volume 3(2), 17-32, 2004 by Robin Jackson.Kendrick, Andrew, Residential child care: prospects and challenges, Jessica Kingsley Publishers, London, 2008, , page 7 = Residential Child Care = This type of out-of-home care is for orphans, or for children whose parents cannot or will not look after them. Orphaned, abandoned or high risk young people may live in small self-contained units established as home environments, for example within residential child care communities. Young people in this care are, if removed from home involuntarily, subject to government departmental evaluations that include progressions within health, education, social presentations, family networks and others. These are referred to as life domains within the charter of Looking after Children (LAC). Recent trends have favored placement of children in foster care rather than residential settings, partially for financial reasons, but a 1998 survey found that a majority of out-of-home children surveyed preferred residential or group homes over foster care. = Child disability care = Children may be placed or taken into care because they have a mental, developmental, or physical disability, often referred to as \\"special needs.\\" A team of teachers, therapists, and caregivers look after the children, who may or may not go home to their parents at night or on weekends. Conditions and disabilities such as Autism, Down syndrome, epilepsy and cerebral palsy (to name a few) may require that children receive residential professional care. Specialized residential can be provided for children with conditions such as anorexia, bulimia, schizophrenia, addiction, or children who are practicing self-harm. =Foster care= Children, including children with special needs, may be cared for in a licensed foster care home. Foster care entails the young person or young people going to live with a family that is not biologically related to the young persons/people. Special training or special facilities may be required to foster a child who is medically fragile - for example, a child who has a serious medical condition or is dependent on medical technology such as oxygen support.Department of Human Services, State of Michigan  Adult care  = Adult disability care = Adults may be placed in Adult Residential Facilities because of a disability, often a mental disability such as Down syndrome or Autism, which makes them unable to care for their daily needs.Department of Social Services, State of California = Geriatric care = Various forms of long-term residential care are available for elderly people. A person or couple who are able to take care of their daily needs may choose to live in a retirement apartment complex (\\"independent living\\") where they function autonomously. They may choose to fix their own meals or have meals provided, or some combination of both. Many residential facilities are designed for elderly people who do not need 24-hour nursing care but are unable to live independently. Such facilities may be described as assisted living facilities, board and care homes, or rest homes. They typically provide a furnished or unfurnished room, together with all meals and housekeeping and laundry service. Depending on the needs of the resident they also provide assistance with daily activities such as personal hygiene, dressing, eating, and walking. They are not considered to be medical facilities, but they do have to meet state standards for care and safety.California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform Nursing homes, also known as rest homes or skilled nursing facilities, are intended for people who need ongoing medical care as well as help with daily activities. Nursing home populations have been decreasing in the United States, despite the increase in the elderly population, because of the increasing availability of other options such as assisted living.Senior Housing News, August 10, 2011 Continuing care retirement communities provide several types of care - typically independent living, assisted living, and skilled nursing - in one location, with the resident being able to move from one level of to another as their needs dictate.Your guide to choosing a nursing home, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, page 12 This is often referred to as 'Aging in Place'. = Hospice care = Hospices provide a form of medical care for people with a terminal illness or condition, for example, cancer. It is generally used when a person is very close to death. Most hospices offer a choice of residential (nursing home) or in-home (supportive) care. A hospice emphasizes a palliative rather than curative approach; the patient is made comfortable, including pain relief as needed, and both patient and family are given emotional, spiritual, and practical support.The Hospice Concept, at hospicenet.org  Mental illness  = Psychiatric hospital care = People may be detained under the laws that state that they have to be sectioned in certain circumstances. In the United Kingdom, at least 2 doctors can sign a paper to get this to happen. Patients have to be a risk to themselves, property or other people to warrant being sectioned; this can include suicide attempts. Some patients may volunteer to go to a psychiatric hospital because they recognize that they are ill. Treatment can occur against the patient's wishes if this is needed and that can be with the use of drugs. The patients are generally detained until doctors believe that they are stable enough to leave. = Rehabilitation unit care = People who are addicted to drugs or alcohol may be voluntarily or involuntarily admitted to a residential facility for treatment. Prescribed drugs are sometimes used to get people off illegal or addictive drugs, and to prevent the withdrawal symptoms of such drugs. The length of stay may be determined by the patient's needs or by external factors. In many cases the patient's insurance will cover such treatment in private facilities for only a limited period of time, and public rehabilitation facilities often have long waiting lists.Rogowski, J.A., Insurance coverage for drug abuse, Health Affairs, Fall 1992  Levels of care  = Total care = Total care is when a resident or patient requires a caregiver in order to have all their survival needs met, including ambulation, respiration, bathing, dressing, feeding, and toileting. The term \\"total care\\" is sometimes incorrectly used in nursing homes and other similar facilities to refer to a patient who simply needs diaper changes, but is able to provide other care on his/her own. = Self care = The term \\"self care\\" is used to refer to a resident or patient who resides in a caregiving facility, but is able to meet one's own needs, such as ambulation and toileting, and only requires a caregiver for occasional assistance.

However, the band's lineup ended up with an almost different cast by the start of the following decade, with several of the original members having left after differences in the late 1970s regarding whether the band would continue to play tipica music, with Santiago and three others leaving to form Los Kimbos.

Biography Born in Bra≈üov (), Romania, the son of a German (Transylvanian Saxon), he was 14 when his family relocated to his parents' (West) Germany in 1963.¬´A cucerit¬ª Germania cu o chitarƒÉ / video, 1 September 2009, Libertatea, Retrieved 19 February 2017 In the same year, he started his first band, The Dukes. After completing his education and working for Chemigraphics, an art manufacturer, Maffay worked in clubs, where he distributed his music. Maffay's career started with the publication of his first single, \\"Du\\" (You in German). It was his biggest German hit in 1970 and brought him instant fame. With the 1979 album Steppenwolf, he became a major music star in Germany. The album sold 1.6 million copies, making it one of the best selling LPs at that time. In 1980, the album Revanche (Revenge) broke his previous record, selling more than 2.1 million copies. Together with German Singer-Songwriter Johnny Tame he formed a successful Country Rock Duo in 1976 called Tame & Maffay, They released two albums and continued a close cooperation until 1985. Maffay holds the German record for the most number one ranked album sales charts, including 16 albums.A German charts database In addition, each of his studio albums since 1979 reached the top ten. He also holds the German record for most albums to have sold over one million copies, with 14. His 2005 album, Laut und Leise (Loud and Quiet), became the fourteenth.  The 1980s  Altogether, Maffay has sold over 40 million records, which makes him one of the top selling artists in Germany. Since 1980, each of his 13 tours (roughly every 2 years) has ranked among the third most visited musical events in Germany, with nine of them ranked first in that category. The first leg of his 2015 Tour (19 Arena shows) sold out nearly a year in advance. Maffay also created a string of fairy tales about a little green dragon named Tabaluga. The tales, which spanned across five albums, were also turned into a musical. Maffay went on tour individually with Tabaluga & Lilli in Germany; he later released a live album, DVD, and live TV broadcast. The tour included Peter Maffay, Alexis, Nino de Angelo, Rufus Beck, and Carl Carlton, among others. In 1998, Maffay created an album in collaboration with global artists, including Aboriginal singers and musicians from Israel, called \\"Begegnungen\\". Julia Neigel, another famous German artist, is one of the musicians he usually works with in lyrics and singing in duets. She wrote two of his top singles ‚Äì \\"Freiheit die ich meine\\" and \\"Siehst Du die Sonne\\", a cover of Michel Polnareff's \\"La poupe√© qui fait non\\". He also starred in two movies directed by Peter Patzak: Lethal Obsession in 1987, and Gefangen im Jemen in 1999, for which Tony Carey provided the soundtrack. In addition, Maffay played a supporting role in the feature The Polar Bear. On 12 March 2011, Maffay received the Steiger Award (Germany). Personal life Peter Maffay is active in politics and sometimes inserts his own political stances into his music. He is a peace activist, and in 2005 he performed a concert for German ISAF troops in Afghanistan. Maffay also donates to projects for traumatised and abused children. On the Spanish island of Majorca, he established a ranch where traumatised children from all over the world can have a free two-week holiday to help them cope with their problems. For his social commitment, he received the Bundesverdienstkreuz in 1996, and, in 2001, he received an award called \\"Goldene Henne\\" (\\"The Golden Hen\\"). He has been awarded the Toleranzpreis der Evangelischen Akademie Tutzing in 2012. Peter Maffay has been married four times, has a son and lives with his family on a farm on Majorca. One of his hobbies is motorcycle riding. In 1972, Maffay was severely injured in an accident after crashing his Harley Davidson. Later in life, he crossed the Sahara Desert several times on an off-road motorcycle. The band Carl Carlton has played guitar in many projects. Likewise, for many years, Bertram Engel (drums), Ken Taylor (bass), and Jean-Jacques Kravetz (piano) have worked together with Maffay. Some time later, Jean-Jaques Kravetz brought his son Pascal Kravetz (guitar) with him into the fold. Frank Diez, member of \\"Peter Maffay Band\\" since 1974 and a remarkable pillar and sideman, left the group in 2004. So did Andreas Becker and some other members Maffay's band, in order to pursue other projects. He worked together with John Mayall and Chris Thompson. The American keyboard player Tony Carey, who produced many of his records, also took part in his live band for many years. The newest addition to the band is guitarist Peter Keller, from Hamburg.

When this band broke up, Sylvicious continued with his band Lucky Striker 201 until he met Benoit, who had already composed a couple of songs which would later be included on Some Atomik Songz. They sent demos out to several labels until the French label La Chambre Froide picked up the band. The resulting release after Some Atomik Songz would Versus (2004) - a split CD featuring Lok-8. The band has become well known because of their live shows. Sonic manipulations are accompanied by fire breathing and other uncanny acts you would rather expect to see at a carnival than a concert.

In 2005 they released the mega hit Le Son de la Pluie (The Sound of the Rain) on the Alfa Matrix compilation Endzeit Bunkertracks: Act I. It became number one on the DAC. They had a touring member besides the core who went by the name of Ins-ext.

Daniel was born in Preston, Lancashire, the son of Dr. Edward MacManus Daniel. He was educated at Repton School and Trinity College, Cambridge. As a young man, Daniel travelled abroad studying the attribution of paintings with Roger Fry. He was appointed as a Trustee of the National Gallery in 1925, apparently due to his being a personal friend and golfing partner of the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin. p. 119 His installation as Director in January 1929 is seen as a strike against \\"experts\\" and the increasing professionalisation of art history, on the part of the Trustees. In 1929, the Gallery bought the Wilton Diptych and Titian's group portrait of The Vendramin Family; these are considered the two major purchases of Daniel's directorship. Also that year the highly controversial dealer Joseph Duveen became a Trustee. Jonathan Conlin's history of the National Gallery describes Daniel as a \\"self-effacing nonentity\\" but Fry, for one, admired his \\"terrific energy and intellectual beefiness\\". Like many directors of the National Gallery, he was a trustee of the Iveagh Bequest. Daniel was appointed an honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1929 and an honorary Litt.D. of Cambridge in 1931. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1932 New Year Honours. In 1904, he married Margery Welsh. He died at his home in London, aged 83.

The most fundamental concept in chemistry is the law of conservation of mass, which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary chemical reaction. Modern physics shows that it is actually energy that is conserved, and that energy and mass are related; a concept which becomes important in nuclear chemistry. Conservation of energy leads to the important concepts of equilibrium, thermodynamics, and kinetics. The laws of stoichiometry, that is, the gravimetric proportions by which chemical elements participate in chemical reactions, elaborate on the law of conservation of mass. Joseph Proust's law of definite composition says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important. Dalton's law of multiple proportions says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers (i.e. 1:2 O:H in water); although in many systems (notably biomacromolecules and minerals) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction. Such compounds are known as non-stoichiometric compounds. The third stoichiometric law is the law of reciprocal proportions, which provides the basis for establishing equivalent weights for each chemical element. Elemental equivalent weights can then be used to derive atomic weights for each element. More modern laws of chemistry define the relationship between energy and transformations. * In equilibrium, molecules exist in mixture defined by the transformations possible on the timescale of the equilibrium, and are in a ratio defined by the intrinsic energy of the molecules--the lower the intrinsic energy, the more abundant the molecule. * Transforming one structure to another requires the input of energy to cross an energy barrier; this can come from the intrinsic energy of the molecules themselves, or from an external source which will generally accelerate transformations. The higher the energy barrier, the slower the transformation occurs. * There is a hypothetical intermediate, or transition structure, that corresponds to the structure at the top of the energy barrier. The Hammond-Leffler Postulate states that this structure looks most similar to the product or starting material which has intrinsic energy closest to that of the energy barrier. Stabilizing this hypothetical intermediate through chemical interaction is one way to achieve catalysis. * All chemical processes are reversible (law of microscopic reversibility) although some processes have such an energy bias, they are essentially irreversible.

This section describes the transformation of the ruling authority of the universe from Sivan to Thirumal. It also narrates the preparational events of the Avatar of Vaikundar. There is a description of the famine and other natural disasters that took place in the Travancore country because Thirumal left from there.  The plea of Devas  Since Thirumal left Travancore because of the cruel rule of the king, the country faced a lot of political, economic as well as natural disasters. But the land of Tiruchendur where Thirumal arrived after quitting Thiruvananthapuram, changed as a land of prosperity. Apart from human beings, other living beings too identified Thirumal, and acted as per his commands. But in Thiruvananthapuram, the country went worse and the king had no grace towards the Santror and ruled over them cruelly. Heavy taxes were charged on them. Many basic human rights were rejected for them and considered untouchables. Devas were not able to tolerate the pathetic situation of the Santror. So they pleaded towards Thirumal for the rescue of Santror. Thirumal accepting to visit Kayilai Meanwhile, Sakthi, the consort of Sivan visited Tiruchendur and requested Thirumal to come to Kayilai. Thirumal replied saying that, \\"Even after knowing the serious nature of Kroni's final fragment, your husband, believing the words of Devas and others, created him without discussing me. So I won't come there and you may go.\\" But Sakthi replied, \\"Since the advent of Kaliyan even the Kayilai was enclosed by the evil of Kali. The Neetham there may be completely destroyed. The whole world might get destroyed and all the devas will lose their divine nature. So please come there.\\" After hearing this humble request of Sakthi, Thirumal decided to visit Kayilai. But he sensed that the Kayilai itself was already affected by the evil Kayilai. So if he goes there as he is, he too will get affected to the evil. So he enveloped his body with Venneer, locked his hair entangled and worn the 32 Dharmas as Safron cloth and went to Kayilai. The transformation of authority As soon as Thirumal entered Kayilai, the darkness spread over there due to the disappearance of the evil Kali. Sivan welcomed Thirumal and told about his sufferings to Thirumal. Hearing that Thirumal summarised all the whole events happened till then right from the creation. And finally told that during all the previous activities we all used to discuss before performing anything. But you yourself created the Kali Yuga and the Kaliyan without a word from me. So you manage yourself and do whatever you wish yourself as done so far. Sivan replied that, \\"When Kroni was created in the Neediya Yukam, he due to hunger, tried to swallow Kayilai and also us. Then you asked me to offer you the boon to kill him. I told then that, if Kroni was to be destroyed, there is only one way, by fragmenting him into six. If so the six fragments each in the successive six yugas will take birth in the world as enemy of yourself. You may have to incarnate in the world and have to destroy him. As per that deed it's your duty to destroy him. So please understand the situation.\\" Saying this Sivan also surrendered all his powers of authority to Thirumal to control and rule the whole world. So Thirumal accepted to find solution for the destruction of Kali yuga and Kaliyan. Devas to take birth in Bhoo Loga He accepted to take birth and before that he asked Sivan to assemble all Devas who told to Sivan earlier that Thirumal was in a divine sleep in the Boo Loga. As per the command Sivan assembled all of them there. Thirumal asked them, \\"You all have lied to Sivan that I was dead over there. Since you told such a great lie, now Kaliyan was created and along with him the evil arrived and see the sufferings due to that. On what ground you all told that?\\" Devas stood without answering with bowed-heads. Being aware of the mind of Devas, Thirumal told them that since they have made the circumstance to be worse, they all should take birth in the Kali Yuga. Devas had nothing but to agree to that order. Then Thirumal, holding the power of Trimurthis within himself told devas, \\"For creating you all in the Bhoo Loga, I've already given birth to seven devas from seven logas in the world as Santror in Ayothya Amirtha Vanam. And they have spread by generations over there. You all have to take birth in their community.\\" By hearing this, the Devas told Thirumal, \\"When we are taking birth in the Kaliyuga which is enclosed by the evil of Kali, thyself should protect us from the evil.\\" Thirumal told that, \\"I can't do so. Once you take birth in Kaliyuga the evil shall also influence you. But I shall come over there and forgive all your sins which are committed by the influence of Kali.\\" Hearing this, the devas accepted to take birth in Kali yuga. The rejection of Sampoorana Devan But one among them named Sampoorana Devan, came up and told that, \\"I too accept to take birth in the Bhoo loga. But I have one demand.\\" Thirumal asked what that is. He replied, \\"I am in love with Para Devathai of Yama Loga . She leaving here husband, is too in love with me. Unless you make her as my wife there in Bhoo Loga I have difficulties to take birth over there.\\" Though Thirumal explained him that it's not good to have such a relation, Sampoorana Devan was not ready to forget his lady love. So Thirumal told him that, \\"In order to fulfill your need, you and herself shall perform austerity, without any other desires in your mind and once you have succeeded, you will be allowed to live with her.\\" Accepting this, Sampoorana Devan along with Para Devathai went for performing austerity. The life-style of Fifty-five Rishis Thirumal after sending them to austerity started to give birth to Devas of all logas in the world one by one. When it's the turn of Brahma Loga, they asked Thirumal, \\"Once, 55 Rishis were cursed to be statues by Brahma for stealing his texts. They are released from their curse as you touched them. They were also asked to live in the 55 nations of the world one for each nation, and they are living as per. And now when we too take birth over there, how we shall identify them and how do they identify us?\\" Thirumal replied that those 55 rishis are living in the world continuously taking birth after their deaths. Thirumal also explained the symptoms of each of them so that they can identify them. They also will perform several miracles in the world there. Then I also will come to the world to destroy the Kali. At that time I will assemble all of them before me and will make them surrender all their powers to me and will kill them. And then they will be again made to take birth as your children in the same (Santror) community. Likewise all of you will be born and die continuously as per the rule of Kali Yuga till its end. Saying this, Thirumal made them to take birth in Bhoo Loga.  See also  * Thirumal in Thiruvananthapuram * Ayyavazhi mythology *Akilathirattu Ammanai * Travancore * The Santror References * N.

It was the third in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Tarzan series to feature Johnny Weissmuller as the \\"King of the Apes\\". Previous films were Tarzan the Ape Man (1932) and Tarzan and His Mate (1934), with Jane's bikini- like attire and the famous skinny-dipping sequence. Weissmuller and O'Sullivan starred together in three more Tarzan films, Tarzan Finds a Son! (1939), Tarzan's Secret Treasure (1941) and Tarzan's New York Adventure (1942). Plot Lobby card Jane's (Maureen O'Sullivan) two cousins, Eric and Rita, arrive in Africa to tell Jane about a fortune left to her back in their world and to try to convince her to return with them. They are led to Tarzan's escarpment home by Captain Fry (John Buckler), a hunter with an agenda of his own. Jane convinces Tarzan to let her go back with Eric (William Henry) and Rita (Benita Hume), promising that their separation will only be temporary. But Captain Fry (unknown to the others) attempts to capture Tarzan to take him back to civilization so he can be put on public display, and actually succeeds in caging Tarzan. Fry's treachery includes making a deal with an unfriendly native tribe to give him food, canoes and protection for the journey back in exchange for his handing over Jane, Eric and Rita for \\"ju-ju\\" and taking away the greatest \\"ju-ju\\" ‚Äì Tarzan. Fry's plan goes wrong when the natives capture Tarzan in his cage and all four white people are taken prisoner. Tarzan manages to escape with the help of elephants and Cheeta, and guides what's left of Fry's party through a cave passage filled with treacherous quicksands. Just before they exit the caves to safety, Tarzan forces Fry to go back the way they came as punishment for his betrayal. Fry starts to go back, then seizes a heavy branch to attack Tarzan, but before he can exit the cave he falls into a quicksand bog (filled with \\"poisonous\\" lizards) and is swallowed up. Rita and Eric tell Jane that it is not necessary for her to return with them and that she belongs with Tarzan. The film ends with Tarzan and Jane reunited at their tree house.

Maureen O‚ÄôSullivan has said James C. McKay actually directed the film. His official credit on that picture was Animal Director. McKay (1894‚Äì1971) had a resume full of various credits, and he jumped back and forth between the jobs of director and editor. McKay had received a Production Assistant credit on Trader Horn (1931) directed by W. S. Van Dyke. McKay was initially given the directors chair for the sequel, Tarzan Escapes (1936), indicating M.G.M must have been happy with the work he did on Tarzan & His Mate; however there would be many changes to cast and crew on that film too (including Elmer Sheeley replacing Cedric Gibbons as art director!). John Farrow was handed the director's chair. Reportedly he then practically re-shot the whole film. Regardless, Richard Thorpe ended up getting final director's credit. John Farrow (who had a fling with Dolores del R√≠o) married Maureen O'Sullivan before the year was through.Media History Digital Library accessed 6th January 2015 Deleted scene A scene, which took a week to shoot, featuring Tarzan fighting vampire bats was cut from the final film after test audiences found the scenes too intense. The first director James C. McKay shot many of the \\"gruesome\\" scenes, but he was replaced by John Farrow in 1936 who re-shot much of the film. Richard Thorpe would finally get credit for directing the film.

In this process, the analyte solution is electrolyzed. Electrochemical reduction causes the analyte to be deposited on the cathode. The mass of the cathode is determined before and after the experiment, and the difference is used to calculate the mass of analyte in the original solution. Controlling the potential of the electrode is important to ensure that only the metal being analyzed will be deposited on the electrode. The process is similar to electroplating. The phenomenon of polarization exerts a back EMF in electrolysis, which reduces the actual EMF of the cell. Thus electrolysis of an electrolyte is possible only when this back EMF is overcome. If two separated platinum electrodes are placed in a dilute solution of copper sulfate and if a source of potential is applied, no appreciable current will flow through the system, until some minimum potential is applied after which the current will increase as the applied potential increases. The applied voltage which is just sufficient to overcome the back EMF due to polarization and also to bring about the electrolysis of an electrolyte without any hindrance is known as decomposition potential. The decomposition potential Ed is composed of various potentials and is given by: :Ea (min)= Ed= Eb+ Es+ Ev where: *Ea = applied potential *Ed = decomposition potential *Eb = theoretical counter or back potential *Ev = overvoltage.

The first use of the term in marketing was in the 1940s when the Coors Brewing Company sold Coors Light, for a short period before World War II, relaunching it more successfully in 1978 as a 4.2% abv pale lager. In 1967, the Rheingold Brewery marketed a 4.2% pale lager, Gablinger's Diet Beer, developed by American biochemist Joseph Owades, as a beer for people dieting. It was not successful, and the recipe was given to a Chicago brewery, Meister Brau, who sold it as Meister Brau Lite. That brewery was acquired by the Miller Brewing Company in 1972, who relaunched the beer as Miller Lite. Light beers may be chosen by beer drinkers who wish to manage their alcohol consumption or their calorie intake; however, they are sometimes criticised for being less flavourful than full-strength beers, or for tasting or actually being Reduced alcohol Light beers with lower alcohol content allow consumers to drink more beers in a shorter period without becoming intoxicated. Low alcohol content can also mean a less expensive beer, especially where excise is determined by alcohol content. This is the primary definition of the term in countries such as Australia and Scotland. In Australia, regular beers have approximately 5% alcohol by volume; light beers may have alcohol. In Scotland, the term derives from shilling categories, where 'light' customarily means a beer with less than 3.5% alcohol by volume. Reduced calories Reducing the caloric content of beer is accomplished primarily by reducing the carbohydrate content, and secondarily by reducing the alcohol content, since both carbohydrates and alcohol contribute to the caloric content of beer. Unlike reduced-alcohol light beers, the alcohol reduction is not primarily intended to produce a less intoxicating beverage. This is the primary definition in the United States, where the spelling Lite beer is also encountered, and where popular light beers include Bud Light, Miller Lite, and Coors Light.

It is analogous to the famous Riemann zeta function : \\\\zeta(s) = \\\\prod_{p\\\\in\\\\mathbb{P}} \\\\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}} where \\\\mathbb{P} is the set of prime numbers. The Selberg zeta-function uses the lengths of simple closed geodesics instead of the primes numbers. If \\\\Gamma is a subgroup of SL(2,R), the associated Selberg zeta function is defined as follows, :\\\\zeta_\\\\Gamma(s)=\\\\prod_p(1-N(p)^{-s})^{-1}, or :Z_\\\\Gamma(s)=\\\\prod_p\\\\prod^\\\\infty_{n=0}(1-N(p)^{-s-n}), where p runs over conjugacy classes of prime geodesics (equivalently, conjugacy classes of primitive hyperbolic elements of \\\\Gamma), and N(p) denotes the length of p (equivalently, the square of the bigger eigenvalue of p). For any hyperbolic surface of finite area there is an associated Selberg zeta-function; this function is a meromorphic function defined in the complex plane. The zeta function is defined in terms of the closed geodesics of the surface. The zeros and poles of the Selberg zeta-function, Z(s), can be described in terms of spectral data of the surface. The zeros are at the following points: # For every cusp form with eigenvalue s_0(1-s_0) there exists a zero at the point s_0. The order of the zero equals the dimension of the corresponding eigenspace. (A cusp form is an eigenfunction to the Laplace‚ÄìBeltrami operator which has Fourier expansion with zero constant term.) # The zeta-function also has a zero at every pole of the determinant of the scattering matrix, \\\\phi(s) .

Selberg zeta-function for the modular group  For the case where the surface is \\\\Gamma \\\\backslash \\\\mathbb{H}^2 , where \\\\Gamma is the modular group, the Selberg zeta-function is of special interest. For this special case the Selberg zeta-function is intimately connected to the Riemann zeta- function.

In particular, we see that if the Riemann zeta-function has a zero at s_0, then the determinant of the scattering matrix has a pole at s_0/2, and hence the Selberg zeta-function has a zero at s_0/2.

TGV 001 (Train √† Grande Vitesse 001 ) was a high-speed railway train built in France. It was the first TGV prototype and was commissioned in 1969, to begin testing in 1972. The TGV 001 was an experimental gas turbine-electric locomotive-powered trainset built by Alstom to break speed records between . The experimental train was part of a vast research program on high rail speeds. This program covered all technical aspects, principally traction, the behaviour of the vehicles, braking, aerodynamics and signalling. Originally, two trains were to be built, but only one was produced. The second was to be a tilting train equipped with an active tilting system, but was abandoned owing to technical difficulties. Description This turbotrain was built in a radically different fashion than its predecessors (the ETG and the RTG); it was composed of two locomotives and three carriages, all with driving axles. This concept as well as the shape of the TGV 001 was kept when designing the future TGV. Each axle was equipped with a traction motor with the advantage of small weight per axle but maximum power. Electric traction permitted dynamic braking, particularly effective at high speeds. Each locomotive was equipped with two Turbomeca Turmo turbines (TURMO III G then TURMO X), also used in the Super Frelon helicopters. As well as having direct control of the turbines, the locomotives were equipped with traction, braking and signalling controls. The TGV 001 was an articulated train; each carriage shared one bogie with the next. This setup ensured greater stability and permitted the suspension to be placed near the centre of gravity of each carriage, thus reducing rolling in curves. Service Despite setting the land speed record for railed vehicles (for a gas turbine-powered train) at , this train never saw commercial use. History TGV 001 was finished on 24 March 1972 and began to undergo testing on 4 April 1972. It went on to carry out 5227 test runs, running and breaking the barrier 175 times. TGV 001 still holds the world speed record for a gas turbine-electric locomotive, having travelled at on 8 December 1972. The 1973 oil crisis caused a sharp increase in the price of oil, after which it was deemed impractical to use oil to power the TGV, and the project turned to electric traction. Tests officially concluded on 19 June 1978. Preservation *T 001 : Bischheim (Bas-Rhin), *T 002 : Belfort (Territoire de Belfort).

It is the sequel to High Wizardry.  Synopsis  Nita and Kit's parents have never been fully behind their children's practices and in this book Nita's parents reveal that they are sending her to live with her aunt in Ireland over the summer to get away from the wizardry. This is particularly unfortunate for Nita and Kit as they are currently settling a land dispute between trees. When Nita gets to Ireland she begins to go \\"sideways\\" between different times and worlds of the location of Ireland. Ireland seems to be having a problem with wizardly overlays, making \\"sideways\\" transit much more frequent and the use of spells very perilous. This is dangerous for wizards and non-wizards alike, as non-wizards would not know how to return to their own time and place. Nita alerts the local Senior, who happens to be a relative of a boy, Ronan Nolan, whom she met in a restaurant and has a crush on. While in her aunt's kitchen, she overhears them talk about a fox problem they've been having, for which they have scheduled a hunt. Nita, being the ever-diligent wizard, goes that night and tells a fox of this. After the hunt, which was unsuccessful thanks to Nita's warning, the fox thanks her by informing her that one of the Powers That Be is near, though as is tradition he cannot say where or who. Things get hectic from there on as wizards must gather to fight an Ancient Evil, a form of the Lone Power. Four ancient relics must be reawakened to fight this evil, even though they're quite weak after the ages. Nita, aided by Ronan and her old ally Kit, is able to find the relics, at which point they go \\"sideways\\" with many other wizards to the site of a massive battlefield. At the height of the battle, Balor, a Fomorian king and an embodiment of The Lone Power, is slain by the Spear of Light. The Lone Power, who was trying to change the past, is narrowly defeated again.

It was purchased by Rolls-Royce plc in 1999, and the Vickers company name became defunct in 2004. History The company was created in 1977 from the rump of Vickers-Armstrongs following the nationalisation of its aviation, shipbuilding and steel businesses. The name was first used by the Vickers family for Vickers Limited ‚Äì at first a Sheffield steel foundry and later a manufacturing conglomerate ‚Äì from 1867 to 1927.

In 2002, Vickers Defence Systems was purchased by Alvis plc to form the subsidiary Alvis Vickers. In 2003, Rolls-Royce renamed its Vickers subsidiaries Vinters plc. The Vickers name lived on in Alvis Vickers. In 2004, the board of the parent group Alvis approved a ¬£309m takeover bid by the American defence company General Dynamics. Within three months BAE Systems, which already held a 29% stake, bid ¬£355m for the company; this was seen as a defence of the home market from a foreign rival. The bid was accepted by the majority of shareholders. In September 2004, BAE announced the creation of BAE Systems Land Systems, a new company bringing together the BAE subsidiaries, RO Defence and Alvis Vickers, which saw the end of the Vickers name after 176 years. In 2005, the acquisition of United Defense led to the creation of BAE Systems Land and Armaments Group.BAE Systems to buy US rival UDI BBC, 7 March 2005 Businesses =Automotive engineering= The Vickers plant in alt= In 1980, Vickers plc acquired Rolls-Royce Motors. This was not Vickers' first involvement with Rolls-Royce. In 1966, Rolls-Royce Limited (the original aero- engine and motor car company) acquired Bristol Aeroplane for its Bristol Siddeley engine business, but declared it had no interest in Bristol's 20% shareholding in BAC; Vickers Armstrong and English Electric (EE) each having 40% of BAC's shares. Despite this declaration, Rolls-Royce had not disposed of its BAC stake when the former was declared bankrupt in 1971. The 20% share was eventually acquired from receivership by Vickers and GEC (EE's parent company). In 1990, the Cosworth automotive engineering group was purchased. Vickers divested its automotive interests in 1998, selling Cosworth and Rolls- Royce Motors to Volkswagen Group. The disposal of Rolls-Royce was a complicated affair, involving BMW and legal issues surrounding the use of trademarks which were shared with Rolls-Royce plc. =Defence= In 1986, Royal Ordnance Factory Leeds was purchased and became the core of Vickers Defence Systems. These interests were primarily centred on land warfare products and brought the Challenger 1 tank into Vickers' portfolio. Vickers would later develop this into the Challenger 2, the current main battle tank of the British Army and Oman. In 1999 Reumech, owner of OMC, the South African defence company was purchased and renamed as Vickers OMC. In 2004, Vickers OMC was sold to BAE Systems. =Marine engineering= Since 1970, Vickers had been the parent of the Scottish Brown Brothers group, which produced marine steering gear and stabilisers.

Cyril Knowles Stand. A diagram of Victoria Park Victoria Park also known as the Super 6 Stadium for sponsorship reasons is a football ground in Hartlepool, County Durham, England, which is the home of National League club Hartlepool United. The four sides of the ground are known as the Town End Terrace (official capacity 1,775), the Niramax Stand (official capacity 1,617 seated and 1,832 terraced standing), the Cyril Knowles Stand (official capacity 1,599) and the Rink End (official capacity 1,033). The Town End Terrace is a standing area behind the south goal, and usually the most vocal area of the ground. The Neale Cooper Stand (formerly the Niramax Stand is an all seating stand with a terraced paddock at the west side of the ground. The Cyril Knowles Stand is a modern all-seater stand to the east of the ground. The Rink End is also an all-seater stand containing 1,033 seats, some with an obscured view of the pitch due to supporting pillars. The Rink End is at the north end of the ground and houses only away fans. The stadium was previously known as the Northern Gas and Power stadium between August 2016 and June 2017. History The land on which Victoria Park stands was originally a limestone quarry owned by the North-Eastern Railway Company. In 1886, the land was bought by West Hartlepool Rugby Football Club for the development of a new rugby ground. The ground was then named the Victoria Ground in celebration of Queen Victoria‚Äôs Diamond Jubilee. In 1908, West Hartlepool R.F.C. went bust, leaving The Victoria Ground vacant. Shortly afterwards, the ground was registered under the name of \\"The Hartlepools United Football Athletic Company Limited\\", a football team representing both the town of West Hartlepool and the original settlement of Old Hartlepool. This football team developed into Hartlepool United. From 1908 to 1910, Hartlepools United shared their ground with the amateurs of West Hartlepool until the club broke up leaving Hartlepools United as the sole occupiers of the ground. In 1916, the ground was bombed by a German Zeppelin, destroying the main stand on Clarence Road. A small, wooden stand was built as a temporary measure with the intent to replace it with a larger, more permanent structure once funds allowed. After the war, Hartlepool tried to claim compensation from the German government in order to fund the new stand. However these attempts failed and the temporary stand was eventually demolished in the late 1980s due to fire regulations being tightened as a result of the Bradford City fire. A number of portable cabins were put on the site of the Clarence Road stand containing dressing rooms, offices and a small number of seats until the Cyril Knowles Stand was built in 1995. When Chesterfield F.C. installed their floodlights in 1967, it left Hartlepool United as the only Football League club not to have floodlights. The Cyril Knowles Stand was named after the former Tottenham Hotspur defender who managed Hartlepool from January 1990 until June 1991. He had built side that won promotion from the Fourth Division in the 1990‚Äì91 season, but had to hand over managerial duties to coach Alan Murray in February 1991 due to brain cancer. Knowles retired in June 1991 after his declining health meant that he was no longer well enough to manage the club and died two months later at the age of 47. In 1986, Middlesbrough faced with liquidation were locked out of their ground, Ayresome Park, and the authorities had granted Middlesbrough continued League status on the proviso that they could fulfil their first fixture of the season. On the day of their first game, two games were played at the ground with Hartlepool playing their game at an earlier kick-off. 3,690 Middlesbrough supporters made the short journey to Hartlepool to see them draw 2‚Äì2 against Port Vale. In 1998, West Hartlepool R.F.C. were allowed to once again share the ground, signing an agreement that was to run until 2001, and brought a number of executive boxes with them from their previous ground, Brierton Lane. These boxes were added to the rear of the Cyril Knowles stand. West Hartlepool R.F.C. moved out in 1999. In 1996, the ground was renamed Victoria Park to reflect the large number of improvements that had been made to the infrastructure and facilities. Among the improvements were two new stands (the Cyril Knowles Stand and the Town End), new dressing rooms and offices in the old Clock Garages building to the northeast of the ground and major work on the condition of the pitch. Since 2003, groundsman Dave Brown has received an annual nomination for Groundsman of the Year awards due to the excellent state of the pitch. In 2006, Hartlepool made a bid to buy the lease of the land that the ground is on. However, Hartlepool Borough Council rejected this proposal claiming that accepting the offer would be premature in light of recent development in the area around Victoria Park. The ground has been relatively free from crowd trouble. However, when matches were played against local rivals Darlington, there was some. One of the most notorious incidents of crowd trouble came in 2000 during Hartlepool's play-off match against Darlington. Darlington manager Dave Hodgson was struck with a coin and Marco Gabbiadini was reportedly punched by a fan after the match. There have also been some Health and Safety issues regarding fans refusing to sit in the seating areas. This has forced the club to employ strict ground regulations. In 1957, the ground attracted its record attendance of 17,264 for a 3rd Round FA Cup Game against a Manchester United team managed by Matt Busby, which Hartlepool narrowly lost 4‚Äì3. This was regarded by Busby in his biography as being one of the most exciting matches he had ever witnessed. Manchester United later returned later to Victoria Park for a heavily attended friendly, only to lose 6‚Äì2. Hartlepool played three Premier League sides in cup competitions at Victoria Park in 2008‚Äì09, two of whom, West Bromwich Albion and Stoke City, were beaten by Hartlepool. Their fourth-round tie against West Ham United was televised live on ITV and attracted over 500 million viewers worldwide, Hartlepool losing 2‚Äì0 in front of a crowd of 6,849. After a successful season ticket campaign at the start of the 2011‚Äì12 season, which saw the club sell over 5,000 season tickets, Hartlepool had the highest percentage of their ground full in their division. In the latter half of the 2012‚Äì13 season, Gateshead played home games at Victoria Park after drainage problems at Gateshead International Stadium. Middlesbrough U21s began to play their home games at Victoria Park in the 2013‚Äì14 season. Following the tragic death of former Hartlepool United manager Neale Cooper in 2018, the Club decided to rename from the Cameron's Brewery Stand to the Neale Cooper Stand. Location The ground is on Clarence Road, close to the town centre. This allows visitors access to a large range of pubs. The most popular pub for visiting fans is the Corner Flag, between the Cameron's Brewery Stand and the Rink End. The Victoria Suite is also at the ground but is for members only. The ground's location also makes parking easier as it is near several large car parks such as the Jackson's Landing and other retail parks. The ground is ¬Ω mile from Hartlepool railway station. Other uses In December 2004, local player David Wheater scored the winning goal in England under-18s' 1‚Äì0 friendly win over Scotland under-18s, played before 4,959 fans at Victoria Park. England under-18s lost 2‚Äì0 to their French counterparts at Victoria Park in September 2006, after two goals from David N'Gog. Danny Welbeck and Danny Drinkwater scored in England under-18s' 2‚Äì0 win over Austria in April 2008, before 2,306 supporters at Victoria Park. England versus Sweden, 2014 The England women's national football team beat Sweden 4‚Äì0 in an August 2014 friendly at Victoria Park. It was the female England team's first game in the North East since a 1‚Äì1 draw with Italy at Roker Park, Sunderland in November 1995. Several of the English players came from the North East, including Jordan Nobbs whose father Keith had played 327 times for Hartlepool United. Fara Williams broke the national record by winning her 130th cap in the match. Victoria Park is one of the town's most popular conferencing venues, offering a range of facilities to suit a variety of needs, with three different suites (The Centenary Suite, CK Suite and the Maidens Suite). Victoria Park has also been used for employability training to help improve the town's unemployment figures and has an after-school programme which teaches children literacy and numeracy skills. The ground was the home of Pitch Invasion Festival in May 2012. It saw around 5,000 people attend the two-day event which had live music across two stages and a small funfair. James Arthur played the festival with his band a few months before he won talent show The X Factor. Future plans In 2012 IOR made several bids to buy the ground from the council only for them to be rejected. June 2012 saw plans for IOR to take control of the ground from the council, which will include development to the local area with a children's play area and student houses built outside the ground along with a hotel built within the ground. 'The Mill House Master Plan' also has plans for the away end to be extended with a capacity of 3,000. The \\"world class\\" facilities would bring an estimated ¬£90 million to the town's local economy. The plan is backed by hometown footballer Steve Fletcher and former Hartlepool player and twice European Cup winner John McGovern. The plans have come with mixed reviews from local councillors whom have had talks and delayed a vote until next year. IOR eventually sold the club, presumably because they weren‚Äôt given permission from the council to expand. No expansion plans are now in talks as Hartlepool United were relegated to the National League in their 2016-17 season.

In the seventeenth century the silver real was established at two billon reals (reales de vell√≥n) or sixty-eight maraved√≠s. Gold escudos (worth 16 reales) were also issued. The coins circulated throughout Spain's colonies and beyond, with the eight-real piece, known in English as the Spanish dollar, becoming an international standard and spawning, among other currencies, the United States dollar. A reform in 1737 set the silver real at two and half billon reals (reales de vell√≥n) or eighty-five maraved√≠s. This coin, called the real de plata fuerte, became the new standard, issued as coins until the early 19th century. The gold escudo was worth 16 reales de plata fuerte. History Coins were produced at mints in Bogot√°, Caracas, Guatemala City, Lima, Mexico City, Popay√°n, Potos√≠, Santo Domingo and Santiago. For details, see the: * Colombian reales * Mexican reales * Peruvian reales * Santo Domingo reales * Venezuelan reales After the independence of Spain's colonies, the real was replaced by currencies also denominated in reales and escudos, including the Argentine real, Central American Republic real, Ecuadorian real, Honduran real, Paraguayan real and Santo Domingo real. Coins From 1572 to 1773 Spanish colonial silver coins were cobs. Initially cut from a silver bar and hammer struck on a coin die, they were accurate in weight, though sometimes debased in precious metal content. However unlike machined coins, they were often irregular in shape, especially if a too-thick coin was clipped by the mint to reach the proper weight. After 1732 similar, but better shaped cobs were produced on screw presses. Cob denominations were , 1, 2, 4, and 8 reales. When circulating in New England the larger coins might be cut to give intermediate values; since a real was nicknamed a \\"bit\\", the expression \\"two bits\\" came to mean a quarter dollar.Spanish Colonial Cobs: Introduction Unlike in Spain, the copper coins were generally not struck by the colonial mints. Most issued silver coins in denominations of , , 1, 2, 4 and 8 reales and gold coins for , 1, 2, 4 and 8 escudos. Exceptions were the Santo Domingo mint, which did strike maraved√≠es in the sixteenth century and the Caracas mint which issued fraction of real copper coins in the early nineteenth century to facilitate commerce.

L. R. James and Martin Glaberman that existed in the United States from approximately 1951 until it split in 1962. History The Correspondence Publishing Committee has its origins in the Johnson-Forest Tendency led by C. L. R. James and Raya Dunayevskaya. Its origins are as a Trotskyist organization but it developed a number of theories including that the Soviet Union was a State Capitalist society, an emphasis on Hegelian theory as a way of understanding the world and a rejection of the Leninist vanguard party. It also sought to focus more energy on the political issues affecting women, youth, African Americans and rank and file workers. It also had an emphasis on analysing popular culture such as movies and books that was unusual for the era. After spending time as a faction inside both the Workers Party and the Socialist Workers Party, the Johnson-Forest Tendency broke with the Trotskyist left. By early 1951, it had renamed itself Correspondence Publishing Committee. It first published a newspaper, also known as Correspondence, in November 1951 and analysed a wildcat miners' strike in West Virginia in the first issue. The newspapers' cartoons have drawn critical acclaim. It was forced to deal with the deportation of one of its main leaders, C. L. R. James, to Britain in 1953 that had a negative impact on the group. Although C. L. R. James continued to advise the group on a very regular basis from Britain, tensions in the group continued and a significant number led by Raya Dunayevskaya split from Correspondence in 1955 to form News and Letters and promote Marxist-Humanist ideas. They publish a newspaper by the same name that remains in print today. Whether a majority or a minority split from Correspondence in 1955 remains in dispute. Historian Kent Worcester claims that Raya Dunayevskaya had a majority of the members in 1955 but Martin Glaberman, writing in New Politics has claimed the opposite. He has also challenged other aspects of Worcester's book in a review that appeared in Against the Current magazine. After the split, James Boggs was named the new editor of Correspondence newspaper. It issued a number of interesting pamphlets including Martin Glaberman's Union Committeemen and Wildcat Strikes in 1955 and C. L. R. James' Every Cook Can Govern: A Study of Democracy in Ancient Greece. The latter favourably analyzed democracy in the Greek city states, despite the oppression that women and slaves experienced in ancient Greek society. However, Correspondence will perhaps be best remembered for the book about the 1956 Hungarian workers' revolt, Facing Reality, by C. L. R. James, Grace Lee Boggs and Pierre Chaulieu, a pseudonym for Cornelius Castoriadis. However, the group split again in 1962 when Grace Lee Boggs, James Boggs, Freddy Paine and Lyman Paine split from C. L. R. James. They continued to publish Correspondence for a couple of years but increasingly reflected Third Worldist, somewhat Maoist politics. Martin Glaberman and others who remained loyal to C. L. R. James started a new organization known as Facing Reality that continued to promote the same politics as Correspondence until its dissolution in 1970. Facing Reality The most important contribution of this group was the publication of the book, Facing Reality. It analyzed the implications of the October 1956 revolt in Hungary against Stalinist rule. The nature of the contribution by Cornelius Castoriadis is complex because he apparently did not have an opportunity to examine the manuscript before it went to press. The book argued that the example of Hungary demonstrated that modern society was shifting towards confrontation between workers' councils and bureaucratic institutions. Therefore, organizations such as Correspondence were needed. It also included a defense of the role of revolutionary newspapers, such as the one published by Correspondence. There was also analysis of the radical potential of anti- colonial movements such as the Gold Coast nationalist movement that had emerged in what is now Ghana. Attention was paid to the role of Kwame Nkrumah. The book was sharply criticized by Raya Dunayevskaya. Sources * Kent Worcester, C.L.R.

The score was composed by Cole Porter. Plot summary While on leave, sailor Ted Barker (played by James Stewart) meets Nora Paige (Eleanor Powell) at the Lonely Hearts Club, which is owned by Jenny Saks (Una Merkel), the wife of fellow sailor Gunny Saks (Sid Silvers). Ted instantly falls in love with Nora. Ted later meets Broadway star Lucy James (Virginia Bruce) aboard a submarine while she's on a publicity tour. Her Pekingese falls overboard, Ted rescues it, and Lucy falls in love with him. Though Ted has already scheduled a date with Nora, he is ordered by his captain, Dingby (Raymond Walburn), to meet Lucy in a nightclub. Nora, who lives with Jenny and her daughter, Sally (Juanita Quigley), aspires to become a Broadway dancer. However, her newfound career is in serious jeopardy when she inadvertently comes between Lucy and her boss McKay (Alan Dinehart). Nora distances herself from Ted after seeing pictures of him and Lucy in a newspaper the next morning. Lucy convinces McKay to stop the press campaign, threatening to leave the Broadway production if any more photos or articles about her and Ted are published. Nora becomes Lucy's understudy and thinks about her behavior towards Ted. Nora gets fired suddenly after McKay tells her to perform a dance that Lucy considers undanceable. But Ted knows exactly what to do after he's told the whole story.

The film co-stars James Stewart as Powell's love interest and Virginia Bruce as the film's resident femme fatale and Powell's rival. Powell's Broadway Melody co-stars Buddy Ebsen and Frances Langford return to provide comedy and musical support. Highlights of the film include a rare musical number by Stewart (which the actor later poked fun at in the That's Entertainment! retrospective), and a bombastic finale called \\"Swingin' the Jinx Away\\". Set amidst a pre-Second World War naval backdrop, the Depression-era \\"feel good\\" number (which runs nearly 10 minutes) makes topical references to the economy and political leaders (with a \\"shout out\\" to Cab Calloway thrown in for good measure) sung by Powell, adds in an eccentric dance routine by Ebsen, and ends in a flurry of tap dancing by Powell culminating in a patriotic salute, and finally a blast of cannon fire. This finale was also lifted in its entirety and re-used in another Powell film, I Dood It, co-starring Red Skelton. Although considered one of Powell's (and MGM's) most memorable musical numbers, and often featured in retrospectives such as That's Entertainment!, musical director Roger Edens was often quoted as being embarrassed by the segment. The film introduced the Porter standards \\"You'd Be So Easy to Love\\" (performed by Stewart and Marjorie Lane, dubbed for Powell) and \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" (performed by Bruce), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. It was the first film in which Stewart sang. Some of the musical numbers were recorded in stereophonic sound, making this one of the first films to utilize multi-channel technology. Rhino Records included the stereo tracks in its soundtrack album, released on CD, including Jimmy Stewart's and Marjorie Lane's performance of \\"You'd Be So Easy to Love.\\" Accolades The film was nominated for two Academy Awards; Cole Porter was nominated for Best Song for \\"I've Got You Under My Skin,\\" and Dave Gould was nominated for Best Dance Direction.

Herriot represented both Scotland and the Scottish League XI. Career Herriot was an apprentice bricklayer playing part-time for Junior club DouglasdaleMore Douglas Players  Jim Herriot, A History of Football in Douglasdale, 12 July 2009 before he joined Dunfermline Athletic in 1958. He became the Pars established number 1 when Eddie Connachan left for Middlesbrough in 1963. Herriot adopted the American Football technique of applying boot polish under and around his eyes to reduce the effects of glare from the sun. Herriot helped Dunfermline reach the 1965 Scottish Cup Final, which they lost 3‚Äì2 to Celtic. Herriot was transferred to Birmingham City for ¬£18,000 in 1965. He was a fixture in the City side during the next four-and-a- half years and eventually gained international recognition. He made his Scotland debut in October 1968, in a 1‚Äì0 defeat by Denmark in a friendly in Copenhagen, and played a further seven times for the national side. His last cap came just a year after his first, in a 3‚Äì2 defeat by West Germany in a FIFA World Cup qualifier in Hamburg. By 1970 Herriot had fallen from favour at St Andrew's and, following loan spells with Mansfield Town and Aston Villa, he left for South African club Durban City. He returned to Britain in 1971, joining Eddie Turnbull's developing Hibernian side. With Hibs he won his first career honour, the 1972‚Äì73 Scottish League Cup, as well as the fledgling Drybrough Cup on two occasions. He left the Edinburgh side to join St Mirren in 1973, then moved to Partick Thistle in 1975. After a spell on loan with Morton in October 1975 he returned to Dunfermline Athletic in early 1976 before joining Morton permanently for the 1976‚Äì77 season. He retired from the game in the summer of 1977. Literary alter ego Herriot is probably best known today for giving his name to the writer James Herriot, a Yorkshire vet whose real name was Alf Wight. Wight needed a pen-name to comply with professional rules banning advertising and chose Jim Herriot's name after seeing him play for Birmingham City in a televised match against Manchester United.
