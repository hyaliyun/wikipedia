Over the last one year, Star Plus' viewership amongst all demographics has increased significantly on the back of fresh engaging content. However, progressive young women have forged a especially strong bond with us. This show will resonate with them, highlighting their dreams and aspirations and a take on love that they will find refreshing.‚Äù Speaking about her role, Rajshri Pandey said, \\"Suhani is simple, innocent, pure at heart. She finds good in everyone and loves her family but what makes her different from other characters is that she is funny, cracks jokes and does not cry. Suhani is soft spoken but gives back to people, if they are mean to her, she sweetly tells them off.\\" Neha Yadav stated taking inspiration from Kareena Kapoor's character Geet in Jab We Met for her role of Soumya. Sahil Mehta made his television debut with the series after his bollywood career did not succeed. =Casting= Due to the twenty years leap in September 2016, lead Sahil Mehta quit as he refused ageing. But on popular demand, he returned back. However in February 2017, he quit with his character being killed. Owing to the same reason, lead Neha Yadav and Debashree Biswas also quit while Ankita Sharma was roped as adult Krishna. As she met with an accident day before the shoot, Sristi Jain was immediately cast. Sharmin Kazi and Mridul Kabir were cast as Yuvaani and Yuvaan. After Mehta's exit, Gaurav Mukesh quit in March 2017.  References   External links  * Suhani Si Ek Ladki Streaming on Hotstar.

The club is most notable for its three-year stint in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) second division in the 1980s. History The Kilsyth Football Club was formed in 1923, and played initially in the Ringwood District Football League, then later in the Croydon-Ferntree Gully Football League. In 1962, the club was a founding member of the Eastern District Football League, and played there until 1981. Despite being a small EDFL club and having finished last in the EDFL's second division in 1981, Kilsyth joined the Victorian Football Association second division for the 1982 season as part of the VFA's restructuring and expansion in the early 1980s. The outer north- eastern suburbs were not otherwise represented in the VFA, and Kilsyth hoped that it would be able to attract some of the best local talent out of the EDFL and into its VFA team; but this never happened, and the club endured three seasons in Division 2 with very little success. The club still intended to continue in the VFA in 1985, but it withdrew shortly before the season began and returned to the Eastern District Football League in 1986. As of 2014, the club plays in the Eastern Football League's fourth division. Club symbols The club's nickname is the Cougars, and the guernsey is currently black with red sash. In 1983, the club reversed its colours to red with a black sash ‚Äì partly because of its similarity to the guernsey of VFA Division 1 club Coburg, and partly because the VFA was discouraging its clubs from wearing the same guernsey design as Victorian Football League clubs (Kilsyth's guernsey matched Essendon's). Since 1997, the club has played home matches at Pinks Reserve in Liverpool Road; prior to that, and during its time in the VFA, the club had played at the Kilsyth Recreation Reserve in Colchester Road.

There were four classes, the yangban nobility, the \\"middle class\\" chungin, sangmin, or the commoners and the cheonmin, the outcasts at the very bottom. Society was ruled by the yangban, who constituted 10% of the population and had several privileges. Slaves were of the lowest standing. During this period clan structure became stricter and bloodline was of utmost importance. Family life was regulated by law, strictly enforcing Confucian rituals. Compared to Goryeo practices before, marriage rituals were restructured and aggravated. Noblemen could have only one wife and several concubines but their children born from commoner or slave concubines were considered illegitimate and denied any yangban rights. The roles and rights of women were reduced compared to previous eras in Korean history. Yangban women were completely hidden from the outer world and every woman had to conform to Confucian ideals of purity, obedience, chastity and faithfulness. Women were subjects of male dominance throughout their lives, obliged to listen to their fathers, husbands, fathers-in-law and firstborn sons. Homes were divided into male and female quarters to separate the sexes. Guiding principles Korean society has always been hierarchical and the conscious, government-backed spreading of Neo-Confucianism reinforced this idea. Even though the philosophy originates in China, Japan and Vietnam also adopted it, Korea integrated Confucianism into daily life, transformed it to fit the nation's needs and developed it in a way that became specific to Korea. Korean society in Joseon was built upon the three fundamental principles (samgang, ) and five moral disciplines (oryun, ): * samgang: **chung (): loyalty to the king **hyo (): filial obedience to the parents **yeol (): differentiation between men and women * oryun: ** ui (): righteousness and justice: the relationship between monarch and the people ** chin (): warmth and closeness between parents and children ** byeol (): differentiation between husband and wife ** seo (): order between seniors and juniors ** sin (): trust between friends This means that Korean society placed utmost importance on hierarchy between classes, older and younger people, emphasized family values, the keeping of order and harmony and the inferior social status of women. Rituals became very important, ceremonies, paying respect to one's ancestors and the need for lifelong learning were valued. Neo-Confucians considered hard work, purity, politeness and refraining from improper behaviour as desirable and valuable human qualities. They could be regarded as prudish, since showing passionate emotions was something noble people were expected to avoid. It was important that everyone knew their standings in society and behaved accordingly. The Korean language reflects this notion even today, by the use of honorifics, which signal whether the speaker addresses a senior person or someone of a higher social standing. Direct communication between the king and the common people was possible through the sangeon () written petition system and the gyeokjaeng () oral petition system. Through the gyeokjaeng oral petition system, commoners could strike a gong or drum in front of the palace or during the king's public processions in order to appeal their grievances or petition to the king directly. This allowed even the illiterate members of Joseon society to make a petition to the king. More than 1,300 gyeokjaeng-related accounts are recorded in the Ilseongnok. Structure Photograph of a yangban man from 1863 The basis of Joseon society was a system similar to caste systems. Historian Baek Ji-won considers the Korean system comparable to that of India. According to Michael Seth, the Korean system could, in principle, be compared to India's (apart from the religious connotations). In practice, however, classes may not have been as impenetrable and clearly separated as in India. Bruce Cumings, on the other hand, thinks that the Korean structure cannot be called a true caste system but a system where certain castes existed. In theory, there were three social classes, but in practice, there were four. The top class were the yangban, or \\"scholar-gentry\\", the commoners were called sangmin or yangmin, and the lowest class was that of the cheonmin. Between the yangban and the commoners was a fourth class, the chungin, \\"middle people\\". The ruling class and the recipient of privileges was the yangban class. This elite aristocracy was hereditary and held most of the wealth, the slaves and the land. They were also called sadaebu, \\"scholar-officials\\", because when compared to Goryeo aristocracy or the Japanese bushido, they were not landowners who engaged in military actions. Yangban strove to do well at the royal examinations to obtain high positions in the government. They did not pay any form of taxes, and they avoided manual labor and conscription. However they had to excel in calligraphy, poetry, classical Chinese texts, and Confucian rites. In theory, commoners could apply for royal exams but in practice, from the 1600s, the family background of applicants was thoroughly checked and had to provide evidence of yangban status on their father's side up to three generations and one generation on the mother's side. Nobles lived separately from commoners, in designated areas of a town or village and spent most of their free time at Confucian academies or gisaeng houses. Yangban families were rare in the northern and eastern parts of the country and on Jeju Island and were mostly demoted yangban that were exiled there. High government positions were filled by yangban from Gyeongsang and Chungcheong provinces mainly. The scholar- aristocracy made up about 10% of Korea's population. Civilian offices (munban), as well as military posts (muban) were occupied by yangban men, the latter were filled by provincial yangban, whose only way to obtain a scholarly certificate was to become military officials. The men were prepared for the exam by the muhak, the military schools. From the mid-Joseon period, they belonged to different lineages than the civilian officials. Around 80% of Joseon society was made up of commoners, called sangmin. They were a free class, obliged to pay taxes, serve in the army, and undertake corv√©e labour. Peasants, artisans, fishermen and merchants made up this class, but merchants were regarded as lowly by yangban. Some peasants owned their lands, but others cultivated yangban property as tenants. The last place on the social ladder was the outsider class, the cheonmin. Slaves belonged here. They were divided into two groups: sanobi (private slaves) and gongnobi (slaves owned by the state). Both groups had \\"in-house slaves\\" (solgeo nobi) and \\"outside slaves\\" (oegeo nobi). The latter lived like any peasant, could own property and, just like peasants, gave a portion of the crop or textile tributes to their owners. The number of slaves fluctuated throughout the Joseon period: there were times when their numbers reached 30% of the population. Slaves could not have family names except for those who already had one when they became enslaved. In theory, marriage between slaves and commoners was forbidden, but the rule was often ignored. By the end of the dynasty, the number of slaves declined. State slavery was abolished in 1800 while private slavery was finally banned in 1894. Besides slaves, people of certain professions were also numbered among the cheonmin class. For example, professionals dealing with animal slaughter (butchers, people working with animal skins), most probably because of old Buddhist views. Innkeepers, gisaengs, entertainers, gravediggers, bark peelers, basket makers, shamans and ferrymen were also cheonmin people. It was a hereditary status, and their children were not allowed to advance on the social ladder. Painting depicting chungin people The middle class, called chungin or jungin was a small but important one. They were below the yangban nobles but above the common people. They were usually \\"technical experts\\", such as interpreters, scribes, astronomers, accountants, physicians, jurists and musicians. Provincial small officeholders also belonged to this class. They oversaw local bureaucracy and so were impossible to overlook. Many of them became wealthy, some by exploiting peasants. In the 19th century, chungin who spoke foreign languages were the ones who introduced Western culture to Korea. The chungin people also included the illegitimate children of yangban. Born from commoner or slave concubines, they made up a substrate within the chungin, called seoeol. The illegitimate children of the scholar-gentry were not allowed to be recognised as yangban and so could not inherit land or wealth from their fathers or participate in government exams. Their fate caused much discussion among Confucian scholars, as recognising their existence would have meant that the well-defined lines between commoners and nobility would have been blurred. Joseon society is special in that the elite class remained the same for many centuries. While there were constant wars, with different groups changing in top positions throughout Europe and Asia, the Korean ruling class remained largely untouched, from Goryeo times to the end of the Joseon dynasty. The structure of the social system also remained the same for five centuries, which is unique in the world. Clans, family and marriage Tables set for jesa ceremonies depicted in an early Joseon painting Korea has a clan system, every Korean belongs to a bongwan (Î≥∏Í¥Ä) that can trace ancestry back to the founding father of the clan. Different clans may share certain surnames, differentiated by the founding city or town of the clan. Clan structure had existed well before the founding of Joseon but the spread of Confucianism made its rules stricter, dogmatized in state laws. Clans are based upon paternal blood lineage, named jok (), pa () or munjung (). The history of the clan, with birth, marriage and death details of its members are registered in the jokbo () even today. This kind of registry making became regular in the 15th century. Traitors and sentenced criminals were expelled from the clan and from the lineage. Outsiders could not join a lineage. Family life was regulated by the Gyeongguk daejeon (), a code of law compiled in the 15th century. It regulated the jesa, the ancestor rituals, emphasizing that ancestors are important members of a lineage. Jesa is conducted by the oldest male family member of the deceased, the other family members line up behind him according to their ranks in the family. Rituals have strict rules and pre- set orders, with the type of sacrificial food and its placement order defined, as well. These rituals became common and solidified during the Joseon era. Royal wedding reenactment in the Unhyeongung palace in Seoul, with the \\"king\\" on the left Just like rituals, marriage also had stern rules to follow. While in Goryeo marriage within members of the same clan was permitted, Joseon took exogamy very seriously and forbade such marriages, even if a clan had more than a million members. Michael Seth, professor of history at the James Madison University, claims that the reason for this was the adaptation of the gwageo (), the government examination system of China, as well as the integration of Confucianism into everyday life, making proving one's lineage of utmost importance. Marriage was conducted at a young age, in 1471 the lowest possible age was 15 for boys and 14 for girls. Men usually got married before the age of 30, women had to be below 20. Commoners usually married at an earlier age than yangban class children. Significant age difference between husband and wife was daily occurrence. Marriage and married life rituals were regulated by Zhu Xi's Zhuzi Jiali (, , Juja garye), but customs were modified according to Korean traditions. For example, according to Confucian customs, wedding ceremonies were held at the house of the groom's father, however, in Korea the exact opposite had been the custom. As a compromise, a part of the ceremony was to be held at the bride's home, after which they would proceed to the groom's home. in Goryeo times the newlyweds usually lived at the bride's home for years, but by adapting Confucianism this had to change. The bride had to move to her new family. In practice there were occasions when the couple chose to live where the parents had a bigger need of looking after or where land was more arable. Koreans also adapted another Chinese custom, the minmyeoneuri (), or child brides, when 6- and 7-year-old girls were given off to marriage. They usually spent the years leading up to the actual wedding ceremony at their mothers-in-law's, where they worked as maids. This custom was not widespread and mainly observed by poor families, who could not afford to have a wedding otherwise. Because of such poor conditions, it could happen that the age difference between the bride and the groom was more than 30 years. The most important possession for a Korean family was the firstborn son, or jangja (). It had always been the case, but Confucianism strengthened the idea even further. It was so important that no man could die without having a male heir. If they were unable to produce one, they had to adopt (from the same lineage). Most of the wealth and land of the family was inherited by the firstborn son, and other sons also inherited some part of it; girls were denied any such rights. Men were allowed to have more than one wife and several concubines. Women Sseugae chima, used by lower-class women to hide their faces when going out Gisaeng clothing at a Korean fashion show held in Vietnam During the Goryeo Dynasty women had considerable freedom. They could freely mingle with men, have their own possessions, and inherit land. That changed drastically during the second half of the Joseon era after the Imjin War, women's situation became gradually worse. Their life was regulated by Neo-Confucianism but in a much stricter way than in China, which started the philosophy. Women had to conform to Confucian ideals, as children they were subordinated to their fathers, when they married, to their husbands, and when they got old, to their firstborn son. Being virtuous, modest, obedient and faithful was required of them; virtuous women were rewarded by the state from 1434. Yangban noblewomen were completely segregated from the rest of society. During the day they could not leave their homes, and if they had to, they were transported in a litter called gama (). They were forbidden to play games and have fun outside their homes or they could be beaten. These ideals and segregation could not completely be maintained in the lower classes, as commoner and slave women had various works to do. Nevertheless, even the peasant houses had separate rooms for men and women, and wealthier families had male and female quarters: sarangchae, or \\"outer rooms\\" () for men and anche () or anbang (), \\"inner rooms\\" for women. By the end of the Joseon Dynasty commoner women who had fulfilled their Confucian duties of bearing a son bared their breasts in public as a sign of pride. Noblewomen were forbidden to do so. Most women were illiterate, as schools taught men exclusively. Even after the introduction of hangul, when literacy improved, women who could read and write made up only 4% as late as the 19th century. Women of the yangban could receive an education from within the family, for instance the 18th century crown princess Lady Hyegyeong was taught to read and write hangul by an aunt-in-law. Women were not allowed to learn hanja, the Chinese characters used to write Korean. Women were also denied the right to participate in the jesa, the ancestor honoring rituals, which is also a significant divergence from the original Chinese practices. Households headed by women disappeared at the beginning of the Joseon era, and they gradually lost their right to inheritance, as well. The reason was that marrying daughters off required expensive dowry, resulting in calling daughters dodungnyeo (), \\"thieves\\". As according to the new Confucian ideals, women had to obey their in-laws after marriage, the birth family regarded it unnecessary to provide her inheritance. Married daughters were often labelled chulga oein (), \\"one who left the family and became a stranger\\". Women had to obey their husbands and in-laws and had no right to apply for a divorce. Men could divorce their wives based on the chilgeojiak (), the \\"seven sins\\": disobedience towards in-laws, inability to bear a son, adultery, jealousy, hereditary disease, talkativeness and theft. Women were expected to be faithful to their husbands beyond death so widows were not allowed to remarry. In lower classes such marriages still happened, as families, for financial reasons, married off the burdensome widows to men who could not afford to marry otherwise. While the breaking of the rule in lower classes was widely ignored by authorities, yangban widows were forbidden to remarry, or their children would be cast out of the noble class. Members of the royal lineage were treated even more strictly, with Seongjong of Joseon ordering the execution of his cousin when he discovered she had cohabited with a servant after being widowed. As women could not be the heads of a household anymore, widows often were considered financial burdens and sometimes driven to commit suicide. Women were expected to protect their virtue at any cost, and by the late Joseon era they often wore small knives called paedo () attached to the norigae (the colourful pendant hanging from the upper part of the hanbok), to commit suicide rather than dishonor their families even by giving cause to gossips. Men could have second wives besides their first wife and have several concubines, as well. Being a second wife or a concubine of a nobleman was considered a rise on the social ladder for commoner or slave women, but their children were considered illegitimate and denied any yangban rights. First wives and legitimate children of noblemen often despised these women and their offspring. Society considered these children outcasts. Women could only have four types of \\"professions\\" in Joseon: they could become gungnyeo (palace women), shamans, physicians or gisaeng. The latter, who are often compared to Japanese geisha, could live a freer life than most women. They could read and write, were skilled in music, arts, poetry and served as intellectual companions to men in a period where wives were not allowed to be true companions because of the Confucian restrictions. The most famous gisaeng is probably Hwang Jin-yi, who lived in the 16th century and is considered a role model of progressive, self-conscious women in Korea. By the end of the era, women almost became \\"nameless\\" in Korea. They were referred to mostly by their husband's or children's names (\\"...'s wife\\", \\"...'s mother\\").

Tours had spoken to a Belgian entrepreneur, Frederick the Hault, founder of the French General Tramways Company and with that the company commissioned the first network of public transport in the city, pulled by horses on 8 July 1877. Another operator extended the network in 1889 to Vouvray along the Loire, on 7.6 km, with trams hauled by steam locomotives. A new company, the Tramways Company Tours was founded in 1898 to electrify and expand the urban network, which reaches 20 km in 1900. During the First World War in 1916 some sections were abandoned. Suburban lines closed in 1932 before road competition from private buses. The tram network was seriously damaged during the Second World War, particularly during the bombing of the tramway facilities in Tours on 20 May 1944, which destroyed the depot. Facilities were repaired as much as possible and the network operated until 14 September 1949, when the last tram was replaced by buses.

Origin and name The Red Palace and Red Square used to be an old- style school during the Ming Dynasty. In 1927, between November 18 and 21, the Haifeng Soviet Congress of Worker-Peasant-Soldiers was held there. During this congress, the Haifeng Soviet Government was established. The congress also decided to brush walls around the palace with red paint and cover the indoor walls with red cloth, imitating the Red Palace in Moscow, Russia. Hence, the first Red regime was established. They also gave this old-style school a new name‚ÄîRed Palace. After that, many important meetings were held in the Red Palace and the square to the east of it was named the Red Square. It was called ‚ÄúDongcang Bu‚Äù () before that and covered an area of more than 22 square kilometers.

Work on other languages is in progress. This is one of the many projects taken up to develop interactive products for developing countries at IDC.  Motivation  22 official languages India is a multilingual country with 1,635 languages (including dialects and sub dialects) while Indian currency notes display 15 major languages. Although smartphone penetration is increasing in India, text input in Indic scripts has been a challenge for many years. According to the 2005 India Human Development Survey, the surveyed households reported that 72 per cent of men did not speak any English, 28 per cent spoke some English, and five per cent spoke fluent English. Among women, the corresponding percentages were 83, 17, and 3. While Indian languages are preferred in other means of communication in India (e.g. oral and written communication, radio, TV, newspapers and magazines), English is still the most preferred language for text input. The focus of this project is to increase the Indian text input on smartphones and tablets. A better text input mechanism will be helpful to people with little or no knowledge of English, and also for those who prefer not to use English.  Challenges  Devanagari INSCRIPT Keyboard Text entry in Indian Languages has many challenges. Devanagari, for example, requires 52-65 keys to input just the frequently used characters (25 consonants, 9 semi-vowels, 3 frequent conjuncts, 13 vowels, a halant and the 13 vowel modifiers), whereas 26 keys are sufficient to represent Latin script. The government standard Inscript uses 42 keys but takes away many punctuation marks, including commonly used ones such as question marks and quotation marks. Further, it clubs unrelated characters on same key such as ‡§Æ ‡§£, ‡§π ‡§ô, ‡§ç ‡•ß, ‡§∞ ‡•©, ‡§ú‡•ç‡§û ‡•´, ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ ‡•¨, ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑ ‡•≠, ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞. This is believed to be why Inscript and most other qwerty-based text input mechanisms have not become popular up until now.  History  Researchers at IDC have been working on alternatives to QWERTY- based keyboards for Indic text input since 2001. Earlier projects included the design of hardware devices such as Dynakey, Barakhadi, KeylekhKeylekh: a keyboard for text entry in indic scripts and e-Lekh. As mobile phones became smarter and more powerful, this group started working on text input alternatives for mobile phones in 2007 with Saral.Saral: Devanagari text input system in mobile phones Swarachakra and Disha were two designs developed in 2010 for touch-screen devices.Design and evaluation of Devanagari virtual keyboards for touch screen mobile phones In June 2013, Swarachakra was launched on Android devices. , more than 20 lakh people have downloaded Swarachakra from Google play store.

He sat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1872 to 1880.  Early life and family  He was the son of Edward Wells from Wallingford, where his family had lived since the early 18th century. He became a banker and brewer, and an alderman of the town. His brother Thomas Frederick Wells (1837‚Äì1907) was also an alderman of the town, and served 4 times as its mayor. The tall chimneys of their family business, the Wallingford Brewery, dominated the town's skyline. He married a niece of Sir Matthew Wood, a former Lord Mayor of London.  Political career  Wells was elected at a by-election in March 1872 as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Wallingford, filling the vacancy caused the death of the Conservative MP Stanley Vickers. The election took place in public, and the returning officer reminded voters that with a secret ballot about to be introduced, this was likely to be their last public election. A Mr Moffat had been canvassing, with the intention of contesting the seat for the Liberal Party, but had withdrawn and left the town. Wells was therefore the only candidate, so he was returned without a vote. In his acceptance speech he opposed secular education, supported a reduction in income tax, and denounced the Ballot Bill as \\"positively un-English\\". He was re-elected in 1874, but at the general election in 1880 he was defeated by the Liberal candidate Walter Wren, by a margin of 581 votes to 542. Wells lodged a petition, alleging bribery and treating by his opponent and his agents. The petition was upheld, and the election was declared void. A by-election was held in July 1880, where Wells did not stand. The seat was won by another Liberal candidate, Pandeli Ralli. That result was also the subject of a petition (though not by Wells), when it was found that voters had been bribed. However, it was not proven that the bribery had been done by an agent of Mr Ralli, so the election result was upheld. In 1909, Wells was re-elected as a churchwarden of St Mary's Church in Wallingford, for his 67th year in the post. This was claimed to be a record for the United Kingdom.

The company produces chocolate and sugar coated confections (i.e. almonds, nuts etc.), but is particularly known for its drag√©es (sugar-coated chocolate and almonds), which feature often in Christian and Islamic traditions and celebrations. The recipe and preparation of its drag√©es, dating back over 125 years ago, are still followed today. In 2012, Vanparys extended its range of confections to include a 'gourmet' range of chocolate-coated nuts, fruits and coffee beans ‚Äì as well as a variety of seasonal confectioneries such as pralin√© eggs and fondant chicks for Easter. Presently the company is located in Evere, Brussels, and exports to many countries including the Netherlands, France, Luxembourg, UK, Germany, Poland, China, Turkey, Tunisia, Japan and Portugal.

In 1922, Emile Vanparys (Felix‚Äôs nephew) took control and relocated the growing production line to larger premises in Brussels. He improved the coating technique while also making the sweets more accessible in price. When almonds grew scarce due to a bad harvest across Europe, Emile decided to replace them with an almond- shaped nugget of chocolate. This new type of drag√©e was eventually copied by the competition and has since become more popular across Europe than the traditional almond ones. By 1935, the Vanparys business had grown to 80 employees, but over the next few years production faltered due to the Second World War. = 1945‚Äì1998 = Progress resumed when the war ended. In 1945, Constant Vanparys took over the family business, and when its competitors had to stop producing drag√©es due to tough economic conditions, Vanparys recruited their staff. In 1957, Princess Grace of Monaco opted for yellow color drag√©es for the christening of her daughter Princess Caroline of Monaco, which led to the fact that the colors other than blue, rose and white, came into vogue. Following that trend, Vanparys also expanded its range and introduced 25 additional colors the same year. = Modern history = In 1998, the Belgian confectioner Andr√© De Greef, together with his two sons, assumed control of the company, the first non-family members to do so.

Early life  Born in the refugee camp at Porto Recanati, to a mother who had escaped Nazi deportation and a father who had fought with the Anglo-Polish forces, in late 1948 he and his family moved to South America. He spent the first few years of his life in the Misiones and Iguaz√∫ forests, and in Paraguay and the Chaco region. In Buenos Aires he witnessed the bombing of the Casa Rosada, and the fall of Per√≥n (1955).  Career  Lina Sastri When Kokocinski was young, he joined the circus in the Argentine capital. He soon moved into theatre, having studied set design at the school of Saulo Benavente. He designed the sets for ‚ÄúEl Guapo del Novecento‚Äù. After being filed on police record by the military regime, he was forced to take refuge in Santiago de Chile. His drawings of political protest were exhibited at various universities in Chile. His works were presented by the art critic Mario Pedrosa, and by writers Enrique Araya and Delia del Carril. He worked on the Allende government‚Äôs agrarian reform, in partnership with the Catholic University of Santiago de Chile. Kokocinski was already in Europe by the time Allende fell from government. He exhibited first in Hamburg and later in Rome, presented by Rafael Alberti (who dedicated a poem to him, entitled ‚ÄúAlejandro Kokocinski 1971, pintor‚Äù.) He settled in Rome and became a pupil of Riccardo Tomassi Ferroni, with whom he shared a studio in Trastevere, together with Carlo Quattrucci. In 1986 he moved to the Far East and lived there for a few years, travelling between South East Asia and China. In the late 1980s he moved to Germany, where he lived for four years. He then returned to Italy for good, and there founded the Kosa theatre company with the actress and singer Lina Sastri. He designed lighting, costumes and sets for six of the company's shows, all directed by and starring Sastri. In 2003 he moved to Tuscania (Lazio), where he moved his studio into an ancient, deconsecrated church. He set up the Fondazione Alessandro Kokocinski in the town, an organization aimed at supporting the creativity of young artists (from Italy and all over the world), through training and specialization courses, residential training programmes and exhibitions and events. In 2016 Kokocinski created the set design and lighting design for Lina Sastri √® il mio nome, a musical theatrical show which opened on 4 October 2016 at the Teatro Quirino, Rome. Neapolitan actress and singer Sastri spoke to Il Messaggero newspaper about the \\"prolific imagination of Alessandro Kokocinski, a truly internationally-renowned painter who observes the world through the eyes of the heart‚Äù. She said she ‚Äúhope[d] the audience appreciates his visually dramatic touch, with which I fully identify\\".  Selected exhibitions  Il cielo celato (scultura in vetroresina e rame) Kokocinski staged his second solo show in Buenos Aires in 1969. The exhibition included a series of dramatically stylized black and white pencil drawings. The subject matter was: the difficulty of a life in poverty; work; and suffering in general. In 1979 he took part in a group show at the Printshop Gallery in Amsterdam. The title of the exhibition was \\"L'immagine dell'uomo dal 1945 ad oggi\\" (\\"The image of man from 1945 to the present\\"). The selection of works was intended to illustrate how artistic creativity had reinterpreted the vision of humanity since the end of the Second World War. In 1987, at the Hong Kong Arts Festival, eighteen of Kokocinski's pieces went on display in a solo exhibition, which grouped together artists from all over the world in the then-British colony. These works mainly focused on images from the circus tradition, with acrobats and dancers moving across canvases, accompanied by impetuously leaping horses. In 1999, in Rome, three exhibitions running almost simultaneously at the Istituto Italo-latinoamericano, Palazzo della Pigna and the Galleria Italarte celebrated Kokocinski as a \\"world pilgrim\\". His portraits of men and women were \\"loaded with pathos and pain\\", according to La Stampa, and painted using superimpositions and faded colours/elements of pain to accentuate their dramatic impact. Palazzo Venezia in Rome staged an extensive one-man exhibition on Kokocinski in 2003. The exhibition comprised more than sixty works from various takes of his long creative career. One of the most important of these was La Trasfigurazione, a polyptych measuring more than 4 metres high and 14 metres long, made up of five polychrome fiberglass sculptures mounted on wooden panels resting on iron joists. In 2005 Kokocinski had an exhibition at the Museo Nazionale di Castel Sant' Angelo, Rome, with a sculpture cycle, \\"L'Ombra delle idee\\" (\\"The Shadow of Ideas\\"), inspired by the philosopher Giordano Bruno. The historian and art critic Claudio Strinati introduced the exhibition. In the same year, he took part in a group show curated by Vittorio Sgarbi entitled \\"Il Male ‚Äì Esercizi di Pittura crudele\\" (\\"Evil ‚Äì Exercises in Cruel Painting\\") at the Palazzina di Caccia di Stupinigi, in Turin, Italy. One of the artist's major achievements has been the solo show in 2006 in Beijing, at the National Art Museum of China (NAMOC), as part of the events held to celebrate the 'Year of Italy in China'. In 2008, at the Regia Hall in the Museo Nazionale di Palazzo Venezia, Kokocinski presented \\"La Potenza dello Spirito\\", a painting cycle inspired by classicism and myths. Kokocinski was one of the most popular artists in the group exhibition \\"Las Americas latinas. Las fatigas del querer\\" curated by art critic Philippe Daverio in 2009 at the Spazio Oberdan, Milan. In 2011 Kokocinski was one of the artists chosen to exhibit at the 54th Venice Art Biennale, selected by Vittorio Sgarbi, who curated the Italian Pavilion at the Arsenale. In Milan, in 2013, the Artespressione gallery presented a series of Kokocinski's drawings, made using mixed media on books and antique paper. The theme was the circus, that magical and mysterious environment in which the artist lived and worked when living in Buenos Aires as a young man. In September 2015 the Fondazione Roma Museo staged a one-man show on the artist at Palazzo Cipolla, called \\"Kokocinski. La vita e la Maschera: da Pulcinella al Clown\\" (\\"Kokocinski. The life and the Mask: from Pulcinella to Clown\\"). The exhibition reflects both \\"the history of a tormented man who has personally experienced exile, political persecution and the cruelty of the world\\" and the history \\"of the artist who transforms this into art with paintings, sculptures and installations in which the mask, the clown and Pulcinella become central subjects\\". The works \\"present themselves as the spectacle of human fragility. Restless, suffering figures yet full of hope, always struggling to defend the true sense of existence\\", commented the President of the Fondazione Roma Museo. Death Kokocinski died on the morning of 12 December 2017 in Tuscania, Italy, at the age of 69 after suffering from a long illness.

The first manor on the site known as Jernit was built by Valdemar Parberg in 1583. After the statesman Mogens Friis acquired the property in 1672, the manor was rebuilt at the end of the 17th century. In the 1860s, it was considerably expanded and redesigned in the Renaissance style. History and architecture Frijsenborg c. 1830 The property stands on the site of the former village of Jernit which had existed since the 15th century. In 1558, King Christian III gave orders for Jernit Parish to be combined with Hammel Parish which required Jernit Church to be demolished. In 1583, the king transferred ownership of the village to the nobleman Valdemar Parsberg who demolished all its buildings. In their place, he constructed a Baroque manor surrounded by a moat which he called Jernit. The Danish county of Frijsenborg consisting of Jernit, Tulstrup, Lyngballeg√•rd, Hagshom and √òsterg√•rd, was established in 1672 by the Crown for Mogens Friis (1623‚Äì1675) a high-ranking statesman, in order to compensate him for losses he had incurred in the Dano-Swedish War (1658‚Äì60). The county became one of the largest in Denmark, covering an area of . Friis renamed the manor house Frijsenborg. Renaissance renovation Count Christian Emil Krag- Juel-Vind-Frijs, who acquired the estate in 1849, commissioned the architect Ferdinand Meldahl (1827‚Äì1908) to redesign, modernize and expand the building into a luxurious manor house in the Renaissance style. Three new wings were added as well as tall steepled towers although the walls of the original ground floor were maintained. A new storey was added to the west wing while two-storied pavilions were built on the south and north wings. The work was completed in 1867. Today's building is considered to be one of the finest examples of Renaissance Revival architecture in Denmark. In 1880, the count's son Mogens returned from England, bringing with him experience of the English nobility's lifestyle which he applied to the manor, fitting it our with palatial furnishings and decorations. Since 1982, the property has been owned by Bendt Tido Hannibal Wedell. The building can be seen from the road but is not open to the public.

Its creation involved the Kingdom of Prussia, the Altona-Kiel Railway Company, neighbouring villages and towns and the town of Tonning. History  After Schleswig-Holstein was annexed by Prussia as a result of the Second Schleswig War, the Gl√ºckstadt‚ÄìElmshorn Railway Company (Gl√ºckstadt-Elmshorner Eisenbahn- Gesellschaft), which owned the railway from Hamburg to Itzehoe (now part of the Marsh Railway) was able to promote the extension of its line to Heide. The West Holstein Railway Company (Westholsteinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) opened its first 79 km long stretch from Neum√ºnster via Hohenwestedt to Heide and Weddinghusen to Karolinenkoog at the Eider estuary as the first branch line in Germany (Neum√ºnster‚ÄìHeide railway and the Heide‚ÄìKarolinenkoog railway) on 22 August 1877. From here, the town of T√∂nning on the Eiderstedt peninsula was reached by means of a steam ferry, which operated from 6 August 1878. The bridging of the river would have been too expensive because of its considerable width and only in 1886 was the Marsh Railway extended through Friedrichstadt. This extension made the line to Karolinenkoog largely unnecessary, so that the northern section was closed in 1942 after a long period of low use. On 1 November 1878, the Wesselburen‚ÄìHeide Railway Company (Wesselburen‚ÄìHeider Eisenbahngesellschaft), with the involvement of the West Holstein Railway, the Altona-Kiel Railway Company and the Wesselburen municipality, opened a line that branched off from the Heide‚ÄìKarolinenkoog railway in Weddinghusen and ran west for 11 kilometres to Wesselburen. After the Wesselburen‚ÄìHeide Railway had passed in the ownership of the West Holstein Railway Company on 1 April 1881, which already operated its trains and infrastructure, the line was extended a further 10 km to B√ºsum. Freight traffic commenced on 1 November 1883 and passenger traffic on 15 November 1883. On 1 July 1890, the Prussian state railways bought the company, including its exactly 100 km long network, and placed it under the Eisenbahndirektion (railway division headquarters) in Altona. Today Nordbahn Eisenbahngesellschaft operates passenger services from Neum√ºnster via Heide to B√ºsum. The branch-line to Karolinenkoog was closed in sections. Passenger services‚Äîas far as Hemmerwurth‚Äîended on 23 May 1954 and freight traffic operated for another five years.

Boat Race, also spelt Nowka Bais) is a traditional dragon boat-style rowing sport of Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Rowing Federation, established in 1974, is the authority of all rowing activities in Bangladesh and has organised over 40 National Rowing Championships. The races are held during the wet and autumn seasons of the Bengali calendar which corresponds from June to October in the Gregorian calendar. The \\"Nowka Bais\\" which takes place annually in Birmingham is a leading cultural event in the West Midlands, United Kingdom attracting not only the Bangladeshi diaspora but a variety of cultures. It is also the largest kind of boat race in the United Kingdom. Common elements Madhumati River. Boats used for Nouka Baich are long with each team can consist from 7 to up to 100 members known as majhis. Boats with motor engines are not allowed. Boats are usually named with attractive and boastful names displaying quality and speed. During inter-riverine competitions, teams are named after their respective 'home rivers'. It is also a social event, and it is common for the competitors to sing Sari gan folk songs as they compete during the race. A popular song is Ronger Nao Ronger Boitha, Ronge Ronge Bao (Cheerfully tune the colourful oars of the colourful boat). History A large Nouka Baich competition taking place with over hundreds of participants. With riverine Bangladesh's geography being dominated by the world's largest delta, the country has over 230 rivers in its terrain. The rivers have played an important role in the livelihoods of the native Bengali people. Common in rural areas, Nouka Baich is a very old tradition of the folk Bengali culture going back centuries. Its popularity in urban areas increased in the 18th century. The various Nawab families throughout Mughal Bengal were also known for organising races and the use of Sari gan started to become more popular. Nouka Baich was also common during the British rule in the Sylhet region after the rainy season when much of the land goes under water. The long canoes were referred to as khel naos (meaning playing boats) and the use of cymbals to accompany the singing was common. Boat variation Nouka Baich taking place in Kaliganga River, South Bengal. Different types of boats may be used in different parts of Bangladesh. Straight-back narrow timber boats known as koshas are used in Mymensingh, Pabna and Dhaka. The latter also uses goyna boats in its races. The use of sarangi boats is a tradition of Sylhet, Comilla and Brahmanbaria. Racing with Sampans is common in Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Feni and Noakhali. Outside Bangladesh Burmese regatta The Rakhine Buddhists of Myanmar and some parts of Bangladesh also have a similar tradition called Pailong Poye. In 2007, the British Bangladeshi community in Oxford initiated the first 'Nowka Bais' event in the United Kingdom as part of Oxfordshire County's 1000th birthday by getting two 40 ft canoes made in Sylhet, Bangladesh and bringing them to England. Nowka Bais in England has now become an annual cultural event attracting thousands such as the likes of the High Commissioner of Bangladesh. In 2012, the event was dedicated to the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. Queen Elizabeth II issued a statement on the event and expressed her interest about the Bengali tradition to the founder of Nowka Bais UK and Oxford Bangladeshi Boat Club, Azizur Rahman. In 2015, the event founder selected Birmingham to be its host city, which hosts a larger Bangladeshi diaspora population than Oxford. It has also become a mela (festival) with performances, stall and funfair rides.. In 2018, The Nowka Bais short film documentary was released based on the events in Birmingham.

The developer is mainly associated with popular and colourful Amiga games as Elvira: The Arcade Game, Trolls, Oscar and Whizz. In 1993 platformer Oscar was bundled with Millennium's Diggers as launch bundle for the Amiga CD32 and it was considered as one of the mascot games for the failed system. Flair Software's 1994 fighting game Dangerous Streets (that was a pack-in game for the CD32 later in its lifespan) is generally considered as one of the worst games of all time. At some point Flair Software changed its name into Microvalue and became focused on publishing instead of developing games. The company seems to be defunct, since it hasn't published any games since the end of the 1990s and the current website has been 'under construction' for some years now. The games Trolls and Oscar were remade and re-released in 2010 as Nintendo DSiware by Virtual Playground (that is part of the Microvalue group of companies) under the new titles Oscar in Toyland (since the Trolls licence couldn't be used any more) and Oscar in Movieland.

Although Revilla claimed that he delivered the speech for the people, the reaction to the speech was largely negative, especially on social media, where netizens reacted with \\"amusement, anger and disbelief\\". He later apologized to those who felt disgusted over his performance‚Äîin particular over a song he played towards the end of the speech‚Äîsaying that the song, and the speech in general, was meant for his supporters rather than his critics, and he understands the reaction elicited online.

Initially a client of his uncle, Edward Bromley, Wolryche had been MP for Much Wenlock. He became an ardent royalist in the English Civil War and was military governor of Bridgnorth, before being sequestered and forced to compound for ¬£730. *Ursula Ottley, daughter of Thomas Ottley of Pitchford, Shropshire. She was a sister of Francis Ottley, a key leader in the royalist seizure of power in Shropshire and military governor of Shrewsbury John Wolryche was educated initially at the grammar school in Stone, Staffordshire. He was admitted as a pensioner, i.e. a fee-paying student, at Christ's College, Cambridge, aged 16, on 19 May 1653 ‚Äì a fair guide to his birth date. He matriculated in the same year and went on to graduate BA in 1656-7. Legal training and career Map of Gray's Inn as it was in 1677.

An Oxford Doctor of Civil Law, in Convocation dress, from David Loggan's 1675 engraving Oxonia Illustrata. While he was still completing his Cambridge degree, Wolryche's name was entered on the admission register at Gray's Inn on 6 December 1655.Foster (1889), p.275 This was an unusual choice for his family: his father, Edward Bromley, Francis Ottley and many other relatives were members of the Inner Temple. Unlike Sir Thomas, John Wolryche was not expecting to become a major landowner and took his legal studies seriously. On 25 November 1661, the Pension or governing council ordered that Wolryche be called to the bar, as part of a large batch of students, on condition that he deposit ¬£4 as surety for performing his bar moot.Fletcher (1901), p.441 He seems to have taken chambers at his Inn: he was listed as occupying a room on the third storey of Cage's Buildings in 1668.Fletcher (1910), p.420 In 1670 he received the degree of Doctor of Civil Law from Oxford University.Foster (1891) Foster conflates Wolryche with his own grandson, the 4th Baronet. In 1676 he was appointed recorder of Bridgnorth ‚Äì a post he held until his death. On 26 November 1680 the Pension of Gray's Inn admitted him to the Grand Company of Ancients,Fletcher (1910), p.63 its body of most learned and experienced members. Landowner Sir Thomas Wolryche had owned about 6,000 acres, centred on his seat of Dudmaston, at Quatt, to the south of Bridgnorth. The estates were destined for his eldest son, Francis Wolryche, but he was considered incapable of managing them because of mental illness. Hence Sir Thomas settled them on John in trust. Sir Thomas died in 1668 and John Wolryche obtained a private act of Parliament in 1673 to confirm his position. Dudmaston was a substantial property, probably a fortified manor house, rated for taxation purposes as having 24 hearths in 1673.Garnett, p.24 John Wolryche began building a new house near Quatt church in the 1680s but it was not completed in his lifetime and ultimately became the dower house.Garnett, p.25 The present hall was built for his son, Thomas, in the 1690s.Garnett, p.26 From 1668 Wolryche played a more significant role in the county, taking positions appropriate to his status as a prominent landowner. In 1669 he was made a freeman of Bridgnorth. The following year he became a Justice of the Peace. He was a commissioner for assessment, a key post in imposing taxation locally, from 1673‚Äì80. Like his father, he became a captain of the militia, a post that led to his appointment as a Deputy Lieutenant of Shropshire in 1683. Political career =Candidate at Bridgnorth= Wolryche first stood for Parliament on 21 February 1679 at Bridgnorth, where he had been recorder, or chief legal official, a post which might have been expected to give him an advantage. However, in standing for election he was challenging the might of the Whitmores. Wolryche's father, Sir Thomas, had been a close friend and business partner of Sir Thomas Whitmore, 1st Baronet: Whitmore resided at Bridgnorth Castle while Wolryche was governor of the town. This association was not inherited by the next generation. Sir William Whitmore, 2nd Baronet had represented Bridgnorth in the House of Commons ever since 1661 and was to do so until his death in 1699:Henning: Whitmore, Sir William, 2nd Bt. (1637‚Äì99), of Apley Park, Salop. ‚Äì Authors: M. W. Helms / J. S. Crossette he regarded the borough seats as at his disposal. His brother, Sir Thomas Whitmore, had taken the second seat in a by-election in 1663, after a fierce contest, in which 182 new freemen were made in the six weeks before the poll.Henning: Bridgnorth ‚Äì Author: J. S. Crossette There seems to have been similar chicanery on this occasion, as Wolryche submitted a petition complaining of manipulation by the bailiffs after his defeat, but it was not reported. The Whitmores were both broadly acceptable to the court and Thomas especially was reviled by Shaftesbury,Henning: Whitmore, Sir Thomas (c.1642‚Äì82), of Bridgnorth, Salop. ‚Äì Author: J. S. Crossette who was working for the exclusion of Charles II's Catholic brother, James, Duke of York from succession to the throne. Wolryche stood explicitly for the \\"country party,\\" opposed to the court. =MP for Much Wenlock= The short-lived Habeas Corpus Parliament of spring 1679 took the country further into political crisis and the king sought a way out of the impasse by calling for fresh elections in the summer. Wolryche had learnt from his earlier experience and decided to seek election elsewhere. Previously the Wolryche estates had been a key support to their parliamentary ambitions. Sir Thomas Wolryche had been MP in three parliaments for Much Wenlock, a constituency in which the Wolryches held two considerable estates: the large manor of Hughley and the nearby estate of Presthope. John too chose to try his luck electorally at Much Wenlock. At the February elections, Sir George Weld had stood in for his son, John, who was tainted by his support for the now disgraced Earl of Danby, and had been elected alongside the increasingly radical William Forester.Henning: Much Wenlock ‚Äì Author: J. S. Crossette Now Wolryche stood on slate with Forester, sharing electoral expenses, which totalled ¬£124 9s. They used the same methods employed by their enemies, the Whitmores, having a large number of new burgesses enrolled. As a result, in an election held on 27 August, they defeated Weld and Sir Francis Lawley, 2nd Baronet. However, the parliament was prorogued and did not assemble until October of the following year. In this Exclusion Bill Parliament, which lasted only three months, Wolryche was appointed to the important committee on elections and privileges, as well as a committee to investigate the Peyton affair. Sir Robert Peyton was a republican and member of the Green Ribbon Club, which had expelled him when he tried to reach a personal reconciliation with the Duke of York.Henning: Peyton, Sir Robert (c.1633‚Äì89), of East Barnet, Mdx. ‚Äì Author: Eveline Cruickshanks Rash remarks he had made in the presence of Elizabeth Cellier then led to arrest for high treason, release, accusations of involvement in the \\"Meal Tub Plot\\", and subsequent appearance at the bar of the House of Commons. He was expelled from the House. Wolryche was re-elected for Much Wenlock on 18 February 1681 and represented it in the so-called Oxford Parliament, which sat for just a week. Again he was accompanied by Forester, who was now deeply involved with Shaftesbury and the embryonic Whig party.Henning: Forester, William (1655‚Äì1718), of Dothill Park, Salop. ‚Äì Author: J. S. Crossette He was once again named a member of the elections and privileges committee. =The Rye House Plot= The failure of the opposition to secure an exclusion bill was followed by the Rye House Plot, in which radical Whigs allegedly conspired to ambush the king and his brother. After the discovery of the plot in June 1683, Wolryche was one of the deputy lieutenants ordered to search for arms in Shropshire, despite his oppositional record. One of those implicated was Forester, who was found to have concealed a considerable quantity or arms and ammunition. Death Wolryche survived for only a few months into the reign of James II. He died of smallpox and was buried in St Andrew's church at Quatt on 17 June 1685. His heir was his eldest son Thomas. However, as his elder brother Sir Francis had no male heirs, Thomas succeeded to both the lands and the title on his death in 1688. Marriage and family Around 1670 Wolryche married Mary Griffith, daughter of Matthew Griffith (c.1599‚Äì1665). A militant and vituperative royalist, Griffith had been chaplain to Charles I during the civil war and was made master of the Temple Church in the reign of Charles II. Mary, according to her epitaph, was cultured and an accomplished singer and lutenist. She was about 33 years of age when she married Wolryche and was the widow of George Elphick, a Sussex landowner. She died in childbirth, aged 41, in 1678, and was commemorated by an impressive monument in Quatt parish church. She had already borne two sons, including Thomas, destined to become the third of the Wolryche baronets. =Family tree= Monument to Mary Wolryche n√©e Griffith (died 1678). St Andrew's church, Quatt.

Function  This gene encodes a protein containing a coiled- coil domain. The encoded protein functions in the regulation of NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) by interacting with COMMD (copper metabolism Murr1 domain-containing) proteins. The mouse orthologous protein has been shown to bind copines, which are calcium- dependent, membrane-binding proteins that may function in calcium signaling.

Built in 1810‚Äì1813, it is a fine example of Federal style architecture, and may be an early work of the noted local builder Jonathan Folsom. The house was joined in 1954 to the adjacent Portsmouth Academy building when it housed the city's public library; this complex is now home to Discover Portsmouth, a local tourism promotion organization. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The Benedict House stands near the western end of Portsmouth's Congress Street business district, on the west side of Middle Street. The Academy building, to which it is connected, faces north to Congress Street; the house faces south toward a parking lane. It is three stories in height, and is built out of brick and covered with a gabled roof. The brick is laid in Flemish bond throughout, and its workmanship is of exceptionally high quality when compared to that of other period buildings in the city. The main entrance is its most elaborate exterior feature, with sidelights and fanlight transom window sheltered by a half-round portico supported by columns with Ionic capitals. Above the entrance is a sash window with half-round fan, framed by wooden paneling. The interior features include a fine curving staircase and carved fireplace mantels. The house was built sometime between 1810 and 1813 for Thomas Morton, a local merchant. Its construction just outside central Portsmouth also apparently kicked off a minor building boom of fashionable houses in the immediate area. In 1814 Morton sold the house to Thomas Penhallow, another merchant. He sold it in 1835, and it passed through many owners before its acquisition by the city, originally to house the library.

The congress is the highest organ of the party, and is stipulated to be held every four years. 1,657 voting and 73 non-voting delegates represented the party's 1,311,563 members. The 4th Central Committee, elected by the congress, reelected Kim Il-sung as WPK Chairman, and a number of deputy chairmen. Delegates 1,657 voting and 73 non-voting delegates were elected to represent the party's 1,311,563 members. 32 different fraternal parties sent delegations to the 4th Congress, among these were the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (led by Frol Kozlov), the Communist Party of China (led by Deng Xiaoping), the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (led by Alfred Krehler) and the Japanese Communist Party (led by Kenji Miyamoto) among others. Congress Kim Il-sung delivered a six-hour-long report on the work of the 3rd Central Committee since the 3rd Congress (held in 1956). In his report, Kim Il-sung talked about the economic accomplishments made since the 3rd Congress, the First Seven-Year Plan, Korean reunification, the party's victory over the factionalist tendencies and the international position of the WPK. A notable success of the 3rd Central Committee was the collectivization of agriculture and the nationalization of all industries had been completed, together with the fact that 52 percent of the North Korean workforce were by definition industrial workers (accomplishing the party's task of creating a proletariat). Kim Il-sung asserted that these developments had been initiated by the Chollima Movement, a Stakhanovite movement inspired mobilization campaign, in which more than 2 million workers were participating in. He then concluded his section by claiming that exploitation was non- existent in North Korea. He then went on too talk about the First Seven-Year Plan, stating it would be a continuation of the previous successful five-year plan, and that the state would continue to prioritise heavy industry while simultaneously develop light industry and agriculture. In regards to South Korea, Kim Il-sung trivialized the April Revolution which led to the overthrow of Syngman Rhee, the President of South Korea, believing it mattered little in the long run since North Korea was both stronger and more prosperous then South Korea. He then began speaking about the party's victory over the factionalists, citing that the party had grown rapidly in the last years and needed to appoint younger men to the top through the party's youth league, the League of Socialist Working Youth (LSWY). He then ended his speech by talking about the WPK's international position, stating that North Korea emphasized the importance of good relations between fraternal socialist countries (telling the Chinese and Soviet delegations that North Korea would remain neutral in the Sino‚ÄìSoviet dispute). On the congress' last day, amendments to the party's by-laws were announced. They were approved without much discussion; the numbers of chapters were reduced from ten to nine, while the number of articles increased from 62 to 70. The changes are not very noteworthy in themselves, but they clarified the relationship between the WPK and the LSWY and the Korean People's Army (KPA). The extent of Kim Il-sung's consolidation of power became clear to all with the election of the 4th Central Committee. The congress elected 85 members to the 4th Central Committee, an increase of 14 from 71-member 3rd Central Committee. Of the 85 elected, only 28 of them had served in the 3rd Central Committee, in contrast, 57 of those elected had never served in the Central Committee before. All the partisans from the 3rd Central Committee were elected, with the exception of General Yu Kyong-su who died on 19 November 1958. Officials of the 3rd Central Committee who belonged either to the Soviet Korean or the Yanan faction were not reelected, if one excludes those members who had denounced their allegiances to these factions and pledged their allegiance to the partisans (such as Kim Chang-nam and Nam Il). O the 57 new members, 25 of them were active in Kim Il-sung's partisan faction while approximately 21 of them were recruited from either the KPA or the LSWY. In addition, there were those who were not partisan but had family ties to partisan members, such as Kim Yong-ju (Kim Il-sung's brother) and Yi Hyo-sun (elder brother of Yi Che-sun) for instance. Partisans, those trained by the partisans and people with family ties to the partisans constituted 80 percent of the Central Committee; to make matters better for Kim Il-sung, there existed no other organized group within the Central Committee. Of the 50 candidate members elected to the 4th Central Committee, 49 were new (with Yi Chi-chan being the only reelected). 1st plenum of the 4th Central Committee The 1st Plenary Session of the 4th Central Committee convened on 18 September 1961 to elect the officers of the 4th Central Committee. Kim Il-sung was elected the party's Chairman, while Choe Yong-gon, Kim Il, Pak Kum-chol, Kim Chang-nam and Yi Hyo-sun. Of these, only Kim Chang-nam was not a partisan. All organs of the Central Committee had either one or two partisans while concurrently holding either the post as head or deputy head; for instance, Kim Ik-son served as the Chairman of the 4th Central Inspection Commission, but Kim Chang-dok (a partisan) served as Deputy Chairman.

Built in 1809, it is one of the finest surviving examples of an early 19th-century academic building in northern New England, and is attributed to James Nutter, one of the finest local builders of the period. In addition to housing the Portsmouth Academy, it later housed the city's public library, and presently houses Discover Portsmouth, a local tourism marketing organization. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 as \\"Portsmouth Public Library\\". Description and history The former Portsmouth Academy building stands on the western fringe of downtown Portsmouth, at the southeast corner of Middle and Islington Streets. It is a two-story brick structure with a hip roof and a cut granite foundation. Its original main facade faces Islington Street, and is seven bays wide. Windows are set in rectangular openings, with marble sills and splayed lintels. A marble stringcourse separates the two floors, and the roof cornice is adorned with dentil moulding. The center three bays project slightly, and are topped by a pedimented gable with a half-round window at its center. The main entrance is in the center bay, set in a round-arch opening flanked by paired engaged Ionic columns. The Academy was designed by local designer-builder James Nutter and built in 1809. Its Federal style resembles other academy buildings (including an early building at the Phillips Exeter Academy), and its design was for a time attributed to Charles Bulfinch. The building was acquired by the city and converted for use to house the Portsmouth Public Library in the 1890s. At this time its interior was extensively altered; the extant skylights were probably added at this time as well. In 1954 a brick connector joined this building to the adjacent Benedict House. The building served as the public library until 2006, when the library moved to a new facility at 175 Parrott Avenue. The buildings are now leased to the Portsmouth Historical Society, which operates the Discover Portsmouth center.

It takes its name from the town and comune of Monte San Biagio, which until 1862 was known as Monticelli. It is raised in the provinces of Frosinone and Rome, on the Monti Aurunci, the Monti Ausoni, the Monti Lepini, the Monti delle Mainarde in the Val Comino and on the Monti Prenestini. The area of distribution is very similar to that of the Ciociara Grigia, from which it is however quite distinct. The Bianca Monticellana breed descends from a flock of about 700 head of white goats brought to Monticelli from Villa Latina in about 1850 by the Minchella family of shepherds. It is probably the same breed described as \\"Bianca Romana\\" (\\"Roman white\\") in the early years of the twentieth century, and not subsequently documented. The Bianca Monticellana is one of the forty-three autochthonous Italian goat breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep- and goat-breeders.

Young years and education Hilary was a son of Jan Krzysztofiak and Maria n√©e Helwig (killed in 1942 at Auschwitz concentration camp). During World War II, he worked in the Uthemann's steelworks in Szopienice as an apprentice carpenter and as a student for 3 years of evening school (Abendschule f√ºr Bildende K√ºnste), finishing in 1943. After the war he left for Warsaw where in 1945-1946 he went to art college. From January 1946, he worked as an extra in the Polish Theatre (Teatr Polski) in the first post-war production of Juliusz S≈Çowacki‚Äôs Lilla Weneda. In the same year, he produced his first theatre decorations for the production of The Story of Doctor Dolittle in the Puppet Theatre in Warsaw. In September 1946, he was accepted in the State School of Fine Arts (later: Academy of Fine Arts) where he studied block design, architectural painting, studies of nature, decorative and wall painting, technology, painting and conceptual design. As a student he worked for The Academic Theatre. In 1950-1951, Krzysztofiak started to co-operate with the literary-political magazine Po prostu where he published (among others) articles written with Lech Emfazy Stefa≈Ñski (\\"New Way of Visual Arts\\", 1950, no. 13, and \\"Talks of Realism on Visual Arts\\", 1950, no 3), criticized later at the Congress of Young Activists from Schools of Fine Arts.

In 1953, he joined other artists in Group ST-53. It was seen as a symbol of the artist's rebellion in the post-Stalin era, a sign of the newly organized avant-garde. The main purpose of the Group was self-education based on W≈Çadys≈Çaw Strzemi≈Ñski‚Äôs \\"Theory of Seeing\\". The first public exhibition of the Group opened on 13 May 1956 in the Silesian Institute in Stalinogr√≥d (Stalin City), now Katowice. In 1955, Krzysztofiak returned to Warsaw and stayed at a flat in Tarczy≈Ñska 11 with L. E. Stefa≈Ñski, who in there ran together with Miron Bia≈Çoszewski the famous Theatre at Tarczy≈Ñska. In July‚ÄìSeptember 1955, he took part in the legendary National Exhibition of Young Artists under the banner: ‚ÄúAgainst War, against Fascism‚Äù, organized in the building of Warsaw Arsenal. Krzysztofiak proposed three works and one was accepted: \\"Still Life\\", later known as \\"The Jaw\\". At the end of 1955, he started working as a graphic editor for Po prostu where he worked until the magazine was shut down in 1957. On 27 July 1956, Krzysztofiak's first individual exhibition opened in the Warsaw discussion club Po prostu. In 1957, Krzysztofiak made a design for the Station of the Passion for the church in Nowa Huta but it was never realized. At the end of 1958, Krzysztofiak met his future wife, Krystyna Mi≈Çotworska, a journalist and later editor with Radio Free Europe. At the beginning of 1960, he became graphic editor of the biweekly Ruch Muzyczny and designed the magazine's covers. He designed decorations for three one-act plays directed by Krystyna Meissner within her director's workshop; the first night was 21 June 1961, in Ateneum Theatre in Warsaw. The plays were Michel de Ghelderode‚Äôs Escurial, Harold Pinter‚Äôs The Dumb Waiter and S≈Çawomir Mro≈ºek‚Äôs At Sea. In September 1963, Krzysztofiak took part in the First International Koszalin Open Air Workshop organized in Poland for the first time. In 1964, he worked for theatres in Opole and Bia≈Çystok designing decorations for plays directed by L. E. Stefa≈Ñski and K. Meissner. In that time he painted the series of sixteen pictures called \\"Bia≈Çystok Totems\\". In August 1965, together with 39 artists from Poland and abroad, Krzysztofiak took part in the First Biennial of Space Forms in ElblƒÖg. The metal space forms made during the biennial were situated in the town. Abroad Hilary with wife, Krystyna Mi≈Çotworska in Paris, October 1967 Krzysztofiak first went abroad to Paris in 1966. There he made contacts with Polish emigrants, among them artists and writers such as S≈Çawomir Mro≈ºek and his wife Maria Obremba (a painter), Zbigniew Herbert, Jan Lebenstein, as well as with the Literary Institute ‚ÄúKultura‚Äù. During his stay in France, he exhibited his works in Paris at the Galerie Desbri√®res and in Marseilles at the Galerie Jouvens. In May 1968, Krzysztofiak went to the Netherlands to prepare an exhibition in Galerie De Graaf in Schiedam where he presented unknown pictures sent from Poland by his wife. He then moved to Cologne where his wife joined him in December. In 1969, Krzysztofiak exhibited his paintings and worked as a stage designer; among others he made decorations for Mro≈ºek's play The Turkey which had its first night on 10 May 1969 in the theatre in D√ºsseldorf. That summer, together with his wife who had found work for Radio Free Europe, they moved to Munich. After the first radio programme presented by Krystyna Mi≈Çotworska, the authorities in Warsaw decided to enter and liquidate Hilary's studio in Warsaw. Everything, including all the paintings apart from three works found many years later, was destroyed. Paintings were thrown into rubbish bins and works on paper were used for fire in roof repairs. In spring 1971, Krzysztofiak went for the first time to the United States where he applied for American citizenship, which he was granted in 1977. He changed his name to Christopher Hilary. His first American exhibition took place a year later in South Orange, New Jersey. From the beginning of the 1970s, the artist continued his artistic creativity in Germany and the USA. He took part in many collective exhibitions and had several individual ones. In 1976, he was awarded the New York Alfred Jurzykowski Prize. He died suddenly in 1979, in Falls Church near Washington when he was 53. Recognition Katowice, Hilary Krzysztofiak Square In the Polish People's Republic, Hilary was sentenced to non-existence. To bring back his person to the history of post-war Polish art National Museum in Warsaw organized a retrospective exhibition in the Zachƒôta Gallery in March 1997. The exhibition was also presented in the Silesian Museum in Katowice, in the Bunkier Sztuki Gallery in Krak√≥w and in the Museum of Silesian Piasts in Brzeg. At the beginning of 2009, in Katowice, the square at General Haller's Street and Westerplatte Defenders Street was given the name of Hilary Krzysztofiak. In October 2010, Kazimierz Kutz uncovered a memorial plate on the house where Krzysztofiak was born. Krzysztofiak's paintings are in museums and private collections in Europe and in the USA.

Built about 1760, it is a well-preserved example of Georgian residential architecture. It was operated for a time as a tavern serving travelers on the main road between Portsmouth and Exeter. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The John Crockett House stands in northern Stratham, on the north side of Portsmouth Road, between Depot Road and Jason Drive. It is a 2-1/2 story wood-frame structure, with a gabled roof, central roof, and clapboarded exterior. It is five bays wide and two deep, with a center entrance framed by pilasters and a pedimented gable. A single-story ell extends to the right side. The interior follows a typical Georgian period plan, with a narrow central hall flanked by parlor spaces. The house was built c. 1760 by Ephraim Crockett and his son John around the time of the latter's marriage. Both Crocketts, as well as Ephraim's father Richard, were prominent local builders, so the construction of this house may shed significant light on the evolution of local building practices. The house was purchased in 1780 by Henry Kenniston, a tailor who converted the house into an inn, capitalizing on its location midway between Portsmouth and Exeter. It served as an inn, operated by Kenniston's descendants, until 1883.

White, revealed at SpaceVision 2013, designed for the goal of achieving warp travel. The conceptual spacecraft would make use of a modified version of the Alcubierre drive. Dr. White is currently running the White‚ÄìJuday warp-field interferometer experiment in order to develop a proof of concept for Alcubierre-style warp travel, if possible. The Alcubierre drive uses exotic matter (not to be confused with antimatter) to travel faster than light. While the concept had been out since 2013 the design of IXS Enterprise was popularized in June 2014 after a series of media outlets reported on the conceptual artwork done by Dutch artist Mark Rademaker in collaboration with NASA. According to Mark Rademaker, over 1,600 hours have been spent on the conceptual artwork that he created. The energy required to power the warp drive, according to White, is approximately the negative (negative energy is required for the Alcubierre drive concept to function) mass‚Äìenergy equivalence of Voyager 1, which has a mass of approximately 700 kilograms. Using E=mc2, ‚àí700 kilograms of mass is equivalent to ~‚àí63 exajoules of energy (this number is not definitive and can be further reduced). The ship has two thick outer rings (to reduce required energy) that generate the warp field‚Äîa contraction of space ahead, and expansion of space behind it. The space inside the rings is optimized to fit more space for cargo, crew and equipment.

It is a pest within the horticultural trade in several parts of the world. It is known by the common names of daylily gall midge and hemerocallis gall midge. Description Adults are tiny greyish- brown alate midges about 2 mm long. Females deposit their eggs with their long, penetrating ovipositors into developing Hemerocallis flower buds during May through early July. This fly is difficult to see when it is flying. Life cycle This fly is univoltine, having only one annual cycle. It mates shortly after emerging from its overwintering puparium. Females lay eggs inside developing Hemerocallis buds which hatch into 2-mm-long, elongate, legless white larvae. Their presence and feeding causes distortion of bud tissues and failure of buds to open. Infested buds characteristically become more globular than normal, elongate Hemerocallis buds, tepals within buds become thickened, and a watery liquid is present between the tepals in which the larvae live. A few through hundreds of larvae live within a single bud. Larvae emerge from disfigured buds and to the soil in which they pupate, spend the winter as pupae, and emerge as adults in the following spring. Buds of a Hemerocallis cultivar with a short globular bud (lower left) distorted by infestation of the hemerocallis gall midge, compared with normal cylindrical bud at centre Distribution Cotarinia quinquenotata probably originated in Asia where wild Hemerocallis are native. It occurs only in gardens or plant nurseries which contain Hemerocallis. The midge has been slowly spreading across the world in infested Hemerocallis plants and soil. This fly was first noted in the United Kingdom in 1989 and has now spread to many parts of the United Kingdom. It was first reported in Canada in 2001 and has spread into the USA. The spread is assumed to occur from larvae within buds of imported plants or the soil in plant containers. Commercial impact Devaluation of infested plants by their failure to produce the attractive flowers favoured by gardeners for their colourful displays. Plants can safely be shipped only without their flower scapes, flower buds, and flowers and with bare roots. The need to control the midge by whatever means increases the cost of producing Hemerocallis plants.

Wing Luke Asian Museum Photograph Collection. Photo: Martin Moyer. Fay Chong (1912‚Äì1973) was a Chinese-American artist and educator, well known for his printmaking and watercolor painting. He was also known for his activities as an arts organizer, arts educator and WPA-era artist. Chong was active in the Pacific Northwest.  Early life and education  Fay Chong was born in Canton (modern Guangzhou), China in 1912, and moved to Seattle with his family in 1920. He attended public school, and studied art with Hannah Jones at Broadway High School, along with classmates Morris Graves and George Tsutakawa. He studied traditional calligraphy techniques during return visits to China in 1929 and 1935.  Career  In 1933, Chong, Andrew Chinn, Lawrence Yun, Yippie Eng, and others formed the Chinese Arts Club. Initially an informal co-op, they began holding regular shows at a shared studio in Seattle's International District, and eventually exhibited as an arts collective at the New York Chinese School. Artists Guy Anderson and William Cumming - who, along with Graves and Mark Tobey, would later become prominent members of the 'Northwest School' - were regular guests, joining them on art-making field excursions.Hallmark, Kara Kelley; Encyclopedia of Asian American Artists: Artists of the American Mosaic. Greenwood, 2007; Cannery Buildings, 1936, b&w; block print by Fay Chong. In 1938, during the Great Depression, Morris Graves helped Chong find work as an artist with the Federal Art Project of the Works Project Administration. He worked with the WPA, off and on, until 1942, mainly making linocut prints for various federal buildings and public places. He also became interested in watercolor painting at this time.Oral history interview with Fay Chong, by Dorothy Bestor, 1965 Feb. 14-20; Smithsonian Archive of the Arts; http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-fay- chong-12344 retvd 6 12 14 After the WPA, Chong worked various jobs, including several years at a YMCA school. In the mid-1950s - already a well-known, nationally exhibited \\"WPA artist\\" - he enrolled at the University of Washington, studying under Mark Tobey and others. He earned his B.A. degree in 1968, and M.A. degree at University of Washington in Arts Education in 1971. He taught art at Cornish College of the Arts, Seattle Central College, Washington Senior High School, and Ingraham High School.Seattle Public Library - Special Collections online; Fay Chong, biographical notes; http://cdm200301.cdmhost.com/cdm/singleitem/collection/p15015coll5/id/42/rec/3 retvd 6 12 14 George Town Farm, 1939 watercolor by Fay Chong. His artwork fused traditional Chinese styles with American Regionalism and other modern developments. His later work incorporated elements of Abstract expressionism. His art has been exhibited at the Seattle Art Museum, the Frye Art Museum, the Zoe Dusanne Gallery, and the Francine Seders Gallery in Seattle; the Tacoma Art Museum, the Bellevue Arts Museum, Reed College in Portland, Oregon, the Santa Barbara Museum of Art in California, the Riverside Gallery in New York City, and in many other museums and galleries. He was a member of the arts organizations Northwest Printmakers (treasurer and president), the Northwest Watercolor Society (president), the Puget Sound Group of Painters, and the Washington Art Association.Preliminary Guide to the Fay Chong Papers, circa 1933-1976; University Libraries, University of Washington; http://digital.lib.washington.edu/findingaids/view?docId=ChongFay2574.xml retvd 6 12 14 Chong was married to artist Priscilla Hwang.

This kind of grape does not belong to the Vitis vinifera family, but to the Vitis labrusca, and it was introduced to fight a plague of a parasite named phylloxera, which was destroying the European grapevine and wine production. This American grapevine was more resistant to the parasites. Venetian winemakers had the idea to make wine directly with this new grape, and this wine was delicious. Sweet and refreshing, the fragolino is a summer wine, with a delicate aftertaste of strawberry. Fragolino, as fragola means strawberry. Moreover, it was inexpensive and became popular around the Venetian area, where it was produced. However, Fragolino is considered a very low quality wine among connoisseurs Today, it is almost impossible to find the real fragolino because its commerce was banned by the EU and the Italian government. Many stories have been told about the fragolino ban. The more official one is that it was banned because it is difficult to control methanol levels during wine production and methanol can be poisonous. Some science revisionists argue that the Vitis labrusca was actually responsible, due to its resistance, to the spread of the phylloxera plague in Europe, and it was banned for this reason: but this confusing version of the story ignores the historical fact of its importation in Europe, France first, was made in the 19th century for the exact opposite reason, when the phylloxera was already destroying the Vitis vinifera cultivations.The fragolino wine References  Producers of wine  Fragolino Novellina Category:Wines of Veneto ","title":"Fragolino"},{"id":"43034935","text":"The marchioness Carina Massone Negrone (Bogliasco, 20 June 1911 - Bogliasco, 19 March 1991) was an Italian aviator.

Massone ... Biography Married to the marquis Ambrogio Negrone (with whom she had a son, Vittorio), she was the first Italian woman to obtain (in 1933) a pilot's license from the Reale Unione Nazionale Aeronautica (RUNA). A keen sportswoman (swimming, ski, tennis), she preferred flying, an activity that at the time was mainly practised by men, the intended interpreters of the manly dynamism encouraged by Futurism and Fascism. On 5 May 1934, she established her first personal record by flying at an altitude of 5,544 metres with a Class C seaplane. Following this achievement and with the support of her friend Italo Balbo, she decided to attempt to beat Maryse Hilsz's world record of 11,289 metres. As preparation, she trained as an air force pilot at Guidonia Montecelio airport. On 20 June 1935, Carina took off from the Guidonia Montecelio base on a Caproni biplane equipped with a Pegasus 1110 engine, taking with her a heated jacket and oxygen cylinder. Due to air rarefaction and low temperature at high altitude (down to -35 ¬∞C), her medical staff did not expect her to fly beyond an altitude of 11,000 metres. However, despite a state of daze (that she referred to as euphoria), through sheer determination she reached 12,043 metres (39,402 feet),Cited in Centennialofflight.gov thus beating Hilsz's record by 754 metres. Her record still stands for that category of propeller-powered planes.Cited in Gwdg.de She went on to achieve 7 additional flying world records, the last of which was on 19 June 1954, flying from Brescia to Luxor (Egypt) - 2,987 km in 13 hours 34 minutes, at an average speed of 299 km per hour. In 1951 she took part in an aerial tour of Algeria alongside Ada Marchelli on a Macchi monoplane. She took part in various international competitions and she eventually founded a pilot school. A commemorative stamp with a face value of L. 750 was issued in her honour by Poste Italiane in 1996. A square has been dedicated to Carina Negrone in her home town.See: Chieracostui.com See also * Maryse Hilsz * Italo Balbo Notes Bibliography *Massimo Zamorani, Nel cielo di Genova: due secoli di voli, Ecig, Genova 1986 (in Italian) *Massimo Zamorani, Vola Genova.

It was opened by Mr Moshe Erell, Israeli Ambassador to Australia who was also made an honorary member. The design included room for thirty boat racks, a maintenance workshop, showers and toilets, and space was made available for future expansions. More recent modifications include the installation of a roof safety system and additions of higher density racks and storage to accommodate Australian National University Mountaineering Club equipment.

During World War I she served abroad as head of the X-ray department and of staff in makeshift hospitals. Early life  London School of Medicine for Women, where Stoney obtained her MD Stoney was born 4 February 1870 in Dublin to George and Margaret Sophia Stoney (30 September 1843 - 13 October 1872). Her father was a mathematical physicist who would later serve as Secretary of Queens University, and was an advocate for women's right to higher education in Ireland. His efforts are considered to be among the principal reasons that women could qualify for a medical license. Florence Stoney, who was of weak health as a child, was at first privately educated in the home, but then attended the Royal College for Science of Ireland with her sister Edith. In 1883 the Stoney family moved to London in order to provide higher education for the daughters since this was unavailable for women in Ireland at the time. Stoney attended the London School of Medicine for Women where she was a distinguished student with great academic achievements in subjects such as anatomy and physiology. She obtained her MBBS with honours in 1895 and a Doctor of Medicine in 1898, going on to specialise in radiology.  Career and role in World War I  Stoney worked as an ENT clinical assistant at the Royal Free Hospital as well as spending six years as a demonstrator in anatomy at the London School of Medicine for Women. After this she spent a short amount of time in the Victoria Children's Hospital in Hull and then went on to establish an X-ray department in the Elizabeth Garret Anderson Hospital for Women in London in 1902. At the hospital she carried out a variety of work but mainly dealt with X-rays, often developing the radiographic plates at her own house. She was the first female radiologist to work in the United Kingdom at a time when knowledge on radiology and the equipment involved was still in its developmental stages. She was forced to work in poor conditions with badly ventilated rooms and a lack of space for X-ray work. Stoney was given no assistance and had to do the majority of the work on her own. Furthermore, she was excluded as a member of the medical staff and from the X-ray department committee. In 1906 she set up a practice in Harley Street. Stoney left the hospital at the start of the war. Stoney had 13 years of experience in her field when World War I broke out in August 1914. Stoney and her sister Edith, a medical physicist, volunteered to assist the British Red Cross, but both were refused by surgeon Frederick Treves since they were women. Despite the refusal, Stoney prepared an X-ray installation and helped to organise a unit of women volunteers alongside Mrs. St. Clair Stobart, Women's Imperial Service League and the Belgian Red Cross to aid the Belgian soldiers in Antwerp. The team converted an abandoned music hall into a makeshift hospital where Stoney managed the surgical unit as head of the medical staff and radiologist. The hospital came under fire and after enduring ongoing shellfire for 18 hours, the hospital was evacuated. The team walked to Holland, where they managed to cross the Scheldt River on buses carrying ammunition, 20 minutes before the bridge was blown up. She and her unit earned the 1914 Star for bravery. She continued working in a hospital near Cherbourg in France, mainly dealing with cases relating to compound fractures and locating bullet fragments in wounds. During this time, Stoney became experienced in recognizing dead bone and discovered that removing it would speed up recovery. Fulham Hospital In March 1915, the Cherbourg hospital was no longer needed and Stoney moved back London. She began full-time work at the 1000-bed Fulham Military Hospital. She was one of the first female physicians that granted to serve as a full-time worker under the British War Office and went on to receive the Order of the British Empire in June 1919. She worked as the Head of the X-ray and Electrical Department and remained there till 1918.  Later life and death  In her later years, Stoney suffered from ill health, largely attributed to her over-exposure to radiation in her work. It was reported that she had X-ray dermatitis of her left hand, a painful skin condition associated in modern times with radiation therapy as a treatment for cancer. Stoney moved to the south coastal town of Bournemouth in England; here she was on the staff of two hospitals, practicing radiology part-time. She occupied the position of Honorary Medical Officer to the Electrical Department of the Royal Victoria and West Hants Hospital in Bournemouth. Stoney was the founder and president of the Wessex branch of the British Institute of Radiology. She served as the consulting actinotherapist at the Victoria Cripples Home. During retirement she penned a number of articles in contribution to the medical literature of the time. She published research on topics such as fibroids, goitre, Graves' disease, soldier's heart, rickets and osteomalacia. Stoney retired from all of her hospital positions in 1928 at the age of 58. She, along with her older sister Edith, travelled in retirement. One trip was to India, where Stoney wrote her final scientific paper, the subject of which was osteomalacia (bone softening), in particular in relation to pelvic deformities in childbirth. She studied and investigated this topic overseas, and specifically the association between UV exposure, vitamin D and skeletal development. In India, she also used her expertise to advise on the use of UV light in hospitals. Stoney died at the age of 62, on 7 October 1932. She was suffering from a long and painful illness, vertebral cancer, again largely attributed to her work in the presence of high levels of radiation. The British Journal of Radiology published her official obituary which spanned five pages, containing many warm personal testimonials. After her sister's death, Edith Stoney continued to travel and research.

In 2002 he was offered the directorship for internal medicine at the University of Adelaide and the Bo Schembechler Chair of Medicine at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, US, which he declined. Since 2004 he has held a C4-Professorship and directorship of the Department for Internal Medicine in Dresden. Furthermore, he became member of the Max Planck Graduate School in 2004 and is founding and board member of the excellence cluster Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden (CRTD). In 2008 he became honorary professor at the University of Miami. Together with Julio Licinio he founded the German Australian Institute of Translational Medicine (GAITM) GAITM in 2009. Since 2011 he has been a consultant at the John Curtin School of Medical Research in Canberra and a board member of the John Curtin Medical Research Foundation. He has been an honorary professor at the Hong Kong University since 2012Honorary professor at the University of Hong Kong and a professor and honorary consultant at King's College London since 2013. Research Bornstein's scientific focus lies on the adrenal gland as on organ of stress, stem cell research and advances in islet cell transplantation as a therapy for diabetes. This is why, presently, Dresden is the only active German center of this treatment. Since 2011 Bornstein has been spokesman for the research group KFO 252 of the German Science Association (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft DFG)DFG Clinical research group KFO 252 (German) and one of the coordinators of the Paul-Langerhans- Institute Dresden. Since 2012, he has been scientific secretary of the DFG Transregio 127.SFB Biology of xenogeneic cell and organ transplantation - from bench to bedside/ DFG TRansregio 127 Main research areas are: endocrinology and internal medicine (e.g. adrenal gland, stress, and stem cell research), diabetes, transplant medicine (e.g. new strategies to improve diabetes treatment), public healthcare and preventive medicine (prevention of diabetes) Teaching *Education of doctors and scientists, conduction of state exams and certificates of completion of training *Development of health information systems for patients. Patent: MediROBO Gesundheitsinformationssystem, German Patent and Trademark Office (DMPA) M394 06 931:8 Hospital work Bornstein is chief of the medical clinic and policlinic III (Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik III) at the university hospital Carl Gustav Carus in Dresden, which is a major centre of treatment and research of diabetes mellitus type I and type II in Europe as well as its sequelae, like the diabetic foot syndrome, heart and blood vessel diseases and diabetic nephropathy. A major topic is creating individual treatment strategies to prevent the increase in diabetes prevalence. That is why in 2009 they created the first professorship for diabetes prevention in Germany. In 2008 started the only currently active program of islet transplantation in Germany. This treatment is a great benefit for patients with diabetes type I with great deviations in their glucose blood levels. Recent research includes a bioreactor of insulin-producing cells in a small implantable chamber which offers an immunoisolation, making the implantation possible without immune suppressive therapy.Transplantation of human islets without immunosuppression Prizes *1990: Research prize for young academics of the Verband der Metallindustrie Baden W√ºrttemberg e.V. *1994: Marius-Tausk-Preis of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Endokrinologie for the work: Human adrenal cells express TNFŒ±-mRNA: Evidence for a paracrine control of adrenal function *1995: ‚ÄûEinfach genial Preis‚Äú of the Middle German TV (MDR) for the MediROBO-Projekt *2010: Leopold-Caspar-Ehrenpreis of the Bundesverband J√ºdischer Mediziner for extraordinary scientific and ethical competence CV Bornstein *2018: Bundesverdienstkreuz Klasse 1 (order of merit of the first class of Germany) Selected publication papers * Stefan R.

Val Hennessy, journalist, portrait by Phyllis Dupuy  Career  Hennessy taught English and drama before commencing a writing and journalistic career with the Brighton Voice, Peace News and Big Scream. Hennessy later became a Fleet Street freelance journalist, an associate editor of Time Out and a columnist for Saga Magazine. She was described by Auberon Waugh as \\"a handsome if elderly (by punk standards) and inescapably middle-class journalist\\". She is best known for her work as chief literary critic for the Daily Mail from 1989 to 2004. As of 2014, she continues to write for the Daily Mails \\"Retro Reads\\" column. Having reviewed thousands of English fiction books, Hennessy is a significant critic of British women's writing. Hennessy has interviewed Luciano Pavarotti, Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, Annie Lennox, Michael Douglas, Terence Stamp, Martin Amis, Vivienne Westwood, Elizabeth Taylor, Bob Geldof, David Bailey, Jeffrey Archer, Germaine Greer, Laurie Lee and Jos√© Carreras. Throughout her career, she has also written for The Guardian, The Observer, New Society, You Magazine, Spare Rib, City Limits, and London Evening Standard.  Judging panels  In 1989, Hennessy was on the controversial judging panel of the (then) Whitbread Book Award, now known as the Costa Book Awards. In 1995, she was a member of the AT&T; Award for Non-fiction. Panel chair, Alan Clark, reduced the panel to laughter with his declaration that \\"No one may speak while the chairman is speaking and if you wish to speak, you must raise your hand\\". In 1996 Hennessy was one of \\"five leading women\\", \\"at the top of their respective professions\\" making up the inaugural panel of the (then) Orange, now Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction and commented vigorously on the quality of submissions by British women writers. As an early judge on this award, Hennessy's comments continued to be referenced by Emma Parker in the Contemporary Women Writers journal (2004) and John Ezard in The Independent (2005).  Reviewing the reviewer  In a letter to Private Eye, Stephen Vizinczey credited Hennessy among a number of critics for taking his work seriously, but her reviews have not always made it on to a novel's dust jacket. The New York Times found \\"mixed messages\\" in her review of Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife by Mary Roach, while Hennessy's review of A History of English Food by Clarissa Dickson Wright was cited as a demonstration of anti-intellectualism in the British media.  Bibliography  * A Little Light Friction, Chambers, 1989, * In The Gutter, Quartet, 1978, In The Gutter received a mixed reception. Auberon Waugh called it an \\"admirable book\\" with \\"touches of a genuine philosophical nihilism\\", while Joe Donnelly wrote, \\"In the Gutter though far from perfect would be a great addition to any punks' collection, providing you can find a copy?\\" Lauded for the photographic record of the punk era, the book is now out of print and is in demand on the vintage book market.

Prior to his professional career, he played college baseball for the Oregon State Beavers. Amateur career Growing up in Beaverton, Oregon, Fry played Little League Baseball. His team, Murrayhill Little League, represented the Northwest in the 2006 Little League World Series, where the team made it to the U.S. championship game. Fry graduated from Southridge High School in Beaverton, and committed to enroll at Oregon State University on a college baseball scholarship. The Oakland Athletics selected Fry in the ninth round of the 2011 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft, but Oakland did not offer Fry a sufficient signing bonus to convince him to forego college. Over the summer of 2011, Fry pitched in collegiate summer baseball for the Corvallis Knights of the West Coast League (WCL). Fry injured his back in the WCL championship game, and required surgery. In his freshman year with the Oregon State Beavers baseball team, he had a 5‚Äì3 win‚Äìloss record and a 2.45 earned run average (ERA) in 13 games started. In June 2012, he underwent Tommy John surgery after a 75% tear of the ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow. Baseball America named Fry a Second Team Freshman All-American. After recovering from surgery, Fry pitched to a 0‚Äì1 record with a 4.70 ERA in six appearances in 2013. During the 2014 season, he pitched a no-hitter on March 8 against the Northern Illinois Huskies. He finished the season with a record of 11‚Äì2 and a 1.80 ERA. He was named the Pac-12 Conference Baseball Pitcher of the Year. Collegiate Baseball named Fry a First Team All-American. Professional career The Chicago White Sox selected Fry in the third round, with the 77th overall selection, of the 2014 MLB draft. He signed with the White Sox, receiving a $760,000 signing bonus, and assigned him to make his professional debut with the Great Falls Voyagers of the Rookie-level Pioneer League and spent the whole season there, posting a 1-0 record and 2.79 ERA in 9.2 innings. Fry began the 2015 season with the Winston-Salem Dash of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League. In June 2015, he underwent his second Tommy John surgery. Prior to his surgery, he was 1-8 with a 3.63 ERA in ten starts. He missed the 2016 season while rehabilitating from the surgery. The White Sox invited Fry to spring training in 2017. In 2017, he pitched for the Birmingham Barons of the Class AA Southern League where he went 2-1 with a 2.78 ERA with 52 strikeouts in 45.1 relief innings pitched. The White Sox promoted Fry to the major leagues on September 5, 2017. In 2018, his first full season, Fry recorded a 4.38 ERA with 70 strikeouts and 20 walks in innings. The following season, his ERA regressed to 4.75 as he walked 43 batters in 55 innings. With the 2020 Chicago White Sox, Fry appeared in 18 games, compiling a 0-1 record with 3.66 ERA and 24 strikeouts in 19.2 innings pitched.https://www.mlb.com/player/jace- fry-605240 References External links Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Beaverton, Oregon Category:Baseball players from Oregon Category:Southridge High School alumni Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Oregon State Beavers baseball players Category:Great Falls Voyagers players Category:Winston-Salem Dash players Category:Birmingham Barons players Category:All-American college baseball players ","title":"Jace Fry"},{"id":"43035079","text":"Susana Fortes (born in 1959 in Pontevedra, Spain) is a Spanish writer and columnist.HarperCollins Biography Susana Fortes graduated in Geography and History at the University of Santiago de Compostela and in American History at the University of Barcelona.

Merten worked as a teacher from 1902 to 1908 in the secular environment while then serving as a teacher while in the religious life from her profession until 1916 when ill health forced her to stop teaching. Pope John Paul II beatified her on 1 November 1987. Life Maria Magdalena Merten was the ninth of eleven children born to farmers. Between 1902 and 1908 she taught children in a secular environment but in November 1908 decided to become a member of the Ursulines near Ahrweiler (along with her sister) with the intention of teaching and to deepen her understanding of faith; she commenced her novitiate in 1910. Merten made her solemn profession on 4 November 1913 and assumed the name of \\"Blandine of the Sacred Heart\\". Merten led a simple life with an emphasis on tending to the children entrusted to her while also associating action and contemplation with the huge devotion she fostered towards the Eucharist. In September 1916 she contracted tuberculosis and was forced to stop teaching as a result. Merten died in mid-1918 at the convent of Saint Bantus due to her tuberculosis and she was buried at the Basilica of St Paulinus in Trier. Her remains were later transferred on 18 May 1990. Beatification The beatification process opened in Trier in an informative process on 13 November 1954 until its conclusion on 9 June 1962; her writings later received approval on 21 December 1968 while the cause's formal introduction came on 4 December 1980 in which she was titled as a Servant of God. Theologians would later approve the Positio of the cause on 26 January 1983 while the Congregation for the Causes of Saints also approved it on 12 April 1983. Pope John Paul II named her as Venerable on 9 July 1983 after confirming her heroic virtue. The miracle needed for beatification was investigated from 7 March 1985 until 30 March 1985 and was validated in Rome in 1985. A medical board approved the healing to be a miracle on 25 June 1986 as did theologians on 19 December 1986 and the C.C.S. on 17 March 1987.

Early years Nicolas Dondeau was born at Fontaine-Denis, Marne, on 25 March 1752. His parents were sieur Claude Dondeau and Catherine Bregeon. He was made principal of Anchin College in Douai in 1772. He became an advocate at the parliament of Douai in 1785, where he exercised various administration and judicial functions. On 23 April 1786 he married Marguerite-Fran√ßoise Davesnes, daughter of an advocate at the parliament of Flanders. In May 1791 he was a municipal commissioner of Douai, and in the absence of Louis-Joseph Art was acting as procureur of the commune. Dondeau entered the administration and became a head of division in the Ministry of the General Police under Philippe-Antoine Merlin de Douai. Minister Dondeau was named Minister of the General Police on 25 Pluv√¥ise VI (13 February 1798). He replaced Pierre- Jean-Marie Sotin de La Coindi√®re. His conduct as a minister was sensible and moderate. On 22 Vent√¥se VI (12 March 1798) he addressed a letter to justices of the peace and officers of the police recommending that they repress libertinism. On 12 Germinal VI (1 April 1798) he sent another letter about the troubles stirred up by agitators during public performances, who stubbornly demanded symphonies, airs or dances that had not been announced on the posters. On 24 Flor√©al VI (13 May 1798) he wrote to the director of the theater of Montansier saying he had heard that actors were appearing on stage with their hair in rolls, which he described as an insolent scandal. Later career On 27 Flor√©al VI (16 May 1798) Dondeau resigned as minister and was replaced by Marie Jean Fran√ßois Philibert Lecarlier. The same day he was named administrator of the lotteries in place of Thabaud de Surins, who had been elected deputy. In 1800 he was named judge of the criminal court of the department of Seine-et-Marne. He became a counselor of the court, and retired on 17 January 1816. He died at Provins, Seine-et-Marne, on 21 October 1834.

Lesch was born in Z√ºrich, the daughter of Swiss director, dramatist, and author Walter Lesch (1892‚Äì1958), and the Austrian actress Mathilde Danegger (1903‚Äì1988). In addition to both of her parents having professional careers in the German-speaking dramatic arts, Lesch comes from a family of Austrian entertainers of music, stage, and cinema. On her maternal side, her grandfather was the Austrian character-actor and director , Snr (1866-1933), and her maternal grandmother Bertha M√ºller (1866-1938) was an Austrian actress of both stage and silent-film.¬´Karin Lesch¬ª, Von: Sacha Beuth, 23. Dezember 2013. ¬´In der Erinnerung liegt ein Gl√ºcksgef√ºhl¬ª Tagblatt der Stadt Z√ºrich (web.archive.org) Her uncle , Jnr, (1889‚Äì1948) was an Austrian actor of stage and cinema, whilst her uncle Theodor Danegger (1891‚Äì1959) was both an opera singer and recording artist in addition to being an actor of stage and cinema, having performed in both musicals and operettas, as well as in purely dramatic r√¥les. Early life Due to Swiss neutrality, Lesh grew up unscathed by the effects of World War II, and the havoc wreaked on her mother's native Austria after its annexation by the Third Reich. After the War, however, Lesch's life changed radically with the breakdown of her parents marriage. Her mother took Lesch from her father and her native Switzerland, when she was only twelve years old, to live first in West Germany in 1947, and then, because of her mother's political convictions, to the newly formed (1949) communist East Germany in 1951, when Lesch was just sixteen. Education and career A formally trained actress of both stage and cinema, as well as television, Lesch studied at the Staatlichen Schauspielschule, (i.e. the former State Drama School, East Berlin); after which she received a contract with the . She often played in different fairy-tale films, such as her r√¥le as the miller's daughter ‚ÄòMarie‚Äô in the fairy-tale adaptation of Rumpelstiltskin in the 1960 television production Das Zauberm√§nnchen. To English-speaking audiences, Lesch is perhaps best known for her cinema r√¥le as the Queen in the 1973 East-German ‚Äì Czechoslovakian co-production: Three Gifts for Cinderella (the title used for its UK d√©but), or Three Nuts for Cinderella (the title used for its US d√©but); but also known as: Three Wishes for Cinderella T≈ôi o≈ô√≠≈°ky pro Popelku in various subsequent releases in the English-speaking world. (The original German title is: Drei Haseln√ºsse f√ºr Aschenbr√∂del, and the original Czech title is: T≈ôi o≈ô√≠≈°ky pro Popelku). The film is based on a Bohemian version of the fairy-tale Cinderella as written by the Czech National Revivalist writer Bo≈æena Nƒõmcov√°, with the storyline more closely related to the German version publish by the Brothers Grimm in 1812, versus the somewhat different version more widely known in English that is based on the earlier French version published by Charles Perrault in 1697; (hence the reason for the r√¥le of the Queen, a character not found in the Anglo-French version of the fairy-tale). The r√¥le having proved difficult to cast, once East German actor Rolf Hoppe had been given the part as the King, he suggested Karin Lesch, with whom he had enjoyed a professional relationship, having worked on stage with Lesch several times before. Although initially expected to screen-test, as all the other actresses who had vied for the part, the film's director V√°clav Vorl√≠ƒçek was so impressed, he gave Lesch the r√¥le after only a read-through. Much like Dinner for One, the film has become a holiday classic being shown on television at Christmas-time every year in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, parts of Scandinavia ‚Äì especially Norway ‚Äì as well as elsewhere in Europe during the holiday season. The movie was shot in both German and Czech, with the cast members each speaking their lines in their own language, and with extensive post-filming work carried out so that two versions of the original were released, one with the Czech lines dubbed into German, and the other with the German lines dubbed into Czech, and employed what, at the time, was the newly developed technique of synchronisation to create a more visually realistic effect of speech emanating from the lips whenever the dialogue was being dubbed. Both a gifted linguist, as well as a professional voice artist ‚Äì in addition to her work as a dramatic actress ‚Äì after shooting Three Gifts for Cinderella in German, her mother tongue, Lesch dubbed the same r√¥le she played for the production's Czech release. This made her one of only three of the fourteen cast members with speaking-parts, asked to provide their own voices for their respective r√¥les in both the German and Czechoslovakian versions; (although Czech actress Vlasta Fialov√° is credited as having provided the voice used in what became the official release of T≈ôi o≈ô√≠≈°ky pro Popelku). At least two versions exist in English, viz: One dubbed without lip-synchronisation, whilst another uses an omniscient narrator in voice-over, as the actors can still be faintly heard to give their original lines in their own languages. Private life Lesch married East-German producer-director (1930‚Äì2009), who later became the Director General of DEFA, the state-owned film studio in the former German Democratic Republic. Lesch remained in the east through the turbulence leading up to the 1990 Reunification of Germany, and the period of adjustment in its aftermath; where she continues to live, now widowed and in retirement, in the Berlin ‚Äì Brandenburg Metropolitan Region of Brandenburg in eastern Germany. Her son , born in 1962, is a screenwriter, author, and member of the German Writers Guild, who lives in nearby Berlin. Post-theatrical Career Lesch leads a private life, avoiding both public and media attention. On 23 December 2013, however, she granted a very rare interview to the Tagblatt der Stadt Z√ºrich ¬´Karin Lesch¬ª, Von: Sacha Beuth, 23. Dezember 2013. ¬´In der Erinnerung liegt ein Gl√ºcksgef√ºhl¬ª Tagblatt der Stadt Z√ºrich (web.archive.org) ‚Äì a paper from her hometown of Z√ºrich ‚Äì in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of Drei Haseln√ºsse f√ºr Aschenbr√∂del, where she spoke about both the film, as well as memories of her childhood in Switzerland. Lesch also spoke of her only visit to Z√ºrich in 1991, after the fall of the East Bloc when she was free to travel, and the enjoyment she felt in revisiting old haunts from her childhood after an absence of some forty-four years.

The Catholic biblical critique asserts that the Sola scriptura principle of Lutheran and Reformed Churches is inaccurate according to the Catholic doctrine. While Catholic tradition agrees with Protestantism that faith, not works, is necessary for \\"initial\\" justification, some contemporary Protestant Scholars such as N. T.

Sources of criticism  Confutatio Augustana (left) and Confessio Augustana (right) being presented to Charles V Historically, certain notable Catholic works were written as a criticism of a Protestant work. For example, when the Lutherans gave the 1530 Augsburg Confession, the Catholics responded with the Confutatio Augustana. Also, Diogo de Payva de Andrada wrote the 1578 Defensio Tridentin√¶ fidei as a response to the Lutheran Martin Chemnitz, who published the Examination of the Council of Trent from 1565‚Äì1573.Examen, Volumes I-II: Volume I begins on page 46 of the pdf and Volume II begins on page 311. Examen Volumes III-IV: Volume III begins on page 13 of the pdf and Volume IV begins on page 298. All volumes free on Google Books While some Catholic leaders have been seeing the positive side of the German Reformer, Martin Luther, calling him \\"thoroughly Christocentric\\" and saying that his intention was \\"to renew the Church and not to divide it\\", Catholic doctrine views Protestantism as \\"suffering from defects\\", not possessing the fullness of truth and lacking \\"the fullness of the means of salvation\\". Protestants also engage in self- criticism, a special target of which is the fragmentation of Protestant denominations. In addition, due to the fact that Protestantism is not a monolithic tradition, some Protestant denominations criticize the beliefs of other Protestants. For example, the Reformed Churches criticize the Methodist Churches for the latter denomination's belief in the doctrine of unlimited atonement, in a long-term debate between Calvinists and Arminians.  Criticism of foundational principles  = Sola scriptura = Jean Colombe, Baptism of Christ (1485), Mus√©e Cond√© Sola scriptura, one of the Five Principles shared by Lutheran and Reformed Churches, originated during the Protestant Reformation, is a formal principle of many Protestant denominations. Baptist Churches as well share the Sola scriptura principle and state that the Bible alone is the sole source of knowledge, truth and revelation sent directly from God, the only true Word of God, sufficient of itself to be the supreme authority of the Christian faith. In contrast, the Anglican Communion and the Methodist Church uphold the doctrine of prima scriptura, which holds that Sacred tradition, reason and experience are the sources of Christian doctrine, but are nonetheless subordinate to the authority of the Bible as well. According to Benedict XVI, the Catholic Church holds a very different view on the Bible and does not consider itself to be a \\"Religion of the book\\": \\"while in the [Catholic] Church we greatly venerate the sacred Scriptures, the Christian faith is not a 'religion of the book': Christianity is the 'religion of the Word of God'...together with the Church‚Äôs living Tradition, [the Scripture] constitutes the supreme rule of faith.\\" = Justification by faith and grace alone =  Sola fide  At \\"the crux of the disputes\\" are the doctrine on justification and Sola fide, two of the core principles of Protestantism. The immediate official Catholic response to the Reformation, the Council of Trent, affirmed in 1547 the foundational importance of faith as part of its doctrinal tradition, \\"we are therefore considered to be justified by faith, because faith is the beginning of human salvation, the foundation, and the root of all Justification...none of those things which precede justification --whether faith or works-- merit the grace itself of justification.\\" Many centuries later, in 1999 the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity and the Lutheran World Federation have found basic doctrinal agreements in the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification, showing \\"a common understanding\\" of the justification: \\"By grace alone, in faith in Christ's saving work and not because of any merit on our part, we are accepted by God and receive the Holy Spirit, who renews our hearts while equipping and calling us to good works.\\" The document states that the Churches now share \\"a common understanding of our justification by God's grace through faith in Christ.\\" To the parties involved, this essentially resolves the 500-year-old conflict over the nature of justification which was at the root of the Protestant Reformation. The World Methodist Council formally recognized the Declaration in 2006. Although an important step forward in the Catholic‚ÄìLutheran dialogue, the Declaration continues to show the unsurpassable differences of thought that separate the Catholic Church from the Protestant tradition. Lutherans uphold Luther's doctrine that \\"human beings are incapable of cooperating in their salvation... God justifies sinners in faith alone (sola fide).\\" According to N. T. Wright, \\"Paul, in company with mainstream Second Temple Judaism, affirms that God‚Äôs final judgment will be in accordance with the entirety of a life led ‚Äî in accordance, in other words, with works.‚Äù Benedict XVI in 2006 declared that \\"it is to God and his grace alone that we owe what we are as Christians.\\" Methodist Churches have always emphasized that ordinarily both faith and good works play a role in salvation; in particular, the works of piety and the works of mercy, in Wesleyan-Arminian theology, are \\"indispensable for our sanctification\\". Methodist Bishop Scott J. Jones in United Methodist Doctrine says that faith is always necessary to salvation unconditionally. Good works are the exterior result of true faith but are necessary only conditionally, that is, if there is time and opportunity.  Criticism of the Joint Declaration within the Catholic Church  The Vatican's note in response to the Declaration said that the Protestant formula \\"at the same time righteous and sinner\\", is not acceptable: \\"In baptism everything that is really sin is taken away, and so, in those who are born anew there is nothing that is hateful to God. It follows that the concupiscence [disordered desire] that remains in the baptised is not, properly speaking, sin.\\"  Catholic opinion on the Great Apostasy  According to Benedict XVI, the encounter of Christianity with enlightened Greek culture and philosophy is not apostasy into Paganism, but rather a natural development in the history of the early Church; Ratzinger also states that the translation of the Old Testament in Greek and the fact that the New Testament itself was written in Greek are a direct consequence of the biblical revelation's reception by the Hellenistic world.  Apostolic succession  Nathan S√∂derblom is ordained as archbishop of the Church of Sweden, 1914. Although the Swedish Lutherans can boast of an unbroken line of ordinations going back prior to the Reformation, the bishops of Rome today do not recognize such ordinations as a valid due to the fact they occurred without authorization from the Roman See. Some Catholic critics state that Protestant acceptance of the Great Apostasy implies their non-acceptance of the apostolic succession in the Catholic Church and Orthodox Churches. At the same time, a number of Protestant Churches, including Lutheran Churches, the Moravian Church, and the Anglican Communion, affirm that they ordain their clergy in line with the apostolic succession; in 1922, the Eastern Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople recognised Anglican orders as valid. The Catholic Church has rejected the validity of Anglican apostolic succession as well as that of other Protestant Churches, saying in regard to the latter that \\"the proclamation of Sola scriptura led inevitably to an obscuring of the older idea of the Church and its priesthood. Thus through the centuries, the imposition of hands either by men already ordained or by others was often in practice abandoned. Where it did take place, it did not have the same meaning as in the Church of Tradition.\\"  Criticism of doctrine and practices  = Eucharist = Some Catholic critics say that Protestant Churches, including the Anglican, Lutheran, Methodist, and Reformed traditions, each teach a different form of the doctrine of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, with Lutherans affirming Christ's presence as a sacramental union, and Reformed/Presbyterian Christians affirming a pneumatic presence. Baptists, Anabaptists, the Plymouth Brethren, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other Restorationist Protestant denominations affirm that the Lord's Supper is a memorial of Jesus' death, and consider the belief in the real presence of Christ to be crypto-papist, unbiblical or a misinterpretation of the Scriptures. = Confession and other sacraments = While some Protestants, such as Lutherans, have retained the sacrament of confession, most Protestant denominations do not. = Prayers for the dead = The Anglican and Methodist traditions along with Eastern Orthodoxy, affirm the existence of an intermediate state, Hades, and thus pray for the dead, as do many Lutheran Churches, such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, which \\"remembers the faithful departed in the Prayers of the People every Sunday, including those who have recently died and those commemorated on the church calendar of saints\\". Historical and ecclesiological critique Major Protestant orientations and their relationships to each other. However, the actual history of influences is more complicated due to the influence of Nicodemites. For example, in areas where open Calvinism was outlawed, Crypto- Calvinists within Lutheran churches continued to exert an influence. Additionally, later cross denominational movements such as Pietism, Rationalism, and the Charismatic Movement complicate the history of Protestant traditions. Additionally, Crypto-Protestantism is not shown at all on this chart. Protestant Churches are considered by some Catholic critics as a negative force which \\"protests\\" and revolts against the Catholic Church. Catholic theologian Karl Adam wrote: \\"The sixteenth century revolt from the Church led inevitably to the revolt from Christ of the eighteenth century, and thence to the revolt from God of the nineteenth. And thus the modern spirit has been torn loose from the deepest and strongest supports of its life, from its foundation in the Absolute, in the self-existent Being, in the Value of all values... Instead of the man who is rooted in the Absolute, hidden in God, strong and rich, we have the man who rests upon himself, the autonomous man.\\" In response to Adam's accusation towards Protestantism, the church historian and Protestant theologian Wilhelm Pauck pointed out that \\"In summing up [...] the Roman Catholic criticism that the Reformation and Protestantism resulted from a revolt against the Church, we conclude that the Roman Catholic leaders of the sixteenth century are not without responsibility for the break-up of Christian unity\\", therefore the Schism between Protestants and Catholics was an inevitable consequence of the Protestant Reformation for which both sides have to be considered responsible.

It was developed in the 1930s by Melvin Mooney. For a specific temperature, scorch time describes how long it will take the material to vulcanize. For example, a scorch time at ambient temperature indicates the rubber will be able to remain unvulcanized at room temperature for an extended period of time. Overview The Mooney machine itself consists of a cylindrical, serrated, metal disk designed to hold a material sample without slippage during rotation. This disk is surrounded by a die chamber where the rubber is pressed with 2500 pounds of force. The rubber is then warmed for two minutes. Next, the serrated disk is rotated, in one direction only, at a speed of 2 revolutions per minute, while the torque required to rotate the disk is recorded. The torque decrease per time can be directly related to viscosity. As the material further warms during initial rotation of the serrated disk and the rubber begins to shear, the viscosity lowers and torque required decreases. Eventually, the torque will reach an inflection point, where the rubber begins to vulcanize and torque begins increasing. A shear pin on the machine prevents damage as the testing material stiffens. Comparing the torque versus time curves for different materials allows direct correlation of material viscosity and scorch time.

The bill would return the tax code to its 2013 status and make the change permanent. The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background In 2013, businesses could write-off the full cost of some capital investments up to $500,000 per investment and a total of $2 million. After that provision of the tax code expired, the limit was dropped to $25,000 per investment and a total of only $200,000. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2014 would amend the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the expensing allowance for depreciable business property, to make permanent: (1) the increased $500,000 expensing allowance for such property, (2) the increased $2,000,000 threshold amount for such property over which the amount of the expensing allowance is reduced, (3) expensing of computer software, and (4) rules for the expensing of qualified real property (i.e., leasehold improvement, restaurant, and retail improvement property). The bill would allow an inflation adjustment to the dollar amounts of the expensing allowance for taxable years beginning after 2014. The bill would eliminate the exclusion of air conditioning and heating units as property eligible for the expensing allowance. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Ways and Means on April 29, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4457 would amend section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code, which mostly affects small- to medium-sized businesses, to retroactively and permanently extend from January 1, 2014, increased limitations on the amount of investment that can be immediately deducted from taxable income. H.R. 4457 also indexes the limitations for inflation and expands the definition of property that qualifies for that immediate deduction. Permanently extending to $500,000 the annual cost of property eligible for expensing under section 179, expanding the qualifying property eligible under section 179, and indexing the amounts for inflation, would allow firms to deduct immediately from their taxable income the full costs of up to $500,000 in investment of certain equipment from their taxable income, instead of spreading the costs out over time. The benefit of the immediate expensing phases out if total qualifying investment exceeds $2 million, indexed for inflation. The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that enacting H.R. 4457 would reduce revenues, thus increasing federal deficits, by about $73 billion over the 2014-2024 period. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation affecting direct spending and revenues. Enacting H.R. 4457 would result in revenue losses in each year beginning in 2014. JCT has determined that the bill contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Procedural history The America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2014 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on April 10, 2014 by Rep. Patrick J. Tiberi (R, OH-12). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Ways and Means. It was reported (amended) on May 2, 2014 alongside House Report 113-432. The bill was scheduled to be considered on June 12, 2014. Debate and discussion According to the Tax Foundation, \\"raising the Section 179 expensing limits to 2013 levels and making them permanent is a positive move.\\" They argued that \\"the uncertainty created by having a temporary tax law that needs to be renewed periodically reduces its effectiveness in promoting business investments and economic growth.\\" The Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM) strongly supporting the bill. AEM President Dennis Slater said that \\"small businesses have been especially hard hit and still trying to recover from the Great Recession; permanent Section 179 expensing reduces uncertainty so owners can make longer-term business decisions that ensure their companies continue to grow and provide jobs. This legislation will help small businesses not only more easily reinvest in their businesses, but also invest in a stronger America.\\" Dan Danner, the president and CEO of the National Federation of Independent Business, argued that Congress could help small business by passing the bill since it would enable small businesses to \\"plan for the future, invest in the economy and hire new workers.\\" Rep. Sander Levin (D-MI) said he would vote against the bill because he thinks \\"voting permanent is counter-productive.\\" Levin thought the bill would increase the deficit. Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA) also said he was opposed to the bill, but did favor extending the tax cut for two years. The White House issued a veto threat against the bill.

Formerly, the nomads mainly used the snake skin violin or horsetail violin. The Chinese call it \\"the Mongol instrument\\" or \\"huk'in or huqin\\".–•—É—É—á–∏—Ä mongol.undesten.mn It is tuned in the interval of a fifth and is small or middle sized. The khuuchir has a small, cylindrical, square or cup-like resonator made of bamboo, wood or copper, covered with a snake skin and open at the bottom. The neck is inserted in the body of the instrument. It usually has four silk strings, of which the first and the third are accorded in unison, whereas the second and fourth are tuned in the upper fifth. The more popular of the hu'kin instruments have only two strings and are called \\"erhu\\", which means \\"two\\" (of the hu'kin) in Chinese. The bow is coated with horsetail hair and inseparably interlaced with the string-pair. A four- stringed version is called the \\"si'khuu or sihu\\", that is \\"four\\", also meaning, \\"having four ears\\". The erhu can be traced back to instruments introduced into China more than a thousand years ago. It is believed to have evolved from the xiqin. The xiqin is believed to have come from ancient nomadic Hu-people, specifically the X√≠ tribe of who lived at the borders of ancient Chinese kingdoms. The name huqin literally means \\"instrument of the Hu people\\", showing that the instrument may have originated from regions to the north, west or northeastern extremities of ancient China, generally inhabited by nomadic people on the extremities of past Chinese kingdoms.

Research topics  Research at ISE was mostly on environmental issues, especially on: * impact of global change, * conservation and recovery of ecosystems, * freshwater ecology, * soil functioning, * biology and technology of photosyntethic microorganisms, * applied ecology and biological pest control.  Organisation and units  The four units of ISE were: * The headquarters in Verbania Pallanza, mostly dealing with limnology. It is now part of CNR IRSA. * The unit in Firenze, in the research area of Sesto Fiorentino, deals with population dynamics, in waters and soils. It is now part of CNR IRET. * The unit in Pisa works on chemical, biochemical and physical aspects determining soil quality. It is now part of CNR IRET. * The unit in Sassari, in the research area of Li Punti, works on integrated pest management. It is now part of CNR IRET.  History  The headquarters of ISE in Verbania Pallanza started working as a research center in 1938 on Lake Maggiore, as the Italian Institute of Hydrobiology, as a will of Rosa Curioni in memory of her husband, the limnologist Marco De Marchi, to whom the Institute was dedicated. During the Second World War life in the Institutes was difficult, due to economic shortages and lack of communication. Nevertheless, important scientists were based here during that time: Adriano Buzzati-Traverso, Luigi Luca Cavalli- Sforza, Vittorio Tonolli and Giuseppe Ramazzotti. In 1944 the genetics section started working on Drosophila. After the war, research in the Institutes became more focused on freshwater ecology. Several limnologists passed through the Institute, most notably: Ramon Margalef, G. Evelyn Hutchinson, Richard Vollenweider, Charles Goldman, Robert G. Wetzel and W. Thomas Edmondson. The Institute entered CNR in 1977, and in 2002 ISE started its existence, with the inclusion of the units in Firenze, Pisa and Sassari. From October 2018, the Institute was dismantled and each of the research units of ISE was included in other institutes of CNR.  Publications  The Journal of Limnology was the official international journal of the ISE headquarters in Verbania, and it is now the official international journal of IRSA. It publishes papers on limnology. It started in 1999 as a continuation of the Memorie dell‚ÄôIstituto Italiano di Idrobiologia (1942‚Äì1998). It is currently published by PAGEPress, is completely free to read and is listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). Tropical Zoology was the official international journal of the unit in Firenze. It publishes papers on zoology in tropical areas. It started in 1988 as a continuation of the Monitore Zoologico Italiano (1966‚Äì1987). It is currently published by Taylor&Francis.; In the last thirty years the researchers of ISE published more than 2,000 scientific papers, resulting in more than 40,000 citations.

Once they have become lovers, she tells him about her past. She was unhappily married, and fell in love with another man named Dolski. When her husband discovered their affair, he had his rival confined in Siberia. Natka followed Dolski in Siberia, but when she finally found him, she discovered that he was with another woman. She ran away and refused to see him any more. Desperate, he committed suicide in front of her door. After telling Ferlita her story, the countess dismisses him and disappears. After searching in vain during a few months, the diplomat decides to marry the rich Erminia. During his engagement party, he receives a letter from Natka, asking him to join her at a hotel. He leaves the party and comes to her room to find that she has taken a poison and is shaken by convulsions. A short-circuit sets the hotel on fire and her husband, mad with jealousy, locks them in the room. They manage to escape by jumping out of the window while her husband is killed in the fire.

Critical Reception According to Eugenia Paulicelli, Pina Menichelli in Tigre Reale \\"is the sex symbol of Italian divas (...) and epitomizes what Fuchs has identified as the notion of appearing naked in full dress. (...) In a magisterial scene, (...) she devours a bouquet of roses, putting them in her mouth and eating them a scene that has overly sexual overtones.\\"Eugenia Paulicelli, Italian Style: Fashion & Film from Early Cinema to the Digital Age, Bloomsbury Academic, 2016, p. 71. Salvador Dali was touched by Menichelli's performance and said \\"In those days characterized by such a violent eroticism, palms and magnolias were bitten off and devoured by these women.\\"Quoted by Eugenia Paulicelli, Italian Style: Fashion & Film from Early Cinema to the Digital Age, Bloomsbury Academic, 2016, p. 71. Catherine Ramsey- Portolano considers that Tigre Reale enforces \\"the role of the female character as representative of power by avoiding the association of the diva with notions of wrongdoing, accomplished through the sublimation of her responsibility and guilt into illness and suffering.\\"Catherine Ramsey- Portolano, Performing Bodies: Female Illness in Italian Literature and Cinema (1860‚Äì1920), Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2018, p. 94, IMDb * Italy : 9 November 1916 * Spain : 15 December 1916 * Portugal: 12 February 1919 * Japan : April 1919 Bibliography * V.

Santhalinga swamigal was born to a Tamil-speaking family. That village is called Perur in Tamil Nadu, South India into an orthodox Saiva Tamil family around the middle of the 17th century. Early life St. Santhalingar lived in Perur three hundred years ago. Perur is known as Chidambaram west. (The chidambaram East is in South Arcot Dt.) It is believed that he should have been born either in the \\"Nadu Nadu\\" or \\"Thondai Nadu\\" where the 'Vira Saiva' religion, was popular. From his very childhood he developed love to serve Lord Siva ascetics, to respect and revere the symbols of Siva, namely Vibuthi and Rudraksha. His company with holy people inducted him to perceive the vanity of the worldly things. He abhorred the idea of birth and rebirth. He under took a pilgrimage to all the holy cities where Lord Siva reigns supreme in search of a Guru who could initiate him in this birth ridding process. Perur village Perur is sacred not only because it is one of the 'sivasthalams' of Kongunadu, but also because the Divine grace of Lord Siva is so immanent and perceptible that when Sundaramoorthy Nayanar, one of the four preceptors of Saivism, went to chidambaram to worship Lord Nataraja, he found there but the deity of Perur. He stays in this Thillaikkoil hymn. Hence it is no wonder that our St.Santhalinga Swamigal was also attracted by this holy city. Siva prakasar and Santhalinga Swamigal Sri-la-Sri. Sivagnana Balaya Swamigal II, the Head of the Bommaiya Adheenami was his contemporary, whose miraculous feats and wealth of -Sivagnanam- possessed wide popularity. St.Santhalinga Swamigal desired to see him, During his sojourn there, he got the acquaintance of Thuraimangalam Sivaprakasa Swamigal, a great seer, a Virasaiva saint, scholar and poet at Thiruvannamalai. St.Santhalinga Swamigal enjoyed the company of Siva Prakasar. Along with him, he went and stayed at Bommaiyapuram =Gnambikai Ammal and Santhalinga Swamigal= With the blessings of St Sivagnana Balaysswamigal. St. Santhalingaswamigal married Gnanambikai She is the sister of Siva prakasa Swamigal, Velaiyar and Karunai Prakasar. His family life was in conformity with the maxim \\"If a man fulfilled aright the duties of the house-holder, where is the need for him to take up other duties?\\" His family life never stood in the way of his endeavours in realisation of Truth. By undaunted perseverance he rose to perfection. Pupils flocked around him to par take his teachings. One day when he spoke on total renunciation, condemning the love for transient worldly things, some of his reactionary students began to indulge in scandalising the verity of his speech. \\"Could it be possible for a man living with his wife to preach total renunciation, unless he be a hypocrite?\\" they doubted. Sensing their feelings, St.Santhalingar, seated his wife Mrs. Gnambikai on his lap and continued his teaching. To their utter bewilderment they saw Lord Neelkanta with his consort Gowri in the place of St.Santhalingar and his wife Gnanambikai. The pupils fell down instantaneously before Swamigal and apologised fervently for their mistake. Swamigal took pity on them and loved them more than before. After this incident he resolved to renounce the world thoroughly in its entirety and declared that he would set out for alms next day and that if he was served rice with milk at the very first house he approached, he would become a complete ascetic thenceforth. He was served rice with milk at the very first house he resorted to. From that moment he broke all his worldly attachment and renounced the world utterly. He sent away his wife Gnanambikai to her brother siva Prakasar who was the Prime disciple of the Pommapura Aadeenam. There were no issues for them. She stayed along with his brother Velaiyar and became a part of the brought of her brother's son Sundaresanar. . The later years At a proper time St.Santhalinga Swamigal gave vent to his long cherished desire to be initiated in the noble venture of the realisation of God. Observing the 'upadesa', he was enjoying the divine bliss in the presence of his Guru. Sometime later, his Guru ordered him to settle in a place he liked and work for the salvation of the humanity. Obeying the order, St.Santhalinga Swamigal settled at Perur, the holy city where his favourite deity Lord Nataraja reigns supreme and continued his religious pursuits. His fame began to spread far and wide around Perur. His retinue began to swell in the form of followers and well-wishers. Except the time he spent for bathing, dieting and teaching, almost the whole of the day was devoted in meditation. One day when he opened his eyes after meditation, Lord Nataraja with his consort Maragathabikai., -seated on Nandhi, appeared before him. St.Santhalinga Swamigal enjoyed the vision of God with devouring look. He, with down pouring eyes, hands folded on his head with reverence, with melting heart, prostrated before the God numberless times. His hymns bear many references vouching for this incident (Vairakkiya Catakam Devotional part) when the vision disappeared his languish was indescribable. He craved to have the 'darshan' once again as can be seen in his works. The power of his 'Tapas' was so strong that when- ever he set out for alms, the womenfolk hurriedly rushed to cover their sons and men folk, fearing that his very sight would infuse in them 'Vairakkiya' and render them renounce the world immediately Perur St.Santhalinga swamigal's Disciple Of his numerous pupils, Kumara Deva ‚Äì was a prince of Kannada Desa and also, the author of many Vedantha works in Tamil. Perur Chidambara Swamigal, the commentator of St.Santhalinga Swamigal's works, was his disciple. =End of life= At the age of Ninety nine St.Santhaling Swamigal entered into eternal bliss on 'Makam' day in the month of 'Masi'. His body was laid in Samadhi in Perur, around, where the present shrine and other institutions have grown up.

Peyroux continued to perform with the band along with vocalist Queen Esther, who eventually became the band's mainstay singer. JC Hopkins and Queen Esther Legendary country singer/songwriter Willie Nelson heard a demo of Norah Jones singing Hopkins' song \\"Dreams Come True\\" with the JC Hopkins Biggish Band and decided to record the tune as a duet with Jones.

The nickname refers to the Siberian village near where it was found.  Discovery The head of this specimen, entirely covered with skin and very well-preserved, was first discovered in 2002. After hearing about the discovery, a polar explorer carried out the expedition with his team to extract the remains from the permafrost. One of the members of the team was the French polar explorer, \\"Mammoth-Hunter\\" Bernard Buigues, known for carrying out expeditions to the North Pole, Siberia since the 1990s. It took three excavation trips to gather and put the Yukagir fossil together. Although mammoth remains are not a rarity, few are as notable as this specimen. The discovery of the Yukagir Mammoth, is described as one of the greatest paleontological discoveries of all time as it revealed that woolly mammoths had temporal glands between the ear and the eye and the well- preserved remains of the Yukagir Mammoth, such as the foot, shows that the soles of the feet contained many cracks that would have helped in gripping icy surfaces during locomotion. Like modern elephants, woolly mammoths were Paenungulata, meaning they walked on their toes and had large, fleshy pads behind the toes. Among other discoveries, the Yukagir Mammoth showed that the species had suffered from spondylitis in two vertebrae, and osteomyelitis which is also known from some other specimens. Several specimens have healed bone fractures, showing that the animals had survived these injuries. The Yukagir Mammoth head The Yukagir mammoth's permafrost tomb preserved its head, tusks, front legs, and parts of its stomach and intestinal tract. From its bones and enormous tusks, the scientists who rushed to the site (including mammoth experts Dick Mol and Larry Agenbroad) guessed that the woolly mammoth was an old male that when alive stood over nine feet tall at the shoulder and weighed four to five tons. Furthermore, scientists were able to discover that the main component of the Yukagir's final meal was grass, including stems from the family Poaceae. Remarkably, like many of the dung's floral remains, the stems have retained their color and shape ever since the woolly mammoth tore them from the tundra roughly 22,500 years ago. Based on the Yukagir Mammoth's last meal, scientists were able to discover facts about the elephant's ancestors and conduct an environmental reconstruction showing fungi's importance in the process of nutrient cycling in the mammoth steppe. The following types of research were agreed upon at the meeting of the Scientific Council: * Geological and pedological surveys of the site, as well as research on the process of fossilization; * Research on the external structures of the mammoth, as well as on the internal structures using nondamaging methods; * Histological, cytological, and genetic research on the mammoth's soft tissue; * Paleobotanical and paleoclimatologic analysis; * Microbiological research on the soil and the inside of the mammoth.  Exhibitions  Since the Yukagir Mammoth has been found, it has been transported globally for informative and educational purposes. The specimen was displayed in an effort to understand the link between life and the global environment with the theme of the Expo - \\"Nature's Wisdom.\\" To keep it preserved, the exhibition room needed to be kept at -15 ¬∞C. The 2005 World Expo was held in Aichi, Japan at took place on November 17‚Äì18, 2005.

He was one of the greatest rulers of the dynasty.  Biography  Map of Khurasan, Transoxiana and Tokharistan He was the son of Nasr Khan, a Karakhanid ruler from the western branch of the family, known as the \\"Alids\\", which was named after their ancestor Ali ibn Musa Qara Khan. B√∂ritigin is first mentioned during some time after 1034, when was imprisoned by the sons of the Karakhanid deceased Ali- Tegin, who was from the eastern branch of the family, known as the \\"Hasanids\\". However, B√∂ritigin eventually managed in 1038 to escape to his brother who was at Uzgend, and then raised an army consisting of Kumiji tribes from the upper Oxus river. He then invaded the territories of the Ghaznavid Sultan Mas'ud I, and plundered Khuttal and Vakhsh. He then conquered Chaghaniyan and defeated a Ghaznavid counter-attack. The following year, B√∂ritgin began fighting the sons of Ali-Tegin and by 1040 had annexed much of Transoxiana. He then made Samarkand his capital and took the title of \\"Tamghach Khan Ibrahim\\". In 1042, the newly crowned Ghaznavid ruler Maw'dud invaded the territories of the Seljuqs and conquered much of Khorasan. This greatly increased the fame of Maw'dud and made B√∂ritigin acknowledge him as his suzerain. In ca. 1050, Maw'dud, with the aid B√∂ritigin and an army sent by the former Kakuyid ruler Garshasp I re-invaded Khorasan; B√∂ritigin and his commander Qashgha invaded Khwarazm and Tirmidh, however, during the invasion, Maw'dud died and thus the invasion failed. The Seljuqs then extended their rule as far as Vakhsh and appointed a certain Abu 'Ali ibn Shadhan as the governor of their new conquests. After this, B√∂ritigin seems to have stopped recognizing the Ghaznavids as his suzerain. In 1059/60 B√∂ritigin forced the Karakhanid rulers of Farghana to acknowledge him as their suzerain. In the early 1060s, the newly crowned Seljuq ruler Alp Arslan invaded Transoxiana, which made B√∂ritigin complain to the Abbasid caliph of needless aggression from the Seljuqs. B√∂ritigin later died in 1068 and was succeeded by his son Shams al- Mulk Nasr. He also had a daughter named Terken Khatun who later married the son of Alp Arslan, Malik-Shah I.

In 1958 he formed The Oscar Martinez Band. In 1960 the band recorded ‚ÄúMakes No Difference‚Äù and ‚ÄúLa Bamba‚Äù and the band's popularity exploded. In 1965, Oscar composed his big hit, ‚ÄúEl Tejano Enamorado.‚Äù The tune was recorded by Isidro Lopez, who headed one of the top orchestras of the day, and it became a hit on Tejano radio across the state. Oscar hosted a very popular radio show in Corpus Christi on KCCT Radio, every morning, from 7:00 am to 8:00 am which was later expanded to include a 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm show every week-day. Oscar has written many songs but is best known for his hit songs ‚ÄúEl Tejano Enamorado‚Äù and ‚ÄúEl Gallo Copeton.‚Äù It is said that Oscar was the first songwriter to use the word ‚ÄúTejano‚Äù in a song and album. Oscar, who is still active, is also known for writing tunes with catchy lyrics, a big brassy sound and a musical career that has spanned over half a century. =Early life= Known to Tejano Music devotees as El Tejano Enamorado, Oscar Martinez was born in Corpus Christi, Texas to Eloisa and Pedro Martinez in a small barrio known as ‚ÄúLoma Rosa.‚Äù Oscar's mother, Eloisa, had two sisters; Goya and Ramona; two half-brothers, Manuel and Pedro Guerra; and a half-sister, Erlinda Guerra. Oscar's father, Pedro A. Martinez, worked at an oil mill in the cotton bale department. The family lived in a house at 407 Duncan Street, which was located just across the railroad tracks from the oil mill. Oscar grew up with three brothers, Joe, Johnny and Victor. He also had a half-brother, Daniel. In the area close to present Port and Agnes streets, near an oil cotton factory known to residents as ‚ÄúLa Mantequeria,‚Äù Oscar's grandmother, Dona Santos Guitron Galindo, owned several businesses that included rental apartments, and a small grocery store, where she used a small corn graining machine to prepare and sell masa de maiz (corn dough). In those days this masa de maiz was used to make corn tortillas. In addition to masa, Oscar's grandmother hawked butter, eggs and other goods to barrio residents. She also owned cows, chickens, rabbits and goats. Oscar attended Southgate Elementary School and Driscoll Jr. High. It was there that Oscar joined the band and was assigned the tuba as his instrument. Oscar attended and graduated (1953) from Roy Miller High School where he played in the school's Buccaneer Band. =Musical career= Although Oscar did not play the trumpet in his high school band, he acquired proficiency with the instrument sufficient to lead a small local band that performed in a Corpus Christi nightspot known as El Macambo (located on Morgan and Pueblo Streets). From there the band redeployed to ‚ÄúIbarra‚Äôs Place‚Äù on Port Street. It was there that the then seventeen-year-old performed with older musicians and where he first met Isidro Lopez. Lopez performed mechanic duties with his Dad during the day and played the alto sax after hours at Ibarra's Nite Club. Oscar Martinez joined the Isidro Lopez Orchestra, then one of the most popular bands in the business in 1954, and toured with the band through 1956. After recording some ten records for Torrero Records the popularity of the Isidro Lopez Orchestra was at an all-time high. Unable to meet the band's touring demands, Oscar was forced to leave the Lopez organization in order to keep his day job at a local auto parts store. Oscar continued performing local gigs and in 1958 formed The Oscar Martinez Band. Band members included Joe Morris at trumpet; David Reyes at tenor sax; Rudy Alvarado at alto sax; Tony Arnelas, Jr. at drums; Joe Guajardo at guitar and Juan Perez at vocals. Past band members included Raul Ornelas on drums and vocals. Oscar Martinez played the trumpet. The band's first recording, ‚ÄúLa Lumbre‚Äù (penned by Oscar Martinez) and ‚ÄúLlorando Por Ti‚Äù (written by Juan Perez) did well on radio, with increased bookings. Then in 1960 the band reached another plateau with the success of new recordings, ‚ÄúMakes No Difference‚Äù and ‚ÄúLa Bamba.‚Äù The band's popularity was aided by Oscar Martinez's daily radio show on KCCT radio in Corpus Christi. In 1965, Oscar wrote his big hit, ‚ÄúEl Tejano Enamorado.‚Äù Isidro Lopez recorded the tune first, with accordion instrumentation. Then Oscar's band recorded the tune. ‚ÄúEl Tejano Enamorado‚Äù became a massive hit all over the State of Texas. Everything seemed to be working well when tragedy struck. On Sunday, March 7, 1965, an unfortunate car accident occurred, near La Luisa and El Campo, Texas. Two young sailors in a Mustang died instantly; all the members of the band suffered bruises, broken limbs and head injuries. Oscar Martinez lost his front teeth and suffered a broken leg. It took nine months for the band to recover from the injuries sustained by its members and to return to performances. Bright and energetic Oscar Martinez is known as one of the last ‚Äúpioneers of Tejano Music‚Äù and continues to live in his hometown, Corpus Christi, Texas. Oscar has written many songs but is best known for his hit songs ‚ÄúEl Tejano Enamorado‚Äù and ‚ÄúEl Gallo Copeton.‚Äù In addition to writing, recording and performing his music, Oscar Martinez has authored a book and creates art. And he still models the dark lenses and a pompadour hair-do that makes him a distinctive living legend. On October 26, 2010, Oscar Martinez recorded ‚ÄúThe Corpus Christi Rose‚Äù and ‚ÄúKiss me again tonight.‚Äù Currently (Sep 2012) Oscar Martinez is 78 years of age and recently performed with Larry Lange and the Lonely Knights as they staged ‚ÄúA Chicano Soul Revue.‚Äù This revue included several of Oscar Martinez's early compositions. The act has performed at the Josephine Theater in San Antonio, the Bob Bullock Museum in Austin, Texas and several other places. Personal Life Oscar Martinez married Eduvina Perez and has a family that includes four children: Javier, Imelda, Iris and Jaime. That marriage ended in divorce in 1984. In 1977 Oscar started working with American National Insurance as an insurance agent. He also worked for other insurance companies for about twenty years, while continuing to pursue his career performing in bands and composing music. In 1996, Oscar Martinez started work on a book called ‚ÄúTejano Music Talk.‚Äù The book is unique in that Oscar includes sheet music and a short biography. Oscar is currently working on a second printing of this book. Honors On March 20, 1999, Oscar Martinez was inducted into the Tejano Music Hall of Fame in San Antonio, Texas in the category of Composer. Roberto Pulido, Laura Canales, Joe Mejia, and Rogelio Rios were others honored that evening. On August 3, 2002 Oscar Martinez was inducted into the Tejano R.O.O.T.S.

She was the country's first female government minister. Before entering politics, Marie-Jos√®phe worked as a schoolteacher and social worker. She was a high-level advisor to the government of David Dacko in the 1960s, and remained in favour after Jean-B√©del Bokassa seized power in 1966. Bokassa appointed her to cabinet in 1970, and she remained in office until he was deposed in 1979, holding a number of different portfolios. Marie-Jos√®phe re- entered politics in 1993 as an independent member of the National Assembly, and served until her death. Early life Marie-Jos√®phe was born in the town of Ippy (now in Ouaka prefecture), the daughter of Achille Petit-Jean (a Belgian mining engineer) and Augustine Valagandede (a Banda woman originally from Mbr√®s). Her father left the country before she was born, and only acknowledged her as his daughter several decades later. Because of her mixed- race background, Marie-Jos√®phe received a French-language education, attending schools in Bangui and Mba√Øki run by Catholic nuns. She was given an additional surname during her schooling, Jeannot, in order to identify her as of European ancestry, but took her husband's surname (Franck) after her marriage in 1951. In 1960, Marie-Jos√®phe received a scholarship from the national government to attended a home economics training course in Paris, which was worth 30,000 francs. She initially worked as a schoolteacher when she returned to the CAR, but in October 1961 joined the civil service as an assistant social worker. In October 1962, President David Dacko appointed Marie-Jos√®phe to his Social and Economic Council, where she served until January 1966. In February 1964, he also made her head of the Service for the Advancement of Women, a new government agency dedicated to improving the status of women in Central African society. Marie-Jos√®phe was further promoted in October 1965, becoming Director of Social Affairs. In March 1967, she was appointed to the inaugural national committee of the Central African Red Cross Society.Bradshaw and Fandos-Rius, p. 583. Politics and later life In January 1965, Marie- Jos√®phe was elected president of the Union F√©minine Centrafricaine (UFCA; \\"Central African Women's Association\\"), a position which she would hold until her death. The UFCA had been formed the previous year as the women's section of MESAN, the sole legal political party at the time. In February 1970, Marie- Jos√®phe was made Secretary of State for Social Affairs in the government of President Jean-B√©del Bokassa, who had seized power in January 1966. She was the first female government minister in the CAR, and remained in cabinet for over nine years, only departing in September 1979 when Bokassa was deposed.Akyeampong and Gates, p. 227. She held a number of different portfolios and titles during her time in office, at various points being responsible for social affairs, education, and the advancement of women.Female Ministers of the Central African Republic/ R√©publique Centroafricaine/ B√™- Afr√Æca, Worldwide Guide to Women in Leadership. Retrieved 26 October 2016. Marie-Jos√®phe returned to politics at the 1993 general election, winning election to the National Assembly as an independent and standing in the Mbr√®s constituency. She was re-elected at the 1998 election, but died in office in December 2001, while undergoing medical treatment in Paris. Her body was flown back to the CAR, and she lay in state at the National Assembly buildings for two days before being buried in her home village. Her funeral was attended by President Ange-F√©lix Patass√© and various other government officials. Personal life In 1951, aged 18, Marie-Jos√®phe married Antonio Franck, a civil servant originally from Middle Congo. They had seven children together, four sons and three daughters. Antonio Franck also became a minister under President Bokassa, entering cabinet three years before his wife. The couple divorced in 1973, and Marie-Jos√®phe later remarried to Andr√© Zani-F√© Touam- Bona, another of Bokassa's ministers.

It was first published in 1847 or 1848 by Thomas Affleck (1812-1868), a Scottish immigrant and owner of the Glenblythe Plantation in Gay Hill, Washington County, Texas. The book contains a detailed system, including blank tables to be filled in, that allowed plantation owners to track the efficiency of their production. It also includes essays on various aspects of plantation management, such as the proper care and discipline of slaves. History and influence Thomas Affleck published the first edition of the Cotton Plantation Record and Account Book in 1847 or 1848. In 1842 he established a plant nursery and experimental cotton farm near Washington, Mississippi. Later, discussing the origin of his Account Book, Affleck wrote: > During my first year's planting, I prepared two books with the pen, almost > identical to that now published for the cotton plantation, and gave one to > each of my next year's overseers, making it a part of my contract with them, > that these books were to be correctly kept and returned to me at the end of > the year. And, with a little assistance and encouragement, it was done. And > what a satisfaction it was to me! Soon after that, at the suggestion of a > New Orleans Publisher, I prepared him a transcript of the plan for > publication. Affleck published new editions every year thereafter until the American Civil War of 1861-1865. After the war, the name of the book was changed to The Farmers' Record and Account Book and the scope widened to include \\"any system of husbandry, ... the products of any climate, and ... farms of any extent.\\" Affleck's book was a consistent antebellum bestseller in the cotton-producing states of the lower Mississippi River Valley. Historian Mark M. Smith has noted that \\"it was precisely on plantations that masters employed the most rigorous, capitalist management techniques,\\" which created a need for specialized ledgers and accounting techniques, Affleck's being \\"one of the most popular [of these] record book brands.\\" By the end of the 1850s, his Account Book had sold over three thousand copies, contributing to his powerful influence on the direction of the \\"plantation economy into scientific and systematic channels.\\" According to historian Robert Williams, Affleck's manual included \\"a number of other forms which marked an improvement in the system of rural book-keeping. The record forms were essentially consistent with the intent and purpose of modern cost-accounting, and followed the best and most advanced principles of efficient administrative management.\\" Advertisement for the Cotton Plantation Record and Account Book published in 1854 in The American Cotton Planter Contents The book contained a detailed system which allowed plantation owners to record and track the accounts of their plantations, including pounds of cotton produced per slave, per acre, per bale of cotton, and the gross and net value of production. Space was also provided for recording births and deaths of slaves, their clothing and tools, and other such assets and debits. Unlike many contemporary systems of agricultural book- keeping, Affleck's book took account of depreciation, the costs of labor, and other \\"often neglected factors.\\" According to historian Walter Johnson, the book \\"provided a convenient table by which slaves' annual increase in value could be tracked in the same set of tables as their daily cotton production, and a page at the back where the planter could fill in the value of his slave force, and calculate \\"interest on the same at ten percent.\\"\\" It was published in four numbers for plantations with fewer than 40, 80, 120, and 160 \\"hands,\\" which retailed for $2.50, $3.00, $3.50, and $4.00 respectively. It also contained advertising for the slave markets of New Orleans. Affleck's book also contained essays and advice on slave management, including, e.g., George Washington's instructions to his own slave overseer and instructions for managing the health of slaves. =The Duties of an Overseer= The Account Book included Affleck's essay, The Duties of an Overseer, which noted that one of the most important aspects \\"of a fine crop is an increase in the number and a marked increase in the condition and value of the negroes.\\" Slaveowners, for various reasons, were willing or eager to allow their slaves to attend religious services and Affleck, in The Duties of an Overseer, agreed with this practice: > You will find that an hour devoted every Sabbath morning to their moral and > religious instruction would prove a great aid to you in bringing about a > better state of things amongst the Negroes. It has been thoroughly tried, > and with the most satisfactory results, in many parts of the South. As a > matter of mere interest it has proved to be advisable, to say nothing of it > as a point of duty. The effect upon their general good behavior, their > cleanliness, and good conduct on the Sabbath is such as alone to recommend > it to the Planter and Overseer.

It was the first stable, widely read journal covering feminist art. By the time the final publication was produced The Feminist Art Journal had a circulation of eight thousand copies; and ten thousand copies of the last edition were printed.Gauthier, Olivia. 2019. ‚ÄúA Feminist Reckoning.‚Äù Art in America 107 (4): 27‚Äì30. History The Feminist Art Journal was started in 1972 in New York by several women involved in the American feminist art movement, including Cindy Nemser, Patricia Mainardi, and Irene Moss. The three women formed the journal after having been on the staff of Women and Art, a publication funded by the Redstocking Artists. Women and Art was intended to cover topics surrounding the women's art movement, but only one issue was ever published because of internal staff arguments. The three editors founded The Feminist Art Journal with three stated goals: 1) To be the voice of women artists in the art world; 2) To improve the status of all women artists; and 3) To expose sexist exploitation and discrimination. In 1972, Cindy Nemser became the sole editor of the journal; and in 1975 her husband joined her as a co-editor.Balducci, Temma, author. 2010. ‚ÄúFeminist Art Journal.‚Äù Oxford Art Online. doi:10.1093/gao/9781884446054.article.T2085773. The majority of the articles written in The Feminist Art Journal were all authored by women. Some of the prominent contributors to the journal were Faith Ringgold, Marcia Tucker, Howardena Pindell, and Faith Bromberg. In its five-year run, The Feminist Art Journal published interviews with breakthrough female artists, and included creative writing pieces and art historical essays to keep the content consistently diverse. Featured artists worked in all mediums, and over twenty historical profiles of female figures in art were published. The articles included both a positive modern review of the artist's work, as well as a biographical section which included why the artist was looked over. The Feminist Art Journal was also used as a space where gender discrimination within the art world was called out. In the first two editions of The Feminist Art Journal a column called \\"Male Chauvinist Expos√©\\" was featured in the journal. Both individual people and institutions, spanning newspapers, museums, and universities were denounced for sexist language and actions. Over time, the publication's expos√©s became fewer as they focused on living female artists. The interviews conducted by the Feminist Art Journal covered the artist's childhood, career, education, influences, gender role/career balance, and even any relationship with a male artist. In 1975, in an attempted to attract more readers to the publication during a time of financial strain, Cindy Nemser changed the format of the journal from a tabloid style to a more traditional one where advertisements were now being included within the journal. This change ultimately did not help the journal survive with it folding due to financial strains. In an interview Patricia Mainardi claimed that journals like The Feminist Art Journal saw their demise because they reached their goals. More mainstream publications were pressured into paying attention to female artists after the gained success of publications like The Feminist Art Journal, so journals that were specifically devoted to female artists became devalued.

Henry Robert Reynolds, detail from 1882 portrait by Joseph Sydney Willis Hodges Life Born at Romsey, Hampshire on 26 February 1825, he was the grandson of Henry Revell Reynolds, and the elder son of John Reynolds (1782‚Äì1862), Congregational minister, by his second wife Sarah (died 1868), daughter of Robert Fletcher of Chester and sister of Joseph Fletcher; Sir John Russell Reynolds was his younger brother. Educated mainly by his father, in September 1841 he entered Coward College, London to prepare for the ministry. He matriculated at London University in the same year, obtaining the university mathematical scholarship in 1844 and graduating with a BA in 1848. In the same year he was made a fellow of University College, London. In April 1846 Reynolds became pastor of the congregational church at Halstead in Essex, receiving permission to curtail his course at Coward College. He was ordained on 16 July 1846; among his congregation was the future missionary Matthew Atmore Sherring, whose father was one of Reynolds's deacons. In 1849 Reynolds accepted a call to be minister of the East Parade chapel at Leeds, entering on the duties on 28 March. In 1855 his health gave way, and during next five years he spent time on visits to Egypt, Italy, and the south of France, being frequently ill. In June 1860 Reynolds accepted the post of president of Cheshunt College, where he moved in August, and acted as professor of dogmatic theology, ecclesiastical history, and New Testament exegesis. From 1866 to 1874 he was co-editor with Henry Allon of the British Quarterly Review, and from 1877 to 1882 he edited the Evangelical Magazine. In 1869 he received an honorary degree (DD) from the University of Edinburgh, and in the next few years he was engaged on the project of enlarging the Cheshunt College buildings, in celebration of the centenary of the institution. This work was completed in 1872. In November 1894 failing health compelled Reynolds to resign the presidency of Cheshunt College, and in May 1895 he retired to Broxbourne in Hertfordshire. He died there on 10 September 1896, and was buried in Cheshunt cemetery on 15 September. Works In 1888 appeared Reynolds's best known work, the \\"Introduction\\" and \\"Exposition\\" on the Gospel of St John, contributed to the Pulpit Commentary. Other works were: * The Beginnings of the Divine Life: a Course of Seven Sermons, London, 1859. * Notes on the Christian Life: a Selection of Sermons, London, 1865. * The Philosophy of Prayer and Principles of Christian Service; with other Papers, London, 1881. * Buddhism : a Comparison and a Contrast between Buddhism and Christianity ('Present Day Tracts, 2nd ser.

(Present Day Tracts, No. 80), London, 1896. Reynolds edited the Congregational Register for the West Riding of Yorkshire (London) from 1855 to 1857, and undertook in 1884, with Owen Charles Whitehouse, the prophecies of Hosea and Amos in An Old Testament Commentary for English Readers. With his brother, John Russell Reynolds, he wrote a novel dealing with the intellectual and religious questions of the time, which was published anonymously in 1860 with the title Yes and No. Reynolds made a study of the writings of Auguste Comte, on whom he published a criticism in the British Quarterly Review in April 1854. In 1870 and 1871 he edited two series of essays on church problems by various writers, entitled Ecclesia, and in 1874 he published lectures on \\"John the Baptist\\" in the new series of Congregational Union Lectures. They reached a third edition in 1888. He wrote frequently for The Expositor, and contributed to the Dictionary of Christian Biography. Family On 17 December 1840, at Walworth chapel, Reynolds married Louisa Caroline (died 11 October 1895), the only surviving daughter of Silas Palmer of Newbury, Berkshire. They had no children.

A Democratic member of the North Carolina Senate, he represents the 37th district, which is based in Mecklenburg County. Jackson also serves in the North Carolina National Guard. After the September 11 attacks, Jackson enlisted in the United States Army Reserve and served in Kandahar Province during the War in Afghanistan. His military service continues to this day as a Captain in the JAG Corps with the Army National Guard. He drills monthly with the 113th Sustainment Brigade. After graduating from law school, Jackson worked as an assistant district attorney in Gaston County and tried over one hundred cases ranging from DWI to first degree murder. He has served in the North Carolina Senate since 2014. Early life Raised in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, Jackson earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in philosophy from Emory University. He also earned a law degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Earlier career and military service Jackson served as a Specialist (E-4) during his year-long deployment to Afghanistan. After returning home from his deployment, Jackson entered the ROTC program to become a commissioned officer. He is now a Captain (O-3). Prior to joining the state Senate, Jackson worked as a prosecutor in Gaston County, North Carolina. He was forced to resign upon joining the senate, as the state constitution prohibits serving as an elected official and a prosecutor simultaneously.  North Carolina Senate  When Sen. Dan Clodfelter resigned to become Mayor of Charlotte in 2014, Jackson was selected by local Democrats in the Mecklenburg County district to serve out the remainder of Clodfelter's term. They also chose him to replace Clodfelter as the Democratic nominee on the November 2014 general election ballot. Because no other person had filed to run against Clodfelter for the seat, Jackson ran unopposed for a full two-year term.Profile (2), CharlotteObserver.com, May 3, 2014. Jackson was re-elected to his second full term in 2016, winning with 68% of the vote against Bob Diamond. In 2014, Jackson's speech on the budget process gained national attention. Jackson also gained national attention when he was the only legislator to show up for work on a snow day in February 2015.Profile, storify.com; accessed January 22, 2017. The episode earned him a featured segment on The Rachel Maddow Show. Jackson has repeatedly introduced legislation to end gerrymandering by implementing independent redistricting. He also supports universal pre-K education programs. In 2017, Jackson introduced a bill to repeal the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, a North Carolina law that requires people in government-owned buildings to use the bathroom that corresponds to their birth certificate. The bill also prevents municipalities from passing non- discrimination ordinances. Jackson is also known for his fight to close the consent loophole. Under North Carolina law, women cannot legally revoke their consent to engage in sexual intercourse once that act has consensually begun, thanks to a 'loophole' afforded by the state's Supreme Court. Various news outlets mentioned Jackson as a potential candidate against Republican incumbent Richard Burr in North Carolina's 2016 U.S. Senate election. Jackson declined to run and Burr won re-election. He was also mentioned as a top potential challenger to North Carolina's other Republican Senator, Thom Tillis in 2020, and is a potential candidate for 2022.  Personal life  Jackson currently works as a business litigator at Womble Bond Dickinson in Charlotte. Jackson also continues to serve in the North Carolina Army National Guard as a Captain in the Judge Advocate General's Corps. Jackson is married to Marisa, a marketing director, with two young sons and a daughter. Haden, now 10 years old, attends fifth grade at a public school in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools system.

Born and first educated in Perth, Western Australia, Watson spent most of his life working for and then later the cataloguing of, gay law reform and the gay rights movement in New South Wales and Australia. Background and early years Alexander Watson was born in Perth, Western Australia, the son of a doctor, Alec Watson, and Margaret Newnham, a nurse. Originally educated in Geraldton, Watson moved with his family to Perth and, despite the wishes of his parents, was further educated at Perth Modern School. Watson won a scholarship to the University of Western Australia in 1960, where he studied for a Bachelor of Arts reading history and philosophy. For his honours year in 1964, Watson transferred to the government department at the University of Sydney, where he took a position teaching Australian politics. Career After coming out at an early age, Watson became involved in early movements to establish Gay advocacy groups pushing for decriminalisation in New South Wales, spurred on after the Sexual Offences Act 1967 decriminalised homosexual acts in England and Wales. Watson was in Canberra three years later when the ACT Homosexual Law Reform Society was formed, which he immediately joined. However, much closer to home Watson was much more heavily involved in the establishment of the Campaign Against Moral Persecution (CAMP), which was Australia's first openly homosexual group, formed in September 1970. In early 1972, Watson became Co- President with Sue Wills. In this role he spoke against the use of aversion therapy and psychosurgery then practised against women and homosexuals, prior to the removal of homosexuality from the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1973. Watson also organised the first gay demonstration, held outside the Liberal Party headquarters in Ash Street, Sydney in October 1971. Serving as Co-President until 1975, Watson remained a member of CAMP until 1977 when he resigned as the organisation gradually moved to focus on its phone-counselling service. Watson nevertheless continued his activism and was a regular contributor to the gay press, such as the Sydney Star. In 1976 he notably appeared on the ABC's Monday Conference program in Mt Isa, debating the topic of gay rights, in front of a partly hostile audience with one member throwing faeces at him. Watson maintained his composure throughout and won over the audience. In 1980, with Craig Johnston, Watson helped establish the Gay Rights Lobby (GRL) (now known as the NSW Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby) group, and began the push to decriminalise homosexual acts under the Crimes Act 1900. Watson, in a dispute over tactics and his administrative style, fell out with GRL, but continued his activism work outside the group. With the growing recognition of the threat of HIV/AIDS for the gay community, Watson helped to form the AIDS Action Committee in mid-1983, which later transformed into the AIDS Council of NSW (ACON), serving as its first president. In late 1984, the Federal Minister for Health Neal Blewett established the National Advisory Council on AIDS, with Watson being named as one of its first members. Watson was a member of a delegation to Premier Neville Wran in May 1984 on the morning of the introduction of his Private Members Bill called the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1984, to decriminalise homosexuality. Watson attempted to persuade the Premier to introduce an equal age of consent clause and when Wran refused, he argued for the inclusion of protections for persons between the ages of 16 and 18 years, which Wran agreed to. Honours In 2010, together with Sue Wills, he received ACON's Community Hero Award. In retirement, Watson became involved with Sydney's Pride History Group, Sydney's gay and lesbian history organisation, and was President from 2010 until his death. In February 2014 Watson objected to claims from members of the Labor Party that they were solely responsible for the decriminalisation of homosexuality in NSW: \\"Credit goes to a handful of individuals, initially all Labor and some minor party independents. We should acknowledge George Petersen in particular, Frank Walker, Jack Ferguson and Barrie Unsworth [...] Neville Wran, while personally in favour of homosexual law reform, bungled it badly and was only constructive at the end, in 1984 [...] It was a demonstration of ineptitude and failure of leadership by numerous MPs and to the glory of no major party.\\" On his death on 6 May 2014, the President of ACON Mark Orr noted that \\"Lex was a dedicated and courageous pioneer whose work laid the foundations for a more authentic, caring and inclusive society, and for that he has earned himself pride of place in the history of our community [...] His work in relation to LGBT rights was ground-breaking, and throughout his life the outcomes he helped achieve in relation to law reform and community health have been significant and enduring.\\" In the 2014 Queen's Birthday Honours, Watson was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for \\"significant service to the community as an advocate for gay and lesbian rights.\\" Watson had been aware of the award before it was gazetted, but died before he could be presented with the honour.

In 1967 they became REM Social after a local working men's club started financing the club, before being renamed REMYCA United the following year, the name reflecting links with the REM social club and the Bootle YMCA. Under the new name the club joined Division Three of the I Zingari Alliance, winning it at the first attempt. After winning higher divisions in successive seasons, the club entered the I Zingari League. The 1975‚Äì76 season saw REMYCA win the league's Challenge Cup, and the club were league champions in 1987‚Äì88. In 1990‚Äì91 they won the Lancashire Amateur Cup. The mid-1990s were a highly-successful period for the club as they won both the league title and the Challenge Cup in three successive seasons between 1993‚Äì94 and 1995‚Äì96, before winning the Challenge Cup again in 1998‚Äì99. In 2001 they joined the newly re-established Division Two of the Liverpool County Combination.

Inc. is a privately held, independent wholesale distributor of industrial electrical equipment and supplies. The company is headquartered in Albuquerque, New Mexico where it was founded in 1977. Summit provides electrical equipment and supplies and supply chain solutions to electrical professionals, contractors, project managers, engineers, and others working on commercial, industrial, residential, marine, or export projects. Summit also provides electrical materials and services to contractors for general maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO); original equipment manufacturers (OEMs); and engineering, procurement, and construction (EP&C;) professionals. The company ranked 17th on Modern Distrubition Management's 2019 list of top electrical distributors based on 2018 revenue of $505 million. Summit has 25 service centers in the United States ‚Äì located in New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma ‚Äì and a service center in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It also has three global divisions that support specific industries and specialized project requirements. The company's international sales division and EP&C; division are located in Houston, Texas. Its marine division is in New Orleans, Louisiana. History =1977 to 1987= Summit Electric Supply Co. Inc. was incorporated on May 11, 1977 in the state of New Mexico by its original officers Victor Jury Sr., president; David Meredith, vice president and general manager; and Victor Jury Jr., vice president. The elder Jury had previously worked with Meredith at Graybar Electric Co. Jury retired in 1976 after working 28 years at Graybar. Meredith was a former branch manager for the company. Jury, who frequently spoke with Meredith about starting a business together, talked his son into joining him and Meredith in the new business. As a teenager, the younger Jury sold light bulbs supplied by his father door-to-door, then worked in an electrical contractor's shop before becoming an electrician himself. The Jurys and Meredith considered several locations for their business and settled on founding the company in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The co-founders figured ‚Äúa service-oriented distributor could scrape its way into the market and compete against bigger companies,‚Äù the younger Jury said in a 1987 article in the Albuquerque Journal Business Outlook. Summit opened its first service center with five employees on August 15, 1977. By the year's end, Summit's sales totaled $408,000. In 1979, Summit opened a second location in Grants, New Mexico then moved into a new headquarters building the following year. After purchasing a branch of Cummins Utility Supply Co. in 1983, Summit opened another location in Farmington, New Mexico. That same year the company also took its first Just-in-Time (JIT) systems contract with the Rio Rancho, New Mexico facility of international chip manufacturer Intel Corp. In a JIT systems contract, distributors are required to deliver specified products to their customer's facility within 24 hours; in turn, the customer agrees to purchase all of their materials exclusively from that distributor. By 1986, Summit also had JIT systems contracts in place with Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Other customers included Los Alamos National Laboratory, the City of Albuquerque, Albuquerque Public Schools, and the University of New Mexico. By the end of the 1987 fiscal year, Summit's 10th year in business, Summit had 76 employees in three locations and company sales were $15.7 million. That year, Summit introduced the 30-Second Counter Service Guarantee¬Æ that said customers would receive counter service within 30 seconds or receive a Summit Buck¬Æ worth $5 toward their purchase. The company also began expanding its operations into Texas and opened its first Texas branch in Dallas, which originally operated under the name Sierra Electric Supply. =1988 to 2008= Co-founder Victor Jury Sr. relocated to Summit's Fort Worth branch when it opened in 1988 and announced his retirement in 1990. The younger Jury became Summit's president and CEO. Co-founder David Meredith announced his retirement in 1999. Summit first appeared in electrical distribution industry rankings in 1988 when Electrical Wholesaling magazine ranked Summit 173rd on its list of the top 250 U.S. electrical distributors. In 1989, Electrical Wholesaling detailed Summit's expertise with JIT systems contracts in an article that gave Summit recognition in the industry for its rapid growth and unique service offerings. By 1993, Summit had opened three more locations, moved its headquarters to a new building in Albuquerque, and introduced the 20/20 Will Call Service Guarantee¬Æ, which guaranteed call-in orders would be ready in 20 minutes. During those four years, Summit's annual sales went from $18.6 million in 1989 to over $65 million by 1993, causing the company to jump 125 spots to rank 48th on Electrical Wholesaling magazine's top 250 list. Summit also ranked 16th on the New Mexico Business Weekly‚Äôs Private 100, which recognized New Mexico's top privately owned companies. When the company was founded, Summit made an early commitment to service and quality. This led Summit to support its objectives with an ISO registration. In 1994, Summit earned an umbrella ISO registration, which certified all of Summit's locations to ISO 9002 quality standards. The company maintained the registration, developed by the International Organization for Standardization, until 2007. Summit earned an ISO 9001:2008 certification in 2013. From 1994 to 2000, Jury was a member of the National Association of Electrical Distributors Education Foundation Board of Directors, serving as chairman from 1998 to 2000. In 1991, Jury graduated from NAED's Electrical Products Education Course (EPEC), a three-tiered sales and product training course for electrical distribution professionals. Summit then incorporated EPEC into its own employee training program. When Summit reached its 25th anniversary in 2002, the company ranked 34th on Electrical Wholesaling magazine's top 250 U.S. electrical distributors list. Summit maintained its strong growth through 2008 with consistent sales gains and the addition of many branch locations, some through acquisitions. Between 1990 and 2008, Summit purchased Eastside/Westside Electric Supply in Phoenix, Arizona; Coast Electric in Montclair, California; Tri-Electric Supply in San Antonio, Texas; and Ideal Electric Supply in Killeen, Texas. Its largest acquisition was at the end of 2002 when Summit purchased the assets of bankrupt competitor Warren Electric Group of Houston, Texas, for $10.5 million. The acquisition doubled the number of Summit employees and locations by adding seven service centers in Texas (Houston, La Porte, Beaumont, Clute, Corpus Christi, Harlingen, and Lufkin); four in Louisiana (New Orleans, Broussard, Sulphur, and Gonzales); an export division based in Houston; and a sales branch in Puerto La Cruz, Venezuela. The service centers in Lufkin, Harlingen, Sulphur, and Puerto La Cruz were closed shortly after. Electrical industry magazine The Electrical Distributor (tED) published an article about the Warren Electric acquisition in 2003 entitled Surprises for Summit in Gulf Coast Acquisition. The article cited that Summit purchased $100 million in sales for $.10 on the dollar after a purchase deal with another electrical distributor fell through. Months later, the magazine printed another article about the management style of Jury. The article 30 Seconds to Perfection was derived from Summit's 30-second counter service guarantee and discussed Summit's proactive approach to management, commitment to quality standards, and its ambition to be the best. In 2004, Summit grew its Gulf Coast operations further when it opened a marine division in New Orleans, Louisiana. That same year, Jury took a two-year term as chairman of the board of directors for the IMARK Group, a member-owned marketing group of 1,100 independently owned U.S. electrical distributors, including Summit. By 2006, Summit had more than 500 employees, its annual sales exceeded $300 million, and the company was moving forward with an aggressive integration of a new business system to position the company for future opportunities. Summit partnered with German company SAP AG, one of the world's largest software companies, to upgrade its operating system to the enterprise resource planning system SAP. Used by companies internationally, including many of Summit's suppliers, SAP ERP allowed Summit to offer more advanced services and grow its global operations. As Summit went live with the new system in 2007, growth in the Gulf Coast precipitated a move to a new facility in Houston. The next year, Summit opened two additional locations in Florida, which operated until 2011. =2009 to present= The economic downturn that began in 2008 decreased demand in residential construction and reduced manufacturing activity. As a result, Summit shifted its interests to supporting large industrial and commercial projects, leading to its formation of an engineering, procurement, and construction (EP&C;) division based out of its new Houston location in 2009. Two years after launching the new division, Summit was awarded the largest EP&C; contact in the company's history ‚Äì an expansion of Refineria de Cartagena (known as Reficar) in Cartagena, Colombia, Latin America - by Chicago Bridge & Iron Company. In 2010, Modern Distribution Management magazine published its first industry ranking of the top electrical distributors in the U.S. Despite a loss of nearly $80 million in sales from the previous year, Summit ranked 18th based on its 2009 sales of $307 million. The steep decline in total industry sales in 2009, however, made it one of the worst years in the history of the electrical industry. In 2010, Summit experienced another sales decline as economic recovery in Summit's markets continued to stall, causing the company to drop to 23rd on Modern Distribution Management's 2011 list. To weather out the struggling economy, Summit focused on strategic growth in existing markets and in early 2011 opened its first international service center in the Jebel Ali Free Zone of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Summit had previously opened a sales office in Dubai in 2007 after serving international customers exclusively through its Houston location since 2002. The expansion of its international operations led Summit to join Trace International and implement anti-bribery and anti-corruption compliance solutions. In 2011, Trace certified Summit for ethical business practices and policies. That same year, Summit recognized the increasing number of electrical professionals using mobile devices in the field and subsequently initiated customer and industry focus groups to determine job functions that could be improved with mobile applications. Summit released the NEMA Configuration Guide in 2011 to help identify unknown NEMA receptacle and plug configurations. Over the next two years, the company released two additional mobile applications: the Conduit Fill Tracker calculated allowable fill rates when adding conductors to tubing or conduit and Summit Mobile took scans of product bar codes and worked in conjunction with the e-commerce content on Summit's website. As the electrical industry showed stronger signs of recovery and Summit's sales improved, the company opened a new location in Waynoka, Oklahoma in 2012. Summit opened four additional service centers in Texas from 2010 to 2013 to work closer with customers in the rich oil and gas exploration and production industry in the Eagle Ford Shale and Permian Basin areas. On May 29, 2013, Summit's co-founder and former president Victor Jury Sr. died in Fort Worth, Texas. Later that year, Summit was ranked 17th in Modern Distribution Management magazine's top 25 electrical distributors in the U.S., based on sales of $384 million in 2012- a return to pre-recession levels. Summit was also the 2nd largest revenue producing company in New Mexico by the 2013 New Mexico Private 100 list. By the end of 2013, Summit's sales were more than $405.9 million and the company had over 600 employees. 2017 was a very significant year in the company's history. In March, Summit announced that Kevin Powell had joined the company to serve as its President. He would report to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Victor Jury Jr. and would be based out of Summit's Albuquerque, New Mexico corporate headquarters. In June, Summit announced a realignment of the company's sales operations from a two-region model to more efficient four-district model. In addition to the territorial reorganization, Summit announced the creation of four new District Vice President roles to lead the sales teams in those new districts. These roles were filled by Todd Bockenfeld, North Texas District; Richard Landry, South Texas District; Chad Eschete, Louisiana District; Ryan Oehring, Desert Southwest District. Over the following months, Summit named a number of new service center leaders who would be responsible for growing commercial and industrial market sales. Earlier in the year, David Meeks joined the company's leadership team as vice president of supply chain operations. Meeks would be responsible for Summit's service center logistics as well as the company's quality management system The Summit Way. He would also oversee Summit's central replenishment, purchasing, inventory management, and rebate administration. Executive leadership * Victor R.

It features character job-oriented combat against classic Final Fantasy monsters and summons. It was released in Japan in December 2014, and in North America and Europe in January 2016. Gameplay Final Fantasy Explorers is an action role-playing video game featuring single-player and multiplayer modes. The player starts the game on an island featuring various locations, but can access other areas beyond the island on foot. The main goal of the player is to collect crystals scattered across the world. Unlike other narrative-driven entries in the Final Fantasy series, Explorers follows a quest-driven structure similar to Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles and Capcom's Monster Hunter series. Quest difficulty can be manually adjusted. Unlike previous entries in the series, chocobos, a recurring galliforme bird in the series, will not be available for riding. Player characters engage in fights with classic Final Fantasy enemies and summons including Ifrit and Bahamut. There are four character slots available; the three ally slots can be filled with other human players or with monsters previously defeated in battle. Characters are assigned character jobs as with early Final Fantasy titles, including the White Mage, Black Mage, Monk, Paladin and Dragoon among others. Aside from these, there are also character jobs exclusive to the title. Players start the game as a Freelancer, able to adapt themselves to various skills before choosing specific jobs. There are over five hundred different pieces of equipment available for creation from material that is either found on the field or won in combat. The characters are given a maximum of eight skills to be used in battle, and can learn skills for certain jobs which can be used with other jobs when mastered. Using abilities costs a certain amount of magic points, but costs less if a character uses a skill linked to a specific job. Skills can also be cancelled in battle. For multiplayer matches, a maximum of four players can use both the Nintendo Network and conventional Wi-Fi to enter a playing session. Premise Explorers revolves around the titular group of explorers from the rural town of Libertas who hunt the world for crystals, objects which are the source of life and civilization for the world. The most major source of crystals is the new island of Amostra, but they are guarded by fearsome beasts that the Explorers must fight. Development The original concept for Final Fantasy Explorers was the brainchild of director Atsushi Hashimoto, who had previously worked on the Nintendo DS remake of Final Fantasy Legend II. Hashimito's original concept was for a multiplayer Final Fantasy role-playing game. One of the earliest design choices was the need for players to fight classic summoned monsters, as he felt that their presence would add an air of nostalgic familiarity to the game. The game's job system was developed at a later stage, when Hashimoto felt it would be a good fit with the multiplayer function. The music is composed by Tsuyoshi Sekito. When he began composing music for the title, he only had some pieces of key and concept art to go on, so was worried that he would not create the right kind of music. When he did meet the team, they were pleased with the results. The game's main theme was designed around the idea of the title characters, while also including darker elements such as \\"the suffering of the land\\". Explorers was first revealed in early June 2014 in Shonen Jump. The official website opened on June 16. Hashimoto's main goal was to create a game that was accessible for newcomers to the genre. Square Enix is making the game with the idea of turning it into a new action role-playing subseries. Reception Final Fantasy Explorers received mixed to positive reviews. It received an aggregated score of 69/100 based on 57 reviews on Metacritic. IGN stated, \\"For a few hours at least, Final Fantasy Explorers is a charming little adventure that‚Äôs fun to play alone with your monster buddies or with real-life friends. But repetitive quests, the lack of a serious challenge until late in the story and a poor travel system eventually broke the charm spell that Explorers had cast upon me.\\" While GameSpot stated, \\"The sheer number of quests and the complexity of customization will keep you busy for hours. If you like that sort of thing, that is. Even though its economy leaves a bit to be desired, it's not clunky enough to dissuade you from working hard to earn items and craft your ultimate armor.\\" Final Fantasy Explorers sold over 265,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2015.

V. S. N. Prasad under the banner Sri Venkateswara Cine Chitra. The project features Naga Chaitanya and Kriti Sanon in the lead roles and Brahmanandam, Ravi Babu, Posani Krishna Murali, and Pooja Ramachandran in important roles. Sunny M.R. composed the music for the film. Richard Prasad and Karthika Srinivas handled the cinematography and editing respectively. The film was officially launched at Film Nagar in Hyderabad on 12 June 2014, and principal photography began on 14 July 2014 at Hyderabad. The film released on 24 April 2015. The movie is heavily inspired by the British series Hustle. Plot The film starts off with two masked bandits who commit a take-over style armed bank robbery, seizing a local bank at gunpoint and forcing the employees and customers inside the bank to get down on their knees with their hands behind their heads like classic hostages. The bank robbers end up stealing two crores from the premises. However, after the bank robbers escape, they have a misunderstanding when they discuss whether they should give the money to their boss or run away with it. They both hold a gunpoint blank at each other. The film then switches to the story of Chandu and his friends. They are small-time happy-go-lucky conmen with good hearts. They are also in league with a corrupt cop named CI Richard, who demands a cut in everything they do in return for keeping them out of the authorities' radar. Chandu's sister wants to become a doctor, and Chandu is arranging the money for her studies. One day, he meets Meera, a fellow student in the same college as his sister. They start off as friends and eventually fall in love. It is revealed that Chandu's father, who is suffering from heart disease, is in jail. He gets a heart attack and has to go to the hospital. Chandu has to pay for the operation. He has a scheme and steals the money from a drug dealer, so the operation is a success. However, during the course of conning the drug dealer, he is noticed by Richard, who is suspicious of him. However, Chandu cleverly manages to escape and fools Richard into thinking that he had not done any job recently. Richard is, however, still suspicious and decides to keep a close eye on him. Chandu also learns that the minister's PA can get his father out of jail by treating it as a special case citing his father's health condition. Chandu fixes an appointment with the PA at a new apartment complex where the PA has bought a flat. When Chandu goes to meet the PA, he accidentally goes into the adjacent flat where the thieves hold the guns and eventually shoot each other. Chandu steals the money. However, while escaping from there, Chandu is noticed by two men while getting into an auto. These two men are in league with the robbers and had come to the flat to collect the stolen money from them. Upon seeing the dead bodies in the flat, they quickly make it out on to the road just as Chandu leaves in an auto- rickshaw. They note down the registration number of the auto but unfortunately lose sight of it in the traffic. Chandu then goes to pick up his sister from her college in the same auto and leaves for the hospital where his father is being treated. Meanwhile, Chandu explains the flashback to Meera on how his father went to jail. His family was very poor, his mother was sick, and his father, who was a taxi driver, took care of him and his sister. A man, hires him to take him to a faraway village, to meet an acquaintance and the father takes his kids too, who sleep off in the backseat. There is money in the taxi's trunk that the passenger puts there. Upon reaching the destination, the passenger drops off to meet his acquaintance, named Manikyam. Manikyam, however, kills the passenger and then blames it on Chandu's father by bribing the cops. The cops recover the money from Chandu's father's car and then proceed to arrest him. Eventually, Chandu's mother dies, and he and his sister go into an orphanage, but they soon escape. There he meets a friend, and together they form a gang of thieves and start performing small-time robberies and con jobs. In present time, Manikyam, revealed to be the boss of the bank robbers' gang, tracks down the auto rickshaw driver and from where he tracks down Chandu and his sister. Finding out that Chandu has the two crores, he kidnaps Chandu's father and sister and demands for the two crores, which Chandu no longer possesses. Chandu comes up with a con to get the two crores. He and Meera use Bullet Babu, an actor, as their target. Bullet Babu, a has- been in desperate need of a hit, has invested almost everything he has in a movie and is told that he still requires to pitch in more money. He also has a major flaw which is that he always ends up having a crush on all good-looking girls. Chandu gets Meera to meet him under a false pretext providing him with a false story that his great-grandparents owned land that is worth 40 or 500 million and he is the only known claimant. However, he will have to pay a processing fee of four crores. Bullet Babu believes this. However, Richard, who for some time now has been following Chandu, discovers that Chandu has a new protege ‚Äì Meera. He goes to Meera's house, interrogates her forcefully, and tells her that he will trap her in a false case, Meera, panicking, tells him the entire job details and tells him that the registration for the land will be in Gandipet. Richard meets Bullet Babu and tells him that he is being duped. He tells him to take four crores so that Richard can catch Chandu red handed. In order to make this happen, he provides Bullet Babu with four crores from his own pocket. If the plan works out, then Bullet Babu can claim back the four crores and return it to Richard. Bullet Babu agrees and goes for registration. As Bullet Babu goes into the office, Chandu and his friends threaten to kill him, and they empty the bag of money and stuff it in their pockets. They make off with the money in a car, and soon, a car chase goes on between Richard and Chandu. When Chandu is completely surrounded, he pulls over his car and demands to know what is his crime. Richard, meanwhile, gets his superior to witness the proceedings. He tells him the entire case details. Upon searching Chandu and his friends, the cops realize that Chandu had no money on him. Richard then claims that Bullet Babu can testify for him. However, he is left shocked when Bullet Babu testifies that he has no idea about what Richard is saying and has never met him. Bullet Babu later reveals to Richard that the scam this entire whole time was on Richard and that he was on in it from the beginning. As per his deal with Chandu, the money would be shared equally between him and Chandu. It is also revealed that Meera took a video when Richard says that he will trap Meera in a false case. Richard then gets suspended because of this video. Finally Chandu meets up with Manikyam but gets him arrested by cops, who are later revealed to be actors arranged by Chandu to arrest him. Chandu sets up a false police station and a false court and forces Manikyam to admit his crimes. Manikyam is later taken to a real court, having made him believe that the only way he can get a reduced sentence and escape capital punishment is to confess his crimes. In the real court, Manikyam, still thinking that he was held and tried by the real cops and lawyers last time, admits to all his crimes, including the murders and robberies that he has committed. He is then sentenced to jail. Chandu, his sister, and his father reunite at the end of the movie.

In mid-August 2014, it was reported that the makers finalized the title Mayagadu, which translates to \\"conman\\", as the protagonist plays the role of a very sharp witted conman in this film. Naga Chaitanya, in an interview, said that the film is a mix of con drama and action. The film's title was speculated as Dorakadu in mid November 2014, though the makers denied it later. Another rumored title was Harilo Ranga Hari. Naga Chaitanya announced that the film's first look teaser would be launched on 22 November 2014 and the title was expected to be confirmed. In early December 2014, the film's soundtrack was planned to be unveiled in January 2015 while the film was scheduled for a late February or early March 2015 release. The film was reported to be titled as Docheyi, though an official confirmation was awaited. Chaitanya later confirmed the title as Dohchay on 17 February 2015 through his Twitter page. =Casting= Naga Chaitanya played the role of a conman and sported a different hairdo for the film. Kriti Sanon was selected as the female lead in late May 2014 after participating in a photo shoot with Naga Chaitanya. A press release on the day of the film's launch confirmed that Brahmanandam, Posani Krishna Murali, and Rao Ramesh are a part of the film's cast, while Ravi Babu, Praveen, Pooja Ramachandran, and Satya were also selected for important roles in this film. In late August 2014, Kriti Sanon said in an interview to The Times of India that the script was young, modern and had its own style because of which she accepted the film when she got the script. Naga Chaitanya's looks in the film were unveiled on 18, 20 and 22 November 2014. Madhuurima was cast for an item number which comes as a prelude to a crucial situation in the film. Nikesha Patel was initially approached for that song, which she refused, citing displeasure of similar offers. =Filming= In early June 2014, the regular shooting was planned to start from 2 July 2014. Later, it was postponed to 12 July 2014 and finally started two days later at Hyderabad. Filming continued after a small break from 7 August 2014. Kriti Sanon joined the film's sets in late August 2014 and a scene featuring Kriti entering a share auto and sitting beside the driver with a convoy of vehicles led by Naga Chaitanya following her was shot near HITECH City in Hyderabad. Weeks later, some action sequences were on Naga Chaitanya and some fighters at Aluminium factory in Hyderabad. In mid-October 2014, the filming continued at Annapurna Studios. The film's climax on Naga Chaitanya, Viva Harsha and few other comedians was shot on 8 November 2014. During the teaser launch, it was confirmed that except the songs, the rest of the film's shoot had been completed. In late January 2015, Kriti Sanon revealed that all the songs and 90% of the film's shoot has been completed. A song on Naga Chaitanya and Kriti Sanon was shot at Thailand in early March 2015.  Music   Release  Dohchay released on 24 April 2015.  Reception  = Critical response = Hemanth Kumar writing for The Times of India gave the 3 stars out of 5 stating that \\"Despite having all the elements, it just doesn't add up to make a fine film\\". IndiaGlitz gave 3 out of 5 stars stating \\"Good visuals and slick BGM apart, this one has a few rib-tickling moments.

CLO is a 3D fashion design software that builds virtual, true-to life garment visualisation with cutting-edge simulation technologies for the fashion industry. 3D Fashion design has been pioneered by such designers as The Fabricant, the world's first digital fashion house, and Cat Taylor. https://cattytay.format.com/ In 2019, Forbes magazine reported The Fabricant's sale of the 'Iridescence' dress, the first ever piece of digital couture to appear on the blockchain, which sold for (US) $9,500. Cat Taylor, better known as Cattytay, has been bridging the gaps between Fashion, Technology and Sustainability‚Äîworking with clients as notable as Alexander Wang, Selfridges, Balenciaga and more, she is redefining how garments are seen and even sold. Digital fashion is also the interplay between digital technology and couture. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have been deeply integrated both into the fashion industry as well as within the experience of clients and prospects. Such interplay has happened at three main levels. # ICTs are used to design and produce fashion products, while also the industry organization leverages onto digital technologies # ICTs impact marketing, distribution and sales # ICTs are extensively used in communication activities with all relevant stakeholders, and contribute to co-create the fashion world  Design, production, and organization  Among the many applications available to fashion designers to model the fusion of creativity with digital avenues, the Digital Textile Printing can be mentioned here. =Digital textile printing= Digital printing is a process in which prints are directly applied to fabrics with printer, reducing 95% the use of water, 75% the use of energy, and minimizing textile waste. The main advantage of digital printing is the ability to do very small runs of each design (even less than 1 yard). Digital Textile printing is ‚Äúprobably the greatest innovation of 21-st century fashion\\" as declared by Christina Binkley in the Wall Street Journal. The ‚Äúvastly improved digital printing technologies allow designers to innovate while beefing up their brands‚Äú.Digital Printing and fashion Brand such as Prada, Pucci or Jil Sander are using this technology to invent their design ideas on fabric. The fashion industry has been facing various challenges ranging from the high taxation, availability of raw material to the constrained market. The fashion industry has become more competitive and with new trends taking over the market as a result of digitization. The organization has differentiated its operations and products due to the recent developments in technology which have realized new integrated online shopping. The changes in the organization have helped to facilitate effective management of their inventories and shipping. Moreover, the business has gained a higher order status and created a partnership that involves both buyers and sellers. The digitization in the organization has helped the management to receive regular reports on the performance in the market and the feedback from their contacts. Business requirements One of the entities in the fashion industry which would adopt this move includes Brick and Mortar. The move will help both the operation of the business and make the company more competitive within the fashion industry. Some of the technologies are such as: # Intelligence systems # Big data and knowledge technology The big data and knowledge technology refer to a system that incorporates internet clicks, use of social media, mobile transactions as well as the user-generated content such as the use of sales questions among other forms of transactions. The technique is more superior when it comes to unveiling the patterns and trends. The vast amount of data encompasses data exhaust system, private data, public data, self-quantification of data, communal data as well as data exhaust systems. Some of the characteristics of the system include the use of various varieties of data, large quantities of data and the variability of data acquired. The big data information has been induced in most businesses and has helped to develop new ideas, get updates on emerging trends, styles, and shape within the fashion industry. The use of social media comments, opinions and views has helped in achieving these new trends. This, in turn, has helped in knowing the customers better by knowing what they like and at the same acquire new markets. More to that, it has played a key role for the customers and fashion lovers through the use of adequate content in magazines and other platforms (Stone & Farnan, 2018). Such initiatives have made the implementation of highly innovative concepts and ideas easily implementable. The model has also created a number of experts and professionals whose role is to improve and boost the digitalized fashion industry. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the new ideas and trends, the study has highlighted Macy's Inc. which has adopted the technology to develop fashion ideas and get updates on the most popular fashion. Intelligent system This involves the use of machinery which have embedded the internet and also the use of internet- connected computers with a capacity of gathering and analyzing data with a connection to the other systems. In the fashion industry, some of the changes which are incorporated include the use of computer vision with various sizes, shapes, color, and proportions in identifying the identical items instead of searching for a specific word or even using its description. The use of intelligent systems has provided an opportunity for solving the problems of the customers easily and also easing the ways of interaction and communication. An organization such as Nordstrom's and has embraced the intelligent systems technology and helped them to compete effectively in the new trends, besides maintaining contact with their customers. Competitors and technology The highlight of Macy's company and Nordstrom's in the fashion industry depicts the effectiveness of adopting big data and knowledge technology. The technology has benefited the company by learning the latest trends in the market and helping the company gain a competitive advantage over the competitors. The new business should adopt big data and knowledge management technology since it encompasses mobile transactions, internet clicks, use of generated content and social media among other forms of transactions. The business should adopt the techniques which are more powerful in detecting the trends and patterns in the industry.  Marketing, distribution, and sales  While all digital channels can be used in order to market and sell fashion completely online (eCommerce), they usually are implemented in connection with offline channels (so-called \\"omni-channel\\"). Here, Virtual and Augmented reality is playing a crucial role. Prospects and clients can use ICTs - own computers, tablets and smartphones - to skip fitting rooms and cosmetics counters, and instead virtually see how they look in specific outfits and makeup via in-store kiosks, mobile phones or tablets.Retail Customer Experience Modiface is a web application that anyone can use to give them a virtual makeover. Customers can give any look and decide on what to suits and buy products. Sephora, the beauty specialty retailer, and ModiFace, an augmented reality virtual makeover technology provider, today announced the launch of a 3D Augmented Reality Mirror that can simulate cosmetics on a user's face in real-time and in 3D. The new patented technology, created by ModiFace, tracks the precise location of a user's facial features and applies eye shadow colors directly on the video feed from a camera.CNBC: ‚ÄúSephora brings augmented reality to real-life shop‚Äù Oftentimes beauty retailers will feature virtual fitting rooms to allow users to experience the look of their product before committing to a purchase. Some examples are color contact retailers Freshlook, which allows users to simulate contact lens wear in their color contacts studio before purchase. Colorful Eyes also offers a virtual color contact lens try on room. =Virtual dressing room= A virtual dressing roomLA Times on virtual dressing room (also often referred to as virtual fitting room and virtual changing room although they do perform different functions) is the online equivalent of the near-ubiquitous in-store changing room ‚Äì that is, it enables shoppers to try on clothes to check one or more of size, fit or style, but virtually rather than physically. The multimedia communication company Eyemagnet developed the Virtual Dressing Room for the Hallensteins menswear chain. The changing room is transformed to a single panel which reflects the user. These users can then use simple arm and hand gestures to ‚Äòtry on‚Äô any apparel in the store, take a photo of any selected outfit and have it sent to their mobile phone. Newer versions of this technology eliminate the arm-waving altogether.Trendhunter - Virtual Dressing Room Fashion retailer Topshop installed a Kinect-powered virtual fitting room at its Moscow store. Created by AR Door, the Augmented Fitting Room system overlays 3D augmented reality clothes on the customer. Simple gestures and on- screen buttons let users \\"try on\\" different outfits.Huffingtonpost - Kinect Dressing room However, the high variability of virtual fit platforms to predict consumer clothes sizes called into question the accuracy of these systems in their current form.  Communication and experience co-creation  Fashion is also a matter of socially negotiating what is \\"in\\" or \\"out\\", fashionable or not. In other words, fashion items do not only play on the economic market of physical goods, but also - and sometimes even more importantly - on the semiotic market of the production of social tastes and customs. Thanks to social media, and to all services offered by the so-called web2.0, laypeople can contribute to co-create the fashion world, shaping tastes, customs, and fashion-related values.  Digital fashion education and research  Nowadays, the fashion industry needs experts in digital fashion, equipped with the above-sketched knowledge and competences. Several Bachelor and Master programs in Fashion have in recent years integrated Digital Fashion courses. While there are not (yet) dedicated scientific journals devoted to the topic, several research activities have been done in the field. Among them, a dedicated conference has taken place in 2015 in Seoul, South Korea. SComS - Studies in Communication Sciences, a Swiss-based Communication Journal, has published a special thematic section on Fashion communication: Between tradition and digital transformation. In July 2019, a conference titled FACTUM19 - Fashion Communication: between tradition and future digital developments has taken place in Ascona (Switzerland), whose proceedings are published by Springer. During FACTUM19, a document titled \\"Fashion Communication Research. A way ahead\\" has been published. Fashion is closely related with Art and Heritage: among the most important initiatives to digitize fashion history, thus making such heritage available to researchers, practitioners and all interested people, two projects can be mentioned: Europeana Fashion and We Wear Culture by Google Arts and Culture.

The bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background Thermal insulation is the reduction of heat transfer (the transfer of thermal energy between objects of differing temperature) between objects in thermal contact or in range of radiative influence. Thermal insulation can be achieved with specially engineered methods or processes, as well as with suitable object shapes and materials. Heat flow is an inevitable consequence of contact between objects of differing temperature. Thermal insulation provides a region of insulation in which thermal conduction is reduced or thermal radiation is reflected rather than absorbed by the lower-temperature body. Provisions of the bill The bill would require the Department of Energy to submit a report to Congress about the possibility of using thermal insulation in federal buildings as way to save energy and water. The report would have to include a short term and long term (20 years) projection on any energy and water savings the addition of a thermal insulation system would save. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on June 10, 2014. This is a public domain source. H.R. 4801 would require the United States Secretary of Energy to prepare a report, within one year of enactment, on the effects that thermal insulation has on both energy consumption and systems for providing potable water in federal buildings. Based on information from the United States Department of Energy about the cost of similar analyses, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that completing the required report would cost less than $500,000; those costs would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds. H.R. 4801 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 4801 contains no intergovernmental or private- sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history H.R. 4801 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on June 5, 2014 by Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R, IL-16). The bill was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The committee passed the bill on June 10, 2014. The bill was scheduled to be voted on under a suspension of the rules on June 23, 2014. Debate and discussion Rep. Kinzinger, who introduced the bill, argued that \\"with the federal government being the single largest consumer of energy in the country, doing our best to maximize the potential savings from improved insulation systems is a commonsense step I think everybody can agree on.\\" Rep. Jerry McNerney (D-CA), who co-sponsored the bill, said that \\"it is important for us to look for ways to save taxpayer money and ensure the federal government is doing its part to preserve our natural resources.\\" McNerney also argued that it would be a good way to collect data so that \\"we can use the findings from this study and make sure we are doing everything we can in both federal and private buildings to maximize energy and water efficiency.\\" The Alliance to Save Energy (ASE) supported the bill, calling it a step \\"in the right direction\\" and saying that they \\"are hopeful energy efficiency can once again be an area of common ground between parties.\\" The National Insulation Association supported the bill.

An illegitimate child, her mother was the society figure Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough, who became pregnant by her longtime lover Granville Leveson-Gower. Henrietta gave birth to the girl in secret and sent her to be raised by a foster mother, though she stayed in contact through letters and gifts. At the age of twelve, Harriet joined her father‚Äôs household in Staffordshire and was included as part of his family. After accompanying him to the Netherlands, she met and married George Osborne in 1824 with whom she had eleven children, but died before he became the 8th Duke of Leeds. Birth and early life Countess of Bessborough, never revealed her true identity to her daughter. The circumstances surrounding Harriet's illegitimate birth involved much secrecy. By the end of 1799, Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough had discovered she was pregnant by her longtime lover, Granville Leveson-Gower. The consequences of such an event could be potentially disastrous; eight years earlier, Lady Bessborough had witnessed the scandal and emotional turmoil experienced by her sister Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, when her own illegitimate child had been born. Lady Bessborough was also terrified that her husband would discover the truth and divorce her. Undoubtedly aided by the era's empire waist fashions, she succeeded in hiding the pregnancy from him ‚Äì only a few close family members and friends were made aware. The child, Harriette Arundel Stewart, was born on 17 August 1800; her given surname was inspired by Lady Bessborough's pet name for Leveson-Gower, and by the maiden name of his mother Susanna Stewart. To her lasting sorrow, social constraints prevented her from openly acknowledging the child. Illegitimate children were increasingly disapproved of in English society; worrying about her daughter's future, Lady Bessborough arranged for her to be raised by a foster mother. Another illegitimate sibling, George Arundel Stewart, was born two years later in similar circumstances. Both parents remained in close contact with their children and monitored their progress. Though they lived apart, the Countess sought to be involved in her daughter's life, serving as a sort of godmother to the child. Lady Bessborough wrote frequently to her, though most of these letters were later destroyed. One of the few surviving letters reveals that when the girl was two years old, her mother purchased a locket and asked Leveson-Gower for a piece of his hair in which to send to their daughter. Harriet's life changed quite significantly in August 1812, when she was brought to live in her father's household at Tixall Hall in Staffordshire. At first this was meant to be a temporary visit, but Leveson-Gower's new wife Harriet took to the girl and wished her to stay, describing her as \\"a most amiable little creature and though she has nothing precose about her, her intelligence and docility make her a very delightful companion.\\" \\"Little Harriet\\", as she was known, was loved and included as one of the family, which contained five younger half- siblings as well as her brother George Arundel Stewart. She was never informed of her true parentage, and referred to Leveson-Gower as \\"her guardian.\\" Marriage and later life In 1824, Harriet and the rest of the family moved to Brussels upon the appointment of Leveson-Gower, now Viscount Granville, as British ambassador to The Hague. Talks of finding a husband for Harriet began, and she was given lessons on etiquette from a dancing master. Viscountess Granville worried that her charge's marriage prospects would face difficulties, namely due to her mysterious status as a ward and lack of a dowry. The girl had many positive qualities, however; the historian Janet Gleeson describes Harriet as \\"well-mannered and physically attractive to the opposite sex.\\" While in the Netherlands, Harriet met George Osborne, the son of Francis Osborne, 1st Baron Godolphin and thus an heir to the dukedom of Leeds. Granville and Baron Godolphin eventually gave their consent, and the couple were married at the British Embassy in Paris on 21 October 1824. The newly married couple took up residence in the Bois de Boulogne, where they were enthusiastically welcomed by French society. Osborne and Harriet faced constant financial problems, living far beyond their means to the point of almost being jailed. Her father and guardian, now 1st Earl Granville, could usually be depended on to help with their debts, to Harriet's embarrassment. In one letter, she wrote to him, \\"I can never be sufficiently grateful to you for the kindness you have again shown me and for the generosity with which you have again relieved our great difficulties. I feel much shame at our having brought these difficulties upon ourselves again.\\" Osborne inherited his father's title of Baron Godolphin in 1850, making Harriet Baroness Godolphin, known as \\"Lady Godolphin\\". She died at the family home in Stapleford, Cambridgeshire, on 28 October 1852, seven years before Osborne succeeded his cousin as the 8th Duke of Leeds. Osborne did not marry again and died on 8 August 1872, after which their eldest surviving son George Godolphin succeeded to the dukedom. A hatchment of the Duke's arms on his death survives; unusually, for a Duke, his wife is shown as having no right to inherit her own coat of arms (because of her illegitimate birth) and yet this is not glossed over by omitting the place for her arms on the hatchment. Instead, the hatchment shows decorative swirls on the wife's side (the right-hand side) of the shield of arms where her own paternal arms would otherwise have been. =Issue= They had eleven children, though three died in early childhood: #Harriet Emma Godolphin Osborne (5 September 1825 ‚Äì 14 August 1832) #George Francis Godolphin Osborne (7 March 1827 ‚Äì 7 April 1828) #George Godolphin Osborne, 9th Duke of Leeds (11 August 1828 ‚Äì 23 December 1895); married the Honourable Frances Georgiana Pitt-Rivers, daughter of George Pitt-Rivers, 4th Baron Rivers. #Reverend Lord Francis George Godolphin Osborne (6 April 1830 ‚Äì 6 March 1907); married Matilda Catherine Rich and had issue. #Lady Susan Georgina Godolphin Osborne (6 April 1830 ‚Äì 14 November 1903); married Henry John Milbank. #Granville Theodore Godolphin Osborne (27 November 1831 ‚Äì 10 January 1833) #Major Lord D'Arcy Godolphin Osborne (14 June 1834 ‚Äì 20 March 1895) #Lord William Godolphin Osborne (28 August 1835 ‚Äì 28 December 1888); married Mary Catherine Headly and had issue. #Lady Emma Charlotte Godolphin Osborne (1837 ‚Äì 24 May 1906); a Lady of the Bedchamber to the Duchess of Edinburgh. #Lady Charlotte Godolphin Osborne (1838 ‚Äì 25 March 1914) #Lady Blanche Godolphin Osborne (1842 ‚Äì 13 February 1917); married Major-General Charles Henry Morris, a grandson of Sir John Morris, 1st Baronet.

He was a distant relative of the sculptor Adolf Br√ºtt.  Life and work  He took his first art lessons at the Hamburg School of Applied Arts, where he studied with and .Kronberger Maler: Brief Biography On their recommendation, he transferred to the Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School in 1870, where his teachers were Albert Baur, Karl Gussow and the history painter Ferdinand Pauwels. Baur would be particularly influential in forming Br√ºtt's mature style. When Baur accepted a professorship at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf, Br√ºtt went with him and became a specialist in painting courtroom scenes. He was able to draw from his own experiences, having spent quite a bit of time on jury duty, developing the genre based on earlier work by Louis Gallait and Hendrik Leys. In 1889, he took an extended study trip to Italy where he found himself less inspired by the \\"Old Masters\\" than he was by the landscapes. This prompted further trips to the Alps and the North Sea. In 1893, he was appointed a Royal Prussian Professor. =Kronberg= In 1898, his friend Anton Burger invited him to stay at the Kronberger Artists' Colony in Kronberg im Taunus. He lived and worked there until 1920. He executed several municipal commissions in Frankfurt from 1905 to 1913, including several large wall and ceiling decorations for various public buildings and designs for the B√ºrgersaale (Civic Hall) in the Rathaus. In 1920, he went to live with his son, a District Court Councillor, in Bergen. His style may generally be described as impressionistic, although he preferred scenes with large crowds in urban or indoor settings. His initial phase extended through the 1880s, when he developed an interest in more subtle displays of light and color. After 1902, he concentrated on large landscapes.

With the end of the earldom of Hereford in 1155 and the death of the last of Miles de Gloucester's sons in 1165; Walter Devereux and his son, John, joined the retinue of William de Braose, 3rd Lord of Bramber.William de Braose married Bertha, the eldest daughter of Miles de Gloucester, earl of Hereford. Through her he inherited the lordship of Brecon When William de Braose, 3rd Lord of Bramber, died; John Devereux joined the retinue of his son,William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber. John Devereux would campaign in Wales, France, and Ireland under the younger de Braose. As one of the prominent knightly families of the Welsh Marches, the Devereux became closely entwined with the de Braose, de Lacy, de Longchamp, and Marshal families. Through these connections, and following the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1071, the Devereux family established holdings in Ireland over the next three generations.

The use of cousin in this context refers to being a member of an extended family. Constance presents a good candidate for the link between the two families His father died in 1187 possibly from involvement in the de Braose campaigns in Wales and France.

At this time Braose was accompanying Richard I as England resumed its wars in France to recapture lands lost during his captivity. Many knights from the Welsh border were injured in the assault on the castle at Milly-sur-Therain where William Marshall himself led many into the fray.Thomas Asbridge. The Greatest Knight. (New York: Harper Collins, 2014). Page 249As noted above, Walter Devereux was a member of William Marshal's extended family Landholdings After Walter's death, his sons were fostered for training as knights: Stephen Devereux with William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke; Nicholas Devereux with Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath; and John Devereux with William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber. These sons would sire the three Devereux families that would play an integral role in controlling the Welsh marches during the thirteenth century. Also following the death of her husband, Cecilia began a series of legal fights to establish her dower rights which when added to the holdings of her eldest son, Stephen Devereux, provides an indication of the extent and influence of the Devereux holdings at the time.

Sybil‚Äôs brother was Roger Devereux Junior Cecilia countered Fulton's claims. Concerning the fee of Elnodestune, she did not hold that fee directly, but as part of the holding of Walter de Lacy. Richard Fulton could not counter this and yielded his complaint. Concerning the fee of Putley, she denied holding a whole fee, but admitted possessing a third of a fee. Richard Fulton indicated that regardless of whether it is a third or a whole fee, this is the fee that corresponds to his ancestor's holding. Cecilia put forward that the court should deny his claim as Roger Devereux had two sisters, Orenge and Sybil, and they possess an equal claim. As the descendants of Orenge put forward no claim,The de Lechelad family discussed above she asserts that she should not respond to the current complaint. Fulton countered that Orenge never married the man she was betrothed to, and her children by Parson Ralph de Lichelade were illegitimate. Cecilia put forward that it is true Orenge did not marry her fianc√©e, but land was given her as dowry based on her relationship with Parson Ralph. These rights passed to her children thereby establishing their legitimacy. The land passed to Orenge's son, Master Ralph de Lechelad, who gave it to his brother, William. Cecilia showed that she had sued William, and the king's court found in Lechelad's favor confirming legitimacy. She called for the court to vouch this warranty, which was done, and the court found in favor of Cecilia.F.W. Maitland (editor). Bracton‚Äôs Note Book.

Page 92, Greytree Hundred On 15 October 1206 the Canons of Hereford appeared to show by what right the claim of Cecilia to the chapel of Putley should be set aside. They argued that they had been in possession of the chapel for over 60 years, and presented the original charter granting them the chapel by William Devereux.

They argued that the granting of the claim of Cecilia Devereux had occurred too quickly for them to respond, and when they had discovered that it had occurred they began the proceedings to regain their rights.

Already at an early age, through the constant unrest in this area, he developed an interest in social and political questions, but primarily also in philosophical and spiritual ideas and ideals. The concept of transubstantiation became one of his fundamental ideals, though he understood this not in its religious- ecclesiastic sense, but rather tried to realise it in social life, in financial and banking affairs, as also in agriculture and health care. He studied law in Cologne, Freiburg and Berlin, where, after completing his first state examination, he was conscripted as an officer to do military service in World War II. On the Russian Front he was badly wounded by a grenade, leading to his first out-of-body experience, something that happened on further occasions during his flight on foot from Russia back to Germany. During the war, he married Ottilie Grave from Bocholt. Their first son was born in 1945, had Down syndrome and lived for only eleven months. Later, the couple had three more sons and a daughter. After the war, on completing his articles in 1948, he became a solicitor, founding and running one of the leading law firms in Bochum. He and his wife cultivated close friendships with the artists of the Bochum Art Association. In 1956, he joined the governing board of the Rudolf Steiner School Ruhrgebiet, which was looking for a legal counsellor. The school was started contrary to the ban on founding further Waldorf schools which the Bund der Freien Waldorfschulen, the German Waldorf School Federation, had attempted to impose at the time. With it began the public life of anthroposophy in the Ruhrgebiet. It was to have more students than any other Waldorf school worldwide. Amongst other things, the teacher training college, Institut f√ºr Waldorfp√§dagogik, was one of the initiatives it generated. In order to finance this school, Barkhoff invented the ‚Äúborrowing community‚Äù, a system of solidarity, where the combining of individual financial resources enabled persons of otherwise modest financial means to gain access to substantial bank loans. With this, the basis of anthroposophical banking was born. Through his work on the board of the school, he met his future anthroposophical co-workers: Gisela Reuther, Klaus Fintelmann, Klaus Dumke, Franz Schily, Ernst Neuh√∂fer, Lore Sch√§fer, Robert Zimmermann and Wilhelm Wollborn. Gisela Reuther joined her own tax consultancy with his law offices. Through this collaboration within the credit guarantee communities, the anthroposophical banks began their work. The development of these instruments of funding, as well as his talent for bringing people to work together, brought him into contact with Special Needs Education, particularly close work with Karl K√∂nig and the Camphill Movement as well as the Wuppertal initiatives around Siegfried Schmock. He soon became involved in financially securing and spreading the work of biodynamic agriculture In order to save them from the destructive hereditary division they were subject to, he invented the Non-profit Agricultural Research Company (Gemeinn√ºtzigen Landbauforschungsgesellschaften) as the holding company of the farm. He tied credit worthiness to their willingness to be ‚Äúmore‚Äù than simply a farming business, rather striving towards the inclusion of people with special needs, child or adult education, landscape and community development. Barkhoff wanted to create instruments for new types of human communities in order to replace the ties of blood relationships that had for many centuries determined and carried agriculture. He advised Manfred Klett and his co-workers in the establishment of the Dottenfelderhof, a rural community working to a high professional and human standard. Forming a company out of the Bauck-H√∂fe belonging to Nicolaus Remer and Joachim Bauck of the Bauck family, that continued to work the farm, was a more traditional version. After some time, around a hundred such organisations were established. As banking organisations the Gemeinn√ºtzige Treuhandstelle (Charitable Trustee Agency) was founded in Hamburg in 1961, the Gemeinn√ºtzige Kreditgarantie Genossenschaft (Charitable Credit Guarantee Cooperative) in 1967 and finally the GLS Gemeinschaftsbank (GLS Community Bank) in Bochum in 1974. From 1968 onwards, Rolf Kerler joined the Barkhoff/Reuther team. Meetings with the Heidenheimer Kreis (Heidenheim Circle), a group of industrialists around Hanns Voith and Peter von Siemens dedicated to cultivating the social impulses of Rudolf Steiner, led to a co- work with the industrialist Alfred Rexroth, whose substantial donations went a long way towards securing and realising the banking initiatives. Besides his activities within the anthroposophical scene, Barkhoff began his work with the German welfare organisations during the early 60‚Äôs. In 1961 he became chairman of the Nordrhein-Westfalen branch of the Deutscher Parit√§tischer Wohlfahrtsverbandes (German Parity Welfare Association). At the time the Association led a kind of clandestine existence behind the state Red Cross and the confessional and political associations (Caritas, Innere Mission, Arbeiterwohlfahrt). Welfare was seen to be an affair of Church and State. Free and independent welfare was permitted to exist; initiatives and foundations that arose out of individual impulses, however, were not seen to embody the image one had of a charitable society. Today the situation has changed and they are recognised. It was Wilhelm Ernst Barkhoff who was the initiator and moderator of this development. Under his leadership the regional branch of the Association grew to five times its size. This unprecedented growth in membership was due to the Welfare Association‚Äôs involvement with the movement for the emancipation of parents of children with special needs, with student the women‚Äôs rights as also various self-help groups of a more medical nature, initiatives of the unemployed and recipients of social benefits. As a member of the national executive he represented the viewpoint at the various strategy conferences that the greatest force binding together social life arises precisely through the faith in the individual human being; that an association, which has the courage to fully entertain the competing views of its members on a conceptual and spiritual basis is not weakened but grows stronger than any ties of a common world view can provide. Through Barkhoff, the Parity Welfare Association opened itself to the transforming societal energy of the 1968 movement, which gave it a sphere of activity and new challenges. He also established a new financing instrument for the Parity Welfare Association, the Parity Financial Counseling Parit√§tische Geldberatung. In 1981 Wilhelm Ernst Barkhoff retired from all his business involvements, continuing to serve only as speaker, impulsator and counsellor. He travelled a great deal internationally during this time, particularly to North and South America, and was regularly invited to appear in Scandinavia. Publications *Das gef√§hrdete Ich.

He was an energetic reformer, but was blamed for many of the financial problems of the time, and went into retirement during the French Consulate and First French Empire. He supported Napoleon during the Hundred Days of 1815. After the second Bourbon Restoration, as a regicide he was forced into exile in Belgium, where he died without returning to France. Early years Dominique-Vincent Ramel was born in Montolieu, Aude, France, on 3 November 1760. His father's family were bourgeois cloth merchants and manufacturers established in Montolieu and said to have originated from Nogaret, Haute-Garonne. His great-grandfather, Antoine Ramel (1643‚Äì1715) was a king's advocate. His parents were Jean-Baptiste Ramel (1718‚Äì1800) and Marie- Rose Ducup of Saint-Ferriol (died 1791). He attended law school in Toulouse. He then acquired the posts of king's prosecutor in the mar√©chauss√©e of Montolieu, captain and royal judge. Most important, he was king's advocate in the mar√©chauss√©e and presidial seat of Carcassonne, a position he received from his great uncle, Louis-Joseph Benazet. Estates General and National Assembly Ramel de Nogaret was a supporter of new ideas. On 23 March 1789 he was elected deputy for the third estate representing the s√©n√©chauss√©e of Carcassonne in the Estates General of France. He took the Tennis Court Oath on 20 June 1789, which formally established the National Assembly. He was a member of the committee of alienation, and was appointed a commissioner for taking the oaths of troops. In June 1791 he was sent on a mission to Brittany, where there were serious disturbances, and was skillful in helping to calm the situation down. Ramel de Nogaret was not a brilliant speaker, but worked actively in the committees. He was secretary of the Assembly on 18 July 1791. He opposed the division of France into departments on the grounds of the disruption this would cause in the administration and collection of taxes. After the Assembly session ended on 30 September 1791 he was named president of the court of Carcassonne. National Convention Dominique-Vincent Ramel de Nogaret, circa 1795 On 4 September 1792 the department of Aude elected Ramel to the National Convention. In the trial of Louis XVI, in the third division he said \\"Louis is guilty of conspiracy against freedom. At all times such a crime deserves death.\\" He was in the minority that favored asking the people to ratify the verdict, and was in the majority that was opposed to temporarily suspending the king's execution. Ramel de Nogaret intervened in a considerable number of discussions, including those on the Constitution of 1793, on sale of the property of √©migr√©s, creation of assignats and distribution of taxes. He was against the Law of the Maximum, which controlled food prices. Ramel de Nogaret was made a member of the Committee of Public Safety, and proposed establishment of a \\"paternal Commission\\" to take the final decision on the guilt of the accused before sending them to court. He was rapporteur for the discussion of the forced loan of 19 August 1793, and was the accuser of Fabre d'√âglantine. In 1795 he was sent on a mission to Holland, and helped ensure the rapid success of the troops of Jean-Charles Pichegru. On his return he was elected on 22 Vend√©miaire IV (14 October 1795) by the department of Aude as member of the Council of Five Hundred. Minister of Finance Due to the special study Ramel had made of tax issues, on 25 Pluvi√¥se IV (14 February 1796) he was appointed Minister of Finance. He took office at a difficult time, with urgent demands from the armies. He developed the idea of the land registry, and managed the difficult transition from assignats to money. He was committed to alleviating public debt and to reforming the taxation system. In Brumaire VI (November 1797) he established taxation agencies in the departments with commissioners, tax collection staff and an inspector. However, the disorders in tax administration towards the end of the Directory, for which he was not responsible, made him the target of anger for all the problems of the country. He was severely criticized by the press and by politicians. Antoine Claire Thibaudeau, Pierre-Antoine Antonelle and others accused him of colluding with the army suppliers. However, Ramel de Nogaret was no richer when he retired from power on 2 Thermidor VII (20 July 1799) than when he entered office. On 30 September 1797, Ramel repudiated 2/3rds of France's public debt (fr). Later career Ange-Pauline-Charlotte Panckoucke in 1820, by Jacques-Louis David In the year VIII Ramel de Nogaret married Ange-Pauline-Charlotte Panckoucke, grand-niece of Charles-Joseph Panckoucke, the encyclopedist and founder of Le Moniteur. He remained out of politics during the French Consulate (1799‚Äì1804) and most of the First French Empire. By inheritance and his business activities Ramel had accumulated a large fortune, which gave him 20,000 francs of income in 1811. He bought a beautiful modern country house in Montolieu, the \\"little Versailles\\", surrounded by fertile parkland. In 1812 Ramel de Nogaret accepted a position in the local government of Aude. During the Hundred Days of 1815 when Napoleon returned from exile he accepted the position of prefect in Normandy. After the second Bourbon Restoration, in January 1816 he was exiled as a regicide, and settled in Belgium, where he returned to his family's business of textile manufacture and trade. Dominique-Vincent Ramel died on 31 March 1829 in Brussels, Belgium. Ramel de Nogaret had two daughters by his 1799 marriage with Pauline Panckoucke, Pauline and M√©lanie.

Located in what was the central business district, it was the city's first skyscraper when it opened in March 1925. History By 1920, Waukegan, Illinois had grown to a small city with a population nearing 20,000, a 19.6% increase over the previous decade. The Waukegan National Bank Corporation was founded in 1914 to provide capital to the growing population. However, the bank quickly outgrew its original three-story headquarters at the corner of Genesee and Washington Streets. In 1924, they hired the St. Louis Bank Equipment Company to build a much larger building on the same site. The bank opened for a public viewing on March 7, 1925. Upon its opening, it became the tallest building in Lake County.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/148400.pdf The original tenants were the Waukegan National Bank, the Public Service Company of Northern Illinois, and a Walgreens. The Chicago Chamber of Commerce had an office on the eighth floor. Various professionals such as physicians and attorneys occupied other suites. The Great Depression hit the bank hard and by 1931 the Waukegan National Bank was bankrupt. The Citizens National Bank moved into the vacated offices and operated for six years. A variety of retail stores and professional firms have occupied the space since. It has been largely vacant since 1985. The Waukegan Building is generally Neoclassical in design. The eight-story building has an L-shaped plan with the main elevation on Genesee Street. Exterior walls are light brown brick with limestone details. Built on a concrete foundation, the tower has a flat roof with two antennas. The main facade is divided in a typical tripartite design.

Tolkien in a creative attempt to reconstruct the folktale underlying the narrative in the first two thousand lines of the Old English poem Beowulf. Among other things, it seeks to clarify and integrate a number of narrative strands in the early medieval poem. The resulting text is a loose variant of the Skilful Companions type of folktale, in which each of several characters (two or three in Tolkien's text, depending on the redaction) has a valuable but specific skill. Unlike in folktales of that type, however, the skills of Tolkien's characters do not supplement each other in the resolution of the narrative problem. Tolkien's recasting of the material also incorporates the sluggish youth motif and the abandonment of the hero at the waterfall, both elements found in the analogous Old Icelandic Grettis saga. The suggestion that a waterfall like that of Grettis saga was part of the original setting of the pool of monsters in Beowulf was made by W.W. Lawrence in 1912.  Dating and composition  The text's editor, Christopher Tolkien, dates much of the composition and revision of the tale to the early 1940s on the basis of datable content on the versos of the manuscript leaves. The tale was actually accepted for publication in the forties by Gwyn Jones, who had already published \\"The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun\\" for Tolkien in The Welsh Review; but the collapse of the latter in 1948 prevented \\"Sellic Spell\\" from appearing for almost seventy years.J. Rateliff ed., Mr Baggins (London 2007) p. 281-2 In a note discovered among his papers, J.R.R. Tolkien claims to have \\"[put] it first into Old English\\". However, Christopher Tolkien observes that this sequence of events is inconsistent with the textual evidence, since the earliest manuscript of the Modern English text was revised into a form that corresponds in several places to the Old English text, which was thus probably based on a version of the Modern English tale. The Old English version as published is furthermore incomplete, breaking off before either of the two companions faces Grendel. The Modern English text exists in three (partial) manuscripts and two typescripts; Christopher Tolkien published the text of the later typescript along with the Old English translation and a discussion of the tale's revision history in 2014.

The district consists of several large neighborhoods: San Bosco (Bosconia), Mar√≠as, Purab√°, Lajas, and Calle Quir√≥s.  History  Purab√° was created on 2 September 1976 by Decreto Ejecutivo 6370-G. Segregated from Santo Domingo. Like the rest of the canton, the area now known as Villa Jes√∫s was originally occupied before the Spanish settlers came by the Huetares, an indigenous tribe. The Huetare King, Cacique Garabito, dominated the area. In early 1663, settler Joseph de Sandoval Ocampo set up cattle ranches in the area, including one toward the between the present-day areas of San Pedro and Purab√°, which was called Tapatalanga or Anonos at the time. Heredia, Barva, and Alajuela, three neighboring cities, were populated and settled in the late 1700s. As trade increased between the three cities, the canton developed. Recalling her childhood of making dolls out of plantain leaves in Purab√°, former teacher Mar√≠a Cecilia Alfaro V√≠quez, born in 1940, said that the roads were made of pebbles and dirt. The culture and economy of sugarcane production was so widespread that even children like Alfaro V√≠quez made toy sugar mills. In 1949, a bridge was constructed in the district, blessed by the local Catholic priest. Purab√° is the newest district in Santa B√°rbara, created in 1976.2 The backbone of Purab√°'s economy is agricultural production, particularly sugarcane cultivation, even though sugarcane grows best at lower elevations. Up until 1975, Ingenio Agroindustrial Las Mar√≠as was a buyer of agricultural products for domestic consumption, but it moved to Grecia in 1975. Geography Purab√° has an area of km¬≤ and an elevation of metres. Like much of Costa Rica, the Comisi√≥n Nacional de Prevenci√≥n de Riesgos (National Risk Prevention Commission) puts Purab√° in a high-risk zone. This is due to the district's mountainous geography, which can lead to landslides and flooding. The highest part of Purab√° is on the lower slopes of the Barva Massif, also known as Barva Volcano, at above sea level. The lowest part, at San Juan, is at above sea level.Municipalidad de Santa Barbara: Datos generales Retrieved 10 July 2014 The Barva volcanic massif is part of a mountain range which includes volcanic cones. So part of Purab√° de Santa B√°rbara is in the foothills of Barva Volcano.\\"Filling the gap of Turdus nigrescens Aves Turdidae distribution, first record in Barva Volcano, Costa Rica\\", by Luis Sandoval1 and Melania Fern√°ndez, 2009 Retrieved 10 July 2014 Several large rivers run through Purab√°. These include Quebrada Setillal, Rio Ciruelas, Rio Pacayas, Rio Dorita. In 2010, the canton outlined plans to prevent future natural disasters in the district. Economy Sugarcane has been the backbone of Purab√°'s economy Purab√°'s real estate holdings, private, public, and ecclesiastic, are assessed according to national law. There are various commercial businesses in Purab√°, including a pharmacy, restaurants and corner stores. In 2010 the Santa B√°rbara canton planned to improve Purab√°'s environmental protections with the goal of improving tourism. The plans include reforestation, cleaning rivers, and setting up protected areas. Public and social services An EBAIS, Equipo B√°sico de Atenci√≥n Integral en Salud (Basic Medical Care Center), is located in the San Bosco neighborhood, serving residents and non-residents of the district. The Catholic Church serves the region through the Archdiocese of Alajuela. In Purab√°, there is a public cemetery maintained by the canton. The district is partially electrified by the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad. Like many areas of the country, at various times, Purab√° has suffered from problems with water distribution, despite the 24 springs and wells that exist in the area. Because of these problems, the canton created plans to improve Purab√°'s water distribution before 2020 by improving delivery and building a water treatment plant. There are three elementary schools that serve the entire district: Escuela Don Bosco, Escuela Rodolfo Peter Sheider, and Calle Quir√≥s.Ministerio de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica: Ministerio de Educaci√≥n P√∫blica, accessdate: 27 May 2014 By 2020, the district would like to expand the gyms of Escuela Don Bosco and Escuela Rodolfo Peter Sheider, as well as add a computer lab to Escuela Rodolfo Peter Sheider. In addition to serving as schools, Escuela Don Bosco and Escuela Rodolfo also serve as voting centers during general elections and primaries.

The People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan called for the swift recognition of the newly established state. In 2010, Former US Special Envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke requested Bangladesh to send combat troops to Afghanistan. Few days later, SITE intelligence group published a report headlined \\"Afghan Taliban reacts to US requesting troops from Bangladesh\\" where the Taliban called for rejecting the US request. Two days later, a press conference by the US embassy in Dhaka restated the request saying, \\"The United States has intensified its discussion on Bangladesh's engagement in Afghanistan for global peace and stability,\\". However, there was a general consensus among the politicians of different political parties as well as the civil society members that Bangladesh should not send its troops to Afghanistan without the UN mandate. Later, the government of Bangladesh declared that Bangladesh won't send any troops to Afghanistan but offered assistance on the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the war ravaged country.  Cooperation in rebuilding Afghanistan  Bangladesh has been actively participating in the rebuilding process of Afghanistan which was also praised by the Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Bangladesh has also offered to train Afghan civil servants, police personnel and diplomats and to create a skilled workforce. Bangladesh is also interested in providing technical and vocational training in the fields of banking, disaster management, primary and mass education, health care, agricultural etc. There are about 170 Bangladeshi non-profits working in Afghanistan. Afghanistan has sought Bangladesh's assistance on enhancing its education system. In 2009, a 12-member delegation from Afghan universities visited Dhaka to gain experience on higher education system.

History Founded in 1933 as a well-baby clinic, Whittier Street Health Center initially focused on women's health. Since then, Whittier has expanded its services to more than 40 different programs, including eye care, dental services, physical therapy, and specialized clinics focused on chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, and HIV. In 2011, Whittier was among four organizations recognized by Mayor Thomas Menino and the City of Boston at the Second Annual Mayoral Prize for Innovations in Primary Care. The award was for Whittier's Building Vibrant Communities Program, a partnership with the Boston Housing Authority in which health coordinators connect public housing residents with medical care and community services. In January 2012, Whittier opened its newly constructed, Silver LEED-certified, 78,900 square foot facility. The $38 million cost was partly funded through a $12 million Human Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) American Recovery and Reinvestment Act grant. The health center's new building gives it capacity to provide up to 220,000 visits annually, or about 70‚Äì80,000 patients.Governor Celebrates Opening of New Whittier Street Health Center, accessed June 16, 2014 In 2013, Whittier received a $9.5 million grant from the federal Health Resources and Services Administration to combat the chronic conditions prevalent in the communities served by the health center and to expand health care services. The grant enables Whittier to provide services to patients in the Roxbury and North Dorchester neighborhoods who had been served by the Roxbury Comprehensive Community Health Center (RoxComp), which was put in receivership in April 2013. The grant will be distributed in $1.9 million increments every year for five years for planned initiatives including community engagement forums, outreach and education, financial counseling, health insurance enrollment, and transportation and support services.Whittier Street Health Center Receives $1.9 Million Federal Grant to Support Patients from Closed Roxbury Comprehensive Community Health Center, accessed June 16, 2014 In 2016 WSHC opened a satellite pharmacy in North Dorchester. The following summer, recognizing that people who live in North Dorchester faced a two-hour commute on public transit to reach its main facility, WSHC opened Whittier@Quincy Commons, a satellite clinic on Blue Hill Avenue, staffed by two full-time doctors, who provide scheduled appointments as well as walk-in services. Whittier launched a new Mobile Health Van to provide services to the homeless and community residents to address the high rates of Sexually Transmitted Infections in Roxbury and surrounding neighborhoods, especially in the cities ‚Äúhotspots.‚Äù Within a few weeks of launching the Mobile Health Van, the staff identified two people who tested positive for HIV. Whiter is launching an aggressive campaign to help to eradicate HIV in the low communities of Boston. Whittier is focused on addressing the racial and ethnic disparities in health and health care, and the economic and social inequities impacting low income and minority residents. Whittier Street Health Center has been recognized as one of the Top 100 Women-Led Businesses in Massachusetts by the Boston Globe and The Commonwealth Institute for four consecutive years. The committee considered both nonprofit and for-profit organizations with careful review of each company's revenue, operating budget, number of full- time employees in the state, workplace and management diversity, and innovative projects. On October 24, 2014, the committee recognized President and CEO Frederica M. Williams for her leadership and Whittier's high quality, cost-effective health care for diverse populations. In October 2016, she was recognized by the Boston Business Journal as part of their 2016 Power 50 list celebrating ‚ÄúInfluential Bostonians.‚Äù and covered in their \\"2016 Women of Influence\\" article series. The designation of Top 100 Women-Led Businesses in Massachusetts was once again conferred upon Whittier Street Health Center in 2017. In June 2018, the center's CEO, Frederica Williams, terminated 20 employees days before a vote to unionize. Ms. Williams attributed the sudden decision to a loss of grant funding, but many employees point out that the health center had been waging an anti-union campaign, hiring consultants and forcing employees to attend anti-union meetings during work hours. Ms. Williams makes approximately $461,000 a year in compensation. In June 2018, three days prior to the vote to unionize, Whittier Street Health Center CEO and President, announced the need to lay-off 20 employees as the result of the end of one if its federal grants. At the request of union organizers, Boston Mayor Martin Walsh intervened and offered to help Whittier find the funds to retain the fired workers. The workers were reinstated after Whittier management received assurances of funding assistance from Boston City Hall. A small number of employees, mainly doctors and clinicians, voted to join the union, 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East. Despite the controversy, a few days later the board of directors voted to name the health center's main building after executive director Williams, prompting a scathing column in the Boston Globe. On January 27, 2020, WSHC announced it has withdrawn recognition from 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East after a majority of the employees in the professional bargaining unit represented by the union submitted a petition asking Whittier to withdraw recognition from the union.

The news confirmed fears from public health advocates that HIV use was spreading in MA and Boston, due primarily to shared needles and increased risky behaviors from the state's addicted and transient populations. Whittier Street Health Center is accredited by the Joint Commission and recognized by the NCQA as a Level 3 Patient-Centered Medical Home. Its new building received Silver LEED certification from the US Green Building Council. The outpatient addiction program at Whittier Street Health Center in Roxbury was mentioned in The Boston Globe's article \\"In Boston, Some Areas Bear Brunt of Opioid Overdoses\\" on August 6, 2016 for the Health Center's expertise in opioid treatment and use of the antioverdose drug Narcan.

Automated Insights produced 300 million pieces of content in 2013, which Mashable reported was greater than the output of all major media companies combined. In 2014, the company's software generated one billion stories. In 2016, Automated Insights produced over 1.5 billion pieces of content. In October 2015, Automated Insights released their Wordsmith software for beta testing to allow organizations access to natural language generation technology as a SaaS offering. The company has since commercialized the natural language generation platform called Wordsmith, with customers including Yahoo, Associated Press, and Tableau.  History  The company was founded by Robbie Allen while he was a full-time engineer at Cisco Systems. Formerly known as StatSheet, the company changed its name to Automated Insights in 2011 to mark its expansion into content generation for industries outside of sports. Automated Insights was acquired by Vista Equity Partners in February 2015, but remains independent.  Natural Language Generation  Automated Insights provides natural language generation (NLG) technology in the form of their Wordsmith platform. Natural language generation is a software process that automatically turns data into human-friendly prose. Normally, structured data is fed into NLG software and run through a narrative template, producing content that reads as if a human writer created it. The technology is used mostly in instances that require a routine, large-scale production of content in which each narrative is similarly structured. Some proven uses of natural language generation include the following types of content: * product descriptions from inventory data * business intelligence dashboard text explanations * customer communications that require personalization * real estate market property descriptions * corporate earnings reports  Products  = Wordsmith = Wordsmith is Ai's platform for natural language generation. It is \\"an artificial intelligence system that uses mounds of data, quantitative analysis and some rules about style and good writing\\" to produce stories. Wordsmith is sold as both a direct product and service to clients. In October 2015, the Wordsmith platform was updated to allow users to create their own narratives through online software. Software users upload their own data and create templates for writing narratives. Wordsmith has been described as a \\"a sort of personal data scientist, sifting through reams of data that might otherwise go un-analyzed and creating custom reports that often have an audience of one.\\" The service works by ingesting structured data, analyzing it for insights, and then writing out those insights in human-friendly prose.  Notable Work  =Associated Press = In June 2014, The Associated Press announced it would use automation technology from Automated Insights to produce most of its U.S. corporate earnings stories. AP said automation would boost its output of quarterly earnings stories nearly fifteen-fold, further noting that the technology would \\"free journalists to do more journalism and less data processing.\\" The Associated Press is the first newsroom to have an automation editor to oversee automated articles. Use of the Automated Insights software increased the Associated Press coverage of corporate earnings stories by over tenfold. A study by researchers at Stanford and the University of Washington found that Automated Insights‚Äô technology has had an effect on the stock market, as firms that received little attention from traders now see significant increases in trade volume and liquidity. The Daily Show with Trevor Noah aired a segment on the AP's use of automation on October 7, 2015. =Yahoo = Automated Insights (Ai) generates personalized recaps and previews for Yahoo Sports Fantasy Football. = Partnerships and Integrations = As of June 2017, Automated Insights partnerships and integrations include Amazon Alexa, Tableau, TIBCO Spotfire, MicroStrategy, Zapier, Microsoft Excel, and Google Sheets. =Other= Other Automated Insights work includes automation of marketing reports with the company's Wordsmith for Marketing tool and content generated for Comcast, Edmunds.com, GreatCall, DigitalSTROM, and Bodybuilding.com.  Recognition  *Ai received significant media attention following the announcement that it would automate AP earnings stories.

Its central responsibility is to implement the directives and teachings of the Suryeong [Great Leader], Kim Jong-un. The department was initially a department within the WPK General Affairs Department, but eventually spun off and was established at the 3rd Plenary Session of the 2nd Central Committee as the Organization Committee. Mission The OGD is a powerful department of the WPK that guides the implementation of all Party life policy, which extends to nearly every aspect of life in North Korea from civilian, to military, to government. Policy is based on the will of the Suryong (Supreme Leader). The OGD also serves as the staff for the Central Committee and Central Military Committee, and controls key personnel in the government, WPK, and Korean People's Army (KPA). This control stems from the OGD's power to select and dismiss high ranking officials based on the monitoring it does, records it collects, and investigations it runs, making it one of the most powerful and feared departments of the WPK. The OGD is also responsible for administering party life guidance to secure loyalty to the Kim regime and maintain Party ideology, overseeing guidance implementation down to a local and even workplace level. It does this though local Organization Departments, which are a part of every KWP Committee and have political power due to their close link to the OGD. Since every North Korean citizen experiences party life in some form, regardless of actually joining the party, the OGD and its guidance have a direct effect on the lives of every North Korean from the highest to lowest level. Power Due to a lack of information on the OGD from the North Korean government, there is a heavy reliance on defector testimony and expert analysis. Polish political scientist Nicolas Levi refers to the OGD as \\"The heart of the North Korean political system\\". According to North Korean defector Jang Jin-sung, the OGD is \\"the only entity that actually matters when it comes to decision-making or policy-making\\" and reflects the autocratic structure of the government. Hwang Jang-yop, another high-ranking defector, stated that the leading figures of North Korea belong to the OGD. Its officials regularly accompany the Supreme Leader during inspections and field guidance appearances. Some of its powers were given to the WPK Administrative Department (AD), in a bid to weaken the influence of those working in the OGD. However the AD itself was abolished in February 2014, after the execution of the AD Head Jang Song-thaek. Some scholars and defectors argue that the leaders of the OGD are the real leaders of North Korea, that Kim Jong-un is a puppet. North Korean defector Jang Jin-sung argues that Hwang Pyong-so, the First Deputy Head of the OGD, through his post as Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, was the real ruler of the country because he controlled the appointments and dismissals of military officers. However, none of the three following GPB Directors, Choe Ryong-hae, Kim Jong-gak and now Kim Su-gil, have been seen as true leaders of North Korea. Robert Collins at the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea maintains that the OGD truly implements directives of the Supreme Leader, and Michael Madden of the North Korea Leadership Watch concludes the OGD is not powerful enough to introduce directives itself. Leadership High ranking members of the OGD have significant power in the WPK. The director is often referred to as the second most powerful figure in the country, exemplified by the first director of the OGD being Kim Il-sung, the founder of the North Korean state, and his successor, Kim Jong-il (the Party General Secretary from 1997 to 2011) directing the OGD from September 1973 until his death in 2011. Under Kim Jong-il's stewardship, the OGD was turned into a center of power within the WPK. Therefore, OGD first deputy directors and deputy directors are leading figures within the North Korean establishment. Their position affords them privileges and a degree of secrecy that makes them \\"a kind of elite priesthood in the DPRK.\\" Officials working within the OGD are not under the jurisdiction of state law or party bylaws, after a memorandum issued by Kim Jong-il in the 1980's turned the OGD into a partially secret organization. Sanctions against deputy heads are kept confidential from the rest of the party. Although lower ranking members of the OGD don't have these privileges to the same extent, any member of the OGD is considered to be in a position of power and privilege. Due to the Kim family's lack of trust in the elite, members of the OGD, especially directors and deputy directors, are under constant and heavy surveillance and can be dismissed at any time for any reason by the Supreme Leader. He, as the head of every chain of leadership, has the final word on dismissals; for instance, in the 1990s Yun Sung-kwan, as deputy head, assumed control over the affairs of the OGD for two years, but was removed when Kim Jong-il believed he had amassed too much power. A similar case took place in 2003, when Jang Song-thaek was dismissed. Ri Man-Gon, the last known OGD Director, was dismissed in February 2020 by the Politburo from his position as WPK Vice-Chairman, and likely as OGD Director as well. This was due to, according to the North Korean Central News Agency, an abuse of power and corruption scandal in the WPK. The current OGD Director is unknown. First deputy directors (as of 2020) *General Kim Kyong-ok: An OGD Deputy Director since 2007 and KWP Deputy Director since 1991, General Kim is deeply involved in the Party and the Kim Regime. Kim Jong-un's security is his responsibility. Having no formal military training, General Kim was appointed General in 2010 in an effort to put civilian leadership at the head of the army. General Kim seems to be a trusted member of the Kim family, accompanying Kim Jong-un on many of his public inspections. In 2016 he was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury (OFAC). *General Ri Byong-chol: He has served for over four decades in the KPA, rising up the ranks to four star general in 2010. In addition to his position as OGD First Deputy Director, he is also a Deputy Director at the KWP Munitions Industry Department which is responsible for all weapons development in North Korea. Thus, he plays an active part in overseeing the research and production of weapons of mass destruction as well as making decisions regarding personnel in the military and weapons programs. General Ri has both military and senior Party experience, and is a trusted advisor to the Kim family, especially in times of crisis. In 2017 he was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury (OFAC). *Kim Jo-guk: Kim Jo-guk surfaced in 2019 as a OGD First Deputy Director. He is reportedly responsible for military affairs. Deputy directors (as of 2020) *Hwang Pyong-so: Fired from the General Political Bureau in 2017 for corruption, Hwang was retained as OGD Vice- Director after three months of \\"Revolutionary Rehabilitation\\". Despite a lack of formal military training, he has significant influence over the military and frequently accompanies Kim Jong-un on military related visits. In 2017 Hwang was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury (OFAC). *Jo Yong-won: In 2014 Jo Yong-won began appearing on the political scene, attending senior level meetings, advising Kim Jong-un, and accompanying Kim Jong-un to inspections. He is believed to be Kim Jong-un's Personal Action Officer within the OGD. In 2017 he was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury (OFAC). *Min Byong-chol: He is head of the OGD Inspection Section, one of the most feared institutions for its power to investigate any individual and send reports to the Supreme Leader. In 2017 he was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury (OFAC). *Kim Yo-jong: As Kim Jong-un's sister, Kim Yo-jong is often thought to be a deputy director of the OGD, although there is no official confirmation. In 2017 she was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury (OFAC). = Directors = * Kim Il-sung (1948‚Äì1952), head of the Organizing Committee * Pak Yong-bin (1952‚Äì1959), head of the Organization Department * Kim Yong-ju (1959‚Äì1974), head of the Organization and Guidance Department * Kim Jong-il (1974‚Äì1992), head of the Organization and Guidance Department * Yun Sung-gwan (1992‚Äì1993) * Kim Jong-il (1994‚Äì2011) * Kim Kyong-hui (2011-2012) * Kim Jong-un (2012‚Äì2017) * Choe Ryong-hae (2017‚Äì2019) * Ri Man-gon (2019‚Äì2020) = Past deputy directors = *Ho Ka-i *Ri Je-gang *Ri Yong-chol *Yom Ki-sun *Mun Song-sol *Ri Tong-hui * *Hong Song-ryong *Ko Hak-gyom *Mun Myong-on *Kim Su-yong *Pak Kyong-son *Ri Man-gon *Jo Yon-jun Structure The OGD is the largest department under the WPK Executive Policy Bureau, with a personnel of 1,000 and an estimated 25 deputy directors employed in its central sections. Sections under the OGD often overlap with other organizations within the WPK. This ensures security in the WPK and the OGD's power across the WPK. Due to the OGD's level of secrecy, it is difficult to track the various offices and sections, which are often referred to by slightly different names. Below is a list of known sections under the OGD. = Sections = *Party Headquarters Committee: guides all party elements. This entails training all party members (excepting the Supreme Leader) and overseeing surveillance of WPK Central Committee workers and their families. Members work in the various elements of the WPK EPB, including the Propaganda and Agitation Department, Party Registration, reports section, and the finance section among others. *Party Life Guidance Section: responsible for guiding party life of every North Korean citizen, working in the military, party elements, and local levels throughout the general population. Guidance from the PLG is disseminated to every organization, ensuring it is able to monitor and control the general public's adherence to the guidance. It was referred to as the eyes, ears and heart of the WPK by Kim Jong-il. Also under the PLG is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and all foreign trade organizations. *Military Directorate: guides party and political life of all military members through control of unit leaders. *Cadre Section: controls the selection, appointment, and dismissal of high ranking officials as well as Supreme Leader's personal staff by gauging political loyalty. This means the Cadre Section manages and assess all activities and records of officials and their families. *Seventh Section: formerly the Administrative Department, the Seventh Section has authority over the entire judicial system. Through embedded officers, it oversees the operations of the Ministry of Peoples Security, as well as the Ministry of State Security The Seventh Section is also directly connected to North Korea's prison system, as the chain of command from individual prison camps up to the Supreme Leader must run through the Seventh Section. *Inspection Section: the most feared institution in Korea, the Inspection Section has the power to investigate any person in any organization. The OGD's ability to dismiss officials stems from the Inspection Section. While it works in conjunction with the PLG to investigate N. Koreans at every level, it has the final word on all investigations. *Supreme Leader's Personal Secretariat: responsible for the Supreme Leader's personal matters from protocol and calendar, to security, to education and family finances. *Party Member Registration Section: handles Party registration and occupation as well as party expulsions and international dispatch. *General Affairs Section: responsible for administrative work for the OGD *Reports Section: collects and manages all OGD reports to centralize them to the Supreme Leader *Petitions Section: evaluates petitions from all N. Korean citizens *Mass Party Directorate: deploys OGD personnel to local levels to ensure adherence to guidance *Section 65: specially selects and trains women for the \\"Joy Brigade\\" in horticulture, hairdressing, and masseuse training. *Three Revolutionary Teams Guidance Section: monitors open market activity in N. Korea *Ten Principles of Monolithic Ideology Section: guides implementation of the TPMI *Overseas Guidance Section: guides overseas organizations *8.9 Section: responsible for managing Mansudae Palace and Financial Management Department *Treaty Section: monitors and oversees strategy for engagement in international treaties *Office 80: monitors and oversees Kim Jong-un's bodyguard unit, Unit 974. Human rights The OGD plays a role in North Korea's notorious human rights violations. Monitoring North Korea's human rights policy, although not a formal designation, falls under the responsibility of the OGD, which administers and guides North Korea's policy of human rights denial. The OGD's control over Party life through Organization Departments at a local level allows it to record and punish any North Korean who does not adhere to policy. North Koreans can be removed from positions of power, receive reeducation, or in severe cases be denied access to the food and medical systems or even send citizens to prison or labor camps. =Sanctions= In 2017 United Nations (UN) Security Council sanctioned the OGD as well as key leadership: Min Byong-chol (OGD Deputy Director as of 2020), Jo Yon-jun (former OGD Deputy Director), Kim Kyong-ok (OGD First Director as of 2020), and Jo Yong-won (Deputy Director as of 2020). In 2016 the United States put North Korean human rights on its agenda, with the US Treasury placing sanctions on the OGD itself as well as Jo Yon-jun, Kim Kyong- ok and several other members of North Korean leadership who were added to the Office of Foreign Assets Control Specially Designated Nationals List (OFAC SDN) for human rights abuses. Later in 2017, Min Byong-chol, Jo Yong-won, and Kim Yo-jong were added to the OFAC SDN list for human rights abuses as well. South Korea sanctioned Hwang Pyong-so (OGD Deputy Director as of 2020) in 2016 and implemented the above mentioned UN sanctions. In 2017, the United Kingdom put its own additional sanctions on the OGD and the same individuals. Future viability The stability of the Kim Regime depends on the Party obligations that are largely created and enforced by the OGD, according to the Korean Institute for National Unification. Thus, the OGD is integral to the regime's survival. As assessed by Robert Collins, former Chief of Strategy at R.O.K.- U.S. Combined Forces Command, there are external threats that could put strain on the OGD such as a manmade or natural disaster, or rebellion or war. Internal corruption, competition, and stress due to the OGD's wide responsibility also have potential to strain the OGD.

Since its inception in 1999, FAILE has been known for a wide-ranging multimedia practice recognizable for its explorations of duality through a fragmented style of appropriation and collage. While painting and printmaking remain central to their approach, over the past decade FAILE has adapted its signature mass culture-driven iconography to an array of materials and techniques, from wooden boxes and window pallets to more traditional canvas, prints, sculptures, stencils, installation, and prayer wheels. FAILE's work is constructed from found visual imagery, and blurs the line between \\"high\\" and \\"low\\" culture, but recent exhibitions demonstrate an emphasis on audience participation, a critique of consumerism, and the incorporation of religious media, architecture, and site-specific/archival research into their work. Biographical McNeil was born in 1975 in Edmonton, Alberta; Miller was born in 1976 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. McNeil and Miller met during their youth in Arizona. Separated in 1996 when Miller remained in art school in Minneapolis and McNeil continued to New York, by the end of the decade, the duo reconnected and, with the addition of then filmmaker Aiko Nakagawa (born 1975, Tokyo, JP), \\"A Life\\" was conceived. By early 2000, the trio contributed to the emergence of a nascent street art culture by circulating their screenprinted and painted work on city streets, usually using the subversive processes of wheatpasting (flyposting) and stenciling. During the ensuing years McNeil, Miller, and Nakagawa solidified both their omnivorous style of pop-cultural collage, and changed their name to FAILE (an anagram of A Life).Naoko Fukushi, \\"Faile,\\" Shift, September 2004. Nakagawa left FAILE in 2006, gaining success in her own right as Lady Aiko, while McNeil and Miller continued on to increased commercial and institutional visibility.Michael Mann, \\"Get Acquainted With a Faile Guy,\\" Ion 50 (17 March 2009). Career =Early years: 2000-2005= If FAILE's career can be viewed on a spectrum of \\"street art\\" and DIY-products to gallery-ready \\"fine art,\\" then the first half of the aughts tilts more fully towards street practice. Although FAILE has always shown in galleries in one form or another, and still puts work on the street, these early years were spent deploying work in cities around the world and honing a distinctive style of wheatpasted and stenciled work that recalls both the shredded commodity collage of midcentury d√©collagistes Mimmo Rotella and Jacques Villegl√©, and the pulp-cultural appropriations and comic books sensibilities of sixties \\"pop\\" artists such as Richard Hamilton, Andy Warhol, and Roy Lichtenstein. These influences were intensified in FAILE's work by the rapid fire splicing and re-assemblage of sampling, and the direct-to-audience urban raids specific to the golden age of graffiti. Although FAILE's style can be located in these art historical legacies, their style and idiosyncratic vernacular make FAILE's work distinct and recognizable. During the early years of their career, influenced by contemporaries Shepard Fairey, BAST, and WK Interact, FAILE generated both a process of assemblage and urban circulation, and consistent visual cues and themes. One such example is the Challenger space shuttle, which crashed shortly after its launch in 1986. Not only does the shuttle appear in various forms in much of FAILE's work, the year \\"1986\\" is appended to their pieces as a signature that both invokes their specific use of the shuttle image, and also a reminder to their audience of the event itself, of its role in their personal history. \\"1986\\" is both indicative of a populist or dialogic impulse in much of FAILE's work, and also an example of the characteristic ambivalence or dualism in their practice.Mann, op cit, 22-25. Recurring themes of binaries such as love/hate, peace/war, triumph/calamity, satiation/desire are all prevalent in work that seems to assimilate the global urban landscape but tenders only oblique opinions about that landscape. During this period, FAILE produced several books in limited edition, including, by 2004, Orange, Death, Boredom, and Lavender. The overlap between FAILE's art practice and design background was pronounced during this early period, and found them collaborating on clothing and shoe lines (including Paper Denim, Comme des Garcons, and Pro-Keds), and music projects, as well as work on the street.Lodown 37 (Summer 2003). In 2004 McNeil reflected, \\"A lot of what inspires us and excites us is the opportunity to work with talented people and to work on projects that are a challenge. Having the chance to work on things of all different disciplines whether it is fashion, painting, shoe design, or making a toy. The ideas of getting locked in and known for one thing and having to repeat. It sounds like a dreadful situation to be in. Recently we got the opportunity to work on the new Duran Duran album with John Warwicker for Tomato.\\"Fukushi, op cit. This first phase of FAILE's career was markedly experimental and varied‚Äîconstant travel, a lack of studio space, and a rapidly evolving process meant that work was made for (and usually at) specific sites, from Manhattan to London and Tokyo. Commercial projects helped to finance this period of dissemination and revision. By 2005, however, FAILE acquired a permanent studio space, and were able to commit fully to a more studio-driven practice that both adapted the entropic street aesthetic of FAILE's and others' work, and permitted FAILE to apply their practice to a wider array of media and socio-political themes.FAILE, Faile: Prints + Originals, (Berlin: Gestalten, 2010, 78. =Spank the Monkey (2006)= From 27 September 2006 to 7 January 2007, independent curator Pedro Alonszo's Spank the Monkey ran at the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead, UK. The exhibition brought together twenty two internationally recognized street artists and investigated street art's growing artistic quality and popular appeal (particularly in the United Kingdom) and its rootedness in the realms of graphic design and global youth culture.BALTIC Exhibition Archive, \\"Spank the Monkey.\\" The exhibition included celebrated \\"fine artists\\" such as Barry McGee, Takashi Murakami, and Ryan McGinness alongside noted graffiti, street, and design artists such as Os Gemeos, Shepard Fairey, Banksy, and FAILE. Spank the Monkey was the first exhibition of its kind, and followed closely behind the commercial success of Fairey's Obey line, and Banksy's \\"Barely Legal\\" sale of his own work in Los Angeles.Killian Fox, \\"Spraypainting by Numbers,\\" Guardian, 1 October 2006. The exhibition, which positioned works both inside the gallery and throughout Newcastle, received favorable reviews. Speaking of the show, critic Guy Bird noted that \\"when the gallery takes the art seriously, avoiding condescension, or over-glamorisation, and the artists avoid 'sell-out' accusations by keeping control of their message...the results can be spectacular.\\"Guy Bird, \\"Exhibitions: Spank the Monkey and Keith Haring,\\" Blueprint, 1 January 2007, 78. Spank the Monkey marked both the gradual institutional acceptance of street art, and FAILE‚Äôs regular display in high-profile fine-art institutions. Indeed, FAILE used the venue to display some of their most somber work to date, in a series of twelve paintings titled \\"War Profitees,\\"Gallery Images on artist's site. that incorporated harrowing photographs, newspaper text, and a dark color palette to bring to life the tragic 2006 Lebanon War, which killed 1,500 people, most of whom were civilians. The invocation of political violence, and references to Israel and Hezbollah indicated an intensification of FAILE's work, and demonstrated how their technique could be brought to bear on the precarious global order of the 21st century. The integration of form and content in the work, and sustained, critical attention to a political theme evident in FAILE's Spank the Monkey contribution was a harbinger. =Tate Modern (2008)= In response to the growing popularity‚Äîand commercial viability‚Äîof street art, the Tate Modern, located in London's Southwark, organized a show simply titled Street Art, that took place from 23 May to 25 August 2008, one week after Banksy's Cans show in a London railway tunnel.Alice Fisher, \\"How the Tate got streetwise,\\" Observer (London) Magazine, 11 May 2008, 31-37. The exhibition, organized by curator Cedar Lewisohn, displayed work by six artists or collaborative projects in massive relief on the riverfront-facing wall of the museum's turbine room.Cedar Lewisohn, Street Art: The Graffiti Revolution (London: Abrams, 2008). Street Art included Nunca and Os Gemeos from Brazil, Blu (artist)Blu from Italy, Sixeart from Spain, and JR from France. FAILE was the only group to participate in both the Cans and the Tate shows, contributing to the latter a massive image of a Native American in full regalia amidst a shredded collage of pulp images and found signage typical of FAILE's work in 2008, and constructed in pieces in the studio before being affixed to the Tate's exterior.Morgan Falconer, \\"Graffiti on the Gallery,\\" Knowledge (London), 17‚Äì23 May 2008. Of the exhibition and the institutionalization of their work, FAILE argued \\"At least it‚Äôs no longer undermined as something on the street, something without value. Money fuels interest‚Äîit‚Äôs an injection in the butt that fires people up and makes them realise they should pay attention.\\"Quoted in Fisher, op cit, 37. While street art was, by 2008, an increasingly accepted and popular form overseas, in New York, graffiti's traditional home, street art was embraced by only a handful of galleries, such as Deitch Projects, an early champion of sometimes FAILE collaborator Swoon. As FAILE noted at the time, \\"New York has such a history of this art, but institutions are waiting to see what happens before they open the doors to it. The art is starting to surface in New York Sotheby's and Christie's, but it wouldn‚Äôt be if not for the excitement [in the UK].\\"Fisher, 32-35. Inclusion in the Tate show, which received widespread media attention and reached a large public, brought FAILE more fully into the international spotlight and further established them as one of the most recognizable names in an increasingly globalized and multi- platform art world.For example, Ross McGuiness, \\"Art‚Äôs Truly Off the Wall: Some of the Best Graffiti Artists in the World Cover the Tate Modern,\\" Metro (UK), 23 May 2008, 33. =Lost in Glimmering Shadows (2008)= On the heels of work in England for the Baltic Gallery and the Tate Modern, FAILE displayed a series of new work in November 2008 titled Lost in Glimmering Shadows, and thematically unified exploration of tension between consumer culture and spiritual fulfillment and the contradiction between America's sometimes bloody history and its democratic ideals. Housed in the Lilian-Baylis Old School in conjunction with Lazarides Gallery in London, Lost in Glimmering Shadows occupied an ambiently lit circular gallery space in which large-scale prints and paintings surrounded sculptural elements in the interior ring.Ariston Anderson, \\"Lost in Glimmering Shadows,\\" Cool Hunting, 10 November 2008. While the temple-like lighting and installation, life-size cast of a boy with rabbit, and large-scale painted work were familiar formal carryovers from earlier exhibitions (such as 2007's commercially successful From Brooklyn With Love at Lazarides, and Nothing Lasts Forever in New York's Chinatown)Steven Psyllos, \\"Lost in Glimmering Shadows,\\" Giantmag, 6 November 2008. Lost in Glimmering Shadows notably introduced freestanding, functional prayer wheels, circular disc paintings, and stacks of multifaceted apple boxes, all emblazoned with brightly hued text and found imagery. Moreover, the show introduced a leitmotif of heroic Native American figures in conflict with a consumption-mad America, their world \\"lost in glimmering shadows.\\" The work within the exhibition derived much of its force from ironic juxtapositions, such as a reworking of the American flag in the style of a Navajo ceramic in the acrylic on canvas Star Spangled Shadows, and the textual interplay on the prayer wheels of phrases like \\"In search of sacred\\" and roadside advertisements for \\"cold beer\\" and \\"snacks.\\" This irony is redoubled by the construction here of functional religious devices (the prayer wheel) overlaid by FAILE's own international brand. At other times, the work is more explicit, depicting a suit-wearing kachina figure amidst the backdrop of a pulp serial promising \\"A Betrayal Story,\\" in the painting of the same name, or implying an alternate America in It Could be Beautiful.J. O‚ÄôShea, \\"FAILE‚Äôs ‚ÄòLost in Glimmering Shadows at Lazarides Gallery,\\" Supertouch, 13 November 2008. Consistent FAILE themes such as the Challenger shuttle and urban signage were featured alongside new figures and decorative elements derived from traditional figurines and baskets, as well as appropriated 20th-century imagery and pictures from the American southwest.FAILE, Lost in Glimmering Shadows (self-published catalog, 2010). =Deluxx Fluxx (2010)= From 12 February to 27 March on Greek Street in London, and again from 30 April to 27 May 2010, on artist BAST to produce an installation dubbed Deluxx Fluxx, comprising custom-made, operational arcade games and a foosball table. The entire salon at 158 Allen St. and the arcade cabinets therein were wheatpasted by FAILE and BAST, and blurred the line between the traditional \\"white cube\\" method of art display and the commercial operation of a gaming parlor. While audiences were invited to play the games for free, the works themselves were part canvas, part sculptural object, and part cabinet for interactive video art. The content of the cabinets, video work modeled on classic \\"games,\\" were executed in collaboration with Adapted Studio and Seth Jabour of the band Les Savy Fav.Jake Dobkin, \\"Faile, International Artists/Operators of Deluxx Fluxx Arcade,\\" Gothamist, 29 April 2010. This New York installation updated an earlier version of the show with the Lazarides Gallery in London from earlier that spring, and featured recurring FAILE and BAST images, such as kissing women, Popeye, old time boxers, a barking dog, and commercial logos and signage for, among others, Chapstick and former airline TWA. Most of the images, such as they were derived from threads within FAILE's visual archive no longer for sale as prints in their own right, while others, such as the \\"Fashion Chimp,\\" may appear in future projects. While the London show provided the blueprint for the New York iteration, the latter featured new games and images, and employed neon and blacklighting to generate a fully immersive experience. The aim of Deluxx Fluxx was to bridge the DIY-sensibility and popular accessibility of street practice with the more permanent, gallery- style emphasis of FAILE's more recent work.Wallkandy, \\"Interview with Faile‚ÄîDeluxx Fluxx New York City,\\" 6 May 2010. According to the artists, \\"After doing the show in London, we learned a lot and had so much of the groundwork built to do the show again. There was a real sense of joy in seeing people interact with the work in this way and that was the whole point of the show from the beginning. We wanted to bring it to NYC and it was something we wanted to do on our own. Just to make it happen, much like our street art. We knew we wanted to create new machines here, to make it a new experience but the same style show.\\"Wallkandy, op cit. In so doing, Deluxx Fluxx obscured the lines between artist and consumer, and viewer and participant in an attempt to recapture the recent history of the Lower East Side as a haven for anti- elitist art practices such as graffiti and punk rock. While not reviewed heavily in art publications, Deluxx Fluxx received favorable reviews, with Stephen Heyman of the New York Times arguing that \\"art can be diverting, but people sometimes need winners and losers to get in the game.\\"Stephen Heyman, \\"Joystick Division: Playing Deluxx Fluxx,\\" T Magazine Blog, 10 May 2010. In 2014 Deluxx Fluxx was also exhibited at Edinburgh, Scotland's Summerhall as part of the Edinburgh Festival - alongside the Vestige Board paintings; large canvases created initially in the studio from the artists and assistants cleaning their screens and brushes on the surfaces and then later completed by Faile with the addition of recognisable \\"Faile\\" iconography on the surface. The exhibitions were a critical and popular success. =Temple (2010)= From 16 July to 5 August 2010, FAILE displayed Temple a full-scale church in ruins in Pra√ßa dos Restauradores Square in Lisbon, Portugal.Vernissage, \\"Artist Collective FAILE‚Äôs Temple at Portugal Arte 10, Lisbon,\\" 21 July 2010. The installation was made in conjunction with the Portugal Arte 10 Festival and is slated for touring abroad. Temple brought together a variety of earlier motifs‚Äîstreet art vernacular, prayer wheels, and a dualistic interest in the globalization of commerce and new forms of spiritual immanence‚Äîwith the site specific concerns of working in an historically Catholic country. The piece itself is a building in ruins fabricated with components, such as iron gating, ceramic relief work, and painted ceramic tiles from local and foreign manufacturers. Familiar FAILE images appear in relief (an update on 15th- century Florentine sculptor Luca Della Robia), the previously 2-D \\"Scuba Horse\\" was realized as a sculptural fountain, and the white, blue, and gold color palette was a nod towards the Portuguese landscape.Little Art Book \\"Faile Temple‚ÄîPortugal Art 10,\\" 15 June 2010. Temple marked FAILE's first contribution to the international festival circuit, and brought their practice full circle, taking high concept studio art back to an accessible, urban setting. Temple received strong critical and viewer attention, and was successful at blending seamlessly into its temporary environment even as it expanded and augmented FAILE's idiosyncratic leitmotifs.Stick2Target, \\"FAILE Temple,\\" July 2010. According to Interview, \\"Faile's site-specific work seems to be the hit of the biennial. It's a shining ruin, an open-air dialogue between the sacred past and the secular present. And it's an easy match for the historical architecture encircling the busy Pra√ßa dos Restauradores, which is probably why your average cab driver likes it‚Äìand why foreign tourists passing by have been trying to look it up in their guidebooks.\\"Darrell Hartman, \\"Brooklyn is Holy in Portugal,\\" 21 July 2010. In its ability to blur the boundaries between art and architecture, object and display environment, Temple further amplified underlying currents in FAILE's work, such as an emphasis on openness and participation, the porousness of cultural and institutional boundaries, and the fluid integration of visual culture and the built environment. =Bedtime Stories (2010)= This exhibition of works on wood was something of a return to fundamentals, clearly emphasizing form and process, and ran From 4 November to 23 December 2010 at the Perry Rubenstein gallery in New York. 18 October 2010 Each of the twelve works' compositions were created from individually painted wooden blocks that came together in \\"puzzle-box\\" format as unified paintings. According to the text accompanying the show, the paintings on wood \\"reveal FAILE‚Äôs relentless assimilation and refinement of the vast visual vocabularies of both the urban environment and their own decade-long practice. The grids of these paintings are at once modular and fixed, tactile and graphic. On their surfaces, iconoclastic characters fluidly intermingle with adroit deconstructions of commodity culture. The re-combinations of carefully constructed texts and images provide a glimpse into FAILE‚Äôs rigorous and organic process, and draw attention to painting‚Äôs inherent materiality.\\" 18 October 2010 =Fragments of FAILE (2011)= For the late fall of 2011, FAILE made a series of new paintings for a solo show at the Lazarides Gallery in London. The new work marked a period of experimentation and a pronounced return to painting and folk tradition. While all of the pieces for Fragments of FAILE were built from existing FAILE motifs, images, and text, their formats referenced a wide array of new formal approaches, including monochromatic abstraction, figuration and portraiture, American quilting, Native American textiles, and Tibetan Mandalas. Fragments of FAILE showcased work made during an intensive phase of studio work between larger outdoor commissions. Some elements, such as the use of wood and a modular or \\"quilted\\" structure would factor prominently into subsequent installations. =The Wolf Within (2012)= In the fall of 2012, FAILE worked with the Tiger Translate program to construct a massive (15 ft. high) public sculpture at the National Garden Park complex on the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar, the capitol of Mongolia. For the commission, FAILE selected a figure drawn from their Lost in Glimmering Shadows show, a corporate-styled man seemingly in transition to a wolf-like form. Constructed at twice human scale, the original image (Eat With the Wolf)‚Äîconceived on the brink of the 2008 financial crisis‚Äîwas given a new context and new associations. Wolf Within can, for example, be read as a cautionary tale for a nation in the midst of a massive mineral resource boom and in the process of rapid urbanization. It is also a reminder of the delicate balance between progress and tradition, and the persistence and resilience of the natural world.http://www.theartcollector.org/east-meets-west-in-mongolia-new-york- artist-faile-unveils-permanent-sculpture/ Wolf Within is a permanent installation, rather than a gallery or museum show, and marked FAILE's increasing engagement with commissioned, large-scale outdoor projects. =Les Ballets de FAILE (2013)= FAILE was commissioned by the New York City Ballet to build a new installation in the five-story atrium space of the David H. Koch Theater at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts on New York's Upper West Side, to be displayed during the winter and spring of 2013. In addition to a series of new paintings, FAILE also produced hundreds of individually painted wooden blocks to be given to audience members at two of the NYCB's performances. The centerpiece of the project, however, was a forty foot high tower dubbed Tower of FAILE, constructed using wooden boxes atop a wooden plinth to form an obelisk screen printed and painted with familiar FAILE imagery, and new materials drawn from research in the NYCB's archives. This tower was an outgrowth of FAILE's longer-term experimentation with wood and hybrid-sculptural forms, but was FAILE's largest constructed object to date. It took advantage of the Theater's multiple vantages and high ceilings in order to create encounters with the work that go beyond the single-perspective of a wall-mounted or wheatpasted work. In this way, the tower arguably built on earlier theories of minimalism in artmaking, and contemporary installation formats, such as Maurizio Cattelan's 2012 retrospective at the Guggenheim in New York. Of the installation, the Village Voice argued that the project signaled the emergence of the internet generation into a bastion of elite culture, and that it effectively connected \\"relatable populist imagery with the most rigid of bourgeois arts.\\"Brian Chidester, \\"Beauty and the Vernacular Beast: Street-Art Meets Ballet at Lincoln Center Art Series Opening,\\" Village Voice, 5 February 2013. In May 2013, FAILE reprised their collaboration with the NYCB, installing twenty one of their signature prayer wheels in the Koch atrium space. This installation also featured a performance by the ballet that was developed in dialogue with the art. =Where Wild Won't Break (2013)= In 2013, FAILE's first solo American museum show was held from 21 September to 22 December at Dallas Contemporary. The show featured a suite of paintings on wood with metal armatures, and a range of mixed-media works drawing on classic Americana, such as T-shirts and racing coveralls. For Where Wild Won't Break FAILE incorporated a range of imagery associated with the American west, including cowboys, bandana clad outlaws. horses, eagles, and desert landscapes. Another motif within the show was muscle car racing and associated iconography, such as patches and decals, all reworked with FAILE's by-then signature approaches of digital decollage and multimedia assemblage. The publication Artnews argued that \\"the adventurous, impulsive nature of the West lent itself well to FAILE‚Äôs artwork because, as their name suggests, the duo embraces fallibility and spontaneity. [Citing Miller] \\"No matter how well you try to tame something wild, chaos will always be a part of it.\\"Stephanie Strasnick, \\"FAILE Messes with Texas,\\" Artnews, 17 September 2013. While installing the Dallas Contemporary show, FAILE completed a large mural on the city's Singleton Boulevard, which reflected imagery from FAILE's archive, including the wolf man and bunny boy, juxtaposed with newer material made for the exhibition, including a bandit driving a hot rod.Jamie Laughlin, \\"The 10 Best Murals in Dallas\\", The Dallas Observer, 1 October 2013. =Savage/Sacred Young Minds (2015)= FAILE's work returned to New York for a major retrospective at the Brooklyn Museum, running from 10 July to 4 October. The exhibition, organized by curator Sharon Matt Atkins, featured a return of the Temple, which first appeared outdoors in Lisbon, Portugal. Here, it was reconstituted in an interior gallery of the museum amid two large-scale, hand- carved sculptures, and more recent paintings and works on wood. FAILE also prepared a new arcade for the occasion, drawing on the black-lit, all-over aesthetic of its earlier pop-up Deluxx Fluxx installations with B√§st. At the Brooklyn Museum, signature arcade cabinets were complemented by new FAILE- designed pinball machines that were (like their digital counterparts) fully interactive and cultivated a sense of play and leisure within the otherwise \\"white cube\\" space of the gallery. Reviews for the show were mixed, with the Huffington Post's Jaime Rojo and Steven Harrington noting the punk rock and Dada motifs within the arcade, and praising the democratic sensibility of the installation. They argued that Savage/Sacred Young Minds offered \\"a full immersion and opportunity for titillating interaction, this show provides an unambiguous sense of the industry that is backing the FAILE fantasy. Throughout their work and your imagination and assumed role, you may be villain, distressed damsel, wolfman, fairey, vandal, wrestler, hot-rodder, madonna, whore, supplicant, avenger, surfing horse or simply an arcade hero who is whiling away windowless hours punching buttons, popping flippers and pumping FAILE tokens into tantalizing art machines.\\"Jaime Rojo and Steven Harrington, \\"Holy FAILE! 'Savage/Sacred Young Minds' at Brooklyn Museum\\", The Huffington Post, 8 July 2015. Others, such as Ken Johnson of the New York Times, did not see the broader implications of the show, finding it instead unfocused. He noted that, \\"while some other parts of the temple are amusing, intense vibes of savagery, sacredness or insanity are absent. How those psychic states might be related is obscured by Faile‚Äôs bewilderingly overwrought and unfocused magpie appropriation of graphic signifiers from many times and places, from ancient Egypt to 20th-century comic books.\\"Ken Johnson, \\"Review: Faile Mines the Dark Depths of Modern Youth With Two Exhibitions\\", New York Times, 20 August 2015. Time Out New York, in turn, marked FAILE's movement into the museum context, and their connection to an earlier legacy in the New York avant-garde. They suggested that, \\"as the careers of Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat show, the street can often be an avenue into the art world, something certainly true for Patrick McNeil and Patrick Miller. Two Brooklyn artists collaborating under the all-caps name of FAILE, they‚Äôve jumped from plastering walls around Williamsburg to exhibiting in galleries and museums.\\"\\"FAILE: Savage/Sacred Young Minds\\" Time Out New York, 29 June 2015. =Wishing on You (2015)= Throughout the summer of 2015, visitors to New York's Times Square encountered a large-scale FAILE installation titled Wishing on You. This seven-foot-high kinetic sculpture expanded on the prayer wheels that FAILE placed both inside and outside the gallery in earlier years. Wishing on You blended old and new FAILE motifs, and was built into a flat- roofed, pagoda-like shelter. Audiences climbed two steps and passed through green and red columns bearing seemingly south Asian decorative motifs. The vividly chromatic and textured wheel not only turned, but also powered neon lights in the ceiling of the structure. In this way Wishing on You paid homage not only to the traditional larger prayer wheels of Bhutan, but also the public square's history of arcades, nickelodeons, and garish advertising. Of the installation, FAILE noted that \\"while Wishing on You really builds on Times Square‚Äôs storied past...we are also aware of how it has served for so long as a truly American place of celebration and commemoration.\\" For his part, Times Square Alliance president Tim Tompkins remarked of Wishing on You that, \\"rituals that wish for hope are central to the character of our city, but especially to the character of Times Square.\\"Jen Chung, \\"FAILE's Hand- Carved, 7-Foot Tall Prayer Wheel Is In Times Square\\". Gothamist, 18 August 2015. =Strong Currents (2016) and Meet Me Halfway (2017)= 2016 marked the first FAILE show with Gordon Gallery, a contemporary art space in Tel Aviv. Hung salon style, Strong Currents brought together a range of studio-based works, and featured familiar motifs such as the reclining \\"wolf man\\" and the geometric American flag from the Lost in Glimmering Shadows era. On the whole, the show was notable for its spare compositions and looser handling. In contrast to the intricacy of the wood-block assemblages that preceded them, the works in Strong Currents had a notably graphic feel. In them, FAILE emphasized vibrant color, broad expanses, and more evident brushwork, as in a multihued bouquet of flowers on a white background, or the show's centerpiece, a woman and her horse at rest in an open field.FAILE: Strong Currents. This line of inquiry continued into 2017 with the Paris exhibition of Meet Me Halfway. As in previous FAILE work, the process of layering and bricolage was fundamental to the multimedia works on display. But here, FAILE pressed the color-blocked sensibility of Strong Currents further, building up figural shapes using cut paper, then overpainting a neutral tone to create negative space or a ground for the composition. This process lent the figures an abstract quality reminiscent of early-20th century posters, and modernist painters like Henri Matisse. The cut paper works were displayed with a survey of recent studio-based works, including assemblages of wood blocks, copper plates, and mosaic or tile-styled arrays of smaller modules. In conjunction with this show, FAILE translated one of the smaller works into a ten-story mural on the side of a building in the city's 13th arrondissement, with a text in French that translates to \\"and I held my breath.\\"Paris: FAILE 'Meet Me Halfway'. =Stages (2018)= From its inception, FAILE has worked on a range of surfaces, from canvases and wood blocks to city walls. Since at least the Lost in Glimmering Shadows show, they have also attempted to turn galleires into immersive environments, building platforms, painting on display spaces, and encouraging audience participation. In 2010, they turned their attention more fully to questions of sound and lighting as well. The Stages show in Berlin brought many of these elements together, showcasing a broad spectrum of approaches to painting from the previous decade (e.g. gestural abstraction, interlocking \\"blocks\\", and fragmented collage). For this exhibition, FAILE also applied black-and-white pieces directly to the walls of the Springmann Gallery, and created a literal stage marked off by a diamond-shaped portal that framed a woman in a bandanna strumming a guitar. During the show's run, the space was carefully lighted in purples and blue and used by a variety of performers.FAILE: Stages. This \\"environment\\" seemed to build on earlier experiments, and set the tone for later versions of the Deluxx Fluxx project. =From the Air We Share (2018‚Äì19)= In 2018, FAILE took on several large- scale commissions in the city of Strasbourg in northeastern France. Each of these was public facing, and focussed on a more sequential or narrative quality. In 2017, FAILE visited Strasbourg and studied its local lore, ultimately writing a poem to be illustrated by a series of massive black-and- white panels on the exterior of the Mus√©e d‚ÄôArt moderne et contemporain.Danysz Gallery, \\"Making of FAILE at the Modern and Contemporary Art Museum in Strasbourg\\". The museum's site notes that text and images are epic in tone and rich in metaphor but connect to local luminaries from Marie-Antoinette to Hans Arp, as well as important geographical features like the Rhine River.MAMC Site. Relatedly, FAILE also created a massive color mural, \\"Little by Little\\", spanning several thousand feet of the central train station overlooking the Place de la Gare. Decorative and representational fragments of FAILE paintings (e.g. the race-car driving cowboy, the surf horse, and women as both damsel and cat burglar) appear in the commission in a monumental format.STRASTV, \\"Faile Art s'attaque √† la verri√®re de la Gare de Strasbourg\\". As part of this project, FAILE also painted a streetcar in bright pastel tones (again, both abstract and figurative). Although the station commission ends in 2019, the \\"FAILE Train\\" will be in service for several years.Gilles Varela \\"Pourquoi des New-Yorkais retapent la verri√®re de la gare, apr√®s le mus√©e d‚ÄôArt moderne?\\", and FAILE Instagram. =Public Tile Installations (Ongoing)= 2010's Temple project in Portugal found FAILE working in ceramic on a large scale, developing cast sculptural forms and drawing inspiration from accretions of urban tiling. This process complemented FAILE's interest in vernacular architecture and American textile traditions and opened on to a new way of working in the city using ceramics. The first example of this type of work was the 104 North 7th Street project in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.http://hyperallergic.com/50378/faile-mural-williamsburg/ For this \\"Casa de los Azulejos\\", FAILE designed an array of signature tiles in striking patterns that were then handmade and fired in a wood-burning kiln. The building, formerly a nondescript light industrial space, was clad by hand over the course of several days. According to FAILE, North 7th was a natural extension of their earlier street-based projects. Miller noted that, in creating the mosaic, \\"we see almost the process of how graffiti gets built up, the way it gets buffed, these sort of geometric colorfield, abstract paintings.\\"Vice Media,\\"Screen Printing and Tile Making with FAILE. FAILE's work with tile murals is ongoing, and they have executed a range of custom projects in Southern California, including a home in Venice (2017)Kylie Obermeier, \\"ARTIST FAILE HELPS KEEP VENICE WEIRD WITH HUGE TILE INSTALLATION COVERING ROCCO GARDNER'S HOUSE\\", Flaunt (3 May 2017). and a low-slung building in the downtown Arts District, Los Angeles (2018). This and other work in the city responds in a site-specific fashion to the local context. For example, for a public installation in Orange County's Playa District (2018), FAILE created a slate of bespoke patterns suited to the area, tessellated layouts derived from film reels, the coastal landscape, deco design, and indigenous craft. Similarly, a 2019 commission in Culver City plays on the Lantana flower and local institutions such as the Gemological Institute of America and the famed Rollerdrome. =Deluxx Fluxx Detroit (Ongoing)= The Deluxx Fluxx collaboration with B√§st is a pop-up arcade space that has appeared in multiple locations since 2010. In the summer of 2018 FAILE opened a more permanent version of the project in downtown Detroit near the \\"Belt\\", an alley between Library and Broadway Streets. The corridor features an exhibition space and is centered on a series of public arts interventions by contemporaries like Nina Chanel Abney, Carlos Rol√≥n, and Shepard Fairey.Library Street Collective FAILE had already shown work the year before in this area with Library Street Collective. That show, The Size of the Fight, assembled many instances of FAILE's practice, including pinball machines, works on wood, and mandala-like paintings. Many of these featured Detroit-specific motifs, as in a \\"Detroit Tiger\\" and racing logos that call out to the city. The title of the exhibition references the Mark Twain adage about the \\"size of the fight in the dog\\", and Detroit's simultaneous status as an underdog, and place of resilience and rebirth.FAILE: Size of the Fight. Overall, FAILE was inspired by the energy of Detroit, and made plans for a more permanent project there. Like earlier versions, the Detroit Deluxx Fluxx blends elements from the golden age of arcades, 80s-era basements, and the visual culture of nightclubs. It features the arcade's signature day-glo palette and ten custom video game installations. Made in collaboration with Matthew Cooley, the latter are based on Detroit-specific themes, including Robocop and the city's Eastern Market.Brenna Houck, \\"Meet the Belt Alley‚Äôs New Art-Filled Arcade Bar and Music Venue\\", Eater, 2 August 2018. Built out from a raw space, FAILE lined the walls with their own poster-inspired work and developed a lighting system with Andi Watson, a designer best known as creative director for the band Radiohead. According to the Detroit Free Press, \\"the result is a venue that‚Äôs intimate (240-person capacity) and loaded with details. Its elements will be adjusted over time to create a sense of constant evolution.\\"Ryan Patrick Hoover, \\"Art meets arcade at new Detroit nightlife hotspot Deluxx Fluxx\\", Detroit Free Press, 1 August 2018. In this sense, Deluxx Fluxx is simultaneously an interactive art project and an active performance venue, the space hosts DJ nights focused on Detroit genres (soul, techno) and national acts (e.g. Avey Tare, Chromeo).Deluxx Fluxx Site. Process Although FAILE's completed works are iconographically and stylistically distinctive, their process of creation owes much to chance, improvisation, and openness to outside source material.Carlo McCormick, \\"Interview with FAILE,\\" From Brooklyn With Love, (London: Lazarides, 2007), 24. This is true of both FAILE's relationship to form and content‚Äîthe visual elements of their work is continuously adapted to heterogeneous materials, from grocery store sign paper to wooden boxes and painted ceramics. During the early years of their career, FAILE's primary laboratories were urban streets. On the one hand, their practice, at its most basic, consisted of painting with stencils on the built environment. On the other, from the outset FAILE developed work in the studio that drew from a wide array of international cultural influences, both sacred and profane, that were then wheatpasted in the outside world.FAILE, Prints + Originals, 36; 52; 54; 70. These latter works demanded reproducibility and rapid availability for circulation, and were thus well suited to the printmaking process. After experimenting with more graphically centered black and white images, and the intensive process of layer-by-layer color transfer, FAILE introduced an element of immediacy to these prints by painting the paper prior to printing, yielding prints that were loose and chromatically expressive.FAILE, Prints + Originals, 88. Each of these tendencies were amplified by FAILE's consistent travel and limited permanent studio space. By necessity, work was adapted to its location of display, by virtue of its inherent \\"site specificity,\\" as well as the group's absorption of forms, imagery, and usable materials wherever they happened to be. Once those materials were exhausted, stencils could be used to provide a constant template in lieu of prints. This early phase was one of dynamism and experimentation, and much of FAILE's early work was left to deteriorate and interact with its environment.FAILE, Prints + Originals, 96. By 2005, when FAILE established a larger studio space, this ad hoc approach was supplemented with a more traditional approach to painting and print editions that drew on these earlier priorities (inter-cultural permutation, use of found images and signifiers, and an expressive, playful approach to execution), while taking the entropy and dynamism of the street as an object of investigation. Although street art is a consistent aspect of FAILE's practice (in concrete terms and as a source of inspiration), the post-2005 period has permitted them to work more slowly, generating thematically driven suites (War Profitees; Lost in Glimmering Shadows),FAILE, Prints + Originals, 138. small print runs, and increasingly three-dimensional media, from arcade cabinets, salvaged wood, and large-scale casting. Each of FAILE's projects is unified, however, by a consistent openness to chance, external cultural influences, audience interactivity, and the organic rhythms of the street.McCormick, op cit, 15. More recently, found wood and apple boxes figured into FAILE's development in their studio practice of hybrid forms of painting that blur the boundaries between religious, folk, artisanal, and sculptural forms. The histories of abstraction and quilting, as well as the modular form of the puzzle box, for example, were foundational for the suites of paintings in 2010's Bedtime Stories and 2011's Fragments of FAILE. At the same time, architectural forms and Iberian ornamental tradition were essential in constructing 2010's Temple project, a ruin featuring prayer wheels and cast relief work in Lisbon. Both elements‚Äîprojects in wood, and building environments‚Äîwere fused in producing an \\"obelisk\\" of printed/painted boxes in the atrium of the Koch Auditorium in New York's Lincoln Center in 2013. For much of the past decade, FAILE's work has been iterative, with outdoor and public installations informing studio- based work in an apparently dialogic way. Many of their gallery shows, for example, draw on the technical procedures developed for site-specific commissions and vice versa. While FAILE's projects are known for their high degree of finish, many seem to suggest the artistic process itself as a kind of content. As of 2019, FAILE consistently worked in a wide variety of formats, from European streetcars to tile-clad buildings in California. FAILE has also consistently produced artist's books (typically in partnership with German publisher Gestalten Verlag) including FAILE: Prints + Originals, 1999‚Äì2009 (2010), FAILE Temple (2012), and FAILE: Works on Wood: Process, Paintings, and Sculpture (2014). Cultural impact FAILE, like many of their contemporaries in the street art community, emphasize art making over indirect political statements or sloganeering, but their work often contains both passive and overt messages, usually cloaked in ambivalence. On the one hand, FAILE emerged from a graphic design sensibility and historically functions as a recognizable graphic presence as well as an artistic identity. Similarly, graffiti and street art have typically operated as a counterpublic artistic practice and means of garnering fame or status for \\"writers\\" and artmakers.Joe Austin, Taking the Train: How Graffiti Art Became an Urban Crisis in New York (New York: Columbia University Press, 2001). While there is not an explicitly partisan or anti-capitalist edge to this type of work, it is structurally a political act in its flouting of laws, embrace of punk-rock and hip-hop aesthetics, and function as a means of populist or direct to the masses expression. There also exists in graffiti and street art a deeper anti- establishment trend in its attempt to beautify and reclaim the urban environment, and blur the line between the elite art gallery systems and the \\"outside\\" world of the streets.Pedro Alonso, \\"Flipping the Tortilla,\\" in Spank the Monkey (Die Gestalten Verlag, 2006). FAILE certainly works in this tradition. Although they are not graffiti writers as such, their work originated in the streets, and their studio work bears the stylistic hallmarks of both wheatpasting/stenciling and the vernacular of the global urban environment. FAILE argues that, \\"our process has always resembled this loose and fast critique on society, whether it be literal or figurative. Our image- making has at times been very methodical and researched, other times it's been experimental and dirty. Street art at its roots is 'punk.' It set out to critique and comment on a world it felt outside of.\\"Jaime Rojo and Steven Harrington, \\"The Generational Shift in Street Art Culture,\\" The Huffington Post, 30 June 2010. Such a critique is sometimes ambivalent, as FAILE‚Äôs work is marked by the consistent juxtaposition of dualities. Other times, it is more direct, as in the seemingly explicit pictures in the Lost in Glimmering Shadows exhibition, or in the public wheatpasting in 2010 of images of kissing women amid the text \\"No Change Will My Heart Fear.\\" The latter echoes the ambivalent prompting of Banksy's noted \\"Kissing Coppers\\" wall painting, and is indicative of FAILE's consistent prioritization of ambivalence and open- endedness over more explicitly prescriptiveness. There are both socially and institution-critical strands in FAILE's work and its public or alternative- space staging and execution. FAILE's work is overarchingly characterized by an open approach that allows the interpretation and meaning of their work to ramify once it enters the public sphere. Of their outdoor work, FAILE argues that \\"it gives a person the sense that it is there just for them. That they've stumbled across this great little gem amidst the chaos of daily life that can really speak to them. We try to build in a certain ambiguity that leaves the door open for the viewer to find themselves within the story.\\"McCormick, op cit, 15. The openness of meaning and emphasis on the experience of the viewer marks a shared affinity with both the anti-elitist impulses of recent street art,Lewisohn, op cit, 106-135. and the more institutional ideas of site specificity and relational aesthetics. In 2010, FAILE expanded their painting and printing into the realm of reconstructed sculptural and architectural elements, religious artifacts (such as prayer wheels) and the 2010 Temple project in Lisbon. These projects reflect FAILE's concern that \\"everything that requires skill is disappearing from the world,\\" and that the Temple is \\"an expression of the crumbling beauty of this disappearing world.\\"FAILE, \\"Portugal Survey 2009 Ideation Review,\\" (Limited Circulation Proposal, 2010). This focus on public works was further developed in 2012 with the Eat With the Wolf sculpture in Ulaanbaatar; on the streets of Brooklyn and Los Angeles with the 104 N. 7th and other tile-based projects; in Times Square, Manhattan, with the large-scale, interactive prayer wheel (Wishing on You); and in a series interactive arcades that became a music venue in Detroit.

The song appeared on their 1993 album Phobia, the band's final LP. Background Ray Davies said of the song in a 1993 interview, \\"I think I kind of found my voice again on 'Only a Dream,' which I wrote on a plane to England after I decided that the album needed to have a little more humanity. It's odd that an artist who's supposed to have been around still gets intimidated by certain things, but I do, and I had to really get myself prepared to do that vocal. The night before I did, I went out and got rat-arsed drunk on wine. I was still shaking when I got to the studio the next morning, and I did the vocal in one take. It's only a pop song, but there's a lot of emotion in it and there's a lot of me in it.\\" =Lyrics= In the lyrics of \\"Only a Dream\\", the singer falls in love with whom he describes as \\"a young executive.\\" He doesn't expect her to \\"even look at [him] or bother to glance [his] way, but she actually smiled at [him] and said 'Hi-ya handsome, have a good day.'\\" He starts to wonder if the event was real or \\"only a dream.\\" On another day, the singer awaits his love to return, only to see her talking to another man, ignoring him entirely. He is crushed, but still wondering if the whole event was \\"only a dream.\\" Release and reception \\"Only a Dream\\" was first released as the sixth song on The Kinks' first Columbia album, Phobia. The album was not met with much success, not charting in Britain, and only hitting #166 in America. Despite the failure of the album, the track was released separately as a standalone single, backed with \\"Somebody Stole My Car\\" (another song from the Phobia album.) The single had minimal success, hitting #79 in Britain. A second single from Phobia, \\"Scattered\\", was advertised to follow up \\"Only a Dream\\", but was cancelled and eventually released in small quantities to collectors. One year later, Columbia Records dropped The Kinks. The song also appeared on the compilation album, Picture Book. =Music video= Like many other Kinks tracks of the era, a music video was shot for \\"Only a Dream.\\" Featuring both Ray Davies and Dave Davies, Ray Davies lip-synced the song.

Calculation of the O-score The Ohlson O-score is the result of a 9-factor linear combination of coefficient-weighted business ratios which are readily obtained or derived from the standard periodic financial disclosure statements provided by publicly traded corporations. Two of the factors utilized are widely considered to be dummies as their value and thus their impact upon the formula typically is 0. When using an O-score to evaluate the probability of company‚Äôs failure, then exp(O-score) is divided by 1 + exp(O-score). The calculation for Ohlson O-score appears below: : \\\\begin{align} T = {} & -1.32 - 0.407\\\\log(TA_t/GNP) + 6.03\\\\frac{TL_t}{TA_t} - 1.43\\\\frac{WC_t}{TA_t} + 0.0757\\\\frac{CL_t}{CA_t} \\\\[10pt] & {} - 1.72 X - 2.37\\\\frac{NI_t}{TA_t} - 1.83\\\\frac{FFO_t}{TL_t} + 0.285Y - 0.521\\\\frac{NI_t-NI_{t-1}}{NI_t + NI_{t-1}} \\\\end{align} where * TA = total assets * GNP = gross national product price index level * TL = total liabilities * WC = working capital * CL = current liabilities * CA = current assets * X = 1 if TL > TA, 0 otherwise * NI = net income * FFO = funds from operations * Y = 1 if a net loss for the last two years, 0 otherwise Interpretation The original model for the O-score was derived from the study of a pool of just over 2000 companies, whereas by comparison its predecessor the Altman Z-score considered just 66 companies. As a result, the O-score is significantly more accurate a predictor of bankruptcy within a 2-year period. The original Z-score was estimated to be over 70% accurate with its later variants reaching as high as 90% accuracy. The O-score is more accurate than this. However, no mathematical model is 100% accurate, so while the O-score may forecast bankruptcy or solvency, factors both inside and outside of the formula can impact its accuracy. Furthermore, later bankruptcy prediction models such as the hazard based model proposed by Campbell, Hilscher, and Szilagyi in 2011 have proven more accurate still. For the O-score, any results larger than 0.5 suggest that the firm will default within two years.

Early Life and Family Preston Pond was born in Hinsdale, New Hampshire on September 9, 1823. His parents were Dr. Preston Pond Sr., M.D. and Adeline Stebbins Wright. When he was a child his family moved to Jackson, Louisiana; where his father continued his medical profession. He grew up in a household with his parents, his four siblings and one slave. His three brothers ultimately all served in the Confederate States Army; Henry L. as 1st Lieutenant in the 16th Louisiana Infantry and Charles L. as Corporal in the 1st Louisiana Cavalry (later joined the 16th Louisiana Infantry and 10th Arkansas Infantry). The youngest, Dana B. Pond, served as Private in the 27th Louisiana Infantry till he was captured and paroled at Vicksburg and joined the Ogden Cavalry Battalion. Pond married Emelie Cooper (b. 1829) in 1846. In 1852 he married again, this time Adelaide Alice Woodward (1835 ‚Äì December 12, 1878). With Adelaide he had a single child, daughter Adelaide Jane Pond, born on October 22, 1856. Their household was completed by a young Irish immigrant girl, C. O'Shaughnessy. Leaning to a legal profession by 1850 Pond was admitted to the East Feliciana bar and practiced law in Jackson. By 1860 he had moved to Clinton, Louisiana and in addition to his practice he took up farming. Entering politics as a Know Nothing he was elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives for East Feliciana in 1851. In 1855 he ran for the U.S. Congress as candidate for Louisiana's 3rd congressional district, but he was defeated by Thomas G. Davidson. Pond also served in the Louisiana Militia as an officer in the 21st or \\"Parish East Feliciana\\" Regiment. By 1849 he attained the rank of Major, by 1860 he was the regiment's Colonel. Early Civil War When the American Civil War erupted and Louisiana seceded the Militia was organized into five divisions. Pond's 21st Regiment was part of the 3rd Division, and the Colonel was, in addition to his regimental duties, named divisional Inspector General on April 3, 1861. He traveled with his men to Camp Moore for training and reorganisation. On September 26, 1861, the 16th Louisiana Infantry Regiment was organized and mustered into Confederate service with a strength of 851 officers and men. When the regiment selected its own officers the men elected Pond to become their Colonel. He spent the next months training his men, drilled them 5 hours a day and gained a high reputation for his regiment. In November 1861 the 16th Infantry was ordered by General Mansfield Lovell to relocate to Camp Chalmette at Chalmette, Louisiana to be in proximity to New Orleans. Bad housing, inadequate supply, diseases and rigid camp discipline constantly thinned the ranks. When Confederate President Jefferson Davis asked Louisiana to provide additional forces for service in Tennessee in February 1862 the 16th Infantry was brigaded with the 17th, 18th and 19th Regiments; under the overall command of Brigadier General Daniel Ruggles. Sent to Corinth, Mississippi the brigade had to bear equally bad camp conditions as before. When Ruggles was elevated to division command in the Army of Mississippi the brigade was broken up and a new brigade formed as part of Ruggles' division in March. By virtue of seniority Pond now commanded a brigade composed of the 16th (under Maj. Daniel C. Gober), 18th and Crescent Louisiana Regiments as well as the Orleans Guard Battalion, the 38th Tennessee Infantry and an Alabamian artillery battery under Captain William H. Ketchum. By March 6, 1862, the regiment had an effective strength of 330 men.Aymond, pp. 30‚Äì32, 34. Battle of Shiloh In the morning on April 6, 1862, Pond‚Äôs Brigade formed the extreme left flank of the Confederate line. General Albert Sidney Johnston, commanding the Confederate forces on the field, ordered Pond to seize and hold the bridge over Owl Creek. Around 8:00 A.M., Pond sent the 38th Tennessee Infantry and the Crescent Regiment, supported by a gun section, to secure the bridge while the remaining portion of his brigade joined Ruggles‚Äôs advance toward McDowell Field. Pond‚Äôs Brigade successfully repulsed Colonel John McDowell‚Äôs brigade and occupied the federal camps on the Purdy Road, northwest of Shiloh Church. Sensing the enemy was in full retreat, Ruggles ordered the division to advance through Crescent Field to cut off their retreat. While Pond‚Äôs Brigade advanced it received several volleys of friendly fire from their right, which caused great confusion and led Pond to retreat several hundred yards and hold until the confederate line reformed. When the attack resumed Pond advanced through Sowell Field, stopping on a ridge in front of Tilghman‚Äôs Branch of Owl Creek. On the opposite bank Federal forces hastily organized a new defensive line and pounded Pond‚Äôs position with artillery fire. Around 4:00 p.m., Pond‚Äôs Brigade was ordered to advance and charge up the opposite ridge to break the Federal line. Pond protested, but finally had to order the brigade to attack. Casualties from enemy rifle and artillery fire as well as repeated friendly fire from the brigade‚Äôs right-rear disorganized the charge and forced the brigade to fall back from the Branch. Pond reformed his bloodied brigade and remained in position until nightfall; then he ordered his men to send out advanced pickets and sleep on arms. He positioned his brigade less than a mile from the river with his left flank holding Owl Creek. However, during the night the brigades to his right retreated several hundred yards to the rear without notifying Pond of their new position. Early on April 7, Pond‚Äôs Brigade was taken under sporadic rifle and artillery fire from enemy skirmishers close to 400 yards away. Realizing that the Confederate main battle line no longer protected his right flank, Pond quickly ordered his brigade to retreat and reform in accordance to the main line at the south end of Jones Field. General Ruggles ordered Pond‚Äôs Brigade to take its on the left like the day before. However, General Hardee ordered Pond to move his brigade in support of the extreme right of his battle line. After moving the brigade from the extreme left flank to its right flank, General P.G.T. Beauregard rode up and ordered Pond to advance against the Federal troops in a different location. However, before Pond could completely reposition the brigade, General Leonidas Polk ordered Pond to move the brigade to support his battle line. While moving the brigade, Beauregard again redirected Pond‚Äôs Brigade and ordered them to return immediately to Army headquarters near Shiloh Church. Upon reaching the church Pond‚Äôs Brigade and other hastily assembled units formed a rear guard to allow the army to retreat toward Corinth. In his report Pond reported that his brigade had total casualties of 597 men; 90 of them from his own 16th Louisiana.Aymond, pp. 35‚Äì37. Later life Under the new Conscription Act of April 1862, the 16th Infantry had to reorganize and reelect its officers. In the end Pond was not re-elected as Colonel, and he resigned his commission on May 8, 1862. Returning to his home in Clinton restarted farming and reopened his legal business. Simultaneously he also reentered politics, becoming a Louisiana State Senator for East Feliciana. In August 1863 Pond, as voice of Clinton's citizens, wrote a letter to the federal department commander condemning a speculated raid by irregular union forces in the vicinity of Port Hudson. While the federal commander, General Nathaniel P. Banks, acknowledged the receipt of the letter and stated that no such raid was planned he also made clear that the opinion of the citizenship of the rebellious state would be of no matter in this question. When on January 25, 1864 one of Pond's fellow officers, Brigadier General Henry Watkins Allen, became Governor of Louisiana Pond was appointed to his aides. On May 8 Pond wrote a letter to the Governor, condemning the actions of several regular and irregular confederate officers, who were accused of violent and criminal behaviour. Pond died on June 15, 1864, and is buried in Old Jackson Cemetery in Jackson, Louisiana.

The manuscript was commissioned by the King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia (that time also the King of the Romans) and made in Prague in the 1390s. The Wenceslas Bible is unique and very precious not only because of its text, which is one of the earliest German translations of the Bible, but also because of its splendid illuminations. This oldest German deluxe Bible manuscript remained uncompleted.  Historical context  Sophia The Wenceslas Bible contains the text of one of the earliest Bible translations into German. The translation from the Latin Vulgata was commissioned by the wealthy burgher of Prague Martin Rotlev about 1375‚Äì1380. Although Wenceslas' father Emperor Charles IV forbade Bible translations from Latin into vernacular languages as heresy in 1369, king Wenceslas with his second wife Sophia disrespected his father's order by their patronage of this spectacular edition of the new German Bible translation. Their own patronage confirms an inscription in the manuscript. It indicates the close relationship between the Bohemian royal court and the nascent Bohemian Reformation. The Wenceslas Bible was never completed. The Book of Daniel, the Minor Prophets and the Books of Maccabees are lacking from the Old Testament and the New Testament was not even begun. The Bible contains 654 miniatures and initials; some were only scratched. The scribe left free spaces for more than 900 other illustrations. If the Bible were completed, it would have comprised about 1,800 leaves with circa 2,000 illuminations and would accordingly have surpassed all other medieval manuscripts in length, dimensions and wealth of artistic ornament.

On June 9, 1950, she made history as the first woman to graduate from the chemical engineering program at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). She was also the only woman in the program at that time. Her graduation ceremony took place at the Civic Opera House. Early life Bey's did not come from an engineering background, though she believes that she inherited her unusually good long-term memory from her father. Neither of Bey's parents attended college. Bey experienced sexism since the day she was born; her mother made it clear to her that she had wanted a boy, in case the health problems in Lois Bey's older brother Roy prevented him from growing to adulthood. Bey's parents had traditional gender roles. At the age of twenty-one, Bey's mother set out to marry to avoid becoming a spinster. She composed a list of qualifications that she required in a husband, which included the ability to entertain. Bey's father Leroy Karl Bey was a pianist for Sophie Tucker and Ethel Merman at the time. Her mother persuaded him to propose within six months. During the Depression, Bey experienced more sexism when a black neighbor named Hemmie offered childcare services to her mother. She allowed Hemmie to take Lois but not her brother Roy because \\"I wouldn‚Äôt trust my son to strangers.\\" Despite the sexism, Bey enjoyed her time with the other neighborhood children because she could gain experiences that were not available at her home: books, parks, and zoos. Education A kindergarten teacher found Bey, at the age of four years, after her mother accidentally forgot her to assign someone to find her, in favor of her brother. The teacher found her unusually articulate and enrolled her in kindergarten a year early. She was very inquisitive and an avid reader, as a child, often asking questions about how things work. They moved to Chicago that year, so she had to take kindergarten again. Bey skipped another year in grammar school, so she graduated high school one month after she turned seventeen. She chose to attend Illinois Institute of Technology because the school had the most convenient location with the cheapest tuition. =Sexism in Engineering= Bey took IIT's entrance exam for engineering, despite her mother's warnings. She later reflected that \\"I was a stubborn child and ignored what she told me.\\" She was the only girl in a group of eleven high school graduates to take the exam. The other ten boys found out that they had failed, but they all knew that one fellow had been accepted into the scholarship. IIT had not sent her her score because of a \\"Clerical error‚Äù. Later, she learned that \\"... IIT was not going to give scholarship money to a woman who selected engineering because they knew she would never finish engineering, and she was only probably going to school to find a husband.\\" By the time the IIT accepted her, she did not have the money to attend. =History of IIT's Chemical Engineering Department= In 1901, the College of Engineering at IIT officially established a Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering. This department at IIT is one of the oldest chemical engineering programs in the United States. Charles W. Pierce earned one of the program's first chemical engineering degrees. He was one of the first African American chemical engineers in the nation. Forty-nine years later, Bey became the first woman to graduate from their chemical engineering program. Career > \\"I just hope that today‚Äôs young ladies don‚Äôt face the discrimination I faced > before college, during college and after college.\\" > ‚Äì Lois Bey Bey faced much discrimination as a female engineer. Many companies showed resistance towards hiring a woman as an engineer. Once she was hired, she had to leave a job due to the inequitable treatment she endured from her supervisor. She faced many of the same obstacles at two other companies. Bey began her career doing hands-on research in lab work. She gained experience with large industrial chemical equipment. Her job titles ranged from lab technician to assistant engineer. She started her career at Edwal Laboratories, and moved on to Underwriters Laboratories and the Armour Research Institute (now IIT Research Institute). In 1956, Bey became a sales engineer for F.M. De Beers, Assoc. where she sold and troubleshooted equipment. In 1960, Bey started working at Baxter Laboratories, during which she earned a master's degree in Library and Information Science. She combined both her degrees toward a career as an information specialist in the chemical research & development departments. In 1993, Bey retired from Stepan Chemical Company. After retirement. She was also an active member of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and the American Society of Information Science. Awards On September 2001, Dr. Ahmed Zewail, 1999 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, gave the Ralph Peck Memorial Lecture, to celebrate IIT's century of excellence in chemical engineering education and research. During this lecture, the chairman of the department, named Dr. Hamid Arastoopour, presented Lois Bey with the IIT Distinguished Alumni Award. It had a memorial plaque that read: \\"In recognition of her pioneering role as the first female graduate in chemical engineering at IIT, her commitment, and her contribution to the chemical engineering profession.\\" Societies Bey is a life member of the Society of Women Engineers. She was also a member of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and the American Society of Information Science. Patricia Brown, one of the past presidents of SWE, acknowledged Bey as a pioneer for all women engineers.

Prior to 2014, social movements opposed to Brazil hosting the Cup garnered support during the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2013. The Facebook group Movimento Anti- Copa de Decora√ß√£o de Ruas (Anti-Cup Movement for the Decoration of the Streets) gained more than 15,000 Likes in a little over a month. Timeline =Events prior to the World Cup= On January 25, 2014, protesters clashed with the military police in central S√£o Paulo. According to the organization's official Facebook account, 108 people were arrested by military police and a further 20 arrests were made by civil police, totaling 128 arrests before midnight. Graffiti in S√£o Paulo critical of the expenditures of the World Cup. On May 27, 2 protesters blocked the streets in central Bras√≠lia, near the Monumental Axis, caused traffic congestion. Among the protesters were 300 aboriginals who went to the capital to protest changes in laws concerning the demarcation of indigenous land. The protest ended in a confrontation with the military police, where a cavalryman was struck by an arrow. On May 31, 2014 protesters marched from the Ministries Esplanade to the football stadium before ending the demonstration peacefully. The following day, military police in S√£o Paulo began using specialized suits of armor referred to as 'Robocop', which were intended to maintain control over protests during the World Cup. On June 3, a group of about 50 protesters in Goi√¢nia gathered in front of the hotel where the Brazilian team was staying prior to an exhibition match against Panam√°. The protesters were connected with trade unions and left wing political groups, with pickets demanding fair pay for professors and health professionals. =Events during the World Cup= Arrest of protesters against the FIFA World Cup 2014 in S√£o Paulo The demonstrations of 2014 were generally smaller than those that occurred during the FIFA Confederations Cup in the previous year, but protesters and police clashed in almost every city hosting the games of the World Cup. In the first week of the Cup, there were more than 20 protests and 180 arrests across the various cities, many resulting in police action. On June 12, at least six were injured in S√£o Paulo when military police threw gas grenades and fired rubber bullets at protesters. Two CNN journalists were among those injured. Governor Geraldo Alckmin of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party justified the aggression of the military police saying that their goal was to prevent the protesters from blocking a major traffic artery leading to the football stadium. In Porto Alegre on June 24, around 200 protesters gathered in the city center and travelled toward the airport. The group was monitored by police, and disbursed with one protester being arrested for deflating the tires of a car. Protester holding a sign contrasting the quality of soccer stadiums with the quality of public services. In S√£o Paulo, June 23, an unidentified man in a black shirt fired a gun three times into the air as police were arresting a protester. Protesters say that the man was trying to scare away those critical of the arrest. Police said they would investigate whether the shooter was actually a member of the police. Three people were arrested during the act, among which Rafael Lusvarghi. On July 13, the final day of the Cup, police in Rio de Janeiro injured at least ten journalists with clubs, and shrapnel from tear gas grenades. Police kettled the 300 protesters, preventing them from marching to their destination, Maracan√£ Stadium. Military Police told BBC Brazil that they would forward reports of police abuse to Internal Affairs. Events Reasons of the protest continuation are pointed also by Rom√°rio, ex-player and member of the Parliament, that dubbed the World Cup 2014 as the \\"biggest theft in history\\", and that the real costs would be over R$100 billion (US$46 billion). Rom√°rio now is one of the few parliament members that wants a deeper investigation on the misuse of public funds. Before the opening game of the World Cup on 12 June, police clashed with protesters in S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and several other host cities. Tear gas was used on crowds in S√£o Paulo.

In Piedmont, it is raised in the Chiusella, Orco and Susa valleys, in the Metropolitan City of Turin. It is one of the forty-three autochthonous Italian goat breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep- and goat-breeders. At the end of 2013 the registered population was variously reported as 959 and as 856. Use The Valdostana is kept both for meat, which is consumed both fresh and preserved in the form of goat salame, of Motsetta or of Violino di Capra; and for milk, which is used for cheese- making. A study in 2002 found the average milk yield to be 249 kg in 197 days. In the Aosta Valley, it is also much used in the traditional sport of goat- fighting, the Bataille des ch√®vres.

Prior to this, he had served as a correspondent in Asia for the United Press and as a journalist in Alaska and Arkansas. He was also editor of the Las Vegas Review-Journal, a speech-writer for Paul Laxalt, editor of the Tucson Daily American, editor and publisher of the Lacey Leader (in Washington state) and chairman of the Nevada State Tax Commission. Valley Times On November 1, Brown purchased the Valley Times through his newly formed Las Vegas Valley Publishing Company. He then hired longtime Las Vegas journalists A.D. Hopkins and Bruce Hasley to lead his staff. The Valley Times aimed to cover the gaming industry heavily, viewing it as the political and business core of the Vegas community. Brown hired reporters to dig deep into the industry and top reporter Ned Day uncovered mob connections at the Argent-owned casinos of Stardust, Fremont, and Hacienda, which were run by Frank Rosenthal. He also uncovered Kansas City-based mob connections at Tropicana. Under Brown's leadership, the Valley Times became a \\"must read\\" for politicians and the gaming industry, despite its circulation being dwarfed by Las Vegas' other two daily papers. During the 1970s, the Valley Times entered into financial trouble. In an effort to keep the paper afloat, Brown sold his credibility to the mob. According to a 1979 expose by the Reno Evening Gazette, Brown switched the paper's editorial position in 1976 from criticizing the state government for not being hard enough on Rosenthal to supporting him. Governor Robert List accused Brown of attempting to extort him by promising to withhold unfavorable stories in exchange for a gaming license for Rosenthal. Brown denied the charge and List declined to aid the FBI in investigating the accusation. Brown also became involved in a fake advertising scheme that allowed Argent to launder money from its casinos back to the Chicago mob. Brown admit his involvement in the scheme, saying he participated to keep his paper in business. He later testified against ad man Jerry May who organized the scheme, and the prosecutor of the case called Brown \\"a pillar of the community.\\" Brown stopped paying payroll taxes. By July 1982, the paper owed $200,000 in back taxes and the IRS seized control of Times assets, including its buildings and printing presses. In 1983, Brown pleaded guilty to filing a false tax return in 1976 and underreporting both personal and corporate income in 1976 and 1977. Although he won the paper's assets back in court, Brown was not able to turn around the struggling business before his death. Death and legacy Brown died on June 8, 1984. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court trustee closed the Valley Times two weeks later, with the final issue being published on June 22. Stan Hunterton, who prosecuted the Argent mob case, remarked in 1984 that Brown \\"has devoted a large measure of his life to the public affairs of this state when any number of other pursuits would have been easier and more financially rewarding.\\" Writing for the Las Vegas Review-Journal in 2013, reporter Jane Ann Morrison reminisced, \\"Brown was one of those newsmen praised even today as lovable and a magnificent journalist.\\"  References  Category:1930 births Category:1984 deaths Category:20th-century American newspaper publishers (people) Category:Editors of Nevada newspapers Category:Journalists from California Category:People from Glendale, California ","title":"Bob Brown (newspaper publisher)"},{"id":"43038796","text":"Hypopta cinerea is a moth in the family Cossidae.

Cole (1833‚Äì1899), was a United States army officer, businessman, and politician from Rhinebeck, New York.  Early life  Cole was born on November 18, 1833, in Rhinebeck, New York. He was raised and educated in Rhinebeck and then worked at a lumberyard in New York City. Cole also supervised the building of a sugar cane factory in Cuba. In 1854, he moved to St. Louis, Missouri, and lived there working in a lumberyard.  Civil War  At the beginning of the American Civil War, Cole volunteered for the Union army. He became the captain of Company A, 5th Missouri Volunteer Infantry (3 months, 1861). While in this organization, he was severely wounded at the Battle of Wilson's Creek on August 10, 1861. Cole then served as a captain in the 1st Missouri Volunteer Infantry Regiment (3 Years Organization). He commanded Battery E, 1st Missouri Light Artillery at the Siege of Vicksburg. He was promoted major on August 12, 1863 and lieutenant colonel on October 4, 1863. In 1863 Cole was promoted to Colonel of the 2nd Missouri Light Artillery Regiment.  Indian Wars  At the end of the Civil War in 1865, Cole and eight batteries of his 2nd Missouri Artillery were sent to Omaha, Nebraska. There, he assumed command of the right, or eastern, column of the Powder River Expedition, which was to be a military expedition against the Sioux and Cheyenne Indians in Montana and Dakota Territory. Cole's column, which consisted mostly of cavalry and mounted artillery, started northwest on July 1, and crossed through present day Nebraska and South Dakota, before reaching the Powder River in Montana in late August 1865. At that time, Cole's men were low on supplies, and on September 1 they began skirmishing with Indian warriors who attacked the column. In early September, Cole began a withdrawal toward Fort Laramie, and was forced to abandon his wagons after hundreds of the columns' horses died, fighting the Powder River Battles along the way. The other columns encountered similar results, and the Powder River Expedition was deemed a failure. On November 18, 1865, (his 32nd birthday) Cole was mustered out of the Union army.  Later life  Cole moved back to St. Louis, Missouri and continued in the lumber business, eventually owning a planing mill. In 1868, with his business partner, Stephen Glass, Cole opened the Cole and Glass Manufacturing Company. Cole served on the St. Louis city council for six years, and was also a commissioner for Lawfayette Park.  Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War service  In May 1898, after the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Cole was commissioned a brigadier general in the United States army by President William McKinley, and he applied for active service in Cuba or the Philippines. He was instead assigned to command the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Division, Second Army Corps. The brigade was composed of four volunteer infantry regiments, the 1st Rhode Island Volunteer Infantry, 1st Delaware Volunteer Infantry, 2nd Tennessee Volunteer Infantry, and the 3rd Missouri Volunteer Infantry; it saw no action in the war. During the winter of 1898‚Äì99, while in command of his brigade at Columbia, South Carolina, Cole developed a serious cold. He was mustered out of the service of the United States for the last time in March 1899.  Death  Cole died from complications of his illness on July 31, 1899, in St. Louis, Missouri. He is buried in the Bellefontain Cemetery, in north St. Louis.

It has also provided assistance to numerous authoritarian regimes that have used state terrorism as a tool of repression. United States support for non-state terrorists has been prominent in Latin America, the Middle East, and Southern Africa. From 1981 to 1991, the United States provided weapons, training, and extensive financial and logistical support to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua, who used terror tactics in their fight against the Nicaraguan government. At various points the United States also provided training, arms, and funds to terrorists among Cuban exiles, such as Orlando Bosch and Luis Posada Carriles. Various reasons have been given to justify this support. These include destabilizing political movements that might have aligned with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, including popular democratic and socialist movements. Such support has also formed a part of the war on drugs. Support was often geared toward ensuring a conducive environment for American corporate interests abroad, especially when these interests came under threat from democratic governments.  Years of Lead  The Years of Lead was a period of socio-political turmoil in Italy that lasted from the late 1960s into the early 1980s. This period was marked by a wave of terrorism carried out by both right- and left-wing paramilitary groups. It was concluded that the former were supported by the United States as a strategy of tension. (With links to juridical sentences and Parliamentary Report by the Italian Commission on Terrorism) General , commander of the counter-intelligence section of the Italian military intelligence service from 1971 to 1975, stated that his men in the region of Venice discovered a right-wing terrorist cell that had been supplied with military explosives from Germany, and alleged that US intelligence services instigated and abetted right-wing terrorism in Italy during the 1970s. According to the investigation of Italian judge Guido Salvini, the neo-fascist organizations involved in the strategy of tension, \\"La Fenice, Avanguardia nazionale, Ordine nuovo\\" were the \\"troops\\" of \\"clandestine armed forces\\", directed by components of the \\"state apparatus related to the CIA.\\"Terrorists 'helped by CIA' to stop rise of left in Italy, The Guardian, March 26, 2001 Any relationship of the CIA to the terrorist attacks perpetrated in Italy during the Years of Lead is the subject of debate. Switzerland and Belgium have had parliamentary inquiries into the matter.\\"Belgian parliamentary report concerning the stay-behind network\\", named \\"Enqu√™te parlementaire sur l'existence en Belgique d'un r√©seau de renseignements clandestin international\\" or \\"Parlementair onderzoek met betrekking tot het bestaan in Belgi√´ van een clandestien internationaal inlichtingenetwerk\\" pp. 17‚Äì22 = Piazza Fontana bombing = Plaque in memory of the 17 victims of the terrorist bombing in Piazza Fontana The Piazza Fontana Bombing was a terrorist attack that occurred on December 12, 1969 at 16:37, when a bomb exploded at the headquarters of (National Agrarian Bank) in Piazza Fontana in Milan, killing 17 people and wounding 88. The same afternoon, three more bombs were detonated in Rome and Milan, and another was found undetonated. In 1998, Milan judge Guido Salvini indicted U.S. Navy officer David Carrett on charges of political and military espionage for his participation in the Piazza Fontana bombing et al. Salvini also opened up a case against Sergio Minetto, an Italian official of the U.S.-NATO intelligence network, and \\"collaboratore di giustizia\\" (Uncle Otto), who served as the CIA coordinator in Northeastern Italy in the sixties and seventies. The newspaper la Repubblica reported that Carlo Rocchi, CIA's man in Milan, was discovered in 1995 searching for information concerning Operation Gladio. A 2000 parliamentary report published by the center-left Olive Tree coalition claimed that \\"U.S. intelligence agents were informed in advance about several right- wing terrorist bombings, including the December 1969 Piazza Fontana bombing in Milan and the Piazza della Loggia bombing in Brescia five years later, but did nothing to alert the Italian authorities or to prevent the attacks from taking place.\\" It also alleged that Pino Rauti (current leader of the MSI Fiamma- Tricolore party), a journalist and founder of the far-right Ordine Nuovo (New Order) subversive organization, received regular funding from a press officer at the U.S. embassy in Rome. \\"So even before the 'stabilising' plans that Atlantic circles had prepared for Italy became operational through the bombings, one of the leading members of the subversive right was literally in the pay of the American embassy in Rome\\", the report says. US 'supported anti- left terror in Italy' , The Guardian, June 24, 2000 Paolo Emilio Taviani, the Christian Democrat co-founder of Gladio (NATO's stay-behind anti-Communist organization in Italy), told investigators that the SID military intelligence service was about to send a senior officer from Rome to Milan to prevent the bombing, but decided to send a different officer from Padua in order to put the blame on left-wing anarchists. Taviani also alleged in an August 2000 interview to Il Secolo XIX newspaper: \\"It seems to me certain, however, that agents of the CIA were among those who supplied the materials and who muddied the waters of the investigation.\\"Paolo Emilio Taviani, obituary by Philip Willan, in The Guardian, June 21, 2001 Guido Salvini said \\"The role of the Americans was ambiguous, halfway between knowing and not preventing and actually inducing people to commit atrocities.\\" According to Vincenzo Vinciguerra, the terrorist attack was supposed to push then Interior Minister Mariano Rumor to declare a state of emergency.

Following their seizure of power, the Sandinistas ruled the country first as part of a Junta of National Reconstruction, and later as a democratic government following free and fair elections in 1984. The Sandinistas did not attempt to create a communist economic system; instead, their policy advocated a social democracy and a mixed economy.LaFeber, p. 350LaFeber, p. 238Latin American Studies Association, p. 5 \\"Soviet posture in the Western Hemisphere\\" Carl G.

However, the U.S. administration viewed the leftist Sandinista government as undemocratic and totalitarian under the ties of the Soviet-Cuban model and tried to paint the Contras as freedom fighters. \\"Paris Defends Plan To Sell Arms To Managua\\" New York Times, Jan 9, 1982 \\"Ortega collects warm words of support on European trip.

The U.S. government explicitly planned to back the Contras, various rebel groups collectively that were formed in response to the rise of the Sandinistas, as a means to damage the Nicaraguan economy and force the Sandinista government to divert its scarce resources toward the army and away from social and economic programs.Grandin, p. 116 = Covert operations = The United States began to support Contra activities against the Sandinista government by December 1981, with the CIA at the forefront of operations.Hamilton & Inouye, \\"Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran-Contra Affair\\", p. 3 The CIA provided the Contras with planning and operational direction and assistance, weapons, food, and training, in what was described as the \\"most ambitious\\" covert operation in more than a decade.Hamilton & Inouye, \\"Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran-Contra Affair\\", p. 33\\"Reagan versus the Sandinistas: the undeclared war on Nicaragua\\", Thomas W. Walker, Westview Press, Aug 5, 1987, p. 25 One of the purposes the CIA hoped to achieve by these operations was an aggressive and violent response from the Sandinista government which in turn could be used as a pretext for further military actions.\\"Case Concerning Military and Paramilitary Activities in and Against Nicaragua (Nicaragua V. United States of America): Application instituting proceedings\\", Nicaragua, International Court of Justice, United States, David Macmichael testimony, p. 50 The Contra campaign against the government included frequent and widespread acts of terror. The economic and social reforms enacted by the government enjoyed some popularity; as a result, the Contras attempted to disrupt these programs. This campaign included the destruction of health centers and hospitals that the Sandinista government had established, in order to disrupt their control over the populace. Schools were also destroyed, as the literacy campaign conducted by the government was an important part of its policy. The Contras also committed widespread kidnappings, murder, and rape; several thousand people, mostly civilians, were killed, and many more \\"disappeared.\\" The kidnappings and murder were a product of the \\"low-intensity warfare\\" that the Reagan Doctrine prescribed as a way to disrupt social structures and gain control over the population. Also known as \\"unconventional warfare\\", advocated for and defined by the World Anti-Communist League's (WACL) retired U.S. Army Major General John Singlaub as, \\"low intensity actions, such as sabotage, terrorism, assassination and guerrilla warfare\\".\\"Inside the League: The Shocking Expos√© of how Terrorists, Nazis, and Latin American Death Squads Have Infiltrated the World Anti-Communist League\\", Scott Anderson, Jon Lee Anderson, Dodd, Mead, 1986, p. 120 In some cases, more indiscriminate killing and destruction also took place. The Contras also carried out a campaign of economic sabotage, and disrupted shipping by planting underwater mines in Nicaragua's Port of Corinto. The Reagan administration supported this by imposing a full trade embargo. A mug shot of Oliver North, who conducted covert operations in support of the Contras In fiscal year 1984, the U.S. Congress approved $24 million in aid to the contras. However, the Reagan administration lost a lot of support for its Contra policy after CIA involvement in the mining of Nicaraguan ports became public knowledge, and a report of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research commissioned by the State Department found that Reagan had exaggerated claims about Soviet interference in Nicaragua. Congress cut off all funds for the contras in 1985 with the third Boland Amendment. As a result, the Reagan administration sought to provide funds from other sources. Between 1984 and 1986, $34 million was routed through third countries and $2.7 million through private sources.Hamilton & Inouye, \\"Report of the Congressional Committees Investigating the Iran-Contra Affair\\", p. 4 These funds were run through the National Security Council, by Lt. Col. Oliver North, who created an organization called \\"The Enterprise\\" which served as the secret arm of the NSC staff and had its own airplanes, pilots, airfield, ship, and operatives. It also received assistance from other government agencies, especially from CIA personnel in Central America. These efforts culminated in the Iran-Contra Affair of 1986‚Äì1987, which facilitated funding for the Contras using the proceeds of arms sales to Iran. Money was also raised for the Contras through drug trafficking, which the United States was aware of. Senator John Kerry's 1988 Committee on Foreign Relations report on Contra drug links concluded that \\"senior U.S. policy makers were not immune to the idea that drug money was a perfect solution to the Contras' funding problems\\". = Propaganda = Throughout the Nicaraguan civil war, the Reagan government conducted a campaign to shift public opinion to favor support for the Contras, and to change the vote in Congress to favor of that support.Hamilton & Inouye, p. 5 For this purpose, the National Security Council authorized the production and distribution of publications that looked favorably at the Contras, also known as \\"white propaganda,\\" written by paid consultants who did not disclose their connection to the administration.Hamilton & Inouye, p. 5 It also arranged for speeches and press conferences conveying the same message.Hamilton & Inouye, p. 5 The U.S. government continually discussed the Contras in highly favorable terms; Reagan called them the \\"moral equivalent of the founding fathers.\\" Another common theme the administration played on was the idea of returning Nicaragua to democracy, which analysts characterized as \\"curious,\\" because Nicaragua had been a U.S.-supported dictatorship prior to the Sandinista revolution, and had never had a democratic government before the Sandinistas.Carothers, p. 97 There were also continued efforts to label the Sandinistas as undemocratic although the 1984 Nicaraguan elections were generally declared fair by historians.LaFeber, p. 310 Commentators stated that this was all a part of an attempt to return Nicaragua to the state of its Central American neighbors; that is, where traditional social structures remained and U.S. imperialist ideas were not threatened.Grandin, p. 88LaFeber, p. 15-19Carothers, p. 249 The investigation into the Iran-Contra affair led to the operation being called a massive exercise in psychological warfare. \\"Public Diplomacy and Covert Propaganda: The Declassified Record of Otto Juan Reich\\" The National Security Archive, 2 March 2001 The CIA wrote a manual for the Contras, entitled Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare ('), which focused mainly on how \\"Armed Propaganda Teams\\" could build political support in Nicaragua for the Contra cause through deceit, intimidation, and violence. The manual discussed assassinations. Footnote 105 The CIA claimed that the purpose of the manual was to \\"moderate\\" the extreme violence already being used by the Contras. Leslie Cockburn writes that the CIA, and therefore indirectly the U.S. government and President Reagan, encouraged Contra terrorism by issuing the manual to the contras, violating Reagan's own Presidential Directive. > The manual, Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare, clearly advocated > a strategy of terror as the means to victory over the hearts and minds of > Nicaraguans.

Out of Control: the story of the Reagan > Administration's secret war in Nicaragua, the illegal arms pipeline, and the > Contra drug connection, London: Bloomsbury, 1988, p. 7. = International Court of Justice ruling = The International Court of Justice in session In 1984 the Nicaraguan government filed a suit in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against the United States. Nicaragua stated that the contras were completely created and managed by the U.S. Although this claim was rejected, the court found overwhelming and undeniable evidence of a very close relationship between the Contras and the United States. The U.S. was found to have had a very large role in providing financial support, training, weapons, and other logistical support to the Contras over a lengthy period of time, and that this support was essential to the Contras. In 1984, the ICJ ordered the United States to stop mining Nicaraguan harbors, and respect Nicaraguan sovereignty. A few months later the court ruled that it did have jurisdiction in the case, contrary to what the U.S. had argued. The ICJ found that the U.S. had encouraged violations of international humanitarian law by assisting paramilitary actions in Nicaragua. The court also criticized the production of a manual on psychological warfare by the U.S. and its dissemination of the Contras. The manual, amongst other things, provided advice on rationalizing the killing of civilians, and on targeted murder. The manual also included an explicit description of the use of \\"implicit terror.\\" Having initially argued that the ICJ lacked jurisdiction in the case, the United States withdrew from the proceedings in 1985. The court eventually ruled in favor of Nicaragua, and judged that the United States was required to pay reparations for its violation of International law. The U.S. used its veto on the United Nations Security Council to block the enforcement of the ICJ judgement, and thereby prevented Nicaragua from obtaining any compensation. \\"Appraisals of the ICJ's Decision. Nicaragua vs United State (Merits)\\"  Cuban exiles  A memorial to Cubana Flight 455 The United States government provided support to several Cuban exiles after the Cuban Revolution in 1959, especially under the administration of George H. W. Bush. Among the most prominent of these were Orlando Bosch and Luis Posada Carriles, who were implicated in the 1976 bombing of a Cuban plane. Bosch was also held to be responsible for 30 other terrorist acts, while Carriles was a former CIA agent convicted of numerous terrorist acts committed while he was linked to the agency. Other Cuban exiles involved in terrorist acts, Jose Dionisio Suarez and Virgilio Paz Romero, two other Cuban exiles who assassinated the Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier in Washington in 1976, were also released by the administration of George H.W. Bush. = Orlando Bosch = Bosch was a contemporary of Fidel Castro at the University of Havana, where he was involved with the student cells that eventually became a part of the Cuban revolution. Miami Herald, 27 April 2011, \\"Prominent exile militant Orlando Bosch dead in Miami at 84, family says\\" However, Bosch became disillusioned with Castro's regime, and participated in a failed rebellion in 1960. He became the leader of the Insurrectional Movement of Revolutionary Recovery (MIRR), and also joined a CIA effort to assassinate Castro, along with Luis Posada Carriles. The CIA later confirmed that they had backed him as an operative. Kornbluh, Peter (9 June 2005) \\"The Posada File: Part II.\\" National Security Archive. He was the head of Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations, which the FBI has described as \\"an anti-Castro terrorist umbrella organization\\".

He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and released on parole in 1974. He immediately broke parole and traveled around Latin America. He was eventually arrested in Venezuela for planning to bomb the Cuban embassy there. The Venezuelan government offered to extradite him to the United States, but the offer was declined. He was released quickly and moved to Chile, and according to the US government, spent two years attempting postal bombings of Cuban embassies in four countries. Bosch eventually ended up in the Dominican Republic, where he joined the CIA effort to consolidate Cuban exile groups into the Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations (CORU). The CORU's operations included the failed assassination of the Cuban ambassador to Argentina, and the bombing of the Mexican Embassy in Guatemala City. Along with Posada, he worked with a CIA agent to plan the assassination of Letelier, which was carried out in September 1976. He was also implicated in the 1976 bombing of a Cuban plane flying to Havana from Venezuela in which all 73 civilians on board were killed, although Posada and he were acquitted after a lengthy trial. Documents released subsequently showed that the CIA had advance knowledge of the bombing. Kornbluh, Peter (5 October 2005) \\"Bombing of Cuban Jetliner\\" National Security Archive.

He then relocated to Venezuela, where he came into contact with Orlando Bosch.Bardach, Ann Louise. Cuba Confidential: Love and Vengeance in Miami and Havana. p180-223.

Political complications quickly arose when Cuba accused the US government of being an accomplice to the attack.

Peter Kornbluh described him as \\"one of the most dangerous terrorists in recent history\\" and the \\"godfather of Cuban exile violence.\\"  Colombian paramilitary groups  US General William P. Yarborough was the head of a counterinsurgency team sent to Colombia in 1962 by the US Special Warfare Center. Yarborough was one of the earliest proponents of \\"paramilitary ... and/or terrorist activities against known communist proponents\\". Colombian paramilitary groups were responsible for most of the human rights violations in the latter half of the ongoing Colombian conflict. The first paramilitary terrorist groups were organized by U.S. military advisers sent during the Cold War to combat leftist politicians, activists and guerrillas. According to several international human rights and governmental organizations, right-wing paramilitary groups were responsible for at least 70 to 80% of political murders in Colombia in a given year. HRW, 1996: \\"III: The Intelligence Reorganization\\" Paramilitary violence and terrorism there was principally targeted to peasants, unionists, indigenous people, human rights workers, teachers and left-wing political activists or their supporters. Lovisa Stannow (1996) \\"Social cleansing\\" in Colombia , MA Thesis, Simon Fraser University Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, \\"Colombia: Activities of a Colombian social cleansing group known as 'J√≥venes del Bien' and any state efforts to deal with it\\", 2 April 2004 =Plan Lazo= In October 1959, the United States sent a \\"Special Survey Team\\", composed of counterinsurgency experts, to investigate Colombia's internal security situation, due to the increased prevalence of armed communist groups in rural Colombia which formed during and after La Violencia. Three years later, in February 1962, a Fort Bragg top- level U.S. Special Warfare team headed by Special Warfare Center commander General William P. Yarborough, visited Colombia for a second survey.Livingstone, 2004: p. 155 In a secret supplement to his report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Yarborough encouraged the creation and deployment of a paramilitary force to commit sabotage and terrorist acts against communists: The new counter-insurgency policy was instituted as Plan Lazo in 1962 and called for both military operations and civic action programs in violent areas. Following Yarborough's recommendations, the Colombian military recruited civilians into paramilitary \\"civil defense\\" groups which worked alongside the military in its counter-insurgency campaign, as well as in civilian intelligence networks to gather information on guerrilla activity. Among other policy recommendations, the US team advised that \\"in order to shield the interests of both Colombian and US authorities against 'interventionist' charges, any special aid given for internal security was to be sterile and covert in nature.\\"Stokes, 2005: pp. 71-72 It was not until the early part of the 1980s that the Colombian government attempted to move away from the counterinsurgency strategy represented by Plan Lazo and Yarborough's 1962 recommendations.Stokes, 2005: p. 74 =Armed Forces Directive No. 200-05/91.= In 1990, the United States formed a team that included representatives of the U.S. Embassy's Military Group, U.S. Southern Command, the DIA, and the CIA in order to give advice on the reshaping of several of the Colombian military's local intelligence networks, ostensibly to aid the Colombian military in \\"counter-narcotics\\" efforts. Advice was also solicited from the British and Israeli military intelligence, but the U.S. proposals were ultimately selected by the Colombian military. The result of these meetings was Armed Forces Directive 200-05/91, issued by the Colombian Defense Ministry in May 1991. However, the order itself made no mention of drugs or counter-narcotics operations at all, and instead focused exclusively on creating covert intelligence networks to combat the insurgency. HRW, 1996: \\"Appendix A: Colombian Armed Forces Directive No. 200-05/91\\" Human Rights Watch concluded that these intelligence networks subsequently laid the groundwork for an illegal, covert partnership between the military and paramilitaries. HRW argued that the restructuring process solidified links between members of the Colombian military and civilian members of paramilitary groups, by incorporating them into several of the local intelligence networks and by cooperating with their activities. In effect, HRW believed that this further consolidated a \\"secret network that relied on paramilitaries not only for intelligence, but to carry out murder\\". Human Rights Watch argued that this situation allowed the Colombian government and military to plausibly deny links to or responsibility for paramilitary human rights abuses. HRW stated that the military intelligence networks created by the U.S. reorganization appeared to have dramatically increased violence, stating that the \\"recommendations were given despite the fact that some of the U.S. officials who collaborated with the team knew of the Colombian military's record of human rights abuses and its ongoing relations with paramilitaries\\". HRW stated that while \\"not all paramilitaries are intimate partners with the military\\", the existing partnership between paramilitaries and the Colombian military was \\"a sophisticated mechanism, in part supported by years of advice, training, weaponry, and official silence by the United States, that allows the Colombian military to fight a dirty war and Colombian officialdom to deny it.\\" HRW, 1996: \\"Conclusions and Recommendations\\" As an example of increased violence and \\"dirty war\\" tactics, HRW cited a partnership between the Colombian Navy and the MAS, in Barrancabermeja where: \\"In partnership with MAS, the navy intelligence network set up in Barrancabermeja adopted as its goal not only the elimination of anyone perceived as supporting the guerrillas, but also members of the political opposition, journalists, trade unionists, and human rights workers, particularly if they investigated or criticized their terror tactics.\\" =Los Pepes= In 1992 Pablo Escobar escaped from his luxury prison, La Catedral. Shortly thereafter, the Cal√≠ drug cartel, dissidents within the Medell√≠n cartel and the MAS worked together to create a new paramilitary organization known as Perseguidos por Pablo Escobar (\\"People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar\\", Los Pepes) with the purpose of tracking down and killing Pablo Escobar and his associates. The leader of the organization was Fidel Casta√±o.Livingstone, 2004: p. 159 Colombian Paramilitaries and the United States: \\"Unraveling the Pepes Tangled Web\\" , National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 243, National Security Archive, February 17, 2008 Scott, 2003: p. 88 The Cal√≠ cartel provided $50 million for weapons, informants, and assassins, with in hope of wiping out their primary rivals in the cocaine business.Kirk, 2003: pp. 156‚Äì158 Both Colombian and U.S. government agencies (including the DEA, CIA and State Department) provided intelligence to Los Pepes. The Institute for Policy Studies is searching for details of connections the CIA and DEA had to Los Pepes. They have launched a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act against the CIA. That suit has resulted in the declassification of thousands of documents from the CIA as well as other U.S. agencies, including the Department of State, Drug Enforcement Administration, Defense Intelligence Agency and the U.S Coast Guard. These documents have been made public at the website \\"Pepes Project\\"  Kosovo Liberation Army  Monument to Serbs killed by Kosovo Liberation Army in Mitrovica Staro Gracko massacre memorial The FR Yugoslav authorities regarded the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) as a terrorist group, using a web.archive.org copy of 2 April 2007 though many European governments did not. In February 1998, U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy to the Balkans, Robert Gelbard, condemned both the actions of the Yugoslav government and of the KLA, and described the KLA as \\"without any questions, a terrorist group\\".

The United States (and NATO) directly supported the KLA. The CIA funded, trained and supplied the KLA (as they had earlier trained and supplied the Bosnian Army). As disclosed to The Sunday Times by CIA sources, \\"American intelligence agents have admitted they helped to train the Kosovo Liberation Army before NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia\\". In 1999, a retired colonel said that KLA forces had been trained in Albania by former US military working for MPRI. James Bissett, Canadian Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Albania, wrote in 2001 that media reports indicated that \\"as early as 1998, the Central Intelligence Agency assisted by the British Special Air Service were arming and training Kosovo Liberation Army members in Albania to foment armed rebellion in Kosovo. ... The hope was that with Kosovo in flames NATO could intervene ...\\". According to Tim Judah, KLA representatives had already met with American, British, and Swiss intelligence agencies in 1996, and possibly \\"several years earlier\\".Judah, Tim (2002): Kosovo: War and Revenge. Yale University Press. New Haven, USA. p. 120 After the war, the KLA was transformed into the Kosovo Protection Corps, which worked alongside NATO forces patrolling the province.Council on Foreign Relations, Terrorist Groups and Political Legitimacy, 16 March 2006, prepared by Michael Moran In the following years, however, an ethnic Albanian insurgency emerged in southern Serbia (1999‚Äì2001) and in Macedonia (2001). The EU condemned what it described as the \\"extremism\\" and use of \\"illegal terrorist actions\\" by the group active in southern Serbia. Since the war, many of the KLA leaders have been active in the political leadership of the Republic of Kosovo.  Syrian civil war  Al Qaeda affiliated group Caucasus Emirate fighter firing a U.S. made BGM-71 TOW anti-tank missile. The United States has provided extensive lethal and non- lethal aid to many Syrian militant groups fighting against the Syrian government, an ally of Russia, during the Syrian civil war. Through operation Timber Sycamore, several billions dollars worth of weaponry were delivered to a wide array of Syrian Jihadist groups, many of which often fought alongside al-Qaeda's al-Nusra Front and ISIS. The Syrian government has directly accused the United States of sponsoring terrorism in Syria, despite videos of rebel fighters engaging in cannibalism and public executions circulating online. The United States government was also criticized by Iran for its silence following the beheading of a child by the Islamist group Nour al-Din al-Zenki, a group that is a recipient of US military aid and is accused of many war crimes by Amnesty International. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has also accused the United States of supporting ISIS in Syria, claiming Turkey has evidence of U.S. support for ISIS through pictures, photos, and videos, without further elaborating on said evidence. An investigation by journalists Phil Sands and Suha Maayeh revealed that rebels supplied with weapons from the Military Operations Command in Amman sold a portion of them to local arms dealers, often to raise cash to pay additional fighters. Some MOC-supplied weapons were sold to Bedouin traders referred to locally as \\"The Birds\\" in Lajat, a volcanic plateau northeast of Daraa, Syria. According to rebel forces, the Bedouins would then trade the weapons to ISIL, who would place orders using the encrypted WhatsApp messaging service. Two rebel commanders and a United Kingdom weapons monitoring organization maintain that MOC‚Äìsupplied weapons have made their way to ISIL forces. Another study conducted by private company Conflict Armament Research at the behest of the European Union and Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Internationale Zusammenarbeit found that external support for anti-Assad Syrian rebels \\"significantly augmented the quantity and quality of weapons available to [ISIL] forces,\\" including, in the most rapid case diversion they documented, \\"anti-tank weapons purchased by the United States that ended up in possession of the Islamic State within two months of leaving the factory.\\"  See also  *1985 Beirut car bombing *Allegations of United States support for the Khmer Rouge *Iran and state-sponsored terrorism *Israel and state-sponsored terrorism *Jundallah (Iran)#United States and Israel *Operation Condor *Operation Cyclone *Pakistan and state-sponsored terrorism *Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism *Saudi Arabia‚ÄìUnited States relations#Allegations of funding terrorism *Terrorism and the Soviet Union *United States and state terrorism *United States war crimes *State Sponsors of Terrorism (U.S. list)  References   Sources   * * Category:Foreign relations of the United States Category:Terrorism committed by the United States Category:State-sponsored terrorism Category:Nicaraguan Revolution Category:Presidency of Ronald Reagan Category:Terrorism in Cuba Category:Opposition to Fidel Castro Category:Cuba‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Central Intelligence Agency operations Category:CIA activities in the Americas ","title":"United States and state-sponsored terrorism"},{"id":"43038855","text":"Haruspex bivittis is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

Current work Ernie and Erica now spend their time touring the world teaching workshops on how to build these energy-efficient, natural heaters. They are also working to design and build a stove that will get an Underwriters Laboratory (UL (safety organization)) listing, which would eliminate insurance issues. The Wisners helped write the building code for Portland. In 2013, they were featured in a four-DVD film series produced by Paul Wheaton. The films cover a workshop, and are titled Fire Science, Sneaky Heat, Boom Squish, and Hot Rocket. Village Video produced a film with Ernie and Erica called How To Build Rocket Mass Heaters in which they again teach how to build and maintain these heaters.

The game was originally planned to be released on the PlayStation 4 in 2015, but was delayed, along with the film, to April 2016 in order to give the film a better marketing campaign and the game additional polish time.

Clank is attached to Ratchet like a backpack, performing several functions, such as allowing diving in water, gliding through the use of propellers, and on occasion, acting as a jetpack to allow flight. Clank's gameplay sections are drastically different, even though the premise of navigating environments and the controls remain the same. Clank is not equipped with weapons; instead, he utilizes punches to defeat enemies. Clank's gameplay sections mostly revolve around solving environmental puzzles, rather than defeating enemies.

Bolts, which are found in crates, dropped by defeated enemies and given as rewards, act as currency. Crates also contain health and ammunition. Items are used in several different ways.

Plot Prisoner Shiv Helix is being moved to a joint cell with the newly imprisoned Captain Qwark. As he is a huge fan of Qwark, he reveals that a game is being made based on his last adventure. Eager for attention, Qwark agrees to tell Shiv his side of the story. On planet Veldin, Ratchet, a young Lombax who works as a mechanic, dreams of joining the Galactic Rangers. While he quickly passes the physical exam, his criminal past convinces Qwark to reject him personally. Meanwhile, in a factory on planet Quartu, Chairman Alonzo Drek oversees the construction of a mechanical army built by Dr. Nefarious, an evil scientist who was previously defeated by the Rangers and was presumed dead. However, a defective warbot manages to escape using a stolen ship. After the ship crashes on Veldin, Ratchet rescues the defect, who explains that he needs to warn the Galactic Rangers of Drek's plans. Ratchet names him \\"Clank\\" and offers to take him to the Ranger Headquarters on planet Kerwan. Traveling to Kerwan, they discover that Drek's invasion is already in progress. The duo successfully foil an attempt by the invaders to destroy the Hall of Heroes with a train loaded with explosives. As a reward for their assistance, Qwark reluctantly allows them to join the Rangers. As new Rangers, the duo lead many successful operations, but Qwark soon becomes jealous of Ratchet, whose popularity starts to overshadow his own fame. Qwark calls a meeting of the Rangers where he proposes an assault on Drek Industries on Quartu. They access Drek's files and discover that Drek plans to use the Deplanetizer, a weaponized space station created by Nefarious, to destroy several planets so that he can combine their remains into an artificial world for his people. Learning that the next target is Novalis, Qwark goes to negotiate with Drek while the other Rangers battle his forces outside the station. During the fighting, Ratchet enters the Deplanetizer and tries to shut it down, but Drek captures him. While being dragged away, Ratchet discovers that Qwark has been working with Drek. Drek then seals Ratchet in an escape pod and ejects him into space as the Rangers witness the destruction of Novalis. For several weeks, the loss of Qwark's leadership cripples the Rangers. Ratchet returns to Veldin and decides to take the blame and quit. Clank urges him to reconsider, as Drek is preparing to destroy their final target: planet Umbris. Clank reveals that Umbris' destruction will destroy countless other worlds due to a rare orbital convergence, and Ratchet realised that Nefarious was the true mastermind. Angered by his defeat at the hands of the Rangers, Nefarious has been manipulating Drek and using his resources to destroy the galaxy. With his confidence restored, Ratchet rejoins the Rangers and heads to planet Kalebo III, where he retrieves a Holo-Guise after winning a race championship. Using the Holo-guise, Ratchet disguises as Qwark and infiltrates the Deplanetizer. The plan is to remove the gravity stabilizer used to hold the Deplanetizer over its target, so that the Rangers can use high-powered magnets to drag it away from Umbris and prevent the planet's destruction. An increasingly disillusioned Qwark confronts Drek for breaking his promise not to attack the Rangers any further. Nefarious arrives and mocks Qwark for his treason before sending him away, and betrays Drek by turning him into a sheep and ejecting him away. Meanwhile, Ratchet, disguised as Qwark, successfully removes the gravity stabilizer and defeats Qwark who tries to stop them. Realizing the error of his ways, Qwark appoints Ratchet as the new leader of the Rangers and instructs Ratchet to arrest Nefarious but Nefarious resists and shoots at Qwark. The Rangers deploy the magnets and drag the Deplanetizer sideways. Nefarious manages to fires the Deplanetizer, but the blast misses Umbris completely. Enraged, he drops into a giant Mech and flies to a dwarf star with the intention of triggering a supernova that would destroy the whole system. Ratchet destroys the mech, causing Nefarious and his suit to fall into the star and combust spontaneously. With the Deplanetizer disintegrating from the heat of Umbris's atmosphere, Ratchet, Clank, and Qwark use a teleporter to escape seconds before it explodes. In the present, Qwark and Helix are picking trash near the Hall of Heroes. While looking at a statue of himself, Ratchet and Clank greet Qwark. Seizing the opportunity, Helix seizes a gun, destroys several patrol bots, steals Ratchet's ship and escapes. As the duo prepare to go after him, Ratchet asks Qwark if he would like to come along, which he gladly accepts. Development Ratchet & Clank was announced during Sony's press conference at E3 2014. Insomniac Games' California and North Carolina studios cooperated on its development. Several developers from the first game, such as long time design director Brian Allgeier, returned for the remake. The game was originally slated for release in 2015, but was delayed into 2016 to tie-in with the film's release. Players who pre-ordered the game received access to an additional weapon, the Bouncer, which was featured in Going Commando and Up Your Arsenal. On 11 January 2016, it was confirmed that the game would release in France on 15 April 2016, the rest of Europe on 20 April 2016, and the United Kingdom on 22 April 2016. Unlike the original Ratchet & Clank, the remake runs at a frame rate of 30-frames-per-second.Makuch, Eddie (June 11, 2015). \\"PS4's Ratchet & Clank Runs at 1080p/30fps, Is About 10-12 Hours Long\\". GameSpot. Retrieved June 9, 2016. The game was in parallel development with the film and shared the same character models, environments, animation and some writing. For example, Insomniac would send Rainmaker a 3D character model or environment, and Rainmaker would send Insomniac its slightly altered version for use in the game, so there would be parity between the pieces. Most of the assets in the film and video game had been touched between the two parties, and in some cases, Insomniac would try to match a movie scene as closely as possible in-game. The film and game used the same color-correction tools.J. Seppala, Timothy (March 12, 2016). \\"How 'Ratchet and Clank' preserves history by starting over\\". Engadget. Retrieved June 27, 2016. Reception According to the review aggregation website Metacritic, Ratchet & Clank received \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Chris Carter of Destructoid praised the characters, pacing, and varied gameplay, saying that he would welcome future Ratchet & Clank games after previously thinking that the series had run out of steam. Spencer Campbell of Electronic Gaming Monthly summarized his thoughts with: \\"Ratchet & Clank is a return to form for the series, but anyone looking for something more than that may be disappointed. The game tugs on many of the original's addictive strings, but is also bogged down by a few slower, more passive segments.\\" Game Informers Andrew Reiner particularly commended the game's visuals, specifically praising the amount of action on the screen at once and the designs of the environments. Even though Reiner thought the soundtrack was \\"quite good\\", he did find some of the dialogue \\"cringe inducing\\". Reiner made positive comments about the gameplay, with his only criticism of it being that the sections not focusing on fast-paced action break up the flow of the game. Ultimately, Reiner said that he \\"couldn't put the game down\\". Game Revolution's Jeb Haught gave the game a positive review, praising the \\"outstanding\\" visuals, \\"funny\\" storyline, \\"addictive\\" gameplay, and \\"intuitive\\" controls. Cassidee Moser of GameSpot cited the humor, gameplay variety, weapons and gadgets, controls, and graphics as positives but criticized the story for feeling \\"under-developed\\". Lucas Sullivan from GamesRadar summarized his review with: \\"Despite some wonky tie-ins with the film, this is a gorgeous, thoroughly great platformer and a worthy reboot for Ratchet & Clank.\\" IGN's Marty Sliva wrote: \\"Ratchet and Clank is a culmination of everything Insomniac has done with the series over the past 14 years.\\" Sliva complimented the \\"absolutely gorgeous\\" visuals, \\"rewarding\\" upgrading systems, \\"charming\\" story, and \\"creative\\" weapons. Philip Kollar for Polygon wrote: \\"I'd stop short of saying that the new Ratchet & Clank is exactly what every fan of the series wants. It's a bit less sprawling in terms of hard numbers ‚Äî fewer planets, fewer weapons and so on ‚Äî but the sheer variety and polish prevents this excellent reboot from being dragged down too far. There's enough here to make longtime fans happy, but perhaps more importantly for Insomniac and the franchise's future, it should win over plenty of new fans as well.\\" VideoGamer.com's Tom Orry summarized his review with: \\"Ratchet & Clank is an easy recommendation. It's great fun, looks lovely, plays well and almost serves as a palate cleanser to the usual video game releases. Newcomers to the series will likely find a fresher experience (even though it's a proper remake, familiarity does creep in), but fans will love what Insomniac has done here. A remake done right in a series that rarely puts a foot wrong.\\" =Sales= Ratchet & Clank became the best-selling retail game in the UK in its week of release.

It was destroyed in 1690 by Abenaki and French forces at the Battle of Fort Loyal. The fort was rebuilt in 1742 and renamed Falmouth Fort before King George's War and rearmed again in 1755 for the French and Indian War. The fort was rebuilt a final time in 1775 for the American Revolution.Robert B. Roberts, Encyclopedia of Historic Forts: The Military, Pioneer, and Trading Posts of the United States, Macmillan: New York, 1988, 10th printing, , page 367 The peninsula was first colonized by the English in 1632 as a fishing and trading village named Casco. When the Massachusetts Bay Colony absorbed the Province of Maine in 1658, the town's name changed to Falmouth. In 1676, the village was destroyed by the Abenaki during King Philip's War. English colonists returned two years later when peace resumed. Fort Loyal was built in 1678 in the center of Portland at the foot of present-day India Street to protect the town from future attacks. In 1690 Fort Loyal consisted of four wooden blockhouses and eight guns. During King William's War, a raiding party of French and Native allies destroyed the English settlement and massacred its inhabitants in the Battle of Fort Loyal (1690). At the end of the conflict Massachusetts did not rebuilt the fort, instead building Fort Casco in Falmouth. The fort was rebuilt in 1742 and renamed \\"Falmouth Fort\\" before King George's War and then rearmed during the French and Indian War in 1755.William Willis, History of Portland, 431. Reverend Thomas Smith described the 1759 celebration at the fort in Falmouth upon the arrival of news that Quebec had fallen: \\"The cannon were fired at the fort yesterday and today. Mr. Mayhew's house was illuminated, and small arms fired in the evening, upon further and more authentic news of the victory at Quebec.\\"The last mention of the fort I could find: W.M. Willis, Journals of the Rev. Thomas Smith and the Rev. Samuel Deane(Portland: 1849), 74. Earthworks were constructed on the Fort Loyal site in 1775 as part of harbor defenses during the American Revolution and known as the \\"Lower Battery.\\" Elements from earlier iterations of the fort, such as the guard house, were still in use. The bluff on which the fort had been located was leveled off during the construction of the Grand Trunk Railway in the 1850s. Today the fort's location is memorialized by a plaque on the Grand Trunk Office Building at the corner of India and Thames Streets in Portland.Nathan Goold, \\"Falmouth Neck in the Revolution\\" in Collections and Proceedings of the Maine Historical Society, second series, vol.

(c.1900) August Friedrich Johann Kraus (9 July 1868, Ruhrort - 8 February 1934, Berlin) was a German sculptor.  Life  He was the son of a coachman. In 1877, the family moved to Baden-Baden where he became an apprentice to a headstone sculptor. His family moved again in 1883, this time to Strasbourg, and he continued his studies at the municipal Arts and Crafts School. From 1887 to 1891, he was enrolled at the Prussian Academy of Art in Berlin, where he studied with Ernst Herter. For the next seven years, he was a Master Student of Reinhold Begas and continued to work under his influence for some time after.Uta Lehnert: Der Kaiser und die Siegesallee. R√©clame Royale, Dietrich Reimer Verlag, Berlin 1998, . In 1900. his work on the Siegesallee (Victory Avenue) project won him the Academy's \\"Staatspreis\\", which included a stipendium for five years of study in Rome. This enabled him to break away from his artistic and financial dependence on Begas. Once there, his style took a turn towards Neoclassicism.Boy with a Goat (1926-28) Upon his return, he became a member of the Berlin Secession and served as its Vice-President from 1911 to 1913.August Kraus. In: Thieme-Becker, Allgemeines Lexikon der Bildenden K√ºnstler von der Antike bis zur Gegenwart. Vol.21, E. A. Seemann, Leipzig 1927, pg.444 He was Director of the Rauch-Museum from 1914 to 1920. The Sculptors' Association of Berlin elected him its first President. His work was part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics. After the Nazi Machtergreifung in 1933, he signed a Declaration of Loyalty to Hitler and became a member of the Presidential Council of the Reichskulturkammer.Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, Pg.334. That same year, he was appointed chairman of the Department of Fine Arts in a newly \\"cleansed\\" Academy and served as Provisional President until his death.Membership Databank of the Academy It has been reported that he died at the exact moment his statue of Henry the Child in the Siegesallee was being damaged by a storm, but this is probably apocryphal.

It was destroyed near the end of the World War I. *1900-1901: Figures in the Siegesallee, Berlin. Kraus was the youngest sculptor to work on the project. He was closely assisted and supervised by Reinhold Begas and produced two sets of figures: : _Group 9_ , consisting of Henry II, Margrave of Brandenburg- Stendal (also known as \\"Henry the Child\\") in the central position, flanked by side figures of Wartislaw IV, Duke of Pomerania and Wedigo von Plotho, a 14th Century knight, for which his friend Heinrich Zille was the model. : _Group 32_ , with Wilhelm I as the central figure, flanked by Helmut von Moltke and Otto von Bismarck. There is some disagreement over the extent of Begas' contributions to this group. *1910: Statue of Heinrich Lanz, on the premises of Heinrich Lanz AG in Mannheim. *1926-28: \\"Knabe mit Ziege\\" (Boy with a Goat), in the Savignyplatz, Berlin. *1928: \\"Gefallenen-Denkmal\\" (Memorial to the Fallen), in the Hohenzollernpark in Anklam. *1929: The tomb of Heinrich Zille, S√ºdwestkirchhof Stahnsdorf.

Career  Nasr is mentioned as having served under Yazid ibn Hatim al- Muhallabi while the latter was governor of Egypt (762‚Äì769); he was sent to put down a revolt at Sakha in 767 and was wounded during the fighting. He subsequently made his way to Ifriqiya, where according to al-Nuwayri he became well-liked and developed a reputation for good conduct. During the governorship of the infirm Rawh ibn Hatim al-Muhallabi (788‚Äì791), Nasr was secretly appointed by the caliph Harun al-Rashid as Rawh's successor, after the local postmaster informed Harun of Rawh's condition and urged him to preselect a replacement. Upon Rawh's death in early 791, his son Qabisah was initially proclaimed as his successor, but Nasr was recognized as governor after the postmaster delivered Harun's appointment letter to him. Nasr's governorship lasted for approximately two years and seems to have proceeded without incident. His administration was brought to an end, however, after Rawh's son al-Fadl travelled to Harun's court and convinced the caliph to appoint him over Ifriqiya instead. Following his dismissal, Nasr appears to have remained in Ifriqiya until the death of al-Fadl, whereupon he and other Muhallabids were expelled from the province by 'Abdallah ibn al-Jarud. According to al-Ya'qubi, Nasr was briefly appointed as the governor of Arminiya in ca. late 790s, but was dismissed shortly after.

He then represented France in Italy, where he organized the newly formed republics. During the First French Empire he was prefect of the Scheldt department, and then Minister of Finance in Spain under Joseph Bonaparte. Faipoult was prefect of Sa√¥ne-et-Loire during the Hundred Days. Early years Guillaume-Charles Faipoult de Maisoncelle, was born in Paris on 4 December 1752, son of a noble family of Champagne. His parents were Charles Faipoult de Maisoncelles, lord of Fays and of Trois-Fontaines-la-Ville, Marne (died 1761), and Marie Aubert (died 1754). He studied at the Royal School of Engineers at Charleville-M√©zi√®res, where Lazare Carnot was his fellow pupil, and graduated as a lieutenant of the engineers. He was promoted to captain, but resigned in 1780 after having been refused permission to fight for the independence of the English colonies in America. He then devoted himself to the study of the sciences. French Revolution Faipoult was a partisan of the French Revolution, and a member of the Jacobins society. In 1792 he was appointed secretary-general of the Ministry of the Interior under Jean-Marie Roland. The next year he was forced out of office by a decree of the National Convention that banished all former nobles from Paris. He was not able to return until after the Thermidorian Reaction of 9 Thermidor II (27 July 1794). On 10 Vend√©miaire III (1 October 1794) Faipoult was named Minister of Finance, and held this position until 24 Pluvi√¥se IV (13 February 1796). It was under his administration that the pledges of assignats were broken. Italy Germaine Faipoult de Maisoncelle and her daughter Julie by Serangeli circa 1799 by Gioacchino Giuseppe Serangeli Faipoult was then sent as minister plenipotentiary to the Republic of Genoa, where he destroyed the influence of the agents of Austria and England and gained the confidence of Bonaparte. He was minister plenipotentiary to Genoa in years IV to VI. While in Genoa during the transition from the rule of the oligarchy to the Ligurian Republic in June 1797 he came into conflict with Jean Lannes, the future Marshall. Lannes' blunt speech threatened to undo Faipoult's diplomacy. Lannes accused Faipoult with meddling in military affairs. Napoleon had to intervene to smooth out the dispute. Napoleon wanted to take Faipoult on the expedition to Egypt. However he was charged in turn with missions to Milan, Rome and Naples, which kept him in Italy. Failpoult was commissioner of the French government in Italy from years VI to VII. He organized most of the small republics that were founded at that time. His quarrel with Jean √âtienne Championnet in Naples were denounced by Bertrand du Calvados, and he was forced to go into hiding until the coup of 18 Brumaire VIII (9 November 1799). First Empire Bonaparte named Faipoult Prefect of the Scheldt department on 9 March 1800. He was made a member of the Legion of Honour on 25 Prairial XII (14 June 1806). Accusations of negligence reached Napoleon, who dismissed him on 18 September 1808. The accusations proved false. Joseph Bonaparte, then king of Spain, compensated him with the position of his Minister of Finance. Faipoult did not return to France until 1813. During the Hundred Days of 1815 when Napoleon returned to power, Faipoult was prefect of Sa√¥ne-et-Loire from 7 May to 30 July 1815. He defended M√¢con against the allies. He opened the gates of the city of Macon to the Austrians when authorized by Marshal Louis-Gabriel Suchet. Faipoult was then arrested, and retired to Belgium. He returned to Paris in 1816. Guillaume- Charles Faipoult died in Augy, Yonne, on 8 October 1817. He was survived by one daughter, who was married to the baron Louis de S√©ganville, a colonel of the hussars, commander of the 2d Hussar regiment.

Biography  Barraud was born at La Chaux-de-Fonds, eldest of several brothers,The best known of the others were Fran√ßois-Emile Barraud, Aur√®le Barraud and Aim√© Barraud (WorldCat: Catalogue of joint exhibition at the Mus√©e Rath, Geneva, 1945) the sons of an engraver of watchplates, at least four of whom became artists. Between 1910 and 1914 Charles followed an apprenticeship as an engraver while attending the art school of La Chaux-de- Fonds in the evenings, as did his brothers. When his father became ill in 1918 he worked with his brothers in the local workshops, then spent some time in Geneva with Albert Locca. In 1921 he was awarded a state scholarship in fine arts. In 1926 he opened a picture framing business and married his first wife, Jeanne Pellet (known as Janeb√©). Their daughter Marie-Louise (Malou) was born in 1930. After some time spent in Tunisia in 1935 he obtained a second state grant in 1936 and in the following year visited Algeria. From 1940, when he moved to Areuse, he had several very productive years before moving to Cortaillod in 1946. In 1951, he married his second wife, Paulette K√ºhni. In the same year he took part in a joint exhibition of works by the four Barraud brothers in Paris (repeated in 1961 at La Chaux-de-Fonds) and bought a house in Blauzac. After several exhibitions, including a retrospective at the Mus√©e des beaux-arts of La Chaux-de-Fonds in 1958, he made another visit to Algeria in 1973 and to Tunisia in 1989.

The band released 2 vinyl singles and a vinyl EP in its time and is considered a very seminal and influential group as its members went on to play in many successful Australian bands over the next 25 years. History Australian Musicologist, Ian McFarlane writes that \\"The Proton Energy Pills comprised Dave Curley (vocals), Lenny Curley (guitar), Jay Curley (bass), Stewy Leadfinger Cunningham (guitar) and Richie Lewis (drums). Proton Energy Pills derived their name from American cartoon series Roger Ramjet (the proton energy pills gave Ramjet his extraordinary strength). The band played a form of heavy retro-grunge that drew on US bands like Blue Oyster Cult, MC5 and Mudhoney for inspiration. Local bands that the Pills aspired to included Radio Birdman, The Celibate Rifles and The New Christs. Sydney independent label Waterfront issued two Proton Energy Pills singles, \`Survival'/\`Symmetry' (September 1989) and \`(Less than I) Spend'/\`Strawberry Patch' (March 1990), and the mini-album Proton Energy Pills(September 1990).\\" The band formed whilst most of its members were at school in Wollongong and learnt how to play at parties covering their favourite songs by bands like The Ramones, The Stooges, Flamin Groovies and Radio Birdman. Their first gig took place on 15 August 1987 at the Wollongong Ironworkers Club and the band became known for their long hair and super distorted sounds. Later the band would start to play in Sydney more regularly and would take on Steve Pavlovic as their manager and sign with Waterfront Records and release two influential 7\\" singles. The Proton Energy Pills supported for Dinosaur Jr on NSW and Victorian legs their first Australian tour in 1989 and J Mascis produced the A-side of the Protons 2nd single - a song called Less than I Spend. Both singles sold very well and made it to the top of the Sydney Independent Charts at the time. The band also scored the Australian tour support for US band Mudhoney in their first visit to Australia in early 1990. Proton Energy Pills also played with P.I.L., The Buzzcocks, Rollins Band and The Hoodoo Gurus and supported many of their local heroes including The Celibate Rifles, The Hitmen, Hard-ons and Lime Spiders. The Protons split up in mid 1990 citing musical differences after the recording of a 5 track 12\\" EP at Sydney's Electric Avenue Studios with Phil Punch and Kent Steedman from the Celibate Rifles producing. Postscript Following the split of the band, members of the Proton Energy Pills went on to play in many successful bands including Brother Brick, Zambian Goatherders, Tumbleweed, Leadfinger, Asteroid B-612 and Challenger-7, The Yes-Men, Richie & the Creeps, Brut 66 and The Pink Fits. Despite their limited output, the significance of the band would come to light in hindsight and they came to be considered a pre-grunge seminal act that paved the way for an 'unearthing' of underground rock in Australia in the 1990s. In their hometown of Wollongong, 'the Protons' (as they are known) played many all-ages gigs mostly due to the philosophy of frontman David Curley who in his role as youth social worker with Wollongong Council was very committed to engaging the region's youth in music and art. As a result, the band are revered for inspiring many young people to pick up instruments and form bands. In 2007, Spanish Label Bang! Records released a gatefold CD retrospective of the band's music including extensive liner notes on the band's history and impact. The band also featured on Tales From the Australian Underground retrospective which was released in 2006 on Feel Presents Record Label, the following quote on the significance of The Proton Energy Pills is taken from that release: The Proton Energy Pills were an allegiance of brothers Jay, Lenny and Dave Curley and schoolyard friends Richard (Richie) Lewis and Stewart Cunningham. At the helm was Stewart, a whiz kid guitarist and gifted songwriter who, along with singer and eldest brother Dave, wrote nearly all the band's material including Less Than I Spend(Waterfront, March 1990) the band‚Äôs second single. Produced by J Mascis (the singer/guitarist for proto grunge group Dinosaur Jr) and featuring Bill Gibson (the one time backing vocalist for the Lime Spiders and The Eastern Dark), ‚ÄúLess Than I Spend‚Äù by The Proton Energy Pills is a terrific track. Arguably the last great 7‚Äù in a lineage of Australian rock‚Äôn‚Äôroll that had dated right back to Radio Birdman and their landmark November 1976 release Burn My Eye. Internal friction however meant that the band would only add a mini-album to their catalogue before Stewart decided to leave the band. Jay, Lenny and Richie would then go on to form and garner much success with Tumbleweed, while Stewart did his time with Brother Brick, The Yes Men and Asteroid B-612.

Written by Ray Davies, \\"Scattered\\" appeared as the sixteenth track from their album Phobia, and was the band's final original single (only to be followed by reissues of \\"You Really Got Me\\" and \\"Waterloo Sunset\\".) Background On its appearance on Phobia, \\"Scattered\\" is dedicated to Annie Florence Davies (Ray Davies' mother) and Carol Bryans (a friend of Davies's.) Both died due to cancer. Ray Davies claimed that \\"Scattered\\" took ten years to write. Author Thomas Kitts believes that the song was initially inspired by Ray Davies broken relationship with Pretenders leader Chrissie Hynde. Release \\"Scattered\\" was first released in Europe as a single in 1993, 21 days prior to the release of Phobia. The song was then released on Phobia as the closing track (except for Japan and the UK, where \\"Did Ya\\" was added as a bonus track, making \\"Scattered\\" the penultimate track.) After the release of the song \\"Only a Dream\\" as the debut British single from Phobia, \\"Scattered\\" was planned to be the follow-up to \\"Only a Dream\\". However, due to the under-performance of \\"Only a Dream\\", the \\"Scattered\\" single was cancelled, despite advertising for the single being released. However, \\"Scattered\\" eventually saw release as a single in Britain in small amounts in the collectors' market during 1993. One year later, Columbia Records dropped The Kinks. It did not chart. Reception Although it was unsuccessful as a single, \\"Scattered\\" has been praised as one of the best songs on Phobia from critics. Thomas Kitts, author of Ray Davies: Not Like Everybody Else, said that it was \\"one of [Davies's] most complex lyrics and one of [Davies's] best songs of the 1990s.\\" Rovi Staff of AllMusic cited \\"Scattered\\" as a highlight from Phobia.

Initially assigned to call number TS-336, she is assigned to unit 702 when she is promoted to full pilot. She is later killed and absorbed by Gauna 490, which uses her DNA and memories to develop a powerful Garde-like Gauna known as . A placenta sample resembling her is also retrieved by Nagate, and Ochiai impregnates it using human DNA to create Tsumugi and Kanata. ; : :A Gauna/human hybrid created by Kunato Developments for fighting against the Gauna. Tsumugi is similar in size to a Garde, but has a Gauna-like appearance in the shape of a young woman wearing a dress. Tsumugi eventually becomes friends with Nagate and Izana, usually interacting with them using a tentacle she sneaks in through the ship's ventilation system while the rest of her body stays in her chambers. Tsumugi displays a gentle, curious, child-like demeanor under most circumstances, but her prowess in combat is rivaled only by Nagate's. Just like Shizuka, she eventually develops feelings for Nagate and much to her surprise, he ends up accepting them, despite her inhuman form. Tsumugi is equipped with an organic artificial kabi cannon and retractable claws made of artificial kabi. She also has a hollow chest cavity holding an organic cockpit that allows a pilot to direct and support her in battle. Tsumugi naturally generates Heigus particles within her body and is able to easily out-fly even the most advanced Garde models. Tsumugi eventually sacrifices her hybrid body to rescue Nagate from the Lem star after his battle with Chimera Ochiai, using her body as shield to protect him from the heat. Her consciousness is later transferred to one of the captured Hoshijiro-like Gauna samples from the Crimson Hawk Moths and she enters a true relationship with Nagate, eventually giving birth to a daughter, . According to Tsumugi, Hoshijiro's memories still reside within her new body, though they are vague. ; : :Belonging to an intersex third gender that originated during the hundreds of years of human emigration into space, Izana is also a Garde pilot and quickly becomes Nagate's best friend and eventual roommate, later falling in love with him. This attraction causes Izana's body to undergo a transformation into that of a female. Izana loses an arm and a leg during a battle against the Gauna and has them replaced with prosthetic limbs that allow her to operate complex machinery with far more skill than an ordinary person. A system is also installed on Izana's Garde unit that funnels sensor and radar information directly into her brain via her artificial arm, granting her unparalleled detection abilities surpassing even Sidonias systems. She is often assigned to recon and spotting duties in battle. Initially TS-291, Izana is later assigned to unit 723. Ten years after the destruction of the Large Mass Union Ship and Sidonias colonization of the Lem star system. Izana is one of several crew members to depart on a repaired Sidonia to parts unknown. Izana is referred to using gender neutral pronouns in the original Japanese dialogue. Because the English language lacks an appropriate equivalent, she is often referred to using feminine pronouns for the sake of simplicity. ; : :A friend of Nagate and Izana, she later develops feelings for Nagate and competes with Izana for his attention. Initially a Garde pilot in-training with the call number TS-256, she is promoted to commander's aide after Seii returns to full-time piloting duty, eventually moving into Nagate's home. Yuhata makes a hobby of building and customizing plastic model kits of Garde units in her spare time. Ten years after Sidonia colonizes the Lem star system, Yuhata undergoes a gender reassignment process and becomes male. Yuhata also becomes commander of a repaired Sidonia, which continues on in search of more planets to colonize. ; :A gynoid developed with the purpose of avoiding detection from the Gauna, she is the sole survivor of a colonization expedition on the planet Lem VII. Despite refusing Nagate's help, claiming that he is responsible for the Gauna attacking Sidonia, she is rescued by him nonetheless and, without a place to return to, she is taken under his guard. Teruru claims to be unconcerned towards Nagate, but her actions usually imply otherwise. She later joins the war effort as the pilot of one of Sidonias new Mizuki-class warships. Her body has a special automatic defense mechanism built in, which activates when she feels threatened or flustered. This causes her artificial skin to harden, leaving her with a more robotic, puppet-like appearance. Being a machine, Teruru is able to survive in the vacuum of space without support, even if her body is severely damaged. Teruru is one of several crew members who decide to stay on the repaired Sidonia, departing to search for more planets to colonize. Garde Pilots ; : :A fellow male Garde pilot with long white hair, heir of Kunato Developments, the company developing the Type-18 Gardes that currently compose the majority of Sidonias main force. Norio ranked first during pilot training and had little respect for other trainees, developing a rivalry with Nagate given the special treatment he receives, unaware of his background or circumstances. He is initially assigned the call number TS-001, and is later assigned to unit 701 before becoming unable to pilot out of anxiety from guilt for directly causing Hoshijiro's death. His body is later taken over by Ochiai's mind and discarded once Ochiai's plan to transfer his mind to Kanata's body is complete. Norio barely survives, albeit with no memories of his time under Ochiai's control, and becomes a pilot once more. Having trained on a Tsugumori combat simulator since childhood just like Nagate, Kunato is entrusted with the Tsugumori Custom 2 after Nagate receives the more advanced Yukimori. Kunato is one of several crew members to stay on Sidonia once it is repaired. ; : :A brown-haired female Garde pilot with the call number TS-290, Yamano is hostile and curt towards Nagate and is similarly cold and unfriendly towards her other squadmates. Yamano is in Nagate's squad during his first mission outside Sidonia and is quickly killed by the target Gauna, making her the first Gauna-related death in a century. Said Gauna takes on her form, causing much distress for her squadmates and causing Nagate to experience recurring nightmares until he eliminates the Gauna. ; : :Leader of the Akai squad and designated unit 001. He was the youngest Gravity Cup winner and held it for 13 successive cups. Akai is killed along with his entire squad, including his girlfriend and Yuhata's older brother, during a Gauna attack on Sidonia. ; : :Mochikuni Akai's girlfriend and member of his squad, designated unit 002. She is killed during a battle against Gauna 487. ; : :Member of the Akai squad and designated unit 003. He is killed during a battle against Gauna 487. ; : :Yuhata Midorikawa's older brother and a member of the Akai squad, designated unit 004. He is killed during a battle against Gauna 487. ; : :Leader of the Samari squad and designated unit 005. A senior pilot and the original test pilot for the Type-19, before it was reassigned to Nagate due to an emergency. She is the highest ranked pilot following the deaths of the Akai squad, usually acting as field commander during missions. It is implied that Samari enters a relationship with Seii following the colonization of the Lem system. ; :Member of the original Samari squad and designated unit 006. He is killed during a battle against Gauna 492 when a Heigus particle blast is reflected back. ; : :Leader of the Tsuruuchi squad and former member of the Samari squad, designated unit 007. A running gag is Tsuruuchi making advances on Samari just to be rejected by her with comic results. During the fight against Chimera Ochiai, Tsuruuchi sacrifices himself in an attempt to take it down. He is later discovered alive, albeit severely injured, and manages to eventually make a full recovery. ; : :Leader of the Seii squad and designated unit 026, Seii is initially assistant commander before passing his post to Yuhata Midorikawa. Seii is one of the more serious and experienced Garde pilots. In the manga, Seii wears a distinctive vintage helmet that covers most of his face. Seii is the one who initially spreads the rumor about Samari photosynthesizing with male pilots who rack up high kill counts to boost pilot morale. It is implied that he eventually enters a relationship with Samari and fathers several children. ; : Leader of the Imada squad (Nakazono squad in the anime), designated unit 139. He is killed along with his squadmates units 011, 217, and 312 during the initial battle against the Crimson Hawk Moth. ; :Eiko Yamano's younger brother, he becomes a Garde pilot and Kunato's wingmate to avenge his sister's death. T≈çtar≈ç is later hailed as a war hero for being the one to deliver the killing shot to the Large Mass Union Ship's True Body, destroying it once and for all. Honoka sisters Several identical clone sisters who pilots Gardes, they are chronologically five years old and have undergone accelerated growth and compressed mental training. So far twenty-two Honokas have been created, in two batches of eleven. All of the Honoka sisters possess enhanced physical strength and agility, able to leap vast distances effortlessly and cause heavy damage to objects with simple punches and kicks. Their given names are all characters that reference fire. : ; :Oldest of the Honoka sisters, she is initially assigned the call number TS-203 and is later designated unit 703. She is critically injured in the battle against Gauna 488, the same battle Shizuka was killed in, remaining in a coma for several months. En holds some distaste for Nagate, thinking he is a pervert for walking in on her and her sisters naked more than once. She also blames him for the accident that injured her. ; :Pilot of unit TS-205, then unit 705. She is killed in a battle against the Crimson Hawk Moth. ; :Pilot of unit TS-206, then unit 706, she befriends Nagate after he helps her avenge H≈ç by defeating the Crimson Hawk Moth with a heavy mass bullet she saved for the occasion. She and En are often found together, with Ren being the more polite and level- headed of the two, especially where Nagate is involved. Ren defends En's behavior by stating that because of the way the Honokas are raised, they are immature despite being physically teenagers and have difficulty controlling their emotions. ; :Pilot of unit 707. ; :Pilot of unit 708. ; :The youngest of the Honoka sisters from the second batch of eleven, considered the most skilled pilot among them. She is killed and absorbed by the Gauna during an expedition to the Lem star. The Gauna that takes her form believes it truly is Sh≈ç and possesses her memories and personality. It soon emerges from the Gauna cluster and is revealed to be a giant. This revelation causes the Gauna to break down and destabilize, losing its Sh≈ç form just before it is swiftly eliminated by the Mizuki battleship. The remaining Honoka sisters consist of , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . Immortal Crew Members ; : :The mysterious female captain of Sidonia, who commands the Gardes against the Gauna's attacks. She wears a mask in public to hide her emotions and the fact that she is ageless. She was formerly a Garde pilot and friends with Nagate's grandfather, becoming his legal guardian after he emerges from the underworks. Kobayashi cares about Nagate, but is forced by the Immortal Ship Committee to assign him to all missions available, which many see as a death sentence due to the low survival rate of pilots after successive sorties. This is actually the Committee's intention, as they want Nagate to be killed before someone discovers his natural immortality. After the Immortal Ship Committee attempts to impeach and replace her, Kobayashi orders their deaths instead, assuming full control of the ship to pool its resources on the war against the Gauna without questioning. Kobayashi has a habit of spending her off time blending in with the general population, made easier by the fact that only a select few people actually know what she looks like under her mask. After the assault on the Large Mass Union Ship, Kobayashi discards her mask for good. She later elects to stay on Lem VII once it is colonized, passing command of the repaired Sidonia to Yuhata Midorikawa. ; : :Nagate's 'grandfather' who also taught Nagate how to pilot Gardes. Sait≈ç was Sidonias former ace pilot who saved the ship from being overrun by the Gauna 100 years before the events of the series. This was accomplished by retrieving and using the Kabizashi that Ochiai had discarded. After the battle, Sait≈ç disappeared, just to reappear 80 years later, with his body growing old after renouncing his immortality, as he chose to die naturally. Several advanced immortal clones were grown from his DNA and when Sait≈ç learned that the clones grown for him were going to have his memories implanted on them, he stole one of the infants and raised him by himself as a regular child, who would grow up as Nagate Tanikaze. He also taught Nagate all his piloting expertise before dying. ; : :Izana's grandmother and an immortal crew member. Dr. Shinatose was the scientist who devised the plan to repopulate Sidonia with genetically engineered clones after its population was devastated and almost decimated in the Fourth Defensive War against the Gauna. The survivors included 25 council members and 392 citizens. Dr. Shinatose's plan would increase Sidonias population to 500,000 in 100 years (six generations), while accounting for the lost food production facilities by genetically altering its future population to photosynthesize, reducing the need to consume food to once per week. Dr. Shinatose later oversaw the development of the Gauna/human hybrid Tsumugi. Yure is among the crew members who colonize Lem VII. ; : :A talking bear who serves as \\"dorm mother,\\" taking care of Nagate's living quarters and making his food until he starts living by himself. Hiyama, a member of the original Immortal Ship Committee, was formerly a Garde pilot and served with Kobayashi and Sait≈ç, with whom she participated in the exploration mission to an alien artifact where the Kabizashi were first discovered 600 years before the start of the series. Her bear body is actually an advanced cybernetic life support suit that sustains her human body, which is severely deteriorated due to being subjected to a severe Gauna infection, leaving only her brain unscathed. It is unknown why the suit looks like a bear, though during a flashback, she is seen in an earlier model resembling a bulky diving suit. Hiyama's right hand was lost sometime in the past and was replaced with a three-fingered mechanical claw, though it does not hinder her in any way. She strongly dislikes being addressed by her given name and only ever gave the privilege to Sait≈ç, violently attacking anyone else who addresses her as Lala. As she sees Sait≈ç and Nagate as one and the same, Nagate is the only other person who can get away with calling her Lala. Hiyama is possibly a nod to Nihei's manga Biomega, which features a supporting character named Kozlov, who is also a bear missing a hand. After the war, Hiyama decides to stay on Sidonia as it departs from Lem-VII in search for more planets to colonize. ; : :The series' major antagonist, he is a scientist and researcher on the Gauna's behavior and biology who once discarded all of Sidonias Kabizashi, certain that it attracts the Gauna to them, but this has not stopped the ship from being attacked and almost overrun by the aliens. He escaped execution because a large part of Sidionia's data was transferred to a separate database that can only be accessed through his brain, thus his memories were sealed and his brain transferred to a clone of his. However, a copy of his memories was stored in a separate location and later transferred to Kunato's body, allowing him to resume his research, leading to the advent of Tsumugi and Kanata. Ochiai finally reveals himself when he transfers his memories to Kanata's body, assuming control of the Chimera and leaving Sidonia, believing that the Gauna are a superior life form. Chimera Ochiai later reappears during the assault on the Large Mass Union Ship, intending to gather enough Heigus particles to use his organic Gravitational Beam Emitter and destroy Sidonia. He is eventually killed within the Lem star by Nagate. Other characters ; : :A female scientist working in the Extraterrestrial Research Division (ERD) studying the Gauna and assigned to research a human-like sample extracted by Nagate. One observation she has regarding the Hoshijiro ena is that is always looks in the direction of the Kabizashi, this information is immediately classified. She is later put under mind control by Ochiai and put to work under him until she is forced to kill herself upon being questioned by her research on the Gauna. ; : :Head of R&D.; A tall and imposing woman with a ponytail. She has a fearsome reputation and usually reprimands Nagate for bringing back his Garde damaged. Sasaki is among the crew members to colonize Lem VII. ; : :A Toha mechanic. Made redundant after Kunato began production of Type-18 as there were no need for hand-crafted parts. His works are requested again upon the development of the more refined Type-19. He also is responsible for the maintenance of Teruru's artificial body. ; : :Kunato's 'sister' who is killed and restored by Ochiai after he possesses the body of her brother, brainwashing her to take part on his plans. The brainwashed Mozuku participates into some battles piloting Tsumugi, before the Chimera becomes confident enough to sortie without assistance. Her original personality is eventually restored and she elects to remain on Sidonia once it is repaired. ; : :Also known by the official designations Gauna 489, Gauna 490, and Gauna 491, the \\"Crimson Hawk Moths\\" are a trio of powerful and persistent Gauna that initially take the form of red, organic copies of Shizuka Hoshijiro's Garde, unit 702, possessing the same specifications as a Type-18 unit down to the ability to transmit radio messages over Hoshijiro's frequency. In the first encounter against the trio, Gauna 489 is destroyed, while Nagate is able to retrieve a piece of Gauna 491's placenta, which is a near perfect copy of Hoshijiro, possessing simple, infantile intelligence and wearing an organic \\"suit.\\" Gauna 491 is eventually taken by Ochiai (inhabiting Kunato's body), impregnated, and used to create the Chimeras Kanata and Tsumugi, evidently dying in the process. Gauna 490 continues to pursue and attack Sidonia several times, eventually evolving into a form resembling a giant, biomechanical Hoshijiro and doing battle with Nagate and Tsumugi in the planet Lem IX's atmosphere. True Body of Gauna 490 is eventually destroyed in close combat by Nagate, and its placenta, having invaded Nagate's cockpit during the battle and again resembling Hoshijiro, is recovered and placed in storage. Tsumugi's consciousness is later transferred to one of the captured samples, overwriting what little remained of Hoshijiro's personality. ; :A second Gauna/Human hybrid, far more powerful than Tsumugi, but mentally unstable. Instead of being destroyed, she was put into sleep, as Captain Kobayashi is interested in the Gravitational Beam Emitter, a powerful long range weapon installed on her right eye that could help Sidonia get rid of the Gauna threat for good. Once the weapon is mass produced, Kobayashi gives orders to dismantle Kanata, but its body is hijacked by Ochiai. Nagate eventually destroys Kanata's body along with Ochiai's consciousness during a battle within the Lem star's corona. ; : :An Aide Controller whose face is always covered by a mask.

It is based on the true story of an Idaho teen dropout who builds a multimillion-dollar marijuana ring by trafficking drugs through the woods across the Canada‚ÄìUS border. Plot The plot is based on a true story and follows Nate (Jonathan Daniel Brown), who lives with his younger brother and their single mom who works multiple jobs to support them. An eighteen-year-old high school dropout, Nate smokes copious amounts of marijuana with his best friend Topher (Kenny Wormald), a 27-year-old who had moved from Boston. In order to attain status, they try their hand at smuggling weed across the Canada‚ÄìUS border. They cross the border to search for a supplier, leading them to a man who sells them $1,800 in marijuana. However, they discover later that the marijuana they purchased was of lower quality than they wanted, but stick with it out of convenience. The product proves successful, resulting in them going back across the border and meeting a person named Nicole (Merritt Patterson), who offers to sell them 300 pounds of marijuana from her father. They go on to train their friends to do this work, and after multiple successful runs, they make lavish purchases and throw parties with women. Following a violent encounter with another drug smuggler, the friends argue with Nate over payment, which Nate agrees to. At a party, Nate has an encounter with this smuggler, who gets into a gunfight with him and flees. The smuggler hires two career criminal brothers to rob Nate and Topher of their money and drugs and later to murder them. After a verbal altercation, the brothers strangled and stabbed the smuggler in the woods. Topher begins working in secret with others on drug runs, leading to the crew being robbed. This leads to the police arresting the crew, with Nate fleeing to Canada to avoid a life sentence. He returns after his mother is threatened with money laundering charges.

Embedded sub-trees  A sub-tree S=(V_s,E_s) is an embedded sub-tree of T=(V,E) if and only if V_s\\\\subseteq V and two endpoint nodes of any edge in S are on the same path from the root to a leaf node in T. In other words, for any node A and B in S, if node A is the parent of node B in S, then node A must be an ancestor of node B in T. Any induced sub-trees are also embedded sub-trees, and thus the concept of embedded sub-trees is a generalization of induced sub-trees. As such embedded sub-trees characterizes the hidden patterns in a tree that are missing in traditional induced sub-tree mining. A sub-tree of size k is often called a k-sub-tree.  Support  The support of a sub-tree is the number of trees in a database that contains the sub-tree. A sub-tree is frequent if its support is not less than a user- specified threshold (often denoted as minsup). The goal of TreeMiner is to find all embedded sub-trees that have support at least the minimum support.  String representation of trees  There are several different ways of encoding a tree structure. TreeMiner uses string representations of trees for efficient tree manipulation and support counting. Initially the string is set to \\\\varnothing. Starting from the root of the tree, node labels are added to the string in depth-first search order. -1 is added to the string whenever the search process backtracks from a child to its parent. For example, a simple binary tree with root labelled A, a left child labelled B and right child labelled C can be represented by a string A B -1 C -1.  Prefix equivalence class  Two k-sub-trees are said to be in the same prefix equivalence class if the string representation of them are identical up to the (k-1)-th node. In other words, all elements in a prefix equivalence class only differ by the last node. For example, two trees with string representation A B -1 C -1 and A B -1 D -1 are in the prefix equivalence class A B with elements (C, 0) and (D,0). An element of a prefix class is specified by the node label paired with the 0-based depth first index of the node it is attached to. In this example, both elements of prefix class A B are attached to the root, which has an index of 0.  Scope  The scope of a node A is given by a pair of numbers [l,r] where l and r are the minimum and maximum node index in the sub-tree rooted at A. In other words, l is the index of A, and r is the index of the rightmost leaf among the descendants of A. As such the index of any descendant of A must lie in the scope of A, which will be a very useful property when counting the support of sub-trees. = Algorithm =  Candidate generation  Frequent sub-tree patterns follow the anti-monotone property. In other words, the support of a k-sub-tree is less than or equal to the support of its (k-1)-sub-trees. Only super patterns of known frequent patterns can possibly be frequent. By utilizing this property, k-sub-trees candidates can be generated based on frequent (k-1)-sub-trees through prefix class extension. Let C be a prefix equivalence class with two elements (x,i) and (y,j). Let C' be the class representing the extension of element (x,i). The elements of C' are added by performing join operation on the two (k-1)-sub-trees in C. The join operation on (x,i) and (y,j) is defined as the following. * If i>j, then add (y,j) to C'. * If i=j, then add (y,j) and (y, ni) to C' where ni the depth-first index of x in C * If i, no possible element can be added to C' This operation is repeated for any two ordered, but not necessarily distinct elements in C to construct the extended prefix classes of k-sub-trees.  Scope-list representation  TreeMiner performs depth first candidate generation using scope-list representation of sub-trees to facilitate faster support counting. A k-sub-tree S can be representation by a triplet (t,m,s) where t is the tree id the sub-tree comes from, m is the prefix match label, and s the scope of the last node in S. Depending on how S occurs in different trees across the database, S can have different scope-list representation. TreeMiner defines scope-list join that performs class extension on scope-list representation of sub-trees. Two elements (x,i) and (y,j) can be joined if there exists two sub-trees (t_x,m_x,s_x)and (t_y,m_y,s_y) that satisfy either of the following conditions. * In-scope test: t_x=t_y, m_x=m_y, s_y\\\\subset s_x, which corresponds to the case when i=j. * Out-scope test: t_x=t_y, m_x=m_y, s_y>s_x, which correspond to the case when i>j. By keeping track of distinct tree ids used in the scope-list tests, the support of sub-trees can be calculated efficiently.  Applications  Domains in which frequent subtree mining is useful tend to involve complex relationships between data entities: for instance, the analysis of XML documents often requires frequent subtree mining. Another domain where this is useful is the web usage mining problem: since the actions taken by users when visiting a web site can be recorded and categorized in many different ways, complex databases of trees need to be analyzed with frequent subtree mining. Other domains in which frequent subtree mining is useful include computational biology,Deepak, Akshay, David Fern√°ndez-Baca, Srikanta Tirthapura, Michael J. Sanderson, and Michelle M. McMahon. \\"EvoMiner: frequent subtree mining in phylogenetic databases.\\" Knowledge and Information Systems (2011): 1-32.Chi, Yun, Yirong Yang, and Richard R.

ACLED codes the dates and locations of all reported political violence and demonstration events in over 150 countries in real- time. As of 2020, ACLED has recorded almost a million individual events across Africa, the Middle East, Latin America & the Caribbean, East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia & the Caucasus, and Southeastern & Eastern Europe & the Balkans. The ACLED team conducts analysis to describe, explore, and test conflict scenarios, making both data and analysis open for use by the public. Team and History ACLED is led by founder and Executive Director Prof. Clionadh Raleigh, a Professor of Political Violence and Geography at the University of Sussex, and operated by Research Director Dr. Roudabeh Kishi and Program Director Olivia Russell. The dataset was introduced by Raleigh and co- authors in a 2010 paper in the Journal of Peace Research. ACLED was previously affiliated with the University of Sussex and hosted by the Peace Research Institute Oslo (where it was distinct from the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict dataset) but later moved to an independent home. Since 2014, ACLED has been registered as an independent, non-profit organization with 501(c)(3) status in the United States. Data ACLED data contain information on the specific dates and locations of conflict events, the types of events, the groups involved, reported fatalities, and changes in territorial control. The dataset has different coverage periods for different regions and countries, as back- coding remains ongoing: all African countries are covered starting from 1997 to the present; Middle Eastern countries are covered from 2016 to the present, with the exception of Yemen (2015‚Äìpresent), Saudi Arabia (2015‚Äìpresent), and Syria (2017‚Äìpresent); South and Southeast Asian countries are covered from 2010 to the present, with the exception of India (2016‚Äìpresent), Indonesia (2015‚Äìpresent), the Philippines (2016‚Äìpresent), and Malaysia (2018‚Äìpresent); all Eastern and Southeastern European and Balkan countries are covered from 2018 to the present; all countries in Central Asia and the Caucasus are covered from 2018 to the present, with the exception of Afghanistan (2017‚Äìpresent); all countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are covered from 2019 to the present; and all countries in East Asia are covered from 2019 to the present. All regions are covered in real-time. ACLED has launched a special project covering the United States ahead of the 2020 election and is in the process of expanding coverage to Western Europe. Data collection involves a variety of sources including reports from government institutions, local media, humanitarian agencies, and research publications. In many cases, ACLED has developed partnerships with local conflict observatories to enhance data collection, such as the Yemen Data Project and the Syrian Network for Human Rights. A full account of definitions, practices, source materials, and coding procedures are available in the General Guides and Methodology sections of the ACLED website. Data are updated in real-time and can be downloaded from the website's Data Export Tool, the website's Curated Data Files, or directly from the ACLED API. ACLED provides a codebook intended for all users of the dataset as well as additional FAQs and guides. Real-time analysis of political violence can be also found in the Analysis section of the ACLED website, including weekly regional overviews, briefings, reports, and infographics. The project also issues press releases, fact sheets, and summaries for use by the media, which can be found in the Press section of the website. Uses and Users of ACLED ACLED material is regularly used to inform journalism, academic research, and public discourse on conflict, and to support the work of practitioners and policymakers. =Academics, practitioners, and policymakers= Scholars, students, and academic researchers commonly use ACLED data in their work on protest and political violence, including those from institutions like Bowdoin College, Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Kings College London, the London School of Economics, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Oxford University, Stanford University, and the University of Pennsylvania, among others. ACLED data are also routinely used and referenced by development practitioners, humanitarian agencies, and policymakers, including the World Bank, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN), UN OCHA, UNICEF, OHCHR, UN country offices, European Union agencies, and a variety of government ministries around the world, as well as charities and human rights organizations. =Think tanks and blogs= Think tanks such as the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Carter Center, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Brookings Institution, and the Africa Center for Strategic Studies regularly utilize ACLED data for research and to inform policy recommendations. Political scientist, data analyst, and forecaster Jay Ulfelder blogged about his experience trying to use the ACLED to see if it added predictive power in estimating the probability of coups, and explained both how he approached the problem and why he eventually concluded that the ACLED data did not add predictive power for coup forecasting. However, 23 successful and unsuccessful changes in power through coups have occurred across Africa since 1997. Recent research suggests that coup risk is related to the size and stability of a leader's cabinet, and not episodes of political violence preceding coups. A post by Thomas Zeitzoff at the Political Violence at a Glance blog listed the ACLED as one of several \\"high-profile datasets.\\" Patrick Meier blogged about it at irevolution.net. =News media= ACLED data and analysis are regularly cited in media reports on conflict trends. These include pieces in The New York Times, The Guardian, The Washington Post, CNN, The Telegraph, The Independent, Buzzfeed News, Al Jazeera, Middle East Eye, the Associated Press, Le Monde, the BBC National Geographic, The Economist, and The Atlantic, among others.

The game is a combination of Tetris, tile- matching, and Boggle: players rearrange falling tetromino blocks into rows of similar colors, which turn into letters that are cleared from the board by forming words. The fast-paced game also includes challenges and power-ups. The development team consisted of three people; programmer Asher Vollmer initially developed the game alone, before reaching out to artist Greg Wohlwend for advice on the aesthetics. Composer Jimmy Hinson produced the game's music. The game was released January 19, 2012 to what video game review score aggregator Metacritic called \\"generally favorable\\" reviews. Multiple reviewers mentioned the difficulty involved in juggling the three game components simultaneously. The game was released on Android through publisher GameClub on June 19, 2020. Gameplay Screenshot of gameplay In Puzzlejuice, the player turns falling tetrominos into letters, and those letters into words and points. The player taps and drags on the touchscreen to rotate and position multicolored tetrominos that fall from the top of the screen. When the player completes a solid row of tiles, or arranges the fallen blocks such that four or more like- colored tiles touch, the color tiles turn into letters. Players connect these letter tiles with their eight adjacent tiles (in ordinal directions) to make words. Words of sufficient length are cleared from play as well as their adjacent tilesthus longer words clear more blocks. The iPhone version shows a magnified version of the tile obscured by the player's finger near the finger. The game has been compared to a cross between Boggle, Tetris, and tile- matching. The game also offers objectives to be accomplished over multiple sessions, like making a six-letter word, or clearing three or more rows at once. This unlocks power-ups that occasionally provide opportunities such as halting the rate of new tetromino drops, and removing blocks from the screen. Up to three power-ups can be selected to be used in each game. The object of the game is to get the highest score. There are two play modes: Zen and Core. There is a 90-second time limit in Zen mode. In Core mode, players play until the screen fills with poorly placed tetrominos, similar to Tetris. Core has two difficulties. On the easiest difficulty, three-letter words suffice, but harder modes require five-letter words at a minimum. A score multiplier grows as players maintain a combo of multiple words created in succession, and resets if players are too slow. Scores are uploaded to Game Center. Development Wohlwend and Vollmer displaying the game at PAX 2012 Puzzlejuice was built by a group called Collaboratory and later renamed Sirvo. The three-person team consisted of programmer Asher Vollmer, artist Greg Wohlwend, and composer Jimmy Hinson. The game began as Vollmer's idea. He later reached out to Wohlwend for aesthetic advice, which resulted in a 365-message chain email and the final product. Wohlwend and Vollmer did not speak a word to each otheror use a medium outside of Gmail and Twitterthroughout the entire development process. The title was inspired by what Vollmer described as the \\"EXTREME\\" American culture of the 1990s, exemplified by the board game Crossfire and juice-filled Gushers fruit snacks. A similar game, Spelltower, was released during Puzzlejuices development, but Vollmer and Wohlwend ultimately considered their game sufficiently different to proceed. Puzzlejuice was selected for the PAX 10, a spotlighted group of indie games, in July 2012. The game was released as a universal app for iPhone and iPad on January 19, 2012. Vollmer expressed an interest in bringing the game to Steam Greenlight in August 2012. Reception The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Multiple reviewers compared its core mechanics to a combination of Boggle, Tetris, and a tile-matching game, such as Bejeweled or Puyo Puyo. Comparing word games, Edge called it the \\"fast-paced action-adventure\\" to Spelltower \\"survival horror\\". Multiple reviewers mentioned the difficulty in mentally balancing the various components of the game, which VideoGamer.com compared to \\"doing open heart surgery while playing Dance Dance Revolution. Edge suggested playing on the game's hardest difficulty, which they found the most engaging. They called it \\"mayhem, ... elegantly handled\\". Pocket Gamer Harry Slater said the game \\"forces your brain to think in ways that it's never been asked to before\\". Edge compared the game's challenges to Jetpack Joyride missions, and complimented the connection between Vollmer's \\"magpie\\" design and Wohlwend's \\"luminously flat pastel-colored art\\". Phil Eaves of Slide to Play wrote that the player should play with headphones or else miss a \\"wonderful\\" chiptune soundtrack. Edge called the game \\"too hectic and exhausting\\" to return to often. VideoGamer.com Mark Brown struggled with registering the right input on the small screen, and found himself inadvertently making words from letters instead of moving color blocks. Slide to Play Eaves was also troubled by the controls, and recommended the iPad version for the extra screen space. Pocket Gamer Slater said it was too easy to clear the board with three-letter words, and thus that the design execution was not as robust as the concept, never being \\"more than the sum of its strange combination of parts\\". While TouchArcade Troy Woodfield called the gameplay \\"not ... totally original\\" in how it combines three common game ideas, he still found the combination \\"a stroke of genius\\", and highly recommended the game as \\"a breath of fresh air\\". Brown of VideoGamer.com agreed that Puzzlejuice distinguished itself from the crowded iOS puzzle game genre, and Slide to Play Eaves called its balance between game types \\"perfect\\".

The school also serves as the External Testing Center for admission to De La Salle University. History Under the inspiration and patronage of the Holy Child Jesus, the school started in 1988 with 67 pupils in primary grades. In the second year of operation, the enrollment increased which prompted the school to transfer from Pastrana Street to Roxas Avenue and then to Osmena Avenue, Kalibo in the following years. With the growing number of enrollees, the school moved on to complete preschool and grade school with the first 14 graduates in 1992, and eventually recognized by the government. To accommodate the growing population, the school transferred to its acquired site in Mabini Extension in 1993. After several years of unstable administration, the new Board of Trustees took over the school in 1995 headed by the new President, Mrs. Merle L. Altas. To set direction for the school, the Board of Trustees requested the Supervision of Jimmy Boy H. Estrellas starting in 1995 until he eventually became full-time School Director in 1997. He initiated improvements in facilities, curriculum, discipline, religious dimension and resource mobilization. With the battle cry \\"Big Dreams Start from Small Beginnings,\\" and a vision of complete basic Christian education in the new millennium - 2000, the school was granted government permit to operate secondary course starting with First Year in 1996. It was eventually granted government recognition in 1999, a year before the first high school graduates ‚Äì the millennium batch of 2000. To maximize the limited area of only 1000 sqm., the old dilapidated buildings were converted for vertical expansion. The right wing was named Sto. Ni√±o Building in honor of the school's patron, for the first high school classrooms. The other building, known as St. Joseph‚Äôs Building was converted into three-story with rooftop Function Hall and was completed in the summer of 2003. It was also in the same year that the school acquired part of the lot for the construction of the temporary canteen, quadrangle and basketball court. To complete the vertical expansion, the Blessed Virgin Mary main building was constructed in 2006 to house the administrative offices, Library, Audio-Visual Room, Science and Computer Labs. These three-adjoined buildings were dedicated to the Holy Family, whose intercession made IJS what it is today. Divine providence is clearly a source of inspiration for the school's 25 years of existence. With the onset of K to 12 Enhanced Basic Education, the school started with the horizontal expansion by acquiring the adjacent area for the construction of the proposed Senior High School Building and Covered Court.

The squadron was aircraft carrier during the last year of the war and supported combat operations during the Okinawa and the Battle of Balikpapan (1945). Following the end of World War II they were deactivated on 10 March 1946 and remain in an inactive status today. History =World War II= VMF-512 was commissioned 15 February 1944 at Marine Corps Auxiliary Air Field Oak Grove, North Carolina. During its first few months the squadron was a part of Project Danny which was a plan for Marine Corps F4U Corsair fighter aircraft to attack German V-1 flying bomb launch sites in northern France. The operation was canceled before departing for the European Theatre of World War II. Shortly thereafter the squadron was transferred along with the rest of Marine Aircraft Group 51 (MAG-51) to Marine Corps Air Station Mojave, California on 5 September 1944. Training quickly resumed at MCAS Mojave and on 5 November 1944 the squadron was re-designated as Marine Fighting Squadron (Carrier Squadron) (VMF(CVS)-512) denoting that the squadron was now Aircraft carrier based. On 8 December 1944, VMF-512 was transferred to Marine Air Support Group 48 (MASG-48) at Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara, California where it continued training until it went aboard the USS Gilbert Islands (CVE-107) in March 1945 for a shakedown cruise and carrier-landing practice. For their initial cruise VMF-512 was paired with VMTB-143 to form Marine Carrier Group 2 (MCVG-2). After their training cruise the squadron departed San Diego on 12 April 1945 for exercises in Hawaiian waters. The USS Gilbert Islands arrived off the coast of Okinawa, Japan on 21 May. During the Battle of Okinawa VMF-512 aircraft blasted and strafed concrete dugouts, troop concentrations, ammunition and fuel dumps on Okinawa from 24‚Äì31 May. In the following days they helped neutralize outlying Japanese airfields and installations, including the Sakishima Islands with repeated bomb and rocket attacks. Later in June, the USS Gilbert Islands departed for Leyte, in the Philippines. Soon thereafter they sailed to support operations in Borneo. During the Battle of Balikpapan VMF-512 provided close air support for the Australian 7th Division. The squadron remained carrier based and at the end of World War II was operating at sea near Tokyo. As part of the post- war drawdown of forces, VMF-512 was decommissioned on 10 March 1946.

Description Draganflyer X6 is a remote-controlled miniature helicopter that allows users to control it to a maximum height of . It allows for a fixed altitude to be set. The helicopter is mounted with a camera that can collect up to five hundred gigabytes of real-time recording data. It can be set to record at 1080 HD, low-light vision and thermal vision. The camera is mounted on the vibration-free bottom of the drone. The Draganflyer has six rotors and can fly up to a speed of . The drone is controlled by a single operator with a handheld controller. The controller wears glasses, which display a live feed of what is recorded by the camera. Privacy concerns The drone is in use in Canada and the United States by law enforcement. In Seattle, the use of the Draganflyer X6 by police was prohibited by mayor Mike McGinn due to protests from privacy advocates and the general public. The drones would have been used in missing persons cases and in limited criminal investigations, according to police. In May 2014, the Los Angeles Police Department obtained two of the drones as a gift from the Seattle Police Department. An official from the police department stated that the drones would only be used in limited cases such as hostage situations and that they would not be used to spy on law- abiding citizens. However, this did not stop criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union, which questioned whether the marginal benefits of the drones justified their serious threat to privacy. On October 31, 2014, Los Angeles City Council instructed Los Angeles Police Department to create a drone policy in order to move forth with using their Draganflyer X6. In February 2014, the Federal Aviation Administration allowed the Grand Forks, North Dakota police department to start using the drone. The University of North Dakota, in an attempt to preemptively solve objections regarding privacy, created a committee of private citizens and members of the government with the power to alter or completely stop the drone flights. However, the actual testing was met with little objection from the public.

Crank with the goal of bringing a rail line to Pasadena from downtown Los Angeles. Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad was sold and consolidated on May 20, 1887 into the California Central Railway. In 1889 this was consolidated into Southern California Railway Company. On Jan. 17, 1906 Southern California Railway was sold to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and called the Pasadena Subdivision. 1885 view of the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Railroad crossing the Arroyo Seco near Garvanza - Highland Park Los Angeles and San Gabriel Railroad train 1884 at Aliso Street & Anderson Street, LA, CA People of Pasadena celebrating the opening of the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad with a parade on September 30, 1886 on Colorado Street. Two groups of men building the railroad over the trestle on the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Railroad, crossing into Pasadena in 1885. Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad sold stock to get funds to build the new rail line, Lucky Baldwin purchased a large share of stocks, knowing the rail line would open markets for goods from his Rancho Santa Anita. James F. Crank's Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad had a slow start. The first rail track was laid in Pasadena in 1884, but the first contractor went bankrupt by the end of 1884. In January 1885, a new contractor started working on the line and the second rail bridge that was needed. Test train ran on Sept. 14 and on September 16, 1885 a grand celebration was held in Pasadena for the completion of the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad from Downtown LA to Lamanda Park in East Pasadena. The rail line went from downtown Los Angeles through the Arroyo Seco to Pasadena.

The rail line started a boom in Pasadena, the Hotel Green was started by Edward C. Webster in 1887 and finished in 1888 by George Gill Green. The hotel patrons arrived by train at the adjacent Pasadena station. This grand hotel in Old Pasadena is still on South Raymond Avenue.

By January 1887 the rail had crossed the San Gabriel River in Azusa. In 1887 the line continued to Monrovia where a wooden structure rail station depot was built. This structure was replaced by the Santa Fe Depot which was built in 1926. In February 1887, twenty land owners had a meeting with the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad in Judge Fiery's office. The meeting was about buying land to complete the rail line through Pomona. At the same meeting land was deeded for the rail line through Claremont by C.F. Loop and others. A rail station was built in Pomona, there was debate as to call it the: North Pomona Station or Palomares Station or Palermo Station. There was a land boom along the new rail line. In Mud Springs the resulting land boom resulted in the formation of the San Jose Ranch Company. San Jose Ranch Company and M. L. Wicks laid out streets. Small businesses opened in Mud Springs, soon the city took its new name, San Dimas. The Azusa Land and Water Company sold land in Azusa. A new town near the tracks called Alosta popped, up near Azusa and Southern Glendora, developed by former Sheriff George Gard.\\"Alosta: Latest Notes From the New Azusa Town,\\" Los Angeles Times, April 29, 1887 The Monrovia Land and Water Company sold land in Monrovia. James F. Crank joined with William Newton Monroe and others in getting Rancho Santa Anita land from Lucky Baldwin in December 1885 to sell. The new rail line through the San Gabriel Valley was also a loom to the valley's citrus, nuts and fruit growers, with a new way to get their goods to market. The original 1887 Rancho Santa Anita station, later called the Arcadia Santa Fe Station was move to the Fairplex's Rail Giants museum in 1969. Lamanda Park had a rail station for goods and passengers. Since Lamanda Park had many citrus groves and vineyards, Lamanda Park also had a long side rail line to provided shipping for these goods. Prohibition ended the wineries. The last Lamanda Park citrus packer was Sierra-Madre Lamanda Park Citrus Association, they boxed oranges, lemons, limes, and grapefruit. The packing house was at the corner of Walnut Street and San Gabriel Boulevard. The side rail line also brought lumber to Lamanda Park and later cars to the local dealers. With the close of the main line in 1994, much of the side line land was sold, but some vacant land remains in this right of way.

But in May 1887, the first Santa Fe train rolled into Los Angeles. Santa Fe had an expensive agreement to use Southern Pacific to run trains from Colton to Los Angeles. This agreement was used for a year and a half. With the May 20, 1887 sale of the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad to the California Central Railway, (a subsidiary railroad of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway) the two lines where connected together at Mud Springs, completing the rail line from Chicago to Los Angeles through the San Gabriel Valley. Amtrak ran the Southwest Chief and Desert Wind over this line, but relocated the Desert Wind to the Fullerton Line in 1986. The Santa Fe line served the San Gabriel Valley until 1994, when the 1994 Northridge earthquake weakened the bridge in Arcadia. In the late 1990s construction of the Gold Line started and opened on July 26, 2003. Thus the old Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad right of way (ROW) is still in use today. In 2013 construction on the old ROW started again with the Gold Line Foothill Extension; the site of the original 1886 Monrovia Station is under construction. The line will continue to the site of the old Azusa Station, set to open in 2015. Santa Fe built a service line just south of the main line (The Second District of the AT&SF;) in Pasadena, this ran along near Walnut Street from Eaton Canyon wash to Wilson Ave. This ROW has been sold off little by little. The raised grade for this line can still be seen on Sierra Madre Boulevard, just north Colorado Boulevard, near the VW dealer there. Lamanda Park had many citrus groves and vineyards, the station provided shipping for these goods. Prohibition ended the wineries. The last Citrus packer was Sierra-Madre Lamanda Park Citrus Association, they boxed oranges, lemons, limes, and grapefruit. The packing house was at the corner of Walnut Street and San Gabriel Boulevard. Service to Lamanda Park ended in the 1950s.

The order is a personal memento rather than a state decoration. The same practice is in place in the United Kingdom as is in the royal families of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Tonga. History The insignia of ladies of the first class of the Royal Order of Victoria and Albert The insignia of ladies of the second class of the Royal Order of Victoria and Albert. The insignia of ladies of the third class of the Order of Victoria and Albert. The first Royal Family Order was issued during and after the regency of George IV. Prior to 1820, he started the practice of presenting the order to ladies and gentlemen of the Court, particularly female members of the Royal family. His order was rather ornate in appearance, and the frame that surrounded his portrait was of diamond oak leaves and acorns. The badge was suspended from a white silk bow which varied for men and women. As a young woman, Princess Victoria of Kent (later Queen Victoria) received this badge from her uncle. After George IV, each succeeding sovereign, except William IV and Edward VIII, has issued his or her own Royal Family Order. A slight variation in the practice of the Royal Family Order came with the reign of Queen Victoria. When Victoria came to the throne there was no Royal Family Order until after her marriage she created her Royal Order of Victoria and Albert in 1862, which then served as her Royal Family Order. The order consisted of a cameo portrait of Victoria and Albert, and was suspended from a white ribbon. No other Royal Family Order has depicted both the sovereign and the sovereign's consort. Similar royal badges Those who have served as Mistress of the Robes to the present Queen have received a badge of office which is distinct from the Royal Family Order but designed along similar lines: a jewelled royal cypher worn on a yellow ribbon; it is worn on State occasions and at other events, as appropriate. The Queen's other Ladies-in-Waiting wear their own distinctive badge: a jewelled letter 'E' within an oval frame, worn on a pink silk ribbon.Photo: Lady of the Bedchamber at the State Opening of Parliament Insignia The badge of the order consists of a portrait of the Sovereign set in diamonds, which is suspended from a ribbon. The ribbon of each Royal Family Order changes with each monarch: Edward VII's was variegated of red, blue, and white (similar to the colors of the Royal Victorian Order), George V's was pale blue, and George VI's was rose pink. Each contained a portrait of the sovereign, usually in uniform (if male), or evening dress (if female). The reverse of the order contains the royal cypher of the sovereign. The Royal Family Order of Queen Elizabeth II depicts The Queen in evening dress wearing the ribbon and star of the Order of the Garter. The miniature, painted on ivory (glass since 2017), is bordered by diamonds and surmounted by a Tudor crown in diamonds and red enamel. The reverse, in silver-gilt, is patterned with rays and depicts the royal cypher and St Edward's Crown in gold and enamel. The watered silk ribbon is chartreuse yellow and formed into a bow. Wearing the Order King George V (her grandfather) and King George VI (her father) in 2006. The star and collar are a Brazilian decoration, the Order of the Southern Cross. The Royal Family Orders are worn pinned to the left shoulder at formal evening occasions when other orders and decorations are worn. If a sash is worn also over the left shoulder, the order is pinned to the sash. If more than one Royal Family Order is worn, they are layered, with the most recent always on top. More than one Royal Family Order may be worn. The Queen herself wears the Family Orders of her father King George VI and her grandfather King George V; she does not wear her own. Princess Alexandra has those of King George VI and the Queen. Those who wear that of the Queen only are: Anne, Princess Royal; Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall; Sophie, Countess of Wessex; Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester; Katharine, Duchess of Kent; and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother wore those of King George V, King George VI, and the Queen. Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, also wore those of King George V, King George VI and the Queen. Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, wore the same as her mother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, wore those of King Edward VII, King George V, King George VI and the Queen. She also wore the Royal Order of Victoria and Albert ‚Äì one of only two women, the other being Queen Mary, who was a member of five British royal family orders at the same time. Diana, Princess of Wales, wore that of the Queen only. Marriage into the royal family does not automatically bestow the Order. Although Diana, Princess of Wales, was known to have received the Order (and, more recently, the Countess of Wessex, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duchess of Cambridge were pictured wearing it), neither Sarah, Duchess of York, Princess Michael of Kent, nor Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, has been seen wearing it. A biological relationship to the monarch does not automatically bestow the Order either. None of the current monarch's granddaughters have been seen to hold the order.

He is widely considered to be the club's greatest player of the nineteenth century. Phillips played sixteen seasons for Port Adelaide. For his final two seasons, he was appointed captain.  Junior Football  In his early years Phillips played football for the Kingston Football Club in the South Australian Junior Football Association. In an 1885 post season summary of Kingston, the junior leagues premiership team, a local sports columnist described Phillips football ability as \\"[He] plays to perfection; takes everything cooly and marks well. One of the best all round men in the team.\\" Football career Phillips made his debut for the Port Adelaide against at Alberton Oval in his club's first fixture of the 1886 SAFA season. Phillips kicked his first goal for Port Adelaide the following week against Norwood at Alberton Oval. Phillips would go on to play all of Port Adelaide's 15 games in his debut season. In 1888 during Round 8 against Medindie at Alberton Oval, Phillips kicked 5 goals. At the end of the 1888 SAFA season, Phillips would be awarded his first Port Adelaide best and fairest. In 1889 Phillips injured his ankle during a football trip to Victoria. He would miss a large part of the season but would return for the club's 13th SAFA match against Medindie and kick two goals. In 1890, Phillips was a member of Port Adelaide's victorious Championship of Australia side who defeated South Melbourne for the national title. In 1893 a writer for the Express and Telegraph (Adelaide) wrote of Harry Phillips saying \\"Tick Phillips is one of the most respected and gentlemanly footballers in the colony. He is not an in-an-out player, but one who is loyal to his club and trains consistently in order that the team he plays for should have the full benefit of his abilities. He has been connected with the Ports for a good many years, and during this period has earned the goodwill of not only the supporters of the club, but those outside the magenta ranks. As a ruck player there are few his equal not only in this colony, but in Australia. He is remarkably clever, very modest in his performances, and quite unselfish Messers E and C Lazarus offered to give a trophy to the best all-round player in the team at the end of last season, and the club selected Tick as the one most deserving of the prize.

The Heritage Guitar Inc. of Kalamazoo ‚Äì The History. California. and a native of California and great grandson of two Italian-born musicians and old world luthiers (violin makers). Without knowledge of his musical roots, Gregg began playing the guitar at the age of nine, showcasing his talent performing at schools and local venues, all the while increasing his musical range. By 14, he had become a professional musician when he joined Limey and The Yanks.Stax, Mike (Summer‚ÄìFall 2008).

Right bottom to top: Gregg De Lorto, Buddy Johnson, Ron Johnson The following year, he auditioned for the popular ABC Paramount recording group The Spats. From the moment the audition started he stood out from the others with his Gretsch Country Gentleman and by the fact he flawlessly played pop music, Motown, The Rolling Stones, and anything else they performed. Despite the fact that Gregg was a plug-in and play musician, they wanted someone older. The Spats had a gig scheduled for the Saturday after the auditions and told Gregg if he wanted to play with them while they continued to look for someone older they would outfit him with clothes and spats. After a fitting for the trademark attire, a trip to Knott's Berry Farm to pick up a pair of grey utility spats, rehearsals with the band, and live performances, he proved that not only he had the chops, but also that playing up to four- hour sets without repeating a song by a multitude of artists and sounds was second nature. Within two weeks Buddy Johnson, the leader of the band, told Gregg the search was over and he officially was in, but he should \\"try to look older.\\" Since George Harrison was one of his heroes, by the time Gregg joined The Spats he had already mastered The Beatles‚Äô songs. With the Johnson brothers‚Äô vocal range equal to that of the Fab Four, and Gregg not only knowing The Beatles music note-for-note, but he played the same Gretsch guitar as his hero and The Spats easily added the sounds of the British Invasion as well as The Rascals, Vanilla Fudge, Santana, The Doors and other styles to their roster. After that, his focus unexpectedly turned to jazz when he first heard Wes Montgomery‚Äôs \\"Bump‚Äôn On Sunset.\\" Over the years, Gregg followed his passion, including continually honing the styles of the guitar greats: B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Kenny Burrell, Wes Montgomery, Charlie Christian and others. By 1980, he became a respected representative for Gibson Guitar Corporation, and then in 1985 for The Heritage Guitar Company of Kalamazoo. As his ancestors before him, playing was not enough, he had to learn and know intimately each and every aspect of the instruments he played, which led him to becoming an expert on the construction and history of the guitar. Today, he shares that knowledge by holding clinics on The History of the Carve Top Jazz Guitar and The Heritage Guitar Company of Kalamazoo throughout California. After losing his voice in 1995, Gregg had surgery to remove nodules on his vocal cords. In 2007, he was diagnosed with an inoperable midbrain tumor. Feeling his time was not over and not ready to give up, he sought the best and was referred to neurosurgeon Mark E. Linskey, M.D., at UC Irvine Medical Center. During their first meeting Gregg told Dr. Linskey he was concerned about how the operation would affect his right and left hand coordination. Dr. Linskey said \\"this is not a textbook surgery‚Ä¶,\\" but not to worry and that he wanted to see him playing his guitar at his one year post-op appointment. Three weeks after their first meeting Dr. Linskey successfully excised the tumor followed by a two-week medically induced coma. Soon after waking from the coma, and not able to eat or walk on his own, from his recovery bed, he was composing in his head his \\"Ode to Charlie Christian\\" ‚Äì a complex arrangement. At his one year post-op appointment he walked in with his Heritage Golden Eagle and amazed Dr. Linskey and his staff by playing a compilation of Charlie Christian licks and lines consisting of single string and chord melody, his \\"Ode to Charlie Christian.\\" With a positive post-op exam there was hope the worse was over. Then the tragic diagnosis that Gregg's wife for more than 30 years, classically trained pianist Paulette Froemming De Lorto (1943‚Äì2009), was in the fourth stage of cancer. She died the following year. Life would take another surprising turn when business for The Heritage Guitar Company took him 400 miles away and face-to-face with a platonic friend from nearly forty years earlier; that meeting lead to a new marriage and the genesis for unexpected compositions and new recordings. In 2013, Gregg released a CD of original biographical love songs, with many more original songs in production. Gregg uses multiple guitars on each song, very much the way painter uses brushes ‚Äì each for its own unique qualities ‚Äì as he incorporates the lines, styles and techniques of the greatest guitarists of all time. His unique brand of music celebrates the love, romance, commitment and dedication inspired by the love of his life. Gregg De Lorto recording \\"Serenade Me In the Moonlight\\" with his Heritage Golden Eagle Internationally acclaimed guitarist, educator and author Wolf Marshall, sums up the song Serenade Me in the Moonlight, \\"Serenade is a wonderful tribute in sound and lyrical imagery.... It feels like an ending and a beginning at the same time.\\" Song titles  Serenade Me in the Moonlight released August 1, 2013 under the label De Lorto Music.\\" =Serenade Me in the Moonlight= Inspired by the question, \\"will you serenade me in the moonlight on our honeymoon?\\" ‚Äì is a multifaceted and multi-genre serenade with a modern Spanish-Latin-jazzy feel that features a solo voice with background support and the voice of the Lady in the Moonlight (Jasmine Lee). The song crescendos into the chorus theme and culminates with celebrating la la la's and angelic voice with a hot Flamenco guitar solo cool down fading into the moonlight. Gregg uses two nylon Spanish classical guitars, and two Heritage Custom Golden Eagles to create a wide range of guitar orchestration and styles with intricate guitar passages, counter-melody along with full strings, brass, percussion and bass. =D√©j√† Vu I'm With You= Reminiscent of the iconic music of the 1960s, tells the story of an innocent friendship that takes the surprising turn to love decades later. With a firm foundation and sparkly Benson-ish solos, Gregg summons the Hammond B-3 as the driving force for the sound, along with solid rhythm guitars. He plays all the guitar solos and fills on his Heritage Custom Thin Golden Eagle, and the groove-setting rhythm on his Heritage Split Block Golden Eagle. =Can You Imagine A Love Like This= The heart-stirring vocals are sung by Victoria Rohrig Marchi, while nylon classic guitars are featured in both background and solos, the Heritage Super Eagle shines with vibrant splashes of Wes throughout. Whether the vocal or instrumental arrangement, this is a romantic ballroom dance... =The Rose of Sharon, My Jewell and Always Will Be= A personal expression of love using haunting strings, exotic rhythms, and a captivating melody in both the vocal and instrumental arrangements. This song is enchanting, spiritual, seductive and sexy, and features musically-sound, multi-guitar tracks, played with two nylons, two Heritage Golden Eagles, and a Heritage Super Eagle soloing a very Wes tribute.

They were notable for many firsts, including their involvement in pioneering north/south co-operation during the beginning of the then fragile Irish peace process. Introduction Founded prior to the 1994 cease- fire by the IRA, the first re-enactment was staged mere weeks after the first cessation of hostilities. It was originally formed to pioneer the concept of period re-enactment as a means of providing practical training and personal development for the long-term unemployed, whilst staging an event as a cultural and historical tourist attraction. The unit quickly found itself in the unique position of re-enacting an earlier stage of a war that was still ongoing. It became involved in cross-border initiatives due to the unique appeal to all sides in the Irish conflict. Conscious of the old prophecy that \\"Ireland will lay at peace upon the return of the Wild Geese\\", they chose the 1688-1691 war in Ireland as their focus. This war saw Catholic and Protestant Irish fight on both sides for James II of England and William III of England. The Pope supported the Williamite side during the conflict. Events The Sligo Wild Geese staged the first large scale re-enactment in Ireland. This was the first event to use black powder weapons in Ireland. The importation and use of black powder, necessary to fire the cannon and muskets, was a security issue with the Irish State, but weeks before the event, the 1994 ceasefire was declared and the security climate improved enough to allow the staging of the event. They were the first group of any sort from the Republic to stage an event in conjunction with the Apprentice Boys in Derry city. Pioneered a new era in the St. Patricks Day parade in Sligo in 1999 in which Loyalist marching bands took part for the first time in history in celebrations south of the border. The first group from the Republic to march down the Shankill road in Belfast. They took part in the BBC documentary Warwalks in. They were cited by politician John Hume as a rare example of successful cross border co-operation.

Origins Although autobiography is traditionally considered to be a Western genre, the Tibetan autobiography arose separately from the Western form, with examples of the genre dating back to as early as the eleventh century,Gyatso, Janet. \\"From the Autobiography of a Visionary.\\" Religions of Tibet in Practice. Ed. Donald S. Lopez. Princeton, New Jersey.: Princeton UP, 1997. with a significant increase in production in the sixteenth century and a boom in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Unlike many other branches of Tibetan literature which originated in Indic or Chinese culture, there are no analogous genres in either canon. However, according to Janet Gyatso, \\"there remains a possible influence from Persian Islamic literature, in which didactic religious autobiographies are also known from the tenth century onwards, but such a connection remains to be demonstrated\\"Gyatso, Janet B. \\"Autobiography in Tibetan Religious Literature: Reflections on Its Modes of Self-Presentation.\\" Tibetan Studies - Proceedings of the 5th Seminar of the International Association for Tibetan Studies. Vol. 2. Narita: Naritasan Shinshoji, 1989. 465-78. Print. Language, History and Culture. (Gyatso 1992, 467). Tone Throughout the canon of Tibetan autobiography, authors present a wide span of attitudes towards themselves and their accounts of their lives, ranging from extraordinarily self-deprecating to excessively self-praising. Tert√∂ns tend towards humility and self-deprecation, typically stemming from uncertainty in their realizations in treasure revelation. On the opposite side of the spectrum, many authors, such as Kalu Rinpoche detail numerous acts of compassion and great meditative abilities in their autobiographies, while others add hagiographical elements to their autobiographies to elevate perceptions of them. While this variety in tone typically stems from the autobiographer himself, disciples do frequently impact tone (See Authorship) and add honorific titles in praise of their instructors. Subgenres =Secret autobiography= Tibetan: ‡ΩÇ‡Ω¶‡Ωì‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ω†‡Ω≤‡ºã‡Ω¢‡ΩÑ‡ºã‡Ω¢‡æ£‡Ωò‡ºã, Wylie: gsan-ba'i rang rnam Similarly to secret biography within Namtar, secret autobiography focuses on inner religious experiences, such as visions, realizations, and spiritual thoughts. =Inner autobiography= Tibetan: ‡Ωì‡ΩÑ‡ºã‡ΩÇ‡Ω≤‡ºã‡Ω¢‡ΩÑ‡ºã‡Ω¢‡æ£‡Ωò‡ºã, Wylie: nang gi rang rnam The inner autobiography contains details on meditative cycles and initiations. =Outer autobiography= Tibetan: ‡Ωï‡æ±‡Ω†‡Ω≤‡ºã‡Ω¢‡ΩÑ‡ºã‡Ω¢‡æ£‡Ωò‡ºã, Wylie: phyi'i rang rnam Much like in the outer biography within Namtar, the outer autobiography reflects upon the writer's \\"publicly observable deeds‚Äîsuch as childhood events, education, travels...although...the outer account can reflect on inner thoughts and feelings as well\\" (use the footnoted gyatso or do i need to use Harvard style bracketing?). Religious context The majority of Tibetan autobiographers were Buddhist practitioners who wrote about their personal experiences for their instructional value to their disciples, as well as any other readers. However, although most autobiographers were members of the clergy, members of all classes and religiosity have written autobiography. Because of the emphasis of this genre as a means of teaching, the author‚Äôs discussion of self does not conflict with Buddhist doctrine. Instructional and directive elements within Tibetan literature are also found in other genres, such as in mGur poetry, where, in some cases, Buddhist teachings and popular themes were combined as a means of better propagating the Dharma.Jackson, Roger R. \\"Chapter 22: \\"Poetry\\" in Tibet: Glu, MGur, SNyan Ngag and \\"Songs of Experience\\"\\" Tibetan Literature: Studies in Genre. Ithaca, NY: Snow Lion, 1996. Reflection through both outer and inner autobiography also provides a means for authors to legitimize their other writings and demonstrate spiritual progress. Tibetan autobiographers frequently include accounts of past lives, which in addition to glorifying and legitimating the author's actions, models Buddhist Jataka tales. Authorship While autobiography is traditionally considered to be an account of someone's life written by the subject of the work, authorship in Tibetan autobiography frequently blends material written by the subject with that of other authors. Especially given the role of many Tibetan autobiographers as instructors and teachers, disciples often influence autobiographical content. Many autobiographers dictate their autobiographies to their students, who, in turn, tend to add their own elements to the work. While more blatantly EXTERNAL components, such as chapters regarding the death of the autobiographer, as in the autobiographies of MilarepaHeruka, Tsangnyon. \\"Chapter 12.\\" The Life of Milarepa. London: Penguin, 2010. 178-202. and Orgyan Chokyi, are regularly added by disciples, less obvious additions blur the distinction between autobiographer and disciple even further. Disciples often add honorific titles in praise of the autobiographer attesting to the merit of their teacher, which would superficially seem to be an obvious external contribution; however, Tibetan autobiographers exhibit a wide array of egotism, ranging from the expected Buddhist diffidence to grandiose self- admiration (see Tone. Components that would be expected to come directly from the autobiographer, such as accounts of dreams and visions in the secret autobiography, may, in some cases, actually be recorded by disciples that learned of them orally. Related genres =Terma Literature= Stemming from the Nyingma school of Buddhism, Terma (; \\"hidden treasure\\") literature consists of systematically hidden \\"treasures\\", \\"blessed words and objects said to originate in the enlightened intent of buddhas and bodhisattvas\\".Doctor, Andreas.

As in Tibetan autobiography, Namtar is divided into three subcategories, all of which are present in every work of Namtar:Willis, J.D.
