It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, following the acquisition of the United States rights by Drafthouse Films. Cast * as Tore * as Benno * as Astrid * as Sanny * Til- Niklas Theinert as Dennis * Daniel Michel as Eule * as Cora * Laura Lo Zito as Lilli * as Jasper * as Dieter * Christian Bergmann as Klaus * Torben Lohmann as Pastor Background The film is based on true events that were discovered by Gebbe in an Internet article. The director explained in a July 2013 interview: \\"The characters deeply touched me ... It was so far away from life. And I felt there would be so many themes to discover – about relationships, guilt, desire, belief, idealism, love, bravery… I was searching for more than an easy explanation.\\" From the outset, Gebbe collaborated with producer Verena Gräfe-Höft and the pair attained funding from German film fund Hamburg Schleswig-Holstein (FFHSH). Following the approval of financing, Gebbe wrote the screenplay for the film that she would also direct. Gebbe explained the next step in the July 2013 interview: > In Germany you really have to find a TV channel to raise most of the money > and get some more from the film funds. So that next step was tough. We > wanted to follow our vision, which of course would also mean that the story > would be told in an arthouse way. We didn't want to compromise what we > wanted to show and what we didn't want to tell. Following the receipt of further funding from FFHSH, as well as the Nordmedia company, production commenced, and the crew and cast received low salaries due to the low budget of the film. The film is Gebbe's debut feature film and is the first female-directed film to enter the Drafthouse catalog. Following the film's screening at Cannes in May 2013, the film was also included in the program of the Melbourne International Film Festival (MIFF), held during July and August 2013. Gebbe was in attendance at both of the MIFF screenings and participated in Q&A; sessions with festival goers. Reception Nothing Bad Can Happen was the only German feature film at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival and Gebbe revealed the response that she observed following the Cannes screening: \\"We expected it to be controversial, and that was what happened. We had boos and cheers, escapees and long standing ovations. It was intense! I think we stirred up a hornets' nest. And that is what artists should do.\\" As of 28 July 2013, critical reviews of Gebbe's debut are mixed. Variety's Scott Foundas acknowledges the director's talent, the memorable acting efforts of newcomers Julius Feldmeier and Swantje Kohlhof, and the cinematography of Moritz Schultheiss, but also labels Gebbe's work on the film as \\"muddled\\" and \\"misdirected.\\" Ion Cinema's Nicolas Bell concludes his review by stating \\"there’s something that doesn’t quite sit well by the closing credits\\" and criticizes a \\"weak\\" script. In a break from its usual format, horror film website Fangoria published a review of the film by Samuel Zimmerman who commended Gebbe's film as a \\"riveting example of transcendent horror.\\" Release The film is an official selection for the 2014 Stanley Film Festival.

It is situated south of Fårösund on the northern part of the island of Gotland, Sweden.  History  In 1937, work began on the construction of an airfield near the naval air base in Fårösund. Twenty bombers were to be stationed on the island, and together with naval and coastal artillery defenses their purpose was to defend northern Gotland. The runways and hangars were completed in 1939, and in the early summer of 1940 fighter planes from the J 9 division were temporarily moved to Bunge from Göta Air Force Wing (F 9). In July, both F 9 divisions and the J 8 division were moved to Bunge, where the latter was used for training purposes by the Swedish Air Force. In 1943, B 3 bombers from the Västmanland Air Force Wing, and S 16 and S 17 aircraft from Södermanland Air Force Wing (F 11) were moved to the airbase. During the final years of World War II, tensions increased in the area around Gotland, with both German and Allied aircraft violating Swedish air space. In 1944, the Swedish Air Force subsequently installed landing barriers around the field with the exception of the landing strip. The airfield was used by the Air Force to train pilots on propeller aircraft between 1939 and 1965, and as a military airport from 1965 to 1991. The Air Force also trained members of the Swedish Women's Voluntary Defence Organization at the airfield until it was abandoned by the military in 1991. Today, Bunge Airbase is mostly used for general aviation and various non- aviation activities. Local airline Rauk Air previously operated scheduled services to Stockholm Bromma Airport and charter flights within Sweden and Europe.

He was born in Pavia before soon moving to Milan where he caught the attention of Duke Filippo Maria Visconti. He was assigned to continue work on the Book of Hours of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, which he began sometime between 1412 and 1434. Belbello worked on it throughout different periods of his life, evident by his changing style in the illustrations. During the same years, he also worked on a Bible for Niccolo' III d'Este, a work finished by Jacopino d'Arezzo in 1434. Later in life, Belbello moved to Mantua, where he painted a Missal for Gianlucido Gonzaga (of the noble Gonzaga family) beginning in 1448. He was forced to leave Mantua because of moral misdemeanor in 1450 and returned to Pavia. In 1461, the Marchioness of Mantua, Barbara of Brandenburg, gave the work over to Girolamo da Cremona. The following year, after an unsuccessful attempt at appealing the Marchioness's decision, Belbello moved to Venice where he lived until his death.St. Jerome by Belbello da Pavia, from illuminated Bible of Niccolò d'Este, Vatican Library, 1440–1450  Life  Belbello's background is relatively unknown, with no information regarding his year of birth and first formal training. His personal life remains a mystery due to a lack of documentation. His place of birth is one of the only things that is verified, with that being Pavia in the Lombard province. It is known that at a young age Belbello left for Milan where he met the Duke, Filippo Visconti. Still working on the Book of Hours, Belbello worked for Niccolo' III d'Este in illustrating a bible. This was later taken over by Jacopino who completed it. Belbello is noted to have been in Mantua during 1448 where he worked for Gonzaga on a Missal. During his time there, Belbello eventually faced burning at the stake and was forced to flee due to a moral misdemeanor he was accused of in 1450. He stayed in contact with the Gonzaga family even after he returned to Pavia after his retreat from Mantua. In 1461 Belbello was stripped of his task of working on the Missal by Barbara of Brandenburg, Marchioness of Mantua, in favor of a younger artist, Girolamo da Cremona. This was due to Belbello falling out of favor with the Marchioness, as his work no longer satisfied her. His replacement had based his models on Ferrarese as well as Mantegna. Belbello tried to appeal to the Marchioness, which subsequently failed and forced him to stop working on it. In 1462 Belbello seems to have been working for the Duchess of Milan for a short stint, as evident by a letter dated 1462. After 1461 Belbello's style changed, becoming much more monumental and embracing artistic qualities from the Renaissance. This change in style is attributed to his forceful exit from his work on the Missal by the Marchioness of Mantua as well as his replacement with a younger artist who was more in style. His newer works offer a glimpse into the internal struggle of Belbello as he grappled with his old age and the changing taste of the public. Belbello is then thought to have returned to Venice where he stayed until his death, and where his style remained popular. Four pieces connect the artist to the city: A frontispiece of a manuscript in the Marciana, a manuscript in the Kupferstichkabinett, a Psalter in the British Museum, and an Antiphonary in the Monastery of S. Giorgio Maggiore in Venice. Belbello was among the artists gravitating around the workshop of active Pavia miniaturists. His artistic tendencies were formed in the wake of Lombardy artists such as Michelino Molinari da Besozzo, as well as being somewhat influenced by French miniaturists. Some of his work also seems to be influenced by Michele Giambono, especially in Seated Evangelist, which has similarities to Giambono's St. Michael in the way its figure is spatially placed. Modern rediscovery  Belbello remained unrecognized until the early twentieth century when Pietro Toesca attributed the style of the miniatures in the d'Este Bible to the illustrations found in the 2nd half of the Visconti Hours. Before Toesca's discovery, his works were often attributed to the French school, the schools of Siena, Bologna, and the Marches, as well as other artists such as Giovanni di Paolo and Sano di Pierto. Using letters from the Gonzaga family concerning the artist responsible for part of the illustrations in a Missal, Toesca was able to identify the Belbello mentioned in the correspondence. Toesca had attributed 12 works from the Kann Collection to a follower of Belbello from Venice in 1930, but in 1951, Professor Mario Salmi determined that they were products of Belbello. There was some controversy regarding fol. 57v of the Visconti Hours, which Toesci had credited to Belbello, despite some differences in the style when compared to his other illustrations located in the book. Samek-Ludovici rejected Toesci's attribution of the work on the grounds that it was too much of a departure from Belbello's style, being much coarser in nature and with sharper colors when compared to Belbello's other illustrations. Samek-Ludovici then attributed the work to a Master X, an unknown artist. Mirella Levi D'Ancona, author of The Wildenstein Collection of Illuminations: The Lombard School, reasons that this conflict in style was due to a difference in their dates of production. She argues that due to some particularities in the design of Filippo Maria's portrait in fol. 57v, that the work must have been started after the Duke's death in 1447. The details in question are the inclusion of clouds surrounding Filippo's bust as rays of light radiate outward, glorification that would be inappropriate if the Duke had still been living when it began. Thus she states that Belbello's work on the Book of Hours must have been interrupted by the Duke's death while he was working in Mantua for the Gonzagas, and he resumed his work when he was forced to flee in 1461. A \\"Master of Murano\\" was identified in an essay by Serena Padovani, in which she argues that this miniaturist was a major influence on a specific fresco-artist who had worked on the Chapel of the Rocca of Vignola, a small agricultural center south of Modena. This building featured frescoes that are dated stylistically to about 1425 and was an object of interest due to the artist's anonymity and apparent influence from this miniaturist. The connection was formed due to sharply cut drapery folds predominantly featured in the miniaturist's work which was also found on the frescoes. She also argued for the Master's influence on Ferrarese late Gothic art as well as on Belbello. This Master was then identified as Belbello himself in a response to the essay by Miklos Boskovits in the catalog of the exhibition \\"Arte in Lombardia fra gotico e rinascimento\\". Initial G: Saint Blaise; Master of the Murano Gradual; Venice or Lombardy, Italy; about 1450–1460; tempera and gold on parchment  Master of the Murano Gradual  Some work formerly attributed to Belbello has now been thought to come from a close collaborator known as the \\"Master of the Murano Gradual\\". This artist seems to implement the style of Belbello but his art features figures that are more broadly conceived and more fleshed out, with serious expressions. His name comes from a type of choir book known as a gradual he worked on that only exists in loose leaf sheets in various collections. The book is thought to come from the Camaldolese monastery of San Michele in Murano, and the Master is thought to have been one of the most distinctive illustrators who worked on illuminating manuscripts in Northern Italy. The initial \\"I\\" with the holy Pope, found in the West Bohemian Museum in Plzen, was thought to have been the work of Belbello at first but is now thought to have been done by a potential successor to Belbello who was potentially from Venice. The work retains Belbello's humor and elegance yet is also much more serious and emotional than his predecessor's work.  Follower of Belbello  The figures known as Sts. Cosmas and Damian- Initial O are not by Belbello although they share a striking resemblance to his body of work. They seem to have been made by a follower of his who also may have worked with Belbello on the Antiphonary M of S. Giorgio Maggiore in Venice. He seems to be from Padua or Bologna and his work, unlike Belbello, utilizes strong shadows and very defined planes. This work might come from the Antiphonary of St. Giorgio in Venice, much like the St. Catherine piece, as well as Belbello's The Annunciation seem to originate from. All three share a similar style in regards to their treatment of the initial and include 3 white dots gathered to form a triangle. This work has a coarser way of painting features than Belbello does and uses brown shading in its figures. It lacks the bright colors Belbello is known for. Works Belbello's earliest and most prominent work involved his contributions to the Book of Hours of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, a work entrusted to him by the Duke of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti. The work had been started in 1390 by Giovannino de Grassi and his son Salomone after it was commissioned by the Duke of Milan, Giangaleazzo Visconti, but had been interrupted twice. The first interruption was due to the death of Giovannino in 1398 and the second due to the death of Giangaleazzo Visconti in 1402. It was entrusted to Belbello in 1412 when Filippo Maria became the Duke after the assassination of his older brother, Giovanni Maria. The Visconti Hours seems to show an already developed style despite some imitation of his predecessors who had worked on the book previously. This is mentioned in commentary located earlier in the miniatures where Belbello states his desire to mimic dei Grassi's style. However, there is no homogeneity in the work done by Belbello, with variations in style being present throughout the book. According to art historian Millard Meiss, author of The Visconti Hours, some of these differences are thought to be due to the work of assistants in completing illustrations for Belbello. Meiss attributed the massiveness of certain works, or parts of works, to either Belbello's own evolving style or the work of associates. The Book of Hours of Gian Galeazzo Visconti is currently stored in two different collections, one in Milan called the Collection Visconti di Modrone which features pages that were solely done by Giovannino and his school and the other located in the National Library in Florence, collection Landau Finaly Ms. 22, which has works from Giovannino and Salomone but also includes the continuation by Belbello. Belbello then worked on a Breviary on behalf of Marie of Savoy, Duchess of Milan (1432) and the Bible Estense (1434), the latter highlighting an original expressionism and a narrative sequence. The works of his artistic maturity, however, include a Gradual, commissioned by Cardinal Bessarion and a Roman Missal for the Mantua Cathedral, in which his forms assumed greater fullness with effects that closely resembled Baroque tendencies. He produced Illuminated manuscripts for the most prominent clients in northern Italy, using an original style inspired by the grotesque vein and expressiveness of the International Gothic style. In the miniatures of the Bible for Niccolò d'Este (1431-1434) Belbello painted imposing figures, flowing lines, and excessive gestures with bright colors. Belbello remained faithful throughout his long career to the Gothic style, seldom breaking away completely from this style and instead adapting and modernizing it to his audience's taste. His death was in 1470.  Other works  The Mission of the Apostles The miniature illustrates the group of Apostles gathering after the death of the Virgin and Pentecost in a last prayer. It was here that they decided to preach the gospel, with the world being split up into sections for Apostles to teach. It is a rare scene to be commemorated as it is often melded together with the Pentecost. The differentiation between the two events is mostly shown through the absence of the Virgin Mary as well as the locale where the Apostles were gathered when the Holy Spirit came down. The rocky landscape where the scene takes place is a conscious choice by Belbello. He shows them engaging in prayer while the Dove of the Holy Ghost is handed down to the Apostles. The trees seem to bend as if they are taking part in the prayer, while rabbits are shown hiding in their burrows. The two saints who are identifiable in the work are St. Peter and St. John the Evangelist. St. Peter is placed in the middle of the scene, an allusion to his central position in the Christian church, while St. John's youth and the Book of Revelations he holds both serve as indicators of his identity. The inclusion of 13 apostles in the scene shows Belbello's acceptance of St. Paul as an Apostle despite his joining much later. St. Barnabas is also shown in the illustration, and he serves as the replacement for Judas following his betrayal of Jesus. This work accompanies the hymn \\"Inclitus\\", and contains the first word of the hymn in the image's frame. The word was added after the illustration's completion, evident by the markings overlapping the lowest garments of the Apostles. The left border is decorated by alternating black and white-robed monks while the bottom holds the figure of the Virgin holding the Christ Child with a white-robed bishop and black- robed bishop placed on both sides. The miniature is thought to have been made for a Benedictine monastery, with the black robes being the original robe of the Order and the white robes being those worn by reformed Benedictines. The earliest record of the image is thought to be included in the Ottley Catalogue, which indicates that the image comes from Camaldolese Monastery of St. Michele in Murano, an elegant church that thrived during the Renaissance of Venice. It housed a prosperous community of monks and also served as an important scriptorium during the 15th and 16th centuries. During Napoleon I's occupation of Venice, troops stripped the church of its precious library which had housed thousands of books. The island was subsequently abandoned by the Camaldolese monks and eventually turned into a cemetery. An educated Abbot of S. Michele created a catalogue of the library during the late 18th century, but it lacked the choir book's inclusion due to their use in church. Therefore, it is hard to verify the history of the illumination. What is known about it is that it is a Belbello piece from a late period and that there is marked influence of Michele Giambono on the faces of the Apostles. The colors of the piece are light and bright with a frame that imitates a painted wooden frame, colored black, green, and red on a white ground and inlaid blue stones. This decoration was used commonly in Florence but alien to Lombardy. St. Augustine- Initial I This is taken most likely from the beginning of the Mass of St. Augustine. The initial seems to belong to the phrase \\"In medio Ecclesiae,\\" a segment of the Common of Doctors. The image depicts the saint with the initial I covered with blue and pink leaves. The colored palmette seems to come from Florence. The black robe that is worn belongs to the Augustinians, decorated with an imitation of a golden embroidery. St. Augustine holds a pale blue book and he wears a white miter. His skin has a brownish hue that is harsh against white facial hair. Roundels in the golden background are white and bordered with ink. St. Julian (or St. Paul?)- Initial S This miniature showcases a saint, thought to be either St. Julian or St. Paul, menacingly staring at the viewer. He holds an item that is a cross between a sword and cross. He was originally thought to have been St. Paul by Boinet, but his clothing is different from the traditional garb of St. Paul. This depiction also lacks his striking pointed beard which is found in another illustration from the Wildenstein collection. The figure seems less a saint than an Italian thug yet the dagger is also thought to relate to St. Julian who killed his parents with a dagger, following a prophecy. St. Julian was declared a saint after a life of self-sacrifice and atonement as well as his final martyrdom, and his life seems to be a counterpart to the Oedipus legend. This identification is not fully accepted by scholars because of uncertainty that what he holds is actually a dagger, and his depiction does not follow the tradition of showing him as a young man. He wears a pinkish garment with black sleeves and green-lined red mantle. His hair and beard are both a yellowish brown, while his face seems to have been damaged somehow. The initial S is a blue with pink and brown palmettes, while the background and roundels suggest that this piece was made alongside another illustration, St. Paul. St. Paul- Initial S The apostle is shown pointing to the heaven, already in old age. The sword in his left hand is his identifying emblem, and his history involves a time when he was a fierce opponent of the Christian faith as a Roman officer. After his conversion, he used the same passion he had as an officer to work for the church as one of its most devoted followers of the faith. He was arrested in Rome where he had gone to the Imperial Court to convert the people there. There he was condemned to death and was beheaded as opposed to burning on the Cross due to his Roman citizenship. The instrument that caused his death had then become his pervasive symbol in art for his identity. Belbello depicts the saint with a greenish mantle with an orange lining and golden embroidery, and he is holding his gray sword. His hair is a yellowish brown while his skin is a tan color, and his beard is pointed as a way of more easily identifying the saint. The Initial is mix of several colors: orange- red, pink, green, and blue, while the background is a golden color which appears to have flaked. An Apostle (or Martyr Saint?) The figure may represent a saint, specifically St. John or St. Philip, or just a Christian martyr. He wears the clothes of an Apostle but from his hands foliage seems to bloom, indicating that it may represent the palm of martyrdom. The image lacks context of where it was originally located in a Sanctoral as well as a distinguishing emblem, and thus its identity remains unknown. The miniature seems to have come from a choir book that holds two sections for saints, the Proper of Saints and another for the Common of Saints. The Proper of Saints holds offices for particular saints while the other is devoted to a general class of saint. As such, the Proper of Saints has illustrations for a particular person as well as an individual prayer, with the image hosting an emblem to easily identify the saint. The Common of Saints has prayers that are much more generalized, going from the Apostles to the Doctors of the Church and then Virgin Martyrs and so on. The image is also a general representation of that class of saint. Without the original context of the image, it is impossible to distinguish the figure and in which category it belongs. The saint is shown wearing a red tunic with a white border as well as a green mantel that is lined with pink. His complexion is a dark tan but also include white highlights. The foliage, which is red, green, blue, and pinkish brown, seem to come from his hands. The golden background shows signs of significant damage, such as cracks. St. Stephen- Initial E The stones on top of his head and shoulders serve as the identifier for St. Stephen, as it was the weapon of his martyrdom, as well as the figure's youth and his clothing. Belbello has the stones flattened on both shoulders while the one on his head is dripping with blood. The saint wears a blue dalmatic that is lined with gold and a purplish neckband, and his sleeves are both red and purple. The Initial E that encapsulates the saint is red and has green leaves and pink palmettes. St. Margaret- Initial C (?) The inclusion of the dragon relates to the story of St. Margaret, in which she was swallowed whole by the creature but was unscathed after she was able to exit. Belbello's decision to make her mouth agape is most likely to give the illusion that she is thanking God, but the created effect by pacing the dragon opposite gives an odd visual. The colors are bright, the green of the dragon is stark against the orange-red and blue initial. The saint wears a pink dress that is blue-lined, along with a brownish-gold mantel. This is set to a golden background that is covered in leaves. The saint shows no sign of gentleness that is typical of the female depictions of the time. As a result of this, Boinet, an art historian, has called the figure \\"a male Saint menaced by a snake\\". Daisies in the background might serve as an allusion to the name Margaret, as in Italian daisies are called \\"margherita\\". The face seems to be softer than those given to men by Belbello, and this along with the dragon help identify the saint depicted in the miniature. Holy Bishop Similar to \\"An Apostle\\" it is hard to determine who exactly the figure is supposed to represent. The saint seems to be holding something although there is nothing in his hand, although it could have been the mark of St. Nicholas of Bari: three golden balls. However, the figure could quite as easily be merely a representation of bishops in general. There is extensive damage in the miniature, with the upper half of the saint's crozier being gone. The saint has a cope with a white surplice underneath and wears a white miter with green and lined with blue. The cope is also a light brown with white and red mixed into its design and also has an orange-red border. The initial itself is incomplete and thus the letter cannot be identified, all is known is that the color is a faded grey with a blue lining and also has red and green leaves. Old bearded Saint with a book- (St. John the Evangelist?)- Initial M The Initial is an M with an older saint wearing a blue robe and a green-line pink mantle. In his hands is a book that is pressed against the blue and white initial. The background of the piece is gold with flowered rinceaux in its engraved design. His halo is rimmed red and his identity could be that of St. John, a saint who actually lived to old age after surviving his martyrdom. In that case the book he holds would be either Revelations or the fourth Gospel. However the clothes in the miniature are unlike his traditional clothing: a red or pink mantle. Seated Evangelist- Initial S(?) This miniature seems to hold a much more Venetian approach that Belbello's other works, with the golden background exchanged for a deeper red. There also seems to be some influence from Venetian painter Michele Giambono, especially in the fluid handling of the draperies and the disheveled hair on the figure. The golden rinceaux in the background is a style that came to Venice from Cristoforo Cortese, who had gained the knowledge from his time in Bologna. This is a style that was heavily used by Niccolo di Giacomo da Bologna, and it was originally imported from France in the early 14th century. Its use here seems to corroborate the notion that Belbello spent his later life in Venice, as it exhibits Venetian characteristics. The saint himself has a bumpy plasticity that is striking against the fluid character of the clothes. There are some typical Belbello qualities in the figure: such as the frown and sidelong glance, and the color palette. The colors are bright, with a grey green-lined mantle and blue tunic with a red and gold band. There appears to be an attempt at some imitation of inlaid wood with the throne with a red and blue design, and the floor is a red tiled. The saint's gold halo also appears to be solid and opaque. This figure is different from a lot of his other work as it shows the full length of the figure instead of the usual partial depiction of his subjects. This work seems more similar to the Antiphonary in Berlin, which seems to have been illuminated by Belbello and his school. St. George? This miniature is damaged quite badly but the head is preserved, and may belong to St. George. The saint seems to have worn a gold armor with a white robe that was decorated with a golden cross. He is also thought to have worn a golden mantle that is red-lined on top of this, yet because of paint losses these details are mostly gone. What is visible is a white flag that the saint carries with a red cross across it. The plethora of warrior saints in Christianity, such as St. George, St. Liberale, St. Maurice, St. Theodore, etc., make it hard to identify whom the figure is meant to represent. This is thought to be St. George, although this only because he is the most common of the warrior saints to be depicted. It also worth noting that St. George is the patron saint of the Monastery of S. Giorgio Maggiore in Venice, the place where Belbello worked during his later life. The initial is impossible to make out due to its extensive damage, but might have been an \\"N\\". St. Catherine of Alexandria (St. Justine or Padua?)- Initial R Depicting a noble saint, this miniature features a female figure that has been identified as St. Catherine. However this cannot be proved as there seem to be no adequate emblems in the illustration to fully distinguish this saint from St. Justine and St. Catherine. The figure holds an open book in her hands and also has a sword lodged within her chest, with the palm of martyrdom bearing some fruit that is likely dates. St. Catherine's legend has her tortured on a wheel before she is miraculously saved, only to be subsequently beheaded. The dates on the palm could be a reference to St. Catherine's origins in Egypt. Belbello probably lacked sufficient knowledge in anatomy as the sword is placed on the wrong side of her chest, not where the heart is actually located. The lack of the wheel and inclusion of the sword led to Boinet to identify her as St. Justine, who was usually depicted with a sword in the neck. The botanical accuracy of this piece is questionable, as dates grow in clusters around the tree trunk. Instead he depicts them hanging from the branch in a single line. The initial \\"R\\" is blue with a white design and green foliage emit from the right-side of the initial. She wears a green dress and a pink mantel with gold stars and embroideries, and has a golden crown decorated with various precious stones on top of her head. Her clothing is close to her body, and appears to be wrapped tight. The technique Belbello utilizes has the color model the form by shading and differentiating the material from the crown to the hair. This work shows his tendency to conventionalize his style to fit the period and audience, and this piece is one of his only to completely adhere to the Renaissance style. His objective here seems to be to show off an idealized type of beauty in a state of tranquility. Old Man in Prayer with a Youth Behind Him (Saul and David?)- Initial S Depicted in this image is an older man in what seems to be pain, twisted and staring up to the heavens in prayer. The initial S seems to follow his erratic and tireless movement, sweeping with the man. The younger person behind the man fills up the empty space, offering his hand up to receive something. His inclusion detracts from the tense atmosphere following the man's actions and demeanor. Although his identity is unknown, he resembles somewhat St. John in the Poldi Pezzoli Museum in Milan. There is some thought that the man might be King Saul who could be repenting for his treatment of David earlier in his youth, although he lacks the crown that is his emblem of a crown and the youth lacks David's signature harp. The S is an orange-red with grey, green, and blue leaves and the figure wears a blue robe with darker blue shades in it. The youth wears a green garment and has brown hair, both of the figures have striking white in their eyes that is compelling against the color of their skin. St. Mary Magdalene- Initial G The box of ointments that the figure holds makes her identifiable as St. Mary Magdalene, and her figure seems to be a mix of Belbello's more conventional style and the plasticity of his other figures, and is possibly from the artist's latest period. This figure shows a strong resemblance to those of Lorenzo Monaco's middle period, along with his earlier works, showing the influence of other masters on Belbello. She wears a red- lined green dress with embedded golden decorations and has a golden mantle with pink lining on over it. The initial in the picture, G, surrounds her figure and is blue with a red inner rim. Also typical of Belbello's other works, there is a golden background which the figure is placed on.

In 2016, he won the Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Morning Program for his role hosting Café CNN. Early life and education Samuel Burke was born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona to a Greek Sephardic Jewish family. He learned to speak Spanish at a young age, travelling to Mexico frequently as a child and spending summers in Mexico at a language college as a teenager. Burke attended the Phoenix's North High School and in 2003 he was a member of the United States House of Representatives Page Program after he was nominated by Congressman Ed Pastor. Burke attended the Arizona State University, graduating with a BA in Spanish. Samuel Burke then went to graduate studies at the university, graduating from a master's degree in journalism from the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. While pursuing his graduate studies there, Burke worked as the teaching assistant to former CNN anchor Aaron Brown. Since his 2009 graduation, Burke has returned several times to give seminars for current students attending the school. He is a member of the Cronkite School National Board of Advisors. Journalism Burke was a co-anchor for the Spanish college news program Cronkite Newswatch in 2008 through 2009, which was broadcast on PBS and Telefutura, and was produced at the Walter Cronkite School. While attending graduate studies, Burke held an internship with CNN, working for the television program Anderson Cooper 360°. He also wrote for the Jewish News of Greater Phoenix. His first job out of college was as Christiane Amanpour's digital producer for the CNN show Amanpour. Initially there were no jobs available on the show, so he had decided to potentially take a job as a security guard at the CNN headquarters in New York City, work the nightshift, and volunteer for CNN programming during the day. Just before the start of the show, however, he was offered a temporary job with Amanpour, which turned into a full-time position. Following his work with Christiane Amanpour, Burke was tapped to become the anchor for the CNN en Español program Europa Hoy from 2010 to 2011, a program based in London that was broadcast in both Latin America and North America. In 2011 he then became the anchor of the daily Cyber Café on CafeCNN. He also reports a nightly segment for the business news show CNN Dinero and a weekly segment on the technology news show CLIX.

New York, NY: Princeton Architectural Press, 2002 Education As a Manhattan teen, Smit was in a number of Alternative rock bands. He studied abroad for a year at the Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam as an undergraduate at Parsons, and lived for a year in Berlin. He then entered the Master of Fine Arts program at Rutgers where he learned of the work of New York performance artist Michael Smith. He described to Vice magazine encountering Smith's video, Go for It, Mike, that he felt it was \\"the saddest, most amazing celebration of averageness that's ever been made. I saw that and realized this is what I want to do.\\"https://www.vice.com/read/how-to- be-funny-in-an-art-way Smit graduated in 1996. Grossmalerman First videos The subject of an ongoing performance and video series that started in 1996—Smit has said that he moved into video after growing terrified of performing live—Jonathan Grossmalerman, whose last name is pig-German for \\"big painter guy,\\" is a successful, alcoholic New York painter who has moved into low-end comedy. He has recorded an album, written a book, and delved into movie-making. (The latter is explained in Jonathan in Purgatory (1999) as a feature titled Sally which ends with David Salle dying during an operation for reconstructive plastic surgery.) Blake Gopnik the Washington Post has written that there are \\"hints of Andy Kaufman\\" in the work, saying, \\"Watch the videos with the sound turned off, and you'd sometimes swear you were watching real footage of someone with some kind of a career in comedy—no comic genius, maybe, but someone who's got the timing and manner down.\\" In a performance shot in New York to look like Cologne, the character denounces Joseph Beuys, a national treasure in Germany. In another video, Jonathan Gets Clean (2000), the artist, in recovery, visits his Chelsea art dealer, played by real Chelsea art dealer John Post Lee who insists on paying his artists in cocaine then calls the police on him. From 1999 to 2007 Smit was represented by Roebling Hall in New York City. Comics In 2008, Smit started to put Grossmalerman into comic book form, where he saw wider narrative possibility: Smit majored in illustration while at Parsons and has told ArtNews, \\"If you were to shoot [dismemberment], you’d have to do all kinds of angles. But in a comic, these types of exaggerated happenings can be worked into a story far more easily. It was a chance to develop this character even more.\\" The second issue, published in 2011, featured Grossmalerman being kidnapped and stabbed in a group therapy session. Sitcom-style series The Grossmalerman comics in turn nudged the video work into sitcom form, with more actors, real world settings, and theme music; a line from the latter is \\"Don't greet the future on bended knees / Or go to Chelsea in faded jeans / Unless they're / From Japan.\\" In an episode set in the Hamptons, a visiting art critic, played by writer-performer Kenny Mellman, Herb of Kiki and Herb, describes the painter's work is \\"Matisse-ish.\\" Another is set in Grossmalerman's studio where he falls in love with his pill- popping model (Andrea Hendrickson). Episode 5, also set in the studio, involves male visitors (Mellman and the frontman of New York City's Les Savy Fav Tim Harrington, among others) taking turns hitting on the model. News is also shared of the painter's show in Moscow being held for random. Another episode had the troubled artist visited by Jean-Michel Basquiat's ghost who only relates some unhealthy career advice while Grossmalerman's model lies unconscious on a table in the background. Smit paints all of the work attributed to his alter egos in all of his installations and videos. In \\"Studio Visit,\\" for example, the characters spend time looking at a large painting in Alex Katz-like colors of the crotches of several people amusingly and impossibly tangled together. Columns in ArtReview and Hyperallergic.com In 2013, Grossmalerman started an opinion column in ArtReview. In one he complains about the criticism he received during his time on an art panel with Christian Viveros-Fauné playing himself. The next month, he announces that his interest in trading up in representation to Hauser & Wirth, comparing himself to oligarchic and banker-collectors. Simultaneously in 2013, Grossmalerman wrote a column for the art and culture website Hyperallergic.com. The first was an explicit call for an intern: \\"If you need a shoulder to cry on, cry on mine.... Your twenties are a tough time and I’m happy to hold you and to stroke your luminous golden locks. I mean, if you’re into that. No pressure.\\" Another tells a tale of being tasered and kidnapped at the Armory Show, and in another entry, he describes falling in love with his gallery's assistant, his fifth such experience. Online series, 2015 Smit and Mellman returned for a five-episode series all set at Grossmalerman's studio in Brooklyn, this time with Mellman co-starring as Grossmalerman's studio assistant, Neil. New York performance artist Jibz Cameron plays Joyce, the artist's girlfriend, Scissor Sisters' Ana Matronic and off-Broadway actress Jenn Harris as visiting art dealers, Louise and Regina of Windsor & Gristle. Funded by a Kickstarter campaign with artist and videomaker Joshua White directing in front of a live studio audience, the episodes start with news of Grossmalerman's wife having died at a party; the artist is left to care for their 11-year-old daughter, Tracy (Sadie Parker) and he is less than up to the task. Other plot lines include a haunted Basquiat painting, which produces lines like \\"Are you saying you choose to live a ghost just because of its social ranking?,\\" Louise and Neil having an affair, the artist going through at least three iterations of work, and even further chaos. Carmine Covelli (ex-Julie Ruin member) and Brian Osborne also star. The series was released to Kickstarter funders, and then from April 17 on YouTube. It was re- released on November 11 on PasteMagazine.com every Wednesday on the Grossmalerman site through December 12. Paste magazine noted the dual sitcom, art-world-targeting nature of the work, saying \\"its free-wheeling absurdity comes off a bit like that beloved classic The Young Ones,\\" recalling the cult 1980s MTV classic.http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/11/the- grossmalerman-show-episode-1.html Maxi Geil! His name translating to \\"really horny\\" in German, Maxi Geil! is a New Wave pop star loosely based on 1970s and 1980s Dutch rock star Herman Brood. Smit writes and sings the songs for the band, Maxi Geil! & PlayColt, the music a variety of pop that blends influences from Bryan Ferry, Roxy Music, Los Angeles-based band Sparks and David Bowie from the Ziggy Stardust era. There seems to be less irony in the playing of this character than in Grossmalerman: Blake Gopnik of the Washington Post suggested this might be the artist's truer alter ego whereas Roberta Smith of the New York Times detected a lessening of irony over time. William Powhida, writing in the Brooklyn Rail in 2004, read the fictional persona as representing \\"the underlying, uncensored desires and impulses of his audience.\\" The band includes his wife Rebecca Chamberlain, also on vocals, John Allen on lead guitar, and Mark Ephraim on rhythm guitar and others. With songs with titles like \\"I Will Leave You First\\" and \\"Making Love in the Sunshine,\\" the group's music has been described as \\"anti-sentimental.\\" In the latter song, for example, the band \\"request[s] your presence in the bathroom / When the music stops,\\" and in \\"The Artist's Lament,\\" Maxi croons \\"I want your vagina around the head of my prick.\\" The band themselves describe themselves as \\"French pop / German pop / Italian pop\\" and have played in New York City and London, and released two albums. A Message to mMy Audience, their first full-length effort in 2004 in which the TV actress Zoe Lister-Jones (now known for her work on Whitney) appeared, as well as half-brother Tijn Smit, who played keyboard on the song, \\"Here Comes Maxi.\\" The band released their second album, Strange Sensation, in 2007. The Ballad of Bad Orpheus, 2000 In this 22-minute video, a cruel ship captain (Smit) keeps his crewmen in thrall with his golden voice until they are finally able to overcome him. The crewmen are played by sculptor Tony Matelli and performance artist (and artistic influence) Michael Smith. Nausea 2, 2004 The most ambitious in the Maxi Geil! video series is an hour-long rock musical starring Smit and Chamberlain, as porn stars Maxi Geil! and Giselle Thrust who have reached a crossroads in their careers. A second plot involves a young amateur, Annie Ball (Lister Jones), whose own debut is interrupted by Maxi getting sick on set. The cast includes a bevy of Brooklynites: Luis Fernandez as Maxi's stern manager, Christian Viveros-Fauné, art critic and Smit's actual then-gallerist as a member of the Spanish press to hilarious effect, actor Leo Fitzpatrick (Kids and Sons of Anarchyhttp://observer.com/2015/05/from-child-actor-to-gallery- director-marlborough-chelsea-hires-leo-fitzpatrick/) as a porn actor who suddenly grows some self-dignity in the middle of a shoot and flees. When Maxi appears at a press conference to give his resignation speech, he accuses his peers for letting commodification ruin their work: \\"Have we been reduced as people to simply a couple of cheap fetishes? You let your imaginations run wild, and this is what you came up with? ... You people are libertines with the souls of bureaucrats, and I'm constantly amazed at your limitations.\\" Smit told the Washington Post that this speech was \\"thinly veiled\\" criticism of his art world contemporaries. After revealing his return to theater, future projects, and new interest in dance, Maxi breaks into the song \\"Please Remember Me,\\" in which he exhorts, \\"I've got a hard on for a station in your memories\\" and \\"I've got a bag of tricks, of images and / melodies/ I'm designed to keep your heart and mind so / ill at ease.\\" But when he and Giselle finally meet and set out to find themselves, they end up shopping: This is Smit's attack on the notion of self-exploration in the work of his contemporaries that he feels have \\"forgotten the notion of exploration, of contradicting oneself, of trying to broaden one's horizons.\\" Gopnik of The Washington Post wrote, \\"The confusion between the roles of Smit and Geil—and between Geil [as] rock star and director, and Geil, the ... fictional porn king—make the artwork appealingly complex. It's as though Smit takes the premise of a mockumentary such as This is Spinal Tap, then gives it the density and even subtle conherence of good contemporary art.\\" The writer also notes that the work leads to other questions. \\"The ambition that made Geil a star... also leads him into making work that pushes him beyond where his true talent lies. So should Geil stick with what he's good at, however modest it turns out to be, or try his hand at stuff that may turn out to be absurd musical pornography? Which is better, satisfying competence or interesting incoherence, even failure?\\" Art critic John Haber wrote that he found the work \\"less pretentious than a Matthew Barney epic cycle\\" and \\"more coherent.\\" The work, funded by Roebling Hall and the Indiana Museum of Contemporary Art in Indianapolis,http://www.cjamesgallery.com/assets/wp- content/uploads/2015/07/GRS_CV_5_15.pdf debuted at MoMA during its fall 2004 reopening. Maxi Geil! & PlayColt also played at the event. From 2005 to 2009, Smit was represented by Fred (London) Ltd. gallery in London. A Message to My Audience, 2009 This installation at Roebling Hall's first Manhattan space (above Fanelli's in SoHo) included three videos played on a screen in front of a bed with satin sheets. The videos are a \\"Zebra Countdown Video Klasse,\\" footage of live performances of three songs that, among other things, indicate the band's fictitious level of international fame in a 1980s glam style. In the live performance of \\"Strange Sensation,\\" Maxi arrives late and attempts to express the meaning of the song to a troupe of modern dancers who act out the song's love story. In the performance of \\"The Artist's Lament,\\" Maxi-playing-Smit ends up covered in blood trying to make sense of the creative process. The bed in the installation is surrounded by Smit's paintings of Maxi and his band. Making Love in the Sunshine music video, 2013 Shot by the New York video artist John Pilson, the video stars Maxi as a werewolf and Chamberlain as a maiden cavorting in the Scottish highlands (actually the Catskills, near the couple's summer family home). Village men, played by the other members of Playcolt, nymphs, and trolls abound, as well as a contemporary homeless man randomly sifting through garbage. Performer and burlesque tap dancer Jen Zakrzewskihttp://jenzak.com/ and artist Matt Jones also star. Paintings and installations A Mountain of Skulls and Not One I Recognize, 2008–2010 For a solo exhibition at Fred gallery in London, Smit produced about ten videos with simple scenarios that appeared on different-sized screens around the space. All the videos shared the same soundtrack Smit wrote with band member Mark Ephraim and New York-based new musician Okkyung Lee,http://www.discogs.com/artist/Okkyung+Lee with Smit intoning over Ephraim's rhythm guitar and Lee's cello. Each video was based on a drawing and had two or three actors involved in a theme of either power or obsession. Video artist John Pilson plays a doctor in one, to Matthew Shawlin's patient, who await an important diagnosis. In another, Bodine Alexander plays a woman waiting for her male companion in a bathroom as he pees; all the while they exchanging dreamy, knowing glances. In a third, performance artist Neal Medlyn and actress Zoe Lister-Jones (now known for her work on the TV show Whitney) play two GIs presumably in Iraq or Afghanistan exploring the human wreckage inside a structure they have just bombed. The remaining videos included artists Carol Bove, Will Cotton and Mina Chang, as actors. Jason Cacioppo, the cameraman on all the videos, used many camera moves of 1970s European cinema, like that of Rainer Werner Fassbinder where zooms and pans are used to squeeze as much pathos and meaning out of each scene. Smit painted portraits of each actor in costume after the video production in either watercolor or oil and hung them with the videos in the installation. Paintings, in watercolor, oil, or both are in or all of the Grossmalerman and Maxi Geil videos and installations. Powhida noted a \\"calculated feeling of disinterest\\" in the style. Smit has also produced flat works under his own name. New York Times, 2007– In 2007, he painted a series of made-up newspapers headlines and photos. Headlines such as \\"U.S. Troops Pledge Loyalty to Maktada al-Sadr\\" were by turns satirical and like \\"Who Shall Be the Helen of My Tragedy?\\" by turns plaintive. The series continues into the present, with headlines referencing the 2016 presidential candidates and the spate of police brutality in the U.S., and is entitled NY Times. Mountain of Skulls, 2015–2016 A series of humorous takes on the memento mori, Mountain of Skulls emerged from frustration while Smit was waiting for post-production work on his Grossmalerman videos. The imagery harks back to the artist's time on a school trip while at the Rietveld Academie, right after the 1989 Velvet Revolution, to the Sedlec Ossuary in Kutná Hora, in a part of Czechoslovakia that is now Slovakia. The skulls of those who died in the Black Death and 15th century Hussite Wars evoked for Smit the deaths of everyday people and whole towns wiped out by modern genocide. He decided to make a town's worth of skulls with individual captions like \\"Infinitely Reasonable,\\" \\"Dull But Kind,\\" and \\"Total Dick,\\" creating an installation of 60 of the small gouache and watercolor paintings on paper for the Pulse Art Fair in Miami Beach. Online magazine Crave wrote that the series, painted in a range from constrained to loose, \\"stole the show.\\" Smit's gallerist related that the work was \\"a mediation on vanitas, power, desire, and failure\\" and noted the installation's popularity with selfie takers.http://www.craveonline.com/art/930887-art-basel-miami-guy-richards- smit-mountain-skulls Smit will present over 100 in the series for his forthcoming show at Charles James Gallery in Los Angeles.

He has also represented a number of non-League clubs, and has also served as goalkeeping coach at Needham Market. Career Born in Colchester, Gilberd School student Munson was brought through the Colchester United youth system and was handed his first-team debut by Roy McDonough at the end of the 1992–93 season. The game against Wrexham finished 4–3 to the Welsh club, conceding an 89th-minute winner from Steve Watkin on 8 May 1993. His next appearance for the club came in bizarre circumstances as Colchester became the first club to have two goalkeepers sent off in the same fixture. The game against Hereford United on 16 October 1993 saw John Keeley sent off in the 43rd minute, the U's already 1–0 down from a Chris Pike goal. Roy McDonough covered in goal until half time, where he conceded another goal to Pike. Munson was brought on at half time but was sent off in the 68th minute after conceding to Chris Fry and Pike once again, giving him a hat-trick, scoring against three different goalkeepers in the same game. McDonough returned to goal following Munson's dismissal and conceded again, this time to Derek Hall in the 88th minute to result in a disastrous 5–0 loss. Munson was to make only two further league appearances for the club, a 2–1 home win against Carlisle United, before playing his final U's game on 11 December 1993, a 4–2 defeat to Crewe Alexandra at Layer Road. Following his release from Colchester, Munson joined a number of non-league clubs in the Colchester, Essex and Suffolk area, including Wivenhoe Town, Billericay Town, and Stanway Rovers F.C. He then joined the police force, representing both the English and British police at international level. He later signed for Harwich & Parkeston F.C., Needham Market and AFC Sudbury. He announced his retirement from playing on 15 November 2007, but took over as Sudbury's goalkeeping coach. He was called into action on a number of occasions due to other players being cup-tied, making a total of 92 appearances for the club. He left Sudbury in July 2008 to join Brantham Athletic, but returned to Harwich in October of the same year. For the 2009–10 season, he returned to Brantham in a player-coach capacity. He joined Leiston in May 2011, again acting mostly as goalkeeping coach but also made some appearances for the club when required. He returned to another former club, Needham Market in March 2013 as part of the coaching team alongside former Leiston manager Mark Morsley. Personal life Munson was included in the New Year's Honours list on 1 January 2016. He received an MBE for his services to counter-terrorism while working for the Home Office as Detective Sergeant Hazardous Substances Industry Engagement Officer.

History The K class engine was built in 1891 by Hudswell, Clarke & Co, Leeds, for the construction of Fremantle Harbour. It entered service with the Public Works Department, moving later the same year to WAGR as K19. The locomotive was used subsequently on a number of other construction projects, passing into and out of WAGR ownership on several occasions with the Public Works Department, Goldfields Water Supply Administration and Fremantle Harbour Works Department operating it at various times across the state from Geraldton in the north to Bunbury in the south. When it made one of its returns to WAGR ownership in 1903, the class designation had been reallocated to another class along with number 19, so it was reclassified as L5. In 1926 it was stored at Midland Railway Workshops and scrapped in about 1931. Namesakes The K class designation was reused by the K class locomotives introduced in 1893 and again in the 1960s when the K class diesel locomotives entered service.

He was also an important figure in the revival of Theravada Buddhism in the country when it was being suppressed by the state.  Biography  Early life Bhaju Ratna was born in Kathmandu, the third of four sons of father Kulbir Singh and mother Nanibeti Kansakar. His ancestral home was located at Kel Tol, a business and ceremonial neighborhood in central Kathmandu. Its most important landmark is the temple of Jana Baha Dyah, which is known in Sanskrit as Aryavalokitesvara (Sacred Avalokiteśvara). Bhaju Ratna never went to school, and taught himself to read and write. The Kansakars were engaged in the hereditary occupation of making bronze, brass and copper household utensils. Bhaju Ratna started out working at a relative's workshop in Darjeeling, India in 1898. Returning to Kathmandu in 1903, Bhaju Ratna married Gyan Maya Tamrakar. He went back to his job in Darjeeling shortly after. Going into business After a few years in Darjeeling, Bhaju Ratna decided to set up a cloth shop in Kathmandu with his savings, and went to Mumbai to procure stock. Around 1905, he opened a cloth shop at Kel Tol. The business prospered, but in 1918, a massive fire destroyed the entire stock of textiles and yarn, and Bhaju Ratna was ruined. About the same time, his wife died, leaving behind four children. Bhaju Ratna remarried and moved to Kalimpong, India in 1921 to start afresh as a seller of household utensils for export to Tibet. Kalimpong was then the start of the caravan route to Lhasa. As business grew, he brought over craftsmen from Kathmandu and established his own workshop. Bhaju Ratna habitually wore a white cap, and Tibetan traders would often refer to him as Syamukapu, which means \\"white cap\\" in Tibetan. It would become the name of the business house he subsequently established in Kalimpong and Tibet. Enterprises in Tibet and India Bhaju Ratna diversified into forwarding Lhasa-bound cargo for Lhasa Newar merchants based in the Tibetan capital. Later, he also procured the merchandise for them on commission basis, and dispatched them to Lhasa by mule caravan. By 1930, he had opened his own establishment in Tibet at Phari, which lies on the trade route to Lhasa. Since most of the merchandise shipped to Lhasa were obtained in Kolkata, he set up an office there too in 1937, and sent his eldest son Maniharsha Jyoti Kansakar to work there. In 1939, he set up a business house in Lhasa. Bhaju Ratna's extensive trading enterprises grew into the Jyoti Group which was founded in the 1940s by Maniharsha Jyoti (1917-1992). It is involved in trading, manufacturing, travel, steel, pharmaceuticals and insurance. Bhaju Ratna's grandson Roop Jyoti is the chairman of the Jyoti Group. Religious benefactor Bhaju Ratna became one of the most important supporters of the movement to revive Theravada Buddhism at a time when it faced official disapproval at great personal risk. In 1926, following the banishment of Buddhist monks from Nepal by the Rana regime, he took care of them when they arrived in Kalimpong. During the second expulsion in 1944 too, he housed and fed the monks for years. Bhaju Ratna's generosity earned him the name \\"hero of charity\\". He has also been featured in the course of study in Buddhism as an eminent lay person.  Death  Bhaju Ratna died at his home in Kathmandu aged 74.

A thermodynamical approach to the high energy collisions first proposed by E. Fermi. Partition function The partition function of the fireballs can be written in two forms, one in terms of its density of states, \\\\sigma(E), and the other in terms of its mass spectrum, \\\\rho(m). The self-consistency principle says that both forms must be asymptotically equivalent for energies or masses sufficiently high (asymptotic limit). Also, the density of states and the mass spectrum must be asymptotically equivalent in the sense of the weak constraint proposed by HagedornR. Hagedorn, Suppl. Al Nuovo Cimento 3 (1965) 147. as : log[\\\\rho(m)]= log[\\\\sigma(E)] . These two conditions are known as the self-consistency principle or bootstrap-idea. After a long mathematical analysis Hagedorn was able to prove that there is in fact \\\\textstyle \\\\rho(m) and \\\\textstyle \\\\sigma(E) satisfying the above conditions, resulting in : \\\\rho(m) = a m^{-5/2} exp(\\\\beta_o m) and : \\\\sigma(E) = b E^{\\\\alpha -1} exp(\\\\beta_o E) with \\\\textstyle a and \\\\textstyle \\\\alpha related by :\\\\alpha=\\\\frac{a V}{(2 \\\\pi \\\\beta)^{3/5}}. Then the asymptotic partition function is given by : Z_q(V_o,T)=\\\\bigg(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta - \\\\beta _o }\\\\bigg)^{\\\\alpha}-1 where a singularity is clearly observed for \\\\beta →\\\\beta_o. This singularity determines the limiting temperature \\\\textstyle T_o=1/\\\\beta _o in Hagedorn's theory, which is also known as Hagedorn temperature. Hagedorn was able not only to give a simple explanation for the thermodynamical aspect of high energy particle production, but also worked out a formula for the hadronic mass spectrum and predicted the limiting temperature for hot hadronic systems. After some time this limiting temperature was shown by N. Cabibbo and G. Parisi to be related to a phase transition, which characterizes by the deconfinement of quarks at high energies. The mass spectrum was further analyzed by Steven Frautschi. Q-exponential function The Hagedorn theory was able to describe correctly the experimental data from collision with center-of-mass energies up to approximately 10 GeV, but above this region it failed. In 2000 I. Bediaga, E. M. F. Curado and J. M. de Miranda proposed a phenomenological generalization of Hagedorn's theory by replacing the exponential function that appears in the partition function by the q-exponential function from the Tsallis non- extensive statistics. With this modification the generalized theory was able again to describe the extended experimental data. In 2012 A. Deppman proposed a non-extensive self-consistent thermodynamical theory that includes the self- consistency principle and the non-extensive statistics. This theory gives as result the same formula proposed by Bediaga et al., which describes correctly the high energy data, but also new formulas for the mass spectrum and density of states of fireball. It also predicts a new limiting temperature and a limiting entropic index.

It was founded in 2002 by Nobel Laureate Carl Wieman. PhET began with Wieman's vision to improve the way science is taught and learned. Their stated mission is \\"To advance science and math literacy and education worldwide through free interactive simulations.\\" The project acronym \\"PhET\\" originally stood for \\"Physics Education Technology,\\" but PhET soon expanded to other disciplines. The project now designs, develops, and releases over 125 free interactive simulations for educational use in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, earth science, and mathematics. The simulations have been translated into over 65 different languages, including Spanish, Chinese, German, and Arabic; and in 2011, the PhET website received over 25 million visitors. In October 2011, PhET Interactive Simulations was chosen as the 2011 Microsoft Education Tech Award laureate. The Tech Awards, presented by The Tech Museum of Innovation, honor innovators from around the world for technology benefitting humanity. History After winning the Nobel prize in 2001, Wieman became particularly involved with efforts at improving science education and has conducted educational research on science instruction. He helped write Physics 2000 to provide simulations to explain his work in creating the Bose-Einstein Condensate. As he gave public lectures, some incorporating simulations, he noticed that \\"often the simulations would be the primary thing people would remember from my talk. Based on their questions and comments, it appeared that they consistently learned the physics represented in the simulations.\\" He then used money from a grant from the National Science Foundation Distinguished Teaching Scholars program, the Kavli Foundation, and a portion of his Nobel Prize money to found PhET to improve the way that physics is taught and learned. The PhET simulations differ from the Physics 2000 ones because users can interact with the simulation to change conditions whereas the Physics 2000 simulations are just videos. In 2007, Wieman moved to Vancouver, British Columbia while retaining 20% faculty position at the University of Colorado Boulder. The current director of PhET is Dr. Katherine Perkins, who has been with PhET since January 2003. Perkins hopes that the simulations’ accessibility and interactive nature will increase scientific literacy and promote student engagement in the classroom.  Organization  PhET Interactive Simulations is part of the University of Colorado Boulder which is a member of the Association of American Universities. The team changes over time and has about 16 members consisting of professors, post- doctoral students, researchers, education specialists, software engineers (sometimes contractors), educators, and administrative assistants. The current director of PhET is Dr. Katherine Perkins. Design and educational impact PhET Interactive Simulations incorporates research-based practices on effective teaching to enhance the learning of science and mathematics concepts. The simulations are designed to be flexible so that they can be used as lecture demonstrations, labs, or homework activities. They use an intuitive, game-like environment where students can learn through scientist- like exploration within a simplified environment, where dynamic visual representations make the invisible visible, and where science ideas are connected to real-world phenomena. A PhET simulation starts with three to five people including a content expert (scientist), a teacher, an educational researcher, and a professional software developer. The design begins with identifying specific learning goals that have proven to be conceptually difficult based on teachers' experiences in the classroom. The simulation design, look and feel is storyboarded, discussed, and then finally \\"coded.\\" Each simulation is user tested through interviews with students and in classrooms, re-worked as needed and re-tested, before released on the PhET website. Along with testing every simulation, the PhET team performs education research on their simulations. They have shown in their research that when students explore simulations in addition to traditional labs, student concept understanding improves. PhET usage by educators While PhET Interactive Simulations develops the simulations, it is primarily teachers and publishers who develop the educational activities which use the simulations, sharing these with the community. Contributors on the PhET site follow Open Education Practices (OEP), enabling teachers to use or adapt the activities freely.

He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 2013 provincial election as a member of the British Columbia Liberal Party.\\"Fraser Valley: End of the line for van Dongen as Liberals bolster stronghold in Fraser Valley\\". The Province, May 15, 2013. He currently sits as an independent after the BC Liberal Party revoked his membership for accepting his election as Speaker.  Background  Plecas holds two degrees in Criminology from Simon Fraser University, and a doctorate in Higher Education from the University of British Columbia. Plecas is a criminologist and emeritus faculty member at the University of the Fraser Valley, where he worked for 34 years, and helped turn the criminal justice program from a college diploma into a fully credited degree program.\\"Gibson and Plecas prepare for new opportunities as Abbotsford MLAs\\" . Abbotsford News, May 20, 2013. During this time, he also served as a federally appointed prison judge.  Political career  Plecas served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General for Crime Reduction from June 10, 2013 to January 29, 2015. He was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health for Seniors on January 30, 2015. At a Liberal caucus meeting held in July 2017, shortly after the government of Christy Clark lost power following its defeat in a confidence vote, Plecas called for Clark's resignation as party leader and threatened to quit the Liberal caucus and sit as an Independent MLA if she remained. Later that month, Clark announced her resignation as leader. When Plecas revealed his role in Clark's ouster to The Abbotsford News, NDP house leader Mike Farnworth approached Plecas about becoming speaker. Had he accepted, it would have strengthened the hand of the NDP minority government. Clark had unsuccessfully pressed for a new election due to the prospect of an NDP speaker having to frequently use his casting vote to break 43-43 ties. Plecas and Farnworth negotiated in secret for much of July before reaching a deal in late August, with only Premier John Horgan and a few senior staffers aware of their talks. On September 8, 2017, he was acclaimed as Speaker. On the following day, the Liberals expelled Plecas upon the request of the Abbotsford South BC Liberal riding association, and Plecas now sits as an independent. Plecas later told The Province that he initially had no desire to be speaker, but changed his mind after concluding that there was no basis for Liberal claims that an NDP minority government supported by the Greens would be illegitimate. He said that with his earlier experience as a prison judge, he had the ability to be \\"impartial in difficult circumstances.\\" Legislative Assembly corruption scandal In the year after being appointed Speaker, Plecas grew suspicious of the conduct of two Permanent Officers of the B.C. Legislative Assembly: Clerk Craig James and Segeant-at-Arms Gary Lenz. He brought the matter before the Legislative Assembly Management Committee (LAMC), who urged the Speaker to publicize the corruption claims. The alleged crimes were reported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police prior to the report's publication. A criminal investigation was launched by the RCMP. The preliminary report on the issue was published on January 21, 2019. The Plecas Report cited expenses \\"in the range of a million dollars\\" to the Legislative Assembly for personal use, in the period of 20 months between April 2017 and December 2018. James and Lenz charged the legislature for a variety of luxury goods and inappropriate travel costs. They were also accused of questionably awarding themselves hundreds of thousands of dollars in employment benefits (e.g. retirement allowances and life insurance). Plecas raised concern about employer malpractice by James and Lenz, and attempts to conceal information related to their high expenditures. James in particular was noted for the theft of alcohol, and the contents of departing Premier Christy Clark's parliamentary vault. James and Lenz denied the allegations of the report, and both submitted a written defense to the LAMC. James retired in May, 2019, after an external administrative report conducted by former Supreme Court Justice Beverly McLachlin determined his actions amounted professional misconduct in several areas. Though the same report did not substantiate claims of misconduct by Lenz, a subsequent external investigation found he had lied during the McLachlin investigation, and that he had further neglected his duties as outlined by the Police Act. Shown a copy of the report days before its public release, Lenz resigned.

Gerris was released as free and open-source software, subject to the requirements of the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2 or any later.  Scope  Banner of the Gerris website Gerris solves the Navier–Stokes equations in 2 or 3 dimensions, allowing to model industrial fluids (aerodynamics, internal flows, etc.) or for instance, the mechanics of droplets, thanks to an accurate formulation of multiphase flows (including surface tension). Actually, the latter field of study is the reason why the software shares the same name as the insect genus. Gerris also provides features relevant to geophysical flows: # ocean tide # tsunamis # river flow # eddies in the ocean # sea state (surface waves) Flow types #1 to #3 were studied using the shallow-water solver included in Gerris, case #4 brings in the primitives equations and application #5 relies on the spectral equations for generation/propagation/dissipation of swell (and/or wind sea): for this purpose Gerris makes use of the source terms from WaveWatchIII.WaveWatchIII Lastly, one can note that the (non-hydrostatic) Navier–Stokes solver was also used in the ocean to study: * fluvial plumes * internal waves * hydrothermal convection On the contrary Gerris does not allow (in its current status) the modeling of compressible fluids (supersonic flows).  Numerical scheme  Several methods can be used to provide a numerical solution to partial differential equations: * finite differences * finite volumes * finite elements Gerris belongs to the finite volumes family of CFD models.  Type of grid  Most models use meshes which are either structured (Cartesian or curvilinear grids) or unstructured (triangular, tetrahedral, etc.). Gerris is quite different on this respect: it implements a deal between structured and unstructured meshes by using a tree data structure, allowing to refine locally (and dynamically) the (finite-volume) description of the pressure and velocity fields. Indeed the grid evolves in the course of a given simulation owing to criteria defined by the user (e.g. dynamic refinement of the grid in the vicinity of sharp gradients).  Turbulent closure  Gerris mainly aims at DNS; the range of Reynolds available to the user thus depends on the computing power they can afford (although the auto-adaptive mesh allows one to focus the computing resources on the coherent structures). According to the Gerris FAQGerris (Frequently Asked Questions) the implementation of turbulence models will focus on the LES family rather than RANS approaches.  Programming language, library dependencies, included tools  Gerris is developed in C using the libraries Glib (object orientation, dynamic loading of modules, etc.) and GTS.GTS The latter brings in facilities to perform geometric computations such as triangulation of solid surfaces and their intersection with fluid cells. Moreover Gerris is fully compliant with MPI parallelisation (including dynamic load balancing). Gerris does not need a meshing tool since the local (and time dependent) refinement of the grid is on charge of the solver itself. As far as solid surfaces are concerned, several input formats are recognized: * analytic formulas in the parameter file * GTS triangulated files; note that the Gerris distribution includes a tool to translate the STL format (exported by various CAD software) into GTS triangulated surfaces * bathymetric/topographic database in KDT format; a tool is also provided to generate such a database from simple ASCII listings Among the various ways to output Gerris results, let us just mention here: * Graphical output in PPM format: images can then be converted in (nearly) any format using ImageMagick, and MPEG movies can be generated thanks to FFmpeg (among others). * Simulation files (.gfs), which are actually parameters files concatenated with fields issued from the simulation; these files can then be (i) re-used as parameter files (defining new initial conditions), or (ii) processed with Gfsview. * Gfsview, a display software shipped with Gerris, able to cope with the tree structure of the Gerris grid (a data structure which is not efficiently operated by general visualization software).  Licence  CFD software, as any software, can be developed in various \\"realms\\": * Business; * Academic; * Open Source. As far as CFD is concerned, a thorough discussion of these software development paths can be found in the statement by Zaleski. Gerris was distributed as free and open-source software right from the onset of the project.  See also  Other computing software are freely available in the field of fluid mechanics.

It served with 1st Cavalry Division throughout World War I and was reorganized post-war before being dissolved. A related unit 7th Regiment, RHA had a brief existence post- World War II, before 7th Parachute Regiment, RHA was formed in 1961. History Formation Royal Horse Artillery brigades did not exist as an organizational or operational grouping of batteries until 1 July 1859 when the Horse Brigade, Royal Artillery was formed. The brigade system was extended to five (later six) brigades when the horse artillery of the Honourable East India Company had been transferred to the British Army in 1861. These brigades were reduced to five in 1871, then to three (of 10 batteries each) in 1877 and to two (of 13 batteries each) in 1882. The brigade system was finally abolished in 1889. As battery designations were tied to the brigade that the battery was assigned to, batteries were redesignated in a bewildering sequence as they were transferred between brigades. For example, E Battery of C Brigade (E/C Bty) might become N Battery of A Brigade (N/A Bty) upon transfer. Henceforth, batteries were designated in a single alphabetical sequence in order of seniority from date of formation. The brigade system was revived in 1901. Each brigade now commanded just two batteries and a small staff (a lieutenant-colonel in command, an adjutant and a brigade sergeant major). Initially, batteries were not assigned to brigades in any particular order, but in 1906, at the insistence of Edward VII, brigades were redesignated so that batteries were roughly in order of seniority (hence I Brigade commanded A Battery and B Battery). VII Brigade, RHA was formed on 1 March 1901 as the VIII Brigade-Division, RHA with I Battery and L Battery. In 1903 it was redesignated as VIII Brigade, RHA and was stationed at Secunderabad. On 1 October 1906, it was redesignated as VII Brigade, RHA. World War I The \\"Néry Gun\\" at the Imperial War Museum. At the outbreak of World War I, the brigade was at Aldershot attached to 1st Cavalry Brigade, still commanding I and L Batteries. On mobilization, it joined 1st Cavalry Division (along with III Brigade, RHA). The brigade served with the 1st Cavalry Division on the Western Front for the rest of the war and the brigade commander acted as Commander Royal Horse Artillery (CRHA) for the division. In practice, the batteries were permanently assigned to the cavalry brigades from September 1914 onwards. The division crossed to France between 15 and 18 August 1914, concentrated around Maubeuge between 18 and 20 August, and moved forward towards Mons on 21 August. Its first action was the Battle of Mons on 23 and 24 August where the division formed the left flank. It took part in the subsequent retreat, notably the Actions of Elouges and Solesmes, the Battle of Le Cateau, the Action at Néry and the First Battle of the Marne, before advancing again to the First Battle of the Aisne and the Race to the Sea (Battle of Messines). At Néry on 1 September, L Battery was almost destroyed as an operational unit: of five Officers, three were killed and two wounded; of 200 Other Ranks, 20 were killed and 29 wounded; and five of six 13 pounders were lost. It had to be withdrawn to England to reform. (Tempy) Z Battery, RHA was formed from various sections of I, D and J Batteries, RHA to replace it. On 27 September, the sections returned to their batteries and (Tempy) Z Battery ceased to exist. The next day, H Battery, RHA joined from VI Brigade, RHA at Trowbridge and was attached to 2nd Cavalry Brigade. I Battery, RHA had been attached to 1st Cavalry Brigade on 17 September. On 14 April 1915, the 9th Cavalry Brigade was formed and joined 1st Cavalry Division to bring it up to a three-brigade strength. 1/1st Warwickshire RHA (TF) joined from 2nd Cavalry Division on the same day and was attached to 9th Cavalry Brigade. The division took part in the Second Battle of Ypres (Battle of Frezenberg, 9–13 May, and Battle of Bellewaarde Ridge, 24 May). The only action in 1916 was at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (15 September) when the division was in reserve to XIV Corps of Fourth Army. On 21 November, 1/1st Warwickshire Battery, RHA (TF) was transferred to XV Brigade, RHA, 29th Division replacing Y Battery, RHA which joined VII Brigade, RHA (9th Cavalry Brigade) on 1 December. In 1917, the brigade supported the division in a number of major actions including the Battle of Arras (April, First Battle of the Scarpe) and the Battle of Cambrai (November and December, including the Tank Attack, the Capture of Bourlon Wood and the German Counter-attacks). 1918 saw greater action as the war of movement resumed, including the German Operation Michael (March, the Battle of St. Quentin, the First Battle of Bapaume and the Battle of Rosières), the Advance to Victory (August, Battle of Amiens), the Second Battle of the Somme (August, Battle of Albert) and the battles of the Hindenburg Line (October, Battle of Cambrai and the Pursuit to the Selle). At the Armistice, it was still serving with 1st Cavalry Division with H, I and Y Batteries RHA (eighteen 13 pounders). 1st Cavalry Division led the advance of the Second Army into Germany, crossing the border on 1 December and the Rhine by 13 December. The brigade was broken up in Germany in early 1919. H Battery transferred to II Brigade, RHA at Bordon in early 1919, I Battery transferred to IV Brigade, RHA at Newbridge and Kilkenny in May 1919, and Y Battery transferred to VIII Brigade, RHA also at Bordon. Post-war reorganisation By October 1919, VII Brigade, RHA was reformed in the United Kingdom with *P Battery, RHA joined from X Brigade, RHA at Woolwich *Q Battery, RHA joined from XVI Brigade, RHA in Germany and stationed at Exeter *R Battery, RHA joined from X Brigade, RHA at Woolwich This new incarnation was short-lived, however. On 1 March 1920, the brigade was dissolved and the batteries were redesignated as batteries of the Royal Field Artillery.  7th Regiment, RHA Post-World War II plans for the Royal Horse Artillery envisioned a 7th Regiment, RHA. This was to be an Anti-Tank Regiment with R, S, T and U Batteries. Initially formed in the British Army of the Rhine in October 1946, the decision was rescinded in March 1947 before the regiment was fully constituted. On 1 May 1947, the regiment became 12th Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery. Another unit, 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery, was formed in 1961.

The role was originated by Kristen Alderson in 2013 when Kiki was introduced as the troublesome girlfriend of Morgan Corinthos (Bryan Craig) having gotten him involved in a dangerous gambling ring. Alderson had previously appeared in the series as Starr Manning, a role she originated on One Life to Live. The character was first written into the series as the illegitimate daughter of Franco (originally James Franco) in 2009. Upon her introduction in 2013, Kiki's mother Ava Jerome (Maura West) reveals that she is the biological daughter of Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton). In 2015, Alderson vacated the role and was replaced by Hayley Erin, who exited the role in late 2018. Erin returned for a one-episode guest appearance in 2019. The character of Kiki has been quite polarizing for viewers and critics specifically because of the character's lack of development. Many believed that Kiki who initially comes off as a scheming bad girl had become too much like Starr Manning. Some viewed the recast as a chance to reset the character while others questioned if the character was needed at all. The recast has led to viewers and critics alike re-evaluating the role with many still divided about the need for the character. However, TV Source Magazine specifically praised the writing for Kiki's downward spiral after her father's murder and her mother's recent betrayal with Morgan. Alderson was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series in 2015. Erin's portrayal later received a nomination in the category in 2018, before garnering the award in 2019. Storylines In May 2013, Kiki is introduced as the girlfriend of Morgan Corinthos (Bryan Craig) who has gotten into trouble with gambling debt. When Morgan's brother Michael (Chad Duell) forces Morgan to go back home to Port Charles, Kiki follows and moves in with Morgan and Michael. While they initially get off on the wrong foot, Kiki softens toward Michael when she learns why he is so protective of Morgan. Kiki is shocked when her mother Ava Jerome (Maura West) confesses that her father, Franco (Roger Howarth) is very much alive. In addition, Kiki is also shocked to learn that Ava is a member of the powerful Jerome crime family that is challenging Michael and Morgan's father Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) for his territory. After they kiss, Michael and Kiki are led to believe they are cousins. Noticing the attraction, Morgan convinces Kiki to marry him in the summer of 2013 only for it to be revealed that Kiki is the biological daughter of Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton). To divert his new bride's attention, Morgan resorts to buying Kiki expensive gifts. The marriage quickly implodes when Kiki learns that Morgan knew about her paternity before they married and she files for an annulment. Despite the fact that she is now dating Michael, Kiki is furious to discover Morgan and Ava are having an affair. In 2014, when Michael and Morgan's mother Carly Corinthos (Laura Wright) goes missing and Franco is the main suspect, Kiki helps him escape custody believing he is innocent. Though Franco rescues Carly, Michael still blames Kiki and Franco for the situation. Kiki later moves in with Silas and is shocked when Michael's uncle Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary) starts hitting on her. Instead of confiding in Michael who is grieving the loss of his biological father A. J. Quartermaine (Sean Kanan), she confides in Morgan. Kiki eventually comes clean to Michael about Luke which leads to Tracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot) losing her job as CEO of the family's company ELQ—and Michael being appointed to the position. In the summer of 2014, after her cousin Rafe Kovich, Jr. (Jimmy Deshler) passes away, Kiki reconciles with a pregnant Ava who fears Sonny will kill her once she gives birth because Ava knows Sonny killed A. J. Feeling the need to protect Michael, Morgan and Kiki agree to keep quiet. Kiki is suspicious of Michael's new assistant Rosalie Martinez (Linda Elena Tovar) who has realized they are keeping something from him. Kiki and Morgan lie, claiming they are planning a surprise party for Michael. Kiki later learns that Carly has been cheating on Franco with Sonny and tells him the truth days before Carly and Franco's wedding. On the wedding day, Franco confronts Carly about her cheating and then reveals that Sonny killed A. J. and Carly has been helping him cover it up. Michael is furious to discover both Kiki and Morgan knew about A. J.'s murder and he dumps her. Kiki is furious to learn that Ava tricked Sonny into killing A. J., believing that A. J. was responsible for killing his girlfriend Connie Falconeri (Kelly Sullivan), a crime that Ava really committed. At the same time, Kiki and Ava worry about Ava's newborn daughter who has been stolen from her. While the baby is rescued and Ava names her Avery, both Sonny and Ava are sent to prison, leaving the child in Kiki's care. Kiki is devastated when Ava is killed trying to escape prison. Meanwhile, Sonny is given a pardon, and is free to raise Avery; Kiki decides against fighting for custody. Morgan and Kiki side with Sonny when Michael decides he wants to raise Avery, believing he is only taking custody of Avery to punish Sonny. Michael wins the custody battle and bans everyone, including Kiki from visiting Avery. Furious when Michael hires Sabrina Santiago (Teresa Castillo) — the woman who caused Ava to go into premature labor — as Avery's nanny, Kiki goes along with Morgan's plan to drug Michael to get him to act out in public so he will lose custody of Avery. Just before they go back to court, baby Avery is kidnapped. Meanwhile, Morgan and Kiki bond and rekindle their romance as she forms a connection with the mysterious Denise DeMuccio—claiming to be her mother's identical twin. As Kiki bonds with Denise, Silas is very weary of their growing connection. Kiki is devastated when she finds Silas murdered in July 2015 and believes Franco is responsible. During Franco's trial, Kiki is shocked to learn that Denise is actually a very much alive Ava. Kiki is devastated when Franco admits that Ava and Morgan have been sleeping together behind her back. After dumping Morgan and disowning Ava once again, a bitter, angry Kiki starts drinking heavily. She then talks her former stepmother and Franco's girlfriend Nina Clay (Michelle Stafford) into buying Silas's apartment because she wants to move out. Franco convinces Nina to let Kiki stay with them for her own good. Kiki later attends a Halloween party where sees Morgan with another girl, gets drunk and berates him for his betrayal with her mother. Completely intoxicated, Kiki tries to make her way back home and causes a car accident. Fortunately, Morgan finds her and brings her home safely. Kiki later testifies on Sonny's behalf during Avery's custody hearing to spite her mother. With no recollection of Halloween night, Kiki is shocked when Franco's car is identified by the police as having run Carly off the road. Morgan convinces Kiki to keep quiet assuring her that Carly is ok, and that she can't start rebuilding her life from prison. He then helps her get a job as a waitress at the Metro Court Hotel. Morgan later convinces Kiki to go on a vacation with him to his father's cabin. Kiki is shocked when Morgan starts exhibiting severe mood swings after he reveals that someone else owns the cabin, and he broke in. Kiki calls Michael for help when Morgan goes on a rampage with a shotgun trying to protect her. Morgan's family arrives to restrain him, and Kiki turns herself in when she returns to Port Charles. However, Carly decides not to press charges, and invites Kiki to spend Thanksgiving with a hospitalized Morgan and their family. Her last thanksgiving 2018, she was killed by Ryan Chamberlain (Jon Lindstrom), Kevin Collins's twin brother, because her \\"mother\\" Ava was jealous because, Kiki was in a relationship with Griffin Monroe [her ex]. So \\"Kevin\\" aka Ryan killed her an placed the weapon in Griffin's closet. Development Creation and casting The role was originated by Kristen Alderson in 2013. Alderson had previously appeared in the role of Starr Manning—a role she originated on One Life to Live. Alderson along with several of her One Life co-stars would continue playing their roles on General Hospital when One Life was cancelled. When One Life to Live was relaunched online, Alderson was forced to vacate the role of Starr. The producers then created a new role for Alderson. Alderson said of her new character, \\"I really wanted to be someone completely new\\" but also wanted to incorporate some Starr's qualities into Kiki. Alderson wanted to play the \\"bad girl\\" but also admitted that it took some getting used to. In January 2015, it was announced that Alderson would vacate the role of Kiki. While Alderson did not immediately comment on her departure, her then boyfriend and co-star Chad Duell revealed that it was her decision. Soap Central reported that Alderson refused to take a \\"substantial\\" pay cut and instead decided not to renew her contract. While there were rumblings of a recast, nothing was solidified. Alderson filmed her final scenes on January 15, 2015, and made her final appearance during February Sweeps. Alderson later discussed the reason for her departure in a YouTube video and described her decision to vacate the role as \\"spur of the moment.\\" At the time of Alderson's announcement, it was not known whether the character would be written out or recast. Several days later, it was reported that Hayley Erin—who previously appeared as Abby Newman on The Young and the Restless had been hired to recast the role of Kiki Jerome. The network released a statement to wish Alderson well on her career and to confirm Hayley Erin's casting. Alderson herself also congratulated Erin on her casting on Twitter. Erin received a callback after her initial audition to read opposite head writer Ron Carlivati. \\"It was between me and one other girl\\" though she was unaware that it was for a recast. After the audition, Erin left the studio and was quickly contacted by her agent and manager instructing her to return to the studio for a wardrobe fitting. \\"I started crying a little bit\\" she revealed. Up until a few days before her audition, Erin revealed that a return to daytime after five years was the last thing on her mind. Erin had just expressed her interest in appearing on another soap and she booked the role of Kiki later that week. In the summer of 2015, rumors circulated that Erin would be replaced by a returning Kristen Alderson. Network executive Nathan Varni denied the rumors and said \\"I have a lot of faith in the role of Kiki moving forward. Varni also praised the actress and said \\"I think Hayley [Erin] is doing a fantastic, admirable job as Kiki.\\" In March 2018, when Erin was revealed to have joined the cast of the Pretty Little Liars spin-off Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists as a series regular; questions arose whether she'd be leaving the soap as Kiki. Eight months later, Erin's exit was announced; she made her last appearance on November 28, 2018. On August 20, 2019, it was announced that Erin would briefly reprise the role of Kiki. Characterization According to Alderson, Lauren is very different from Starr, though the two still had some similarities. Alderson had been posting several pictures via social media but intentionally hiding her hair, leading to speculation that her appearance would be very different. A SOAPnet promo confirmed Alderson's change in appearance in early May. Alderson revealed to Soap Opera Digest that Kiki is reminiscent of a younger Starr who is quite the trouble maker. Alderson said she \\"channeled the sassy, spunky bad girl that Starr used to be before she matured.\\" She continued, \\"Kiki's also a little more seductive.\\" Alderson described Kiki as being \\"darker and edgier\\" then her former alter ego. Kiki is \\"risqué\\" when compared to Starr who is a \\"one man kind of girl.\\" When Erin started the audition process, the producers told her, \\"Yeah she's a bad girl. We're gonna make her edgier.\\" While those were the intentions for the character, during Alderson's tenure, the writing strayed from that path. Hayley Erin found it easy to get a handle on the character describing Kiki as being \\"so relatable.\\" She continued and compared Kiki to her former role as Abby Newman on The Young and the Restless: \\"Abby was very one-dimensional... . Kiki's got layers\\" Erin said. The actress described the character as \\"kind of tough\\" yet \\"sensitive.\\" Of the writings bringing back the character's edge, Erin said \\"Now, it's fun\\" and \\"they made a character that a little foggy seem clearer.\\" Paternity and lineage When actor James Franco started his guest star arc as a crazed artist turned serial killer, Robert \\"Franco\\" Frank, character of Kiki, originally known as Lauren was first written into the series in December 2009. The girl was apparently kept from Franco by her \\"bitch\\" of a mother. In April 2012, viewers are falsely led to believe that Franco is the fraternal twin brother of Jason Morgan (Steve Burton), making him, and Lauren by extension, members of the Quartermaine family. It is later revealed that Kiki is the biological daughter of Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton) who had an affair with her mother that destroyed his marriage. Kiki's mother is the mysterious Ava Jerome (Maura West) -- an art dealer from New York City. However, Kiki later learns that Ava is a member of the infamous 80s crime family, the Jerome family—the illegitimate daughter of deceased mobster Victor Jerome and Delia Ryan (Ilene Kristen), a character from the cancelled ABC Daytime soap opera, Ryan's Hope. Having become accustomed to her mother's lies, Kiki isn't too shocked to learn of her connection to the Jeromes—however, this is another lie that \\"rocks her world\\" Alderson stated. This is unfamiliar territory for Kiki because Ava has always shielded her from the crime world. After her mother's presumed death, Kiki starts building a relationship with Silas. Actress Hayley Erin said \\"They have a little relationship, and it's sweet\\" but Silas cannot replace Ava. Kiki really tries to establish that connection with Silas and they do but \\"She just wishes he were around more.\\" In \\"losing\\" Ava, Kiki \\"lost herself\\" and resorts to questionable actions such as drugging Michael in an attempt to make sure he loses custody of their sister. Kiki descends further into turmoil when she finds Silas stabbed to death and believing Franco is guilty she feels \\"sheer hatred\\" for him. What makes it most difficult is that she has trusted Franco so much. Kiki is very relieved when Franco is proven to be innocent of her father's murder and Ava, who has been passing herself off as Ava's twin is revealed to be alive. Hayley Erin was quite upset by the decision to kill off Silas. \\"I took it personally\\" she said. The actress later continued, \\"But it made for a great storyline and there was a lot of great material for all of us.\\" Instead of focusing on whether Kiki was aware that Ava was truly alive in her portrayal, Erin went with the most basic off all the emotions with Kiki only being happy to have her mother back. Kiki's glee at having Ava back is ruined when she learns about Ava and Morgan's secret affair. Erin noted the irony of Kiki having Ava for a mother as \\"the worst thing that could have happened to anyone\\" while the actress said getting to work opposite Maura West is the \\"greatest thing that could ever happen to anyone.\\" She continued, \\"I love it, because she makes me step up my game.\\" Alcoholism and rebuilding After discovering Morgan and Ava's affair and losing her father, Kiki spirals out of control and turns to alcohol. Kiki finally hits \\"rock bottom\\" on Halloween she gets behind the wheel drunk—and causes a car accident. The actress relished in her portrayal of Kiki during the alcohol story. \\"Drunk Kiki was great\\" Erin enthused. Erin also credited the storyline with helping to sway viewer opinion about her character. She later said \\"I was doing something a bit out of the norm for me. It was actual acting.\\" Head writer Jean Passanante described Kiki as someone \\"who is still growing up and struggling to figure out who she is, even as she moves forward.\\" Passanante continued, \\"You can't go through what she went through [...] and not change.\\" In addition to Franco, his girlfriend and her former stepmother Nina Clay (Michelle Stafford) and Morgan rallying around her, Kiki holds down a steady job for the first time since her introduction. Kiki also works toward rebuilding a relationship with her mother. \\"In a strange way, right now, Kiki has more support than she's had for quite a while.\\" Relationships Bryan Craig portrays Kiki's main love interest Morgan Corinthos. The troubled romance has played out through two separate love triangles that end in disaster. However, the duo remains very close. Upon introduction, Kiki is in a relationship with Morgan Corinthos (Bryan Craig). Of the romance Alderson said her character is \\"having a great time with Morgan\\" and her feelings for him are \\"genuine.\\" However, Morgan's loved ones don't approve of the relationship because of the trouble Kiki causes. A Soapnet promo indicated that Alderson's Kiki could potentially drive a wedge between Morgan and his brother, Michael (Chad Duell) who immediately clashes with Kiki. Alderson later explained that Kiki views Michael as a \\"challenge\\" because of his apparent disdain for her. She is accustomed to having men fall at her feet so she pushes Michael's buttons to get under his skin and his obvious annoyance intrigues her more. The actress continued, \\"Kiki kind of loves it when someone loves/hates her!\\" Michael and Kiki later share a kiss only to learn they are cousins the Quartermaines. Despite the obvious attraction, Michael and Kiki decide to keep their distance from one another and keep quiet about the kiss. Whether intentional or not, Kiki's actions and feelings pit one brother against the other. Later, Kiki guilt trips herself into accepting Morgan's sudden marriage proposal because of her attraction to Michael. While Kiki isn't interested in a serious relationship, she recognizes that Morgan really cares for her but she still feels something is missing. Kiki also believes marrying Morgan will help her get over Michael. By the time she marries Morgan, Kiki and Michael have made peace with the fact that they can't be together. However everything changes when it is revealed that Morgan knew Michael and Kiki weren't related before the wedding. A shocked Kiki doesn't really know how to react and though she is angry at Morgan for his lies, she is relieved that she now has a valid reason to walk away from the marriage she never truly wanted. Throughout her relationship with Michael, Kiki remains very close with Morgan. However, after her split from Morgan, the two are practically attached at the hip. Erin said Kiki is able to look back on their relationship fondly and see that \\"Morgan has been there for her this entire time\\" and she realizes how good of a guy he is. The romantic feelings quickly resurface when the duo pretend to be romantically involved to spite Michael. \\"Kiki has rediscovered her feelings for Morgan, for sure\\" said Erin. The story featured actress Hayley Erin's very first onscreen kiss and her first love scene which was covered by Extra. Erin credited Bryan Craig for helping her through the scenes. \\"It was just a big joke to us.\\" Kiki and Morgan's reunion is short-lived due to the fact that she discovers he has been sleeping with Ava behind her back. While the actress is aware of the unfolding bipolar storyline for the character of Morgan, Kiki knows nothing of this -- \\"She just thinks he is cheating on her.\\" While Kiki does notice some odd behavior and mood swings, there isn't enough to clue her in that something more is going on. Co-head writer Shelly Altman said that Kiki and Morgan could \\"help one another heal\\" or \\"they could wind up feeding off of each other's worst impulses.\\" According to Jean Passanante, the potential to hurt one another again worries Kiki as they get close again. However it is because of their mutual history that seem \\"they understand each other.\\" Altman said Morgan's bipolar diagnosis aids in helping Kiki thaw toward Morgan. After leaving Morgan, Kiki immediately starts a romance with Michael. The pairing would pair Alderson back with her real-life boyfriend Chad Duell whom she worked with as Starr. Alderson worried about how fans would react to Kiki and Michael's relationship because Starr and Kiki are so different and \\"it was interesting to see Michael with Kiki\\" who is a lot less refined than Starr. However, the romance doesn't get much development, and ends a year later when Michael dumps Kiki after discovering she has been keeping quiet about Sonny's part in the murder of his biological father, A. J. Quartermaine (Sean Kanan). Hayley Erin later said, \\"When she was with Michael, I don't think she was thinking about Michael.\\" While she was definitely fully invested in the relationship, Kiki also had feelings for Morgan. \\"Michael wouldn't be good for her now.\\" However, Erin said Kiki and Michael \\"will always have a special relationship whether or not either of them acknowledge it.\\" While she is no longer in love with Michael, \\"she's always going to have love for him.\\" Reception The decision to re-introduce all three former One Life to Live actors in new roles simultaneously was met with skepticism. \\"[It] will either be a trainwreck or brilliant,\\" said Sara Bibel. Bibel criticized the overall decision after the dust settled and said it went \\"very wrong.\\" When Kiki is revealed to be Franco's daughter, Bibel said \\"it seems like the whole stunt was convoluted way to keep Howarth and Alderson playing father and daughter.\\" Despite the rocky start, Bibel praised the explosive storylines the came from Alderson's re-introduction as Kiki. Bibel compared the triangle between Michael, Kiki and Morgan to the extremely controversial and iconic romantic triangle in the late 90s between Carly (Michael and Morgan's mother) and brothers, A. J. and Jason. A poll in Soap Opera Digest revealed that 48% of viewers loved Michael and Kiki because they were fans of Michael and Starr, while 33% of viewers would only accept the pairing if they turned out not be cousins. Kristen Alderson earned a Daytime Emmy nomination for the Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series for her portrayal of Kiki in 2015. Michael Fairman said the character of Kiki \\"has often proved problematic for the audience, at times, to invest in.\\" He later said, \\"Kiki has never really felt to the audience as the most fully-fleshed out character, and that is even from the time Kristen Alderson was playing the role and had to quickly shift from playing Starr Manning to the newly-created character of Kiki. Omar Nobloes from TV Source Magazine said the debate over whether a recast was needed would be \\"futile\\" and expressed his hope that the recast would help to \\"reset\\" Kiki who started off with \\"promise\\" and later turned into a \\"watered down\\" Starr. Nobles described Erin as a good actress and praised her tenure on The Young and the Restless. Looking forward to seeing her in the role, Nobles hoped viewers would give the actress a chance to make the character her own. Jenn Bishop praised Kiki's downward spiral after losing her father and discovering Ava and Morgan's betrayal. \\"It's amazing how entertaining Kiki is now\\" Bishop stated. She continued, \\"This is so much better than the clueless vestal virgin of the Corinthos clan we had to suffer through for too long.\\" She continued that Kiki hitting \\"rockbottom\\" was a good way of \\"rebooting the character\\" and develop Kiki into a \\"more viable\\" character. \\"Embracing the character's aimlessness and tendency to make poor choices feels right.\\" Bishop also praised Erin's potential as Kiki and said all she needed was the right story.

The conference dates back to at least the early 1930s and is notable for its stability throughout its history. From 1949 until 1988, no school left or joined the league, although a few schools did grow through consolidation over the years. During its existence, it was one of the premier small school conferences in the state for boys' sports, boasting six state champions in basketball, two in football (in the 9 short years it coexisted with the state playoffs), and six in track & field. Long-Time Members The league had eight members for most of its history: *Alta Cyclones *Aurelia Bulldogs *Hartley Hawks *Milford Pioneers *Paullina Panthers *Primghar Bulldogs *Sanborn Bulldogs *Sutherland Tigers In the 1980s, a series of consolidations led to Hartley being rebranded as Hartley-Melvin and Milford as Okoboji. In 1988, Paullina, Primghar, and Sutherland entered a three-way sharing agreement and became known as the South O'Brien Wolverines. Hartley- Melvin also merged with Sanborn to become the H-M-S Hawks. Alta and Aurelia opted to share sports under the Alta-Aurelia Warriors moniker. For a short time during the 1970s Harris-Lake Park was also a football-only member of the conference, replacing Sanborn in the loop. History The Sioux Valley was formed in November 1933, holding its first championship competition later that season in the form of a basketball tournament. The conference was originally composed of six schools: Aurelia and Marcus of Cherokee County, Alta and Sioux Rapids of Buena Vista County, and Paullina and Sutherland of O'Brien County. By 1942, the conference had expanded to 10 members. After the exit of Marcus for the 1936-37 school year, Hartley and Primghar joined the conference. The next year, Cleghorn joined. Sanborn became the ninth member in 1941, and Milford became the tenth for the 1942-43 school year. Due to World War II, competition was put on hold for one year, though some schools continued to field athletic teams, in 1944-45. When play resumed the next season, Cleghorn opted not to return to the league. Four years later, Sioux Rapids, which was the smallest school in the league, dropped out to compete in a new league, the Little Northwestern Conference. Harris-Lake Park also competed in the conference for a brief period in the 1960s and 1970s as a football-only member. During this time Sanborn did not compete in the league for football. For the next 40 years, the conference lineup would continue unchanged. During this time the conference established itself as one of the premier small-school conferences in the state, especially in basketball, as the conference won 6 of the first 15 Class 1A basketball tournaments staged by the Iowa High School Athletic Association. Conference schools were also traditionally strong in track & field, as a conference school placed in the top two at the state meet 15 times between 1956 and 1989. In the late 1980s, however, shrinking school enrollments in northwest Iowa prompted numerous consolidations, causing the conference to disband. After students from the very small Melvin school district began competing with Hartley in 1980-81, Milford merged with Arnolds Park in 1987-88. The consolidate school adopted the Okoboji Pioneers moniker, and while it remained part of the Sioux Valley, it was much larger than some of the other schools in the conference at the time, and began exploring new conference options. In 1988–89, league membership, for the first time in over 50 years was reduced to six due, as two separate consolidations took place. Hartley-Melvin began sharing sports with Sanborn, as the H-M-S Hawks. Meanwhile, Paullina and Primghar entered into an all-sports sharing agreement. In football membership dwindled to four that year, as Aurelia began an all- sports sharing agreement with Alta and Sutherland joined Paullina-Primghar under the South O'Brien Wolverines moniker. Following the 1988–89 season, the league officially disbanded with H-M-S joining the Siouxland Conference, South O'Brien competing in the War Eagle Conference, and Alta-Aurelia joining the Twin Lakes. Okoboji competed as an independent for one season before joining H-M-S in the Siouxland.

Following the breakup of the league, H-M-S and South O'Brien began Whole-grade sharing and became officially reorganized school districts. Okoboji had already reorganized. Alta and Aurelia, on the other hand, maintained separate high schools, but continued to compete as a one team until 1996. At this time, the schools resumed their separate athletic programs, and helped spark the formation of the new Northwest Conference. In 2010–11, Alta and Aurelia resumed sharing, but this time class sharing was put in place as well. While the school districts remain legally separate entities, they currently share a high school and a middle school.

Airport operations ended in 1945. History The airport was established by the Air Service, United States Army in 1919 as part of a series of military airfields along the Texas/Mexico border. Assigned to the Army Surveillance Group (ASG) Marfa Airfield was used to carry out observation overflights along the Mexican Border. During this period, Mexico was enduring a period of revolution and unrest, which led to border violations and the deaths of American citizens. The 104th Surveillance Squadron operated Dayton-Wright DH-4 reconnaissance aircraft from Marfa Field beginning in November 1919. As the unrest in Mexico died down by the middle of 1921, the 104th moved back to Kelly Field, Texas in July. The next use of the airfield was when the Department of Commerce refitted the facility as one of its network of Intermediate Landing Fields, which were established in the 1920s & 1930s to serve as emergency landing fields along commercial airways between major cities. It was also used by the City of Marfa as their municipal airport. However, the Marfa Municipal Airport continued to be used by the Army Air Corps on an as-needed basis until the beginning of World War II. At some point after the establishment of the much larger Marfa Army Airfield in 1942, Marfa Municipal Airport was taken over by the Army Air Forces and was designated as Marfa Auxiliary Airfield #7. Three paved 5,000' runways were laid down, and it supported the training mission of Marfa AAF and was frequently used by Cessna AT-17 Bobcat twin engine trainers and B-25 Mitchell Medium Bombers. At the end of the war, Marfa AAF and all of its auxiliary airfields were closed, and turned over to the War Assets Administration in 1947 for disposition. The City of Marfa, however, chose to re-establish their municipal airport at the larger Marfa AAF, and the pre-war Marfa Municipal Airport was never used again as an airport. The land was sold and the property eventually was re-used as a Country Club. There are no remains of the former military airfield and civil airport.

The Province, May 15, 2013. He represented the electoral district of Chilliwack-Kent as a member of the British Columbia Liberal Party. After making controversial remarks regarding NDP free contraception plan, he resigned from the BC Liberal Party caucus on October 15, 2020. He will run as an independent candidate for 2020 BC general election. Before becoming a politician, Throness earned a place at the University of Cambridge where he studied for a Ph.D in History. After Cambridge, he went on to publish a book in 2008 on the theological origins of the Penitentiary Act of 1779. Throness was previously the party's candidate in the electoral district of Chilliwack-Hope in a by-election in 2012, following the resignation of Barry Penner, but was defeated by Gwen O'Mahony of the New Democrats. He defeated O'Mahony in the 2013 general election, capturing 49.15% of votes cast compared to her 36.01% share of the vote. The BC Conservative candidate received 10.77% of the votes, and the Green Party candidate received 4.07%.http://www.elections.bc.ca/docs/rpt/2013GE/CHH.pdf  Political views and controversy  Throness has leaned towards conservative political and social views, and has made anti-LGBTQ comments. In July 2020 he defended advertising in the socially conservative Christian lifestyle magazine, The Light Magazine. The magazine routinely hosts articles supporting conversion therapy, which attempts to \\"convert\\" individuals to a heterosexual orientation and treats same sex attraction as a mental illness. Throness was defiant, stating \\"he would advertise in the magazine again because it aligns with his values as a “Biblical Christian” and it’s an important way to reach his constituents.\\" In an online all-candidates meeting on October 14, 2020, prior to the 2020 British Columbia general election, Throness compared the NDP's plan for free birth control to eugenics, the discredited theory of selective mating for \\"desirable\\" traits. Throness was quoted as saying \\"And maybe they’ll have fewer babies so there will be fewer poor people in the future. And to me, that contains an odour that I don’t like and so I don’t really support what the NDP is doing there and that’s my answer.” Following his comments he was removed from the BC Liberal Party's candidate slate, but is continuing to campaign for reelection as an independent.Mike Hall, \\"Former BC Liberal candidate Laurie Throness running as independent\\".

NOFAS was founded in 1990 and advocates for improved public policy for people affected by FASD, provides resources for people living with FASD, and educates the public about FASD and the risks of drinking alcohol while pregnant. NOFAS has a network of over 40 affiliates around the United States. NOFAS works in collaboration with several U.S. government agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2010, the CDC awarded a four-year cooperative agreement to NOFAS to increase FASD support services. Tom Donaldson serves as director of NOFAS. He has been interviewed for the Chicago Tribune. Kathy Mitchell serves as vice president and national spokesperson. Ms. Mitchell has written about FASD for The Partnership at Drugfree.org. The NOFAS Advisory Board includes many prominent supporters, including U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski, John McCain, Orrin Hatch, and Tom Coburn, FASD experts Sterling Clarren, Kenneth Jones, and Philip May, TV producer Neal Baer, and others. NOFAS takes the position that no amount of alcohol is safe to consume during pregnancy and opposes the view that light drinking during pregnancy (an occasional glass of wine) is safe.

The hurricane season officially began on May 15 in the East Pacific, coinciding with the formation of Tropical Storm Alvin, and on June 1 in the Central Pacific; it ended on November 30 in both basins. These dates conventionally delimit the period during each year when most tropical cyclones form. The final system of the year, Tropical Storm Sonia, dissipated on November 4\\\\. The season produced twenty-one tropical depressions. All but one further intensified into tropical storms and nine further intensified to become hurricanes. Despite this level of activity, only one hurricane – Raymond – strengthened into a major hurricane. The most significant storm, in terms of loss of life and damage, was Hurricane Manuel. Forming in mid-September, Manuel attained its peak as a minimal Category 1 hurricane before moving ashore the coastline of Mexico. In total, the storm contributed to 123 confirmed fatalities and $4.2 billion (2013 USD) in damage. Throughout the duration of the season, four other named storms – Hurricane Barbara and tropical storms Juliette, Octave, and Sonia – made landfall in Mexico, causing minor damage and loss of life. This timeline includes information that was not released in real time, but derived from post-season analyses by the National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center; as a result, it may include storms that were not operationally warned upon. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season.

It is at the intersection of County and Clayton streets in downtown Waukegan, near the county government complex. The library has approximately 205,000 books as of 2011, and recorded a total of 338,615 library visits in fiscal year 2005. In addition to its main location in downtown Waukegan, the library operates a branch in Hinkston Park, on the city's northwest side. In 2013, the Waukegan Public Library was selected as one of ten recipients of the National Medal for Museum and Library Service, \\"the nation's highest honor conferred on museums and libraries for service to the community and celebrates institutions that make a difference for individuals, families, and communities,\\" awarded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. The award was based on the library's successful work in providing literacy and ESL instruction. The library has also received the Public Library Association's Upstart Innovation Award on three occasions. History The original Carnegie library As with many towns across the United States, Waukegan was served by private subscription libraries for many decades before acquiring a public library. The first of these was the \\"Little Fort Reading Room and Library Association\\", housed in the courthouse and established in 1845. This was followed by the Young Men's Association Library in the 1860s, and finally by the Sesame Club in the 1890s, which sought to establish a free public library. After successfully operating a free library for two years, the Club appealed to the Waukegan city government for support, and in 1898 the Waukegan Public Library was formally created when the city took ownership of the Sesame Club's library. However, the library still lacked an actual building. This situation was not remedied until 1903, when the Carnegie Foundation provided $25,000 to the city to support construction of a library building, in exchange for the city providing a building site and guarantee of annual support. The Carnegie library, which still stands as of 2013, was located at the corner of Sheridan Road and Washington Street. During the 1930s, the library provided a frequent refuge for the young Ray Bradbury, who later willed his personal book collection to the library. In the 1950s, as Waukegan's expanding population began to exceed what the small Carnegie library could serve, the library began to operate bookmobiles, the first coming into service in 1956 and the second in 1962. The \\"Friends of the Waukegan Public Library\\" organization was formed in 1963. The limestone building currently occupied by the Waukegan Public Library, located at the corner of County and Clayton streets, was opened for business on December 27, 1965. A major renovation in 1998 added some 16,000 square feet, while remaining faithful to the building's original esthetic. In 2008, based on analysis of the need for literacy exposure among Waukegan kindergarten students, the library opened a 2,000-square-foot Early Learning Center in the children's department. Further renovations the following year created an area known as the \\"Literacy Suite\\", which hosts one-on-one and group tutoring in literacy and computer skills. After Shimer College moved to Waukegan in 1979, much of the school's library was housed in the basement of the Waukegan Public Library, due to the school itself having insufficient space. This made it nearly unique among municipal libraries in housing a college's main collection within its own. The college and library maintained numerous ties, including the painting of a mural on \\"the Art of the Story\\" on the library building in 2004. After Shimer left for Chicago in 2006, the basement space that had been used for the Shimer collection was repurposed. Services and holdings As of 2005, the Waukegan Public Library held 224,390 books and serial volumes, or 2.55 for every person in its service area. It also held more than 18,000 video materials and more than 16,000 audio materials. Circulation in 2005 was 479,603, nearly 2 checkouts per resource and more than 5 per capita. As of 2011, the library had 73 computer terminals for library users. The library offers tutoring and small group classes in computer skills. The city of Waukegan has a Hispanic population more than three times that of Illinois as a whole. 55% of Waukeganites are non-native speakers of English. In recognition of this, the library offers extensive educational programs in English as a second language. In 2012, it began the \\"Promotoras Ambassador Program\\", which sends trained volunteers into the community to better assess the types of library programs that are needed. Among the initiatives that the library embarked upon based on the feedback from the community ambassadors was the Conversational ESL Program, which in its first year graduated 255 students, most of whom went on to receive GEDs. Children's programs offered by the library include the Bus to Us program, which was established in 2011 in response to the effect of cuts to funding for field trips by public schools, which had left many children without any way to reach the library. In 2013, the But to Us program received the Upstart Innovation Award from the Public Library Association, a branch of the American Library Association. In 2015, the library underwent a remodel of its main floor in order to meet the needs of its patrons by creating spaces for collaboration and quiet study and increasing the number of classrooms. A central meeting room features a movable wall enabling it to divide easily into two classrooms, and the new floor plan also features several open group workstations. The workstations, found just around the corner from the study rooms and opposite the Friends’ Book Sale, provide comfortable seating for five, with flatscreens enabling patrons to link up their laptops and collaborate. https://www.waukeganpl.org/a-brief-history-of-the-library/ Ray Bradbury Creative Contest The Waukegan Public Library hosts an annual creative contest for artists and authors in honor of Waukegan native Ray Bradbury.

Symptoms include excessively red, swollen eyes as well as subconjuntival hemorrhaging. Currently, there is no known treatment and patients are required to merely endure the symptoms while the virus runs its five- to seven-day course. While it was first identified in Ghana, the virus has now been seen in China, India, Egypt, Cuba, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Pakistan, Thailand, and the United States.  Signs and symptoms  The conjunctiva provides lining for the inside of the eyelid as well as a coating for the sclera, the white portion of the eyeball. It typically serves to provide lubrication for the eye through the production of mucus and tears. When infected with AHC, patients will experience painful, red eyes, swelling of the conjunctival tissue, and frequent mucus discharge from the eyes accompanied by excessive tearing and subconjunctival hemorrhaging. This hemorrhaging is caused by the rupture of blood vessels beneath the conjunctiva giving the eyes a bright red appearance. Some patients also experience blurry vision and fever in addition to the common symptoms and one in every ten thousand cases exhibits paralysis similar to that of polio.  Cause  There are three main viruses that have been studied and confirmed as the agents responsible for AHC, including enterovirus 70, coxsackievirus A24 variant (CA24v) and adenovirus 11. AHC can only exist in a human host and is transmitted through human contact with an infected individual or object, such as a towel used by an infected person. It is also easily communicable through fecal-oral pathways, thus allowing for its abundance in areas of the world with low levels of hygiene. Within one to two days of infection, symptoms will begin to become apparent. Enterovirus 70 Enterovirus 70 is a member of the genus of viruses called Enterovirus and family of the viruses Picornaviridae. Usually very small (about 30 nm in diameter), it is non- enveloped (meaning it only has a nucleic acid core and protein capsid) and has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome; the protein capsid the virus itself is surrounded by is icosahedral. It is known as one of the newer enteroviruses within this category. It spreads easily from one person’s eyes to another’s through contact with infected objects, like fingers, or through the eye secretion itself. Enterovirus 70 infrequently causes polio-like permanent paralysis. Coxsackievirus A24 variant The Coxsackievirus is another member of the genus of viruses called Enterovirus and family of the viruses Picornaviridae. Its isolation host is human. It is an antigenic variant of the Coxsackievirus A24. It was studied independently for the first time in Singapore in 1970. Adenovirus 11 Adenoviruses are a medium-sized variant that are nonenveloped, like Enterovirus 70. They have a double- stranded linear DNA genome. There are 57 variants of this virus, that each cause 5-10% of upper respiratory infections in humans. These viruses are some of the largest nonenveloped viruses in existence, and because of this, they can pass through the endosome without any necessary envelope fusion. Diagnosis  Treatment  There is no treatment currently available. The virus generally resolves itself within a five to seven day period. The use of steroids can actually cause a corneal microbial superinfection which then requires antimicrobial therapy to eliminate.

Marcia was then joined with three other women to help teach the college. The first undergraduate class consisted of 35 women and they graduated in 1964. A Master of Science in Nursing program was added in 1969, followed by a PhD in nursing program in 1987. In 2001 the college established the nation's first Doctor of Nursing Practice program, which eventually led to a discontinuation of the masters program.

He was performing in chamber concert groups and teaching full-time. While on vacation with his first wife, they decided to see the ballet nearby just as something to do. He went to the Nederlands Dans Theater, a premier theatre company that, unbeknownst to him, was putting on a ballet of Carmina Burana. After watching the ballet, it inspired him when he got back home to switch to half-time teaching and study ballet. He met Austin Tichenor (of Reduced Shakespeare Company) when Parlato joined the Metropolitan Ballet of Oakland (not the Oakland Ballet) as a featured solo dancer and Tichenor was stage manager.

The family is named after the size of the genomes relative to other nidoviruses, with Meso coming from the Greek word mesos, which means medium, and ni being an abbreviation of nido. Mosquitoes are the natural reservoir of all known viruses in this family. Classification Mesoniviridae is a member of the order Nidovirales, an order of +ssRNA viruses with animal hosts. The family has only one subfamily, Hexponivirinae, which contains only one genus, Alphamesonivirus. There are 8 subgenera and 10 species in Alphamesonivirus. *Order Nidovirales **Family Mesoniviridae ***Subfamily Hexponivirinae ****Genus Alphamesonivirus *****Casualivirus ******Alphamesonivirus 4 *****Enselivirus ******Alphamesonivirus 8 *****Hanalivirus ******Alphamesonivirus 5 *****Kadilivirus ******Alphamesonivirus 7 *****Karsalivirus ******Alphamesonivirus 2 ******Alphamesonivirus 3 *****Menolivirus ******Alphamesonivirus 9 *****Namcalivirus ******Alphamesonivirus 1 *******Cavally virus (CavV) *******Dak Nong virus (DKNV) *******Nam Dinh virus (NDiV) ******Alphamesonivirus 10 *****Ofalivirus ******Alphamesonivirus 6 The discovery and phylogenetic analysis of four additional mesoniviruses in 2013, named Hana virus, Méno virus, Nsé virus and Moumo virus, has suggested that they represent at least three new species of mesoniviruses. Additionally, in 2014 four potentially new species were discovered in Australia, Indonesia, and Thailand, named Casuarina virus, Karang Sari virus, Bontag Baru virus, and Kamphaeng Phet virus, respectively. As of February 2015, these discoveries have yet to be ratified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). Structure and genome Members of this family are enveloped, spherical in shape and 60–80 nm in diameter with club-shaped surface spikes. There are eight major structural proteins, including a nucleocapsid protein (25 kDa in weight), four differentially glycosylated forms of the membrane protein (20, 19, 18 and 17 kDa) and the spike (S) protein (77 kDa), which is cleaved to produce two S protein subunits (23 and 57 kDa). The genomes are linear, positive-sense, polycistronic, single-stranded RNA, and are about 20,000 nucleotides in length, with a 3' poly(A) tail and seven major open reading frames (ORFs). Two overlapping ORFs are at the 5'-end, encoding the major non-structural proteins and are expressed as a fusion protein by ribosomal frameshift. ORFs 1a and 1b contain six replicase domains, as well as the 3'-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) that controls RNA replication fidelity and a 2'-O-methyltransferase, both of which are found in larger nidoviruses. ORF 1b also encodes an N7-methyltransferase. History The family is relatively new, having only been discovered in 2011. The first virus, which was named Nam Dinh virus, was found in the Vietnamese province of Nam Định. The second virus, named Cavally virus, was then found in Côte d'Ivoire. These two viruses were later found to be of the same species. A third member of this first species, named Dak Nong virus, was later found in Culex tritaeniorhynchus populations in Vietnam. In 2013, four more mesoniviruses were discovered in mosquito populations, all within Côte d'Ivoire, and in 2014 four mesoniviruses were discovered in mosquito populations in Australia, Indonesia, and Thailand.

He worked with the architects George Frederick Bodley and George Gilbert Scott Junior, the designer William Morris and the church craftsman Charles Eamer Kempe on many Victorian Gothic revival churches, Cambridge college interiors and church restorations. He was born in Cambridge, where his father, Richard Hopkins Leach was an artist and craftsman. It is uncertain how he was educated, although he clearly was highly literate and erudite, with a good knowledge of art and literature. At 17 he resolved to use his talents for God. A sincere member of the Church of England, his personal beliefs tended towards low church Anglicanism. His preferred place of worship was Christ Church, Cambridge, an early Victorian structure, where he made the east window, but he worked on many high church (or Anglo-Catholic) commissions, thinking that this was for the glory of God, employing the maxim 'to work is to pray'. In 1862 he bought a premises in City Road, Cambridge, which became both his home and the headquarters of his business as an artist-craftsman. As his trade expanded he established a showroom in St Mary's Passage, on the west side of Market Hill in Cambridge.Halliday, op. cit., 5–7. He emerged as a nationally known artist- craftsman in 1866, when he worked with Bodley and Kempe on the decoration of St John the Baptist's church at Tuebrook in Liverpool and with William Morris on the ceiling decorations of the chapel of Jesus College Cambridge.Robinson and Wildman 1980, 33–6. Subsequent collaborations with Bodley included the roof and organ loft of St Botolph's Church, Cambridge, the interior decoration of St Salvator's Church, DundeeHall, 1980, 136; Halliday 2016, 16–17. and the decoration of the dining hall in Queens' College, Cambridge. He was responsible for much of the decorations of the walls and ceilings of All Saints, Cambridge, one of Bodley's most significant works. He also carried out Morris's redesign for the roof of the Oxford Union in 1875 Frederick Leach was a close friend of Charles Eamer Kempe, doing much to help Kempe start as a stained glass craftsman, although their relationship seems to have cooled after 1872.Hall, 2014, 158; Halliday, 2016, 9–11, 14–15. In 1866 Leach was contracted by William Beaumont to paint the organ pipes and front during the restoration of St Michael's, Cambridge, and, after Beaumont's death, by George Gilbert Scott Junior for the reredos over a two-year period from 1872 to 1874 at a fee of £203-16-2. In 1874, Leach painted the roof, without payment, as a thanks offering to God. Frederick Leach's most significant original commission was probably the interior decoration of St Clement's Church, Cambridge. Here he was responsible for the entire interior decoration, which included some elaborate wall paintings that he personally devised and executed. Much of this has been lost, apart from the rood beam, and an impressively large painting on the east wall of the chancel showing Jesus as the divine head and great high priest of the church, surrounded by biblical figures and saints.Robinson and Wildman, 1980, 25; Halliday, 2016, 12–13. Other Cambridgeshire commissions included the windows of St Peter's, Barton. Leach painted the sundial of Queens' College Cambridge in 1864 and his firm was to repaint it in 1911. In 1880 he received a prestige commission to work on the interior of St James's Palace in London, although it is uncertain how much of his work might have survived.Halliday, op. cit. 20. Frederick Leach married Mary Ann Goodenough in 1864: they had four sons who grew to adulthood: Barnett (1864–1949), Frederick (1869–1948), Walter (1870–1934) and Charles (1875–1961). While Charles emigrated to Canada, his three older sons went into business with him: thus his company name was changed to 'F. R. Leach and Sons'. In 1893 Frederick moved from City Road to a new 'arts and crafts' style house, 'St George's' in De Freville Avenue in Chesterton, a village on the north side of Cambridge. He died on 18 December 1904 and was buried in the churchyard of St Andrew's Church, Chesterton.Halliday, op. cit., 5, 24, 26. Frederick's three older sons, Barnett, Frederick and Charles continued the family business as artist- craftsmen, but financial difficulties led to the company being placed into liquidation in 1916. After this the brothers pursued separate careers.Halliday, op. cit., 27, 29. David Parr House David Parr, an employee of F. R. Leach and sons, decorated the interior of his house in an elaborate neo-Gothic style. The house, 186 Gwydir Street, Cambridge, opened to the public in May 2019 and became a Grade II* listed building in 2020.

Vancouver Sun, May 15, 2013. He was elected to represent the electoral district of Surrey- Fleetwood as a member of the British Columbia Liberal Party. He was appointed by Premier Christy Clark as Minister of Education in June 2013, then Minister of Community, Sport and Cultural Development & Minister Responsible for TransLink in July 2015. Early profession Fassbender was born in Germany and emigrated to Canada with his parents in 1952. Since then, he has lived his whole life in Surrey. He graduated from Queen Elizabeth High School in Surrey and attended the National Broadcasting School in Vancouver. He got a film librarian job at CHAN Television (now Global) and moved up the ranks to cameraman, and then producer and director. He worked for advertising agency James Lovick in the early 1970s and eventually became a partner of Frank Palmer at national firm DDB Canada (formerly Palmer Jarvis). A major focus of his private sector career focused on social marketing campaigns including smoking cessation projects for Health Canada and international marketing activities for Industry Canada. In 1996 and 1997 he was reported to have done volunteer public relations work for the evangelical men's organization Promise Keepers.\\"11,000 'take charge of family' Christian men plan rally at Coliseum\\". Vancouver Sun, November 15, 1996. He is a distant cousin of actor Michael Fassbender. Politics After a failed run at a Social Credit nomination, Fassbender served a four-year term (1975 to 1979) during some turbulent years on the Langley school board. During that time, the board pursued a 'back-to- basics' approach that considered restoration of corporal punishment and banning the Go Ask Alice novel. Fassbender says his approach to education has changed since the 1970s. Fassbender was elected for the first time to the city council of Langley in 2002, and then as mayor in the 2005, 2008 and 2011 civic elections. He advocated for the growing communities south of the Fraser River as co-chair of the municipal advisory council for Fraser Health and as vice- chair of TransLink's mayors council. In November 2012, the provincial government appointed Fassbender as chair of the board for the BC Pavilion Corporation, which operates BC Place Stadium and the Vancouver Convention Centre. In addition to dealing with major renovations, the position also dealt with transparency criticism from journalist Bob Mackin. In the 2013 provincial election, he defeated three-term NDP MLA Jagrup Brar and took leave from his mayoral position. As Minister of Education, one of his priorities was to seek a 10-year labour agreement with the British Columbia Teachers' Federation. In addition to his ministerial duties, Fassbender sat on the Cabinet Committee on Secure Tomorrow.Legislature Bio In 2017 provincial election, he lost his re- election as MLA to Jagrup Brar. In 2018, he ran for his former position as mayor of the City of Langley. He was narrowly defeated, losing to Val van den Broek by around 200 votes.

He was executed because of his activities in the so-called \\"Belter Group\\", which was named after him.  Life and education  Between 1936 and 1945, Herbert Belter attended middle school in Rostock. His desire to graduate from high school was at first prevented by the chaos after the war. From October 1946 to 1948, Belter instead took up an apprenticeship as a business clerk at the business school in Rostock. During this time, he also worked for the Rostock harbour authorities in Rostock and took evening school classes. After receiving his high school diploma from evening school in July 1949, he applied at the Leipzig University. He enrolled as an Economics and Social Sciences student in October 1949.\\"Ich habe mich illegal betätigt\\" Universitätsjournal 7/99, Universität Leipzig (German)  Political resistance and execution  At the university, Belter increasingly witnessed political repression and forced ideological alignment of the university's institutions. Despite of being warned by a wave of arrests of democratic students, the dissolution of the student council and the imprisonment of its chairman Wolfgang Natonek in 1948, Belter decided to take up opposition work. He gathered a group of like-minded students around him and started to pass information about the situation in East Germany to the RIAS. He also began to distribute leaflets at the university to counter the SED's information monopoly - just like the White Rose group against Nazi Germany about ten years before. On the occasion of the first \\"elections\\" of the People's Chamber, the group distributed leaflets which called for free elections in the inner city of Leipzig. On his way back home, Herbert Belter was arrested by the police. A subsequent house search delivered further leaflets and writings as well as information on Belter's comrades. The police handed over the members of the Belter group to the KGB. The prisoners were transferred to Moscow and put to trial in a secret proceeding. On January 20, 1951, Herbert Belter was sentenced to death as the group leader. His nine comrades were mostly sentenced to 25 years of heavy labor. During the trial, Belter admitted the accusations put up against him: \\"I have acted illegally because I was dissatisfied with the situation at the Leipzig University. We didn't have freedom of thought, freedom of speech and freedom of press.\\" Herbert Belter was executed on April 28, 1951 under exclusion of the public. The trial and the execution remained secret until the incidents could be reconstructed after the opening of Russian archives in 1990. The Russian judiciary has officially rehabilitated Belter on May 23, 1994.http://bundesstiftung- aufarbeitung.de/wer-war-wer-in-der-ddr-%2363%3B-1424.html?ID=196 (German) Belter's body was cremated and his ashes were thrown in a mass grave at the Donskoi Cemetery.

Genealogy and Birth Iarlaithe was a member of the Dál Fiatach, a ruling dynasty centered on Downpatrick in east Ulster who were named after Fíatach Finn, a High King of Ireland who reigned in the 1st century A.D. Several of Iarlaithe's close family were saints. His twin brother was Saint Séadna, whose feast day is 16 June. His paternal uncle was St. Laoghaire of Dún. His paternal first cousins were St. Eoghan of Killchlethe, St. Niall of Killchlethe, St. Dichu of Saul (Feast 29 April), St. Duthracht of Nendrum (Feast 16 May), St. Ailill of Moville (Feast 12 January) and St. Ross of Dun da Leithglass (Feast 7 April). Iarlaithe's genealogy is- “Iarlaithe -i. epscop m Treana m Fecc m lomchadha m Breasail m Siorchadha m Fiattaigh Finn m Daire m Dluthaigh m Detsin m Eathach m Sin m Rosin m Triuin m Roitriuin m Airnil m Maine m Forgo m Fearadhaig m Oilella érann m Fiacha firmara m Aonghasa tuirmigh temhrach m Echach foiltletain m Oilella caisfhiaclaigh m Connla cruaidcelgaigh m Irereo gleofhataigh m Melge molbthaigh m Cobthaigh caoilbregh m Ughoine moir”Genealogiae Regum et Sanctorum Hiberniae, Paul Walsh (Ed.), Dublin 1918, p. 83, section 15. This genealogy is also confirmed in the Naemsenchus Náemh nÉrenn as- “Iarlaithe mac Trena truim dias ciallach nachar traicc treoin do Dail fFiatach na fireoin”.Naemsenchus Náemh nÉrenn, in Irish Texts, Fraser, Grosjean & O’Keeffe (Ed’s.), London 1931, Fasc. III, p. 62, section 142. However the genealogy seems incomplete as their obits imply about 10 generations between Iarlaithe and Fiatach Finn rather than the five generations given in the genealogies. The Vita tripartita Sancti Patricii gives the following account of Iarlaithe's birth.- ‘Patrick once went on the road of Midluachair, to go into the land of Ulster, and there he met with wrights who were felling a yew-tree. Patrick saw that the blood came through the palms of the slaves at the felling. “Whence are ye?”; saith Patrick. “We are slaves” say they, “to Trian son of Fiacc, son of Amalgad, a brother of Trichem’s. We are in bondage and in great tribulation, and we are not allowed even to sharpen our irons against a flagstone, so that it may be the worse for us, and so that it may be the more difficult. Wherefore blood comes through our hands.”; Patrick blessed the irons so that they became the more easily used, and he went to the king, to Rath-Trena. And Patrick fasted against him. Trian did nothing for him. Patrick turned on the morrow from the fortress.He cast his spittle on the rock which lay on his road, and the rock broke into three. A third part of the spittle was then flung a thousand paces. Patrick said: ”Two thirds of the fasting on the rock, a third on the king and on the fort and on the district. There will be of Trian’s children neither king nor crown-prince. He himself shall perish early and shall go down into bitter hell.” Trian himself went to bind and beat the slaves who had given an account of him. His horses drag him and his charioteer off in his chariot, and went into the lake. Loch Trena is its name; that was his last fall. He will not come out of that lake until the vespers of Doomsday; and it will not be for happiness even then. The king's wife went after Patrick. She repented, she fell on her knees. Patrick blessed her womb and her children, namely, Setne, son of Trian and larlaide, son of Trian. Sechnall baptized Setne. Patrick baptized Iarlaide; and Patrick said that he would afterwards be a successor of his.The Tripartite Life of Patrick, Whitley Stokes (ed.), London 1887, Part I, pp.219-221. Clonfeacle Church After his ordination St. Jarlath was assigned to the church of Clonfeacle, which was founded by St. Patrick. The 12th century Book of Leinster states- “Iarlaithe mac Trena o Chluain Fiacla” (i.e. Iarlaithe, son of Trena, from Cluain Fiacla)The Ancient List of the Coarbs of Patrick, by Rev. H. J. Lawlor and R. I. Best in PRIA, Vol. XXXV (1919), p. 319, No. 5. Chluain Fiacla has been identified with the church of Clonfeakle, in the townland of Tullydowey, parish of Clonfeacle, partly in the baronies of Armagh and Oneilland West, County Armagh, but chiefly in the barony of Dungannon Middle, Co. Tyrone. This identification is certainly correct as the present church of Clonfeacle is named St. Jarlath’s. That it was also so called in medieval times is evident from papal documents. For example the entry in the Lateran Regesta for August 1446 states- To the abbot of St. Patrick's, Newry, in the diocese of Dromore, and the archdeacon and the official of Dromore. Mandate (the pope having been informed by Thomas Oculean, clerk, of the diocese of Armagh, that Solomon Ocorra, rector called prebendary of the parish church of St. Yrlatheus the Bishop, Cluoynfechana, in the diocese of Armagh, wont to be governed by canons of Armagh only, has, when excommunicate and publicly proclaimed excommunicate, celebrated and taken part in masses and other divine offices in contempt of the Keys, thereby incurring irregularity, and has committed simony) if Thomas, who, on account of the inordinate favours which Solomon has in the city and diocese of Armagh, has no hope of obtaining justice therein, will accuse Solomon before them, etc. as usual, to summon Solomon, and if they find the above to be true, to deprive him, and in that event to make provision to the said Thomas of a canonry of Armagh and collate and assign to him the said rectory called a prebend, value not exceeding 14 marks sterling.

Bishop of Armagh On the death of Saint Benignus of Armagh, the Bishop of Armagh, on 9 November 468, Iarlaithe was appointed as the 4th successor to Saint Patrick. Iarlaithe reigned as Bishop for 13 years. Iarlaithe is sometimes confused with St. Iarlaithe mac Loga of Tuam. Death Iarlaithe died on 11 February 481.

The 1925 French two-seat fighter programme was cancelled before any orders were placed, but four examples were exported to Argentina. Design and development The D.25 was a tandem two- seat version of the Dewoitine D.21 single-seat, parasol-wing fighter, developed to the 1925 C2 (2 seat Chasseur or fighter) programme from the Section Technique de l'Aéronautique (Technical Section of Aeronautics, STAé) for an aircraft capable of daytime and nighttime fighter duty and daytime reconnaissance. The chief structural difference between the two models, which shared the same span and length, was the D.25's second cockpit itself and the fuselage strengthening around it to allow a gun mounting. Though the two- seater was heavier, it had a less powerful engine: it used a Lorraine-Dietrich 12Eb water-cooled upright W-12 instead of the similarly arranged Hispano-Suiza 12Gb. Both the D.21 and D.25 had much in common with the Dewoitine D.12 of 1924. For example, the D.25's parasol wing was similar to that of the D.12, with the same span, a constant chord inner panel, outer sections tapered on both the leading and trailing edges but chiefly on the latter, ending in blunt tips. It was braced to the lower fuselage by a parallel pair of long struts on each side. The D.12 and D.25 used the same Lorraine-Dietrich engine with a circular nose-mounted radiator immediately behind the propeller. Flight testing of the D.25 began in 1926 but the STAé dropped the 1925 C2 programme. Dewoitine therefore sought to export it and in 1928 gained an order for four from Argentina. These were armed with two pairs of fixed Madsen machine guns, one fixed and fitted with synchronisation, firing forward through the propeller arc, and the other on a gun mounting in the rear cockpit. The construction of these machines was sub-contracted to the Hanriot aircraft company.

They play in Peoria, Illinois, United States at the Carver Arena. The team replaced an American Hockey League franchise of the same name that was purchased by the Vancouver Canucks and moved out of Peoria to Utica, New York. The Rivermen are one of the few teams in the SPHL outside the southern United States, along with the Bloomington Thunder (2013–14 season only), the Evansville Thunderbolts (since the 2016–17 season), and the Quad City Storm (since the 2018–19 season). Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Rivermen are one of several SPHL teams to not participate in the 2020–21 season. History On May 13, 2013, it was reported by the Journal Star that after being told the city would no longer have an AHL team, former Rivermen executives John Butler and Bart Rogers and former Rivermen owner Bruce Saurs announced that they had applied for admission into the Southern Professional Hockey League in an attempt to save hockey in Peoria. The SPHL is a low-minor hockey league with teams mostly based in the southeastern United States. Butler and Rogers' plan also included for the group to purchase the Bloomington Blaze of the struggling Central Hockey League and also move them to the SPHL. There was an SPHL Board of Governors and franchise general managers emergency conference call scheduled for the morning of May 14, 2013, to decide on the admission of the Rivermen and the Blaze. On May 15, 2013, it was officially announced that the team had been accepted into the SPHL, along with the newly named Bloomington Thunder, ending the uncertainty of whether Peoria would have a minor professional hockey team in the coming year. Both teams were owned by Illinois Pro Sports, LLC. The Thunder would be shut down after one season when another ownership group obtained an expansion team in the junior United States Hockey League for Bloomington, isolating the Rivermen in the north. In 2017, the majority ownership of the Rivermen was sold to CSH International Inc., the same owners of the Bloomington USHL franchise, with the former owners, Bart Rogers and John Butler, staying on with minority ownership.

Allí en La Bajadilla , en las mismas calles en donde alumbró su arte genial maestro Paco de Lucía, Canelita, aún un chiquillo , descubre que posee el don de la voz. Allí le escuchamos, sentado en el peldaño de una escalera frente a su casa entonando los sonidos negros de los cantes viejos. Canelita respira fandangos y bulerías, sus cantes preferidos , pero también rumba y tangos. Desde pequeño, ligado a artistas de la talla de Morenito de Illora, Manzanita que fué quien le puso el nombre de Canelita, cuando en la grabación del disco ‘Homenaje al Chino de Málaga‘ éste lo escuchó y dijo este niño es ‘canela fina‘, desde entonces se le quedó el nombre de Canelita. Su primer trabajo, ‘Vivo errante’(2004), se publicó hace años, apenas siendo un niño y fue toda una revelación dentro del mundo flamenco. Sin aditivos ni colorantes, sin grandes campañas de promoción, se está convirtiendo poco a poco en una realidad del cante en nuestro país y sus seguidores ya se cuentan por miles. Una vida difícil y sin florituras, que sin duda hace más profundo su cante. Que le hace auténtico y jondo por los cuatro costados.

He and his second wife, Stella Scott Gilman (originally from Alabama), were the originators (1879) of Private Collegiate Instruction for Women (familiarly known as the Harvard Annex), of which he became executive officer. The new school, which employed Harvard professors, was organized so that women could enjoy instruction equal in quality to the instruction that Harvard men received. In 1882 the school became the Society for the Collegiate Instruction for Women. In 1894 it was reorganized as Radcliffe College, for which Gilman was regent until 1895. In 1886, he founded and became director of the Cambridge School for Girls (now The Cambridge School of Weston). Most of his studies were in the fields of English literature and history.

They are based at the 18th Street Arts Center in Santa Monica, California. YBLA stages public installation art and performances to help expand the definition of public art to embrace street art, Urban Interventionism and ephemera. Collaborative art making, community building, public outreach, blurring boundaries between contemporary art practices, graffiti and craft are integral components to YBLA's practice.  History  YBLA organically grew out of a series of participatory yarn bombing events in Los Angeles, California. Inspired by the book Yarn Bombing: The Art of Crochet and Knit Graffiti by Mandy Moore and Leanne Prain, Heather Hoggan of Arroyo Arts Collective and Amy Inouye of Future Studio decided to organize Fig Knit On in October 2010. The event took place on Figueroa Street in Highland Park, Los Angeles and had 19 local participants. The group stayed together when Fig Knit On participant Arzu Arda Kosar invited Hoggan to another yarn bombing at the 18th Street Arts Center on June 18, 2011 and 12 of the Fig Knit On participants signed on. What followed was a six month process of putting together Yarn Bombing 18th Street where local participants met monthly at Kosar’s 18th Street studio and some even developed additional projects such as the Empathy Circle. Yarnbombing 18th Street formed a Facebook page and was soon joined by 50 local and international cohorts who signed up to create their own original site- specific installations. Due to the diversity of the participants, Yarn Bombing 18th Street ended up becoming an international survey of the yarn bombing movement showcasing a wide variety of installations that ranged from the highly political to whimsical to conceptual pieces. The event deliberately coincided with the 18th Street Arts Center's Debating Through the Arts event by Inez S. Bush & Jerri Allyn, who was a member of the Woman's Building, and so Yarnbombing 18th Street was therefore presented in relation to a movement that questioned established art practices on material, technical, and conceptual levels. The group then yarn bombed their own cars outside the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles’s Art in the Streets show in August 2011 to bring yarn bombing to the attention of street art lovers. By then the group adopted the collective name Yarnbombing Los Angeles (YBLA). The core members, participants and level of involvement among collaborators have been fluid based on project.  Art  YBLA activities range from knit graffiti workshops for Los Angeles Unified School District teachers, students, and their parents, to installing hugging trees around town, ongoing participatory projects such as the Urban Letters and Forest for the Trees and interactive installations such as the Wishing Tree and “Wish I Were Here” pillows. YBLA’s largest endeavor to date is CAFAM Granny Squared, a self-produced grassroots project that brought together an international community of over 500 artists and crafters to cover the façade of the Craft and Folk Art Museum with granny squares to make a statement about artistic and institutional identities. CAFAM Granny Squared was installed in May 2013 and dismantled in September 2013. Leftover contributions were assembled into blankets as part of a collaboration with the Downtown Women's Center.Janet Owen Driggs, \\"Unraveling the CAFAM Yarn Bomb,\\" Artbound (July 3, 2013). Christopher Knight, art critic at the Los Angeles Times, referred to the installation as \\"wonderfully weird,\\" \\"jarringly playful,\\" and \\"disconcertingly fuzzy,\\" while placing it into a context with Minimalist repetition and Bauhaus textile arts.Christopher Knight, \\"Yarn Bombing L.

The news channel report stated that dentists at the chain were paid bonuses for the amount of dental work that was performed, and that the clinics of the chain separated children from parents and had performed unnecessary dental work.

It was officially announced on 18 September 2012 in London, UK. The RAZR i is the first smartphone by Motorola to feature an Intel Atom \\"Medfield\\" processor/SOC of the x86/IA-32 architecture, running a x86 port of the Android operating system. It is also the first smartphone with a CPU clocked at 2.0 GHz in its stock configuration. Externally, it looks identical to its sibling Motorola RAZR M launched two weeks earlier in the US, with which it also shares many of its specs. The RAZR i is an almost identical edition except it has an Intel Atom Z2460 processor., which gives it more processing power and imaging power; although it lacks LTE support. Initially it was reported that it does not fully support many high-end apps and games designed for ARM processors until these apps or games are ported and recompiled for Intel compatibility. However, Intel developed a binary emulator called Houdini that is present on the RAZR i, to allow ARM code to run on x86 architecture.https://murlengine.com/news/?murllang=en&murlnews;=2014-08-12_android_x86_support A test showed that the RAZR i was able to run most ARM Android apps thanks to the background emulation, but that a few apps would still not function.https://www.chip.de/test/Motorola-RAZR_i-Handy-Test_139890819.html A special China-only version of the smartphone, the RAZR i MT788 was announced in November, 2012. The GPU in the RAZR i's Intel Atom Z2460 processor is a PowerVR SGX540, a faster-clocked version of the same GPU as in the Samsung Galaxy Nexus and many older smartphones such as the original Samsung Galaxy S. While the RAZR i's raw CPU processing power can be excellent for tasks such as web browsing, its GPU can be considerably slower than the RAZR M, which uses a Snapdragon S4 CPU featuring an Adreno 225 GPU. This may be alleviated somewhat by the Atom Z2460 being capable of providing much greater memory bandwidth, which has traditionally been a severe performance-constraining factor in ARM- based chips. Despite being the first product from a \\"multi-year, multi-device\\" partnership between Motorola and Intel,https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/18/3351024/motorola-intel-medfield- phone-announcement no other Intel-powered Motorola smartphone was ever released afterwards.

History   Mutualism  Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, the first self-identified anarchist, supported a free-market anarchism called mutualism Mutualism began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in France and others in the United States.Wilbur, Shawn (2006). \\"More from the 1826 \\"Mutualist\\"?\\". \\"A member of a community\\". The Mutualist. This 1826 series criticised Robert Owen's proposals and has been attributed to a dissident Owenite, possibly from the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests of Valley Forge. Proudhon proposed spontaneous order, whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a \\"positive anarchy\\" where order arises when everybody does \\"what he wishes and only what he wishes\\"Proudhon, Solution to the Social Problem, ed. H. Cohen (New York: Vanguard Press, 1927), p. 45. and where \\"business transactions alone produce the social order\\". Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist, but rather with socialist factions of workers movements and in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives he also promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service. Mutualism is concerned with reciprocity, free association, voluntary contract, federation and credit and currency reform. According to the American mutualist William Batchelder Greene, each worker in the mutualist system would receive \\"just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount\\".Greene, William Batchelder (1875). \\"Communism versus Mutualism\\".

Tucker influenced and interacted with anarchist contemporaries—including Lysander Spooner, Voltairine de Cleyre, Dyer D. Lum and William B. Greene—who have in various ways influenced later left-libertarian thinking.Martin, James J. (1970). Men against the State: The Expositors of Individualist Anarchism in America.

The doyen of modern American market-oriented libertarianism, Austrian School economist Murray Rothbard, was initially an enthusiastic partisan of the Old Right, particularly because of its general opposition to war and imperialism.Raimondo, Justin (2001). An Enemy of the State: The Life of Murray N. Rothbard. Amherst, New York: Prometheus. However, Rothbard had long embraced a reading of American history that emphasized the role of elite privilege in shaping legal and political institutions—one that was naturally agreeable to many on the left—and came increasingly in the 1960s to seek alliances on the left—especially with members of the New Left—in light of the Vietnam War,Raimondo, Justin (2001).

Rothbard argued that the consensus view of American economic history, according to which a beneficent government has used its power to counter corporate predation, is fundamentally flawed. Rather, he argued, government intervention in the economy has largely benefited established players at the expense of marginalized groups, to the detriment of both liberty and equality. Moreover, the robber baron period, hailed by the right and despised by the left as a heyday of laissez-faire, was not characterized by laissez-faire at all, but it was in fact a time of massive state privilege accorded to capital.Kolko, Gabriel (1977).

In tandem with his emphasis on the intimate connection between state and corporate power, he defended the seizure of corporations dependent on state largesse by workers and others.Rothbard, Murray (15 June 1969). \\"Confiscation and the Homestead Principle\\".

Anti-capitalist libertarianism was the dominant form of libertarianism in the United States through much of the 19th century and early 20th century, but it declined since the mid-to-late 20th century, although it has recently aroused renewed interest in the early 21st century. The Winter 2006 issue of the Journal of Libertarian Studies published by the Mises Institute was dedicated to reviews of Kevin Carson's Studies in Mutualist Political Economy.Carson, Kevin (Winter 2006). \\"Carson's Rejoinders\\".

Drawing on the work of Rothbard during his alliance with the left and on the thought of Hess, some thinkers associated with market-oriented libertarianism came increasingly to identify with the left on a range of issues, including opposition to war, to corporate oligopolies and to state-corporate partnerships as well as an affinity for cultural liberalism. One variety of this kind of libertarianism has been a resurgent mutualism, incorporating modern economic ideas such as marginal utility theory into mutualist theory. Kevin Carson's Studies in Mutualist Political Economy,Carson, Kevin. \\"Studies in Mutualist Political Economy\\". .

This book was the focus of a symposium in the Journal of Libertarian Studies. While other market-oriented left-libertarians have declined to embrace mutualist views of real property, they share the left-libertarian opposition to corporate hierarchies and wealth concentration.See Long, Roderick T.

In the 21st century, the Really Really Free Market movement is a horizontally organized collective of individuals who form a temporary market based on an alternative gift economy. The movement aims to counteract capitalism in a proactive way by creating a positive example to challenge the myths of scarcity and competition. The name is a play on words as it is a reinterpretation and re-envisioning of free market, a term which generally refers to an economy of consumerism governed by supply and demand.  Theorists   Kevin Carson  Kevin Carson describes his politics as on \\"the outer fringes of both free market libertarianism and socialism\\". He has identified the work of Benjamin Tucker, Thomas Hodgskin, Ralph Borsodi, Paul Goodman, Lewis Mumford, Elinor Ostrom, Peter Kropotkin and Ivan Illich as sources of inspiration for his approach to politics and economics.Carson, Kevin (17 August 2012). \\"Introductions – Kevin Carson\\". The Art of the Possible. Center for a Stateless Society. Retrieved 21 March 2020. In addition to individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker's \\"big four\\" monopolies (land, money, tariffs and patents), Carson argues that the state has also transferred wealth to the wealthy by subsidizing organizational centralization in the form of transportation and communication subsidies. He believes that Tucker overlooked this issue due to Tucker's focus on individual market transactions whereas Carson also focuses on organizational issues. The theoretical sections of Studies in Mutualist Political Economy are presented as an attempt to integrate marginalist critiques into the labor theory of value.Carson, Kevin (28 June 2006). \\"Preface\\".

The primary focus of his most recent work has been decentralized manufacturing and the informal and household economies. In response to claims that he uses the term capitalism incorrectly, Carson says he is deliberately choosing to resurrect what he claims to be an old definition of the term in order to \\"make a point\\". He claims that \\"the term 'capitalism,' as it was originally used, did not refer to a free market, but to a type of statist class system in which capitalists controlled the state and the state intervened in the market on their behalf\\".Carson, Kevin (Winter 2006). \\"Carson's Rejoinders\\". Journal of Libertarian Studies. 20 (1): 97–136. Carson holds that \\"capitalism, arising as a new class society directly from the old class society of the Middle Ages, was founded on an act of robbery as massive as the earlier feudal conquest of the land. It has been sustained to the present by continual state intervention to protect its system of privilege without which its survival is unimaginable\\".Richman, Sheldon (March 2011). \\"Libertarian Left\\".

Carson coined the pejorative term vulgar libertarianism, a phrase that describes the use of a free market rhetoric in defense of corporate capitalism and economic inequality. According to Carson, it is derived from the term vulgar political economy, a phrase which Karl Marx described as an economic order that \\"deliberately becomes increasingly apologetic and makes strenuous attempts to talk out of existence the ideas which contain the contradictions [existing in economic life]\\".Marx, Karl (1863).

Gary Chartier  Gary Chartier offers an understanding of property rights as contingent yet tightly constrained social strategies, reflective of the importance of multiple, overlapping rationales for separate ownership and of natural law principles of practical reasonableness, defending robust but non- absolute protections for these rights in a manner similar to that employed by David Hume.Chartier, Gary (2013). Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society. New York: Cambridge University Press. pp. 44–156.

Chartier uses this account to ground a clear statement of the natural law basis for the view that solidaristic wealth redistribution by individual persons is often morally required, but as a response by individuals and grass-roots networks to particular circumstances rather than as a state-driven attempt to achieve a particular distributive pattern.Chartier, Gary (14 September 2009).

He has argued that proponents of genuinely freed markets should explicitly reject capitalism and identify with the global anti-capitalist movement while emphasizing that the abuses the anti-capitalist movement highlights result from state-tolerated violence and state-secured privilege rather than from voluntary cooperation and exchange. According to Chartier, \\"it makes sense for [left-libertarians] to name what they oppose \\"capitalism.\\" Doing so [...] ensures that advocates of freedom aren't confused with people who use market rhetoric to prop up an unjust status quo, and expresses solidarity between defenders of freed markets and workers – as well as ordinary people around the world who use \\"capitalism\\" as a short-hand label for the world-system that constrains their freedom and stunts their lives\\".  Theory  Arguing that vast disparities in wealth and social influence result from the use of force and especially state power to steal and engross land and acquire and maintain special privileges, members of this thought typically urge the abolition of the state. They judge that in a stateless society the kinds of privileges secured by the state will be absent and injustices perpetrated or tolerated by the state can be rectified. These left-libertarians rejects \\"what critics call \\"atomistic individualism\\". With freed markets, they argue that \\"it is we collectively who decide who controls the means of production\\", leading to \\"a society in which free, voluntary, and peaceful cooperation ultimately controls the means of production for the good of all people\\".Richman, Sheldon (16 November 2014). \\"Free Market Socialism\\". Reason. Retrieved 10 January 2020. According to libertarian scholar Sheldon Richman, left-libertarians \\"favor worker solidarity vis-à-vis bosses, support poor people's squatting on government or abandoned property, and prefer that corporate privileges be repealed before the regulatory restrictions on how those privileges may be exercised\\", seeing Walmart as a \\"symbol of corporate favoritism\\" which is \\"supported by highway subsidies and eminent domain\\", viewing \\"the fictive personhood of the limited-liability corporation with suspicion\\" and \\"doubt[ing] that Third World sweatshops would be the \\"best alternative\\" in the absence of government manipulation\\". These left- libertarians \\"tend to eschew electoral politics, having little confidence in strategies that work through the government. They prefer to develop alternative institutions and methods of working around the state\\". Gary Chartier has joined Kevin Carson, Charles W. Johnson and others (echoing the language of Stephen Pearl Andrews, William Batchelder Greene, Thomas Hodgskin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Lysander Spooner, Benjamin Tucker and Josiah Warren, among others) in maintaining that because of its heritage and its emancipatory goals and potential, radical market anarchism should be seen by its proponents and by others as part of the socialist tradition and that market anarchists can and should call themselves socialists.See Gary Chartier, \\"Advocates of Freed Markets Should Oppose Capitalism,\\" \\"Free-Market Anti-Capitalism?\\" session, annual conference, Association of Private Enterprise Education (Cæsar's Palace, Las Vegas, NV, April 13, 2010); Gary Chartier, \\"Advocates of Freed Markets Should Embrace 'Anti-Capitalism'\\"; Gary Chartier, Socialist Ends, Market Means: Five Essays.

Contemporary free-market left-libertarians show markedly more sympathy than American mainstream libertarians or paleolibertarians towards various cultural movements which challenge non- governmental relations of power. Left-libertarians such as Long and Johnson have called for a recovery of the 19th-century alliance with libertarian feminism and radical liberalism.Long, Roderick T.; Johnson, Charles W.

In particular, Long has described the situation as such:  Property rights  Left-wing market anarchism does not have any strict agreement what constitutes legitimate property titles. Arguments have been made for Georgist, homestead, Lockean mutualist, neo-Lockean and utilitarian approaches to determining legitimate property claims. Those discrepancies are resolved through deliberation mechanisms like the polycentric law. They also recognize the importance of property held and managed in common as a way of maintaining common goods.Long, Roderick T. \\"A Plea for Public Property\\". Panarchy.org.

This strand of left-libertarianism tends to be rooted either in the mutualist economics conceptualized by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, American individualist anarchism, or in a left-wing interpretation or extension of the thought of Murray Rothbard.Carson, Kevin (28 September 2012). \\"The Left- Rothbardians, Part I: Rothbard\\".

Some of these libertarians follow Rothbard and other natural rights theorists and cite the non-aggression axiom as the basis for their economic systems while others follow David D. Friedman and base it on consequentialist ethical theories. These left-Rothbardian libertarians consider private property rights to be individual natural rights deriving from the primary right of self-ownership. Like Rothbard, they endorse the use of any tactic to bring about market anarchy so long as it does not contradict their libertarian moral principles.Lora, Ronald; Longton, Henry (1999). The Conservative Press in Twentieth-Century America. Greenwood Press. p. 369.  Tuckerites  American individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker, known for his libertarian journal Liberty, abandoned the natural rights conception of property rights in free-market anarchism for a Stirnerite egoism Benjamin Tucker originally subscribed to the idea of land ownership associated with mutualism which does not grant that this creates property in land, but rather holds that when people customarily use given land and in some versions goods other people should respect that use or possession. Unlike with property, ownership is no longer recognized when that use stops.Swartz, Clarence Lee. What Is Mutualism?. \\"VI. Land and Rent\\". Under mutualism, there would be no market in land that is not in use. The mutualist theory holds that the stopping of use or occupying land reverts it to the commons or to an unowned condition and makes it available for anyone that wishes to use it.Carson, Kevin. Studies in Mutualist Political Economy. Chapter 5.Long, Roderick T. \\"Land-Locked: A Critique of Carson on Property Rights\\". Journal of Libertarian Studies. 20 (1). Tucker would later abandon natural rights theory and argued that land ownership is legitimately transferred through force unless specified otherwise by contracts: \\"Man's only right to land is his might over it. If his neighbor is mightier than he and takes the land from him, then the land is his neighbor's, until the latter is dispossessed by one mightier still\\".Tucker, Benjamin (31 December 1892). \\"Response to 'Rights,' by William Hansen\\". Liberty. 9 (18): 1. He expected that individuals would come to the realization that the \\"occupancy and use\\" was a \\"generally trustworthy guiding principle of action\\" and that individuals would likely contract to an occupancy and use policy.Tucker, Benjamin (6 April 1895). \\"The Two Conceptions of Equal Freedom\\". Liberty. 10 (24): 4.  Rothbardians  Classical liberal John Locke argues that as people apply their labor to unowned resources, they make those resources their property. For Locke, there are only two legitimate ways people can acquire new property, namely by mixing their labor with unowned resources or by voluntary trade for created goods. In accordance with Locke's philosophy, Rothbardian free-market anarchists believe that property may only originate by being the product of labor and that its ownership may only legitimately change as a result of exchange or gift. They derive this homestead principle from what they call the principle of self-ownership. Locke had a proviso which says that the appropriator of resources must leave \\"enough and as good in common to others\\", but Murray Rothbard's followers do not agree with this proviso, believing instead that the individual may originally appropriate as much as she wishes through the application of her labor and that property thus acquired remains hers until she chooses otherwise, terming this as neo-Lockean. Anarcho-capitalists see this as consistent with their opposition to initiatory coercion since only land which is not already owned can be taken without compensation. If something is unowned, there is no person against whom the original appropriator is initiating coercion. They do not think that a claim of and by itself can create ownership, but rather that the application of one's labor to the unowned object as for example beginning to farm unowned land. They accept voluntary forms of common ownership, meaning property open to all individuals to access. Samuel Edward Konkin III, the founder of agorism and the Movement of the Libertarian Left, was also a Rothbardian and is considered a prominent figure within the modern left- libertarian movement in the United States.Burton, Daniel (2002). \\"Smashing the State for Fun and Profit Since 1969: An Interview With the Libertarian Icon Samuel Edward Konkin III (a.k.a.

Further positioning it on the left, agorism embraces the notion of class war and entails a distinctly libertarian analysis of class struggle and stratification.\\" Although anarcho-capitalism has been regarded by some as a form of individualist anarchism,See the following sources: * Alan and Trombley, Stephen (Eds.)

History 8151 was built at Crewe Works in 1942 by the LMS as one of the 8F Class, following nationalisation in 1948 the 40000 was added to the engine's original number and so in 1949 it was renumbered to 48151. From new the engine was allocated to Grangemouth TMD and was to spend over thirteen years at Grangemouth before being transferred to Canklow in July 1955. Other sheds the engine was allocated to included: Staveley in January 1963, Edge Hill (8A) in April 1964 and finally Northwich in March 1966. The engine remained at Northwich for its remaining working career for British Railways until January 1968 when the engine was withdrawn from service.http://www.railuk.info/steam/getsteam.php?row_id=11675 RailUK info regarding 48151's history 48151 was one of the last 359 steam engines operating on British mainline railways, those still in service in 1968. Preservation 48151 was sold to Woodham Brothers at Barry for scrap arriving there in September 1968 and remained there until November 1975 when it was purchased for preservation. 48151 was based at the Embsay and Bolton Abbey Railway for a number of years but its restoration was not completed there. It was then bought by David Smith and after its heavy restoration was completed in 1988 at Carnforth MPD it was certified for mainline use and is today operated by West Coast Railways (WCR) working steam charters across the UK visiting places never visited before by an 8F. 45699 Galatea' working back to Carnforth from the Mid Norfolk Railway in triple headed formation 48151 & 45690 Leander shunting their empty coaches in Blaenau Ffestiniog after arriving with \\"The Conwy Quest\\" railtour. In November 1995, it was loaned for a short time to Tunstead Quarry to haul a 975-ton train of hopper wagons, and five years later in December 2000, it also worked a special one-off freight train along the Settle and Carlisle line from Hellifield to Ribblehead Quarry where the hopper wagons were loaded and it then worked the loaded train on from Ribblehead Quarry to Carlisle. Also in 2000, it made its first operational visit to a heritage railway, when it visited the Great Central Railway for a brief period in June of that year, as well as making a brief visit back to Staveley the following month, now the Barrow Hill Engine Shed. In October 2003, 48151 worked its first train over Shap Summit since the end of steam in 1968, the charter was operated by WCR and ran from Carnforth to Carlisle via Shap both ways. In August 2008, 48151 worked the Liverpool to Manchester leg of the Fifteen Guinea Special reenactment which was celebrating 40 years since the ending of steam on BR in August 1968, it was covering for 45110 as its mainline certificate had run out. This was also to be the first time since 1966 that 48151 had visited Liverpool since being allocated to Edge Hill. In August 2010, it became the first member of its class to work over the Conwy Valley Line. The train was the Railway Touring Company's Welsh Mountaineer from Preston to Blaenau Ffestiniog running via Chester and Llandudno Junction, the section from Chester to Llandudno Junction being tender first due to the train reversing direction at the junction alongside the fierce 1 in 47 gradient in the Blaenau direction. The engine has visited the route on a number of occasions in July and August 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2018 with other trips being worked by 45231 The Sherwood Forester, 46115 Scots Guardsman or 61994 The Great Marquess.

The three engines travelled from Carnforth to Dereham on Thursday, 29 May in triple headed formation along with a set of coaches as most of the Mid-Norfolk Railway's coaches weren't vacuum braked. The three engines then ran at the MNR's West Coast Railways steam gala from Friday, 30 May to Sunday, 1 June and then on Monday, 2 June, the three engines returned to Carnforth once more travelling as a triple headed formation. Also in June, it worked only its second train over Shap Summit for the first time since October 2003, the train in question was the Railway Touring Company's Cumbrian Coast Express that ran from London Euston to Carlisle on Saturday, 14 June. The 8F took over the train at Carnforth and worked northbound over Shap's 1 in 75 to Carlisle with the return leg being via Whitehaven and Grange-over-Sands on the Cumbrian Coast and Furness Lines. In July 2018, it worked only its third train over Shap Summit in preservation, the train in question was the Railway Touring Company's Cumbrian Mountain Express that ran from London Euston to Carlisle on Saturday, 21 July. On the engines two previous trips up Shap the engine worked its train alone but due to there being a restricted use of steam engines on Network Rail tracks owing to the hot weather at the time 48151 was assisted by a class 47 diesel no 47237.

The name of the village was Spata until 17 January 1957. The Monastery of St. Nicholas is a short distance from the village, which gave it its current name. The monastery was built about 200 years ago, on the site of where they found the holy image of Saint Nicholas, causing further development. There are two versions that tell the story of how the icon was found. The first is that the icon was found by a single shepherd who followed one of his animals, leading him to the source of saint from which it drank water. The second that other shepherds were herding their animals across the monastery mountain when they suddenly saw a flash that traveled from west to east, ending at the location the monastery now stands. Upon investigation, they found the icon at that site. Celebration In Orthodox Christianity the day of honor to Saint Nicholas is 6 December. Orthodox Christians honour saint Nicholas on 10 May and in some places on 20 May. Saint Nicholas of Spata celebrates two of those days (6 December and 10 May). The great pilgrimage is during May. Pilgrimage The road to Saint Nicholas of Spata is widely famous in Greece and especially in Western Greece. Every year a week before and a week after of the celebration of Saint Nicholas on 10 May, many people from all around Greece travel the route of Saint Nicholas.

Of these, 370,000 are in state-run institutions while the others are either in foster care or have been adopted. Reports have ranged saying that between 66-95% of all of these children are considered social orphans, meaning that one or more of their birth parents are still alive. Historical background After the collapse of the Soviet Union, there was an increase in the number of orphans. In 1995, there was a reported 300,000 children in the orphanage system. Although difficult to accurately count, there are an estimated 1 million to 5 million homeless youth. The number of orphanages has increased by 100% between 2002 and 2012 to 2,176. Some of the reasons for children to end up in the orphanages are domestic abuse, parental substance abuse, having lost their parents, or being found alone on the streets. As for those who are social orphans there are various reasons why they end up in orphanages. For instance one girl's parents were told when she was born that she wouldn't live long so her parents refused to take her. Other children have been abandoned due to reasons such as their disabilities, or their parent's drug or substance problems. Conditions in orphanages There have been reports over the years that the conditions in the orphanages are not providing proper mental and physical care. Researchers have stated that children 3 and under lose one IQ point for every month spent inside. Children adopted from Russia are also more likely than any other country to have fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Doctors visiting some of these institutions have even reported seeing toddlers sitting alone, rocking back and forth, staring blankly, or even banging their heads against walls. Children in the 1990-s were often not provided with proper nutrition and were not given quality living and sleeping conditions RIAN archive 635660 Orphans and disabled children are celebrating Christmas Transitions out of state institutions Children are sometimes returned to their orphanage. This is not always due to the wishes of adoptive parents; instead, sometimes children will find it difficult to adjust to living outside of the orphanage and will request to return. In 2011, it was estimated that as many as 4,600 children were returned by their adoptive or foster parents. In the 1900s, at the age of 16, children have to leave the orphanages. Approximately 15,000 children leave Russian orphanages each year, usually at the age of 16 or 17. They are given housing, benefits, and a stipend, but often are not given sufficient advice or direction on how to transition into the world. The education that they are given is often lacking. Some institutions only provide the children with six grades worth of schooling. This takes away the opportunity to go onto higher education and many will go into vocational schools that only offer a few trades to study. Statistics have shown that of these youth only 4% are admitted to universities, 50% fall into a high-risk category, 40% become involved in crime, 10% commit suicide, 33% stay unemployed, and 20% become homeless. Adoption ban In late 2012, Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the Dima Yakovlev Law, prohibiting Russian children from being adopted by American citizens. Those in favor of the bill attributed the need for it to the cases of abuse that have been caused by American adoptive parents. They felt as if the punishment for these parents have been mild for the extent of their crimes. For cases where children had been tortured and have died, only 19 times have the parents been convicted of violent child treatment. Russia's proposed plans to compensate for the loss of American adoptions are to encourage domestic adoptions, boost aid to foster families, facilitating adoption procedures, and raising benefits for foster children.

The organization is made up of all members of the Maldivian Democratic Party who are 18 to 35 years old. A Humble Start On June 26, 2005, the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) became the first political party to be registered in the Republic of Maldives. Beginning with just 40 members, the MDP is now the largest political party in the Maldives, with over 40,000 registered members. The MDP prides itself in promoting policies that best reflect the priorities of Maldivians. Aside from the values of human rights and democratic practice, which are ingrained in all of the Party's activities, the MDP's policies encapsulate the Maldivian people's want of a state and society that provides both security and the opportunities for innovation and success. Youth For Change The MDP always strives to be in touch with the pulse of the population and with over 35% of Maldivian society being made up of individuals between the ages of 18-35, the MDP acknowledges the essential role of youth involvement in all sectors of politics and development. For instance, the MDP recognised that the pre 2008 constitution's voting age of 21 disenfranchised large sections of the country from major national decision making processes, and thereby campaigned the Special Majlis, with success, to lower the voting age to 18. The national democratic reform process demonstrated the influence and the extent to which the youth of the country were invested in the future of a democratic Maldives, when youth from across the nation joined together in activities such as ‘Badhalakah Emmen’, ‘Youth for Change’, and ‘Wathan Edhey’, combining young people's opinions, energy, and creativity in a powerful effort to bring change. The establishment of the MDP's youth wing in 2010 sought to institutionalise youth involvement across the Party. This was initiated with the election of the Youth Wing's President, Aminath. The youth wing has since taken a leading role in policy formulation, campaigning, street activism and fundraising, using the power of art, music, and social media to make sure that the MDP continues to be a voice for the youth of the Maldives.

History In 2004, Ivanov and Neustrom started DavisWiki, an experimental project to collect and share local information about the town of Davis, California, editable by anyone. It became a large and active community wiki. According to its founders, at least half of the local residents use it. The LocalWiki project aims to provide \\"institutional memory\\" and context for local news. LocalWiki is built on the Django framework in Python. In June 2010, LocalWiki won a $350,000 grant from the Knight News Challenge. After winning the grant to develop the software, they ran a Kickstarter project to raise $25,000 to help fund outreach, which was successful. In December 2011, the project announced its first \\"focus community\\", Denton, Texas. Its second focus community was the Triangle region of Durham, North Carolina, with initial contributions about transportation infrastructure and parks, and a goal of compiling information about historic events. A nonprofit in Tallahassee, Florida helped start TallahasseeWiki with knowledge from residents. The LocalWiki project for Oakland, California is supported by volunteers meeting in person to collaborate on historical information. In 2012 the LocalWiki team assembled a comprehensive high- definition map of the Antarctic continent, available on \\"Open Antarctica\\", a LocalWiki instance for Antarctica. Neustrom explained that the map was \\"pieced together from very-hard-to-find NASA aerial imagery and coastline datasets\\". In April 2015, Idmloco focused on Davis LocalWiki as part of a public relations operation for U C Davis chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi.http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/education/article94733812.html  Functionality  The LocalWiki software includes a WYSIWYG editing interface to help make editing simpler. It also includes mapping features: each article can have an associated annotated map, and the website has an overview map with those annotations. Notable LocalWiki communities As of 2013, major LocalWiki communities include Santa Cruz County, California; Oakland, California; Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina; Denton, Texas; Ann Arbor, Michigan;Ann Arbor’s wikipedia: Writing what you know about in town, Ann Arbor Observer, July 2013 and Tokyo, Japan.

It usually affects females; many males die before birth or not long after. The disorder is associated with a mutation in the CASK gene. As with the vast majority of genetic disorders, there is no known cure to MICPCH. The following values seem to be aberrant in children with CASK gene defects: lactate, pyruvate, 2-ketoglutarate, adipic acid and suberic acid, which seems to backup the proposal that CASK affects mitochondrial function. It is also speculated that phosphoinositide 3-kinase in the inositol metabolism is impacted in the disease, causing folic acid metabolization problems.

The Province, May 15, 2013. He represents the electoral district of Vancouver- Quilchena. He served as Minister of Justice and Attorney General from June 12, 2017 until an NDP minority government was sworn in the following month. He previously served as Minister of Advanced Education from December 18, 2014 \\"Andrew Wilkinson-Today's BC Liberals\\" . BC Liberal Website, April 8, 2017. and the Minister of Technology, Innovation and Citizens' Services from June 10, 2013. He was the deputy minister of the British Columbia Ministry of Economic Development from 2003 to 2006, where he was responsible for economic issues, trade and tourism. He also served as deputy minister for Intergovernmental Relations in the Premier's Office for two years from 2001 to 2003. Early life and education Wilkinson was born in Brisbane, Australia. His family immigrated to Canada when he was four and he grew up in Kamloops. Wilkinson attended medical school at the University of Alberta. Three years into school, he was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at the University of Oxford where he obtained his first law degree. He then returned to the University of Alberta to finish his M.D. After medical school, Wilkinson worked for a few years as a doctor in Campbell River, Lillooet and Dease Lake before making the switch to law. He received his L.L.B. from Dalhousie University in 1987 and was called to the British Columbia bar in 1988. Wilkinson was president of the BC Civil Liberties Association from 1993 to 1995. In 2006, after leaving his post as a deputy minister in Gordon Campbell's BC Liberal government, Wilkinson joined the Vancouver office of McCarthy Tétrault, a major national law firm, where he practised as a litigator. Politics Wilkinson served as the president of the BC Liberal Party from 1998 to 2001. After the party formed the largest majority government in the province's history in 2001, party leader Gordon Campbell appointed Wilkinson to be the deputy minister responsible for intergovernmental relations. In 2003, he was transferred to the position of deputy minister for the Ministry of Small Business & Economic Development. In 2006, he returned to the private sector by becoming a partner in the Litigation Group of McCarthy Tétrault He remained active in Liberal politics in the intervening years, having served as riding president of former federal minister Stephen Owen and BC campaign co-chair to Michael Ignatieff's leadership campaign in 2006. With the 2013 election approaching and Colin Hansen retiring in his Vancouver-Quilchena riding, the 54-year old Wilkinson stood for the BC Liberal nomination. He was contested by Vancouver City Councillor Suzanne Anton but won the contest, with Anton being shifted to the Vancouver-Fraserview riding where another BC Liberal incumbent was retiring. He easily won the Vancouver-Quilchena riding in the 2013 British Columbia general election with over 60% of the vote as his party won the election and formed a majority government. 40th Parliament As the 40th Parliament of British Columbia began, Premier Christy Clark appointed Wilkinson as the Minister of Technology, Innovation and Citizens' Services on June 10, 2013. In the role, he was responsible for the selloff of government land. Amongst the sales was 5750 Panorama Drive in Surrey to Fairborne Lands LTD that had been previously earmarked as the site for a new hospital by premier Gordon Campbell. The deal was questioned in the media for being three million dollars under the appraised market value. Wilkinson also oversaw the designing of the BC Services Card to combine drivers' licenses and CareCards. On December 17, 2014, Premier Clark had Wilkinson and Amrik Virk exchanged Ministries and Wilkinson became the new Minister of Advanced Education. In this role, he introduced his first two bills, both on February 11, 2015. The Chartered Professional Accountants Act (Bill 4) merged chartered accountants, certified general accountants and management accountants into one professional regulatory body. The Private Training Act (Bill 7) repealed the 37th Parliament's Private Career Training Institutions Act and moved regulation to the Private Training Institutions Branch of the Ministry of Advanced Education, ending the industry's ability to self-regulate. In 2016, he introduced one final bill before the parliament ended, the Sexual Violence and Misconduct Policy Act which requires all public post-secondary institutions establish a sexual misconduct policy. In 2015, as Minister of Advanced Education, Wilkinson told a CBC interviewer that \\"...70 per cent of students go through their higher education with no debt whatsoever,\\". The Canadian Federation of Students called his statement \\"completely untrue\\" and pointed to a B.C. Stats report from 2013 which recorded that, in fact, close to half of all B.C. students leave school with debt. Following a January, 2017 article in The New York Times entitled \\"British Columbia: The 'Wild West' of Canadian Political Cash\\" Wilkinson was delegated to speak on behalf of the BC Liberal party, saying: \\"No one gets special treatment by being a campaign donor,\\" and \\"It's a system that works.\\" B.C. has since banned corporate and Union donations. During the 41st Parliament Wilkinson sponsored several private member bills. On September 13, 2017, he introduced the Election Amendment Act, 2017 (Bill M-201) which proposed to ban corporate and union political donations, impose a $5,000 annual limit for political contributions by individuals, ban loans except from Canadian banks or credit unions and ban in- kind donations of staff. 41st Parliament In the 2017 BC election Wilkinson again ran for office with the BC Liberal Party in the Vancouver- Quilchena riding and was reelected with 56% of the vote. The BC Liberal Party won the largest number of seats on election night but not enough to form a majority government. This led to their defeat on a confidence vote on June 29, 2017. The NDP and the BC Greens came to an agreement to allow the NDP to form government. Incoming Premier John Horgan appointed fellow NDP Vancouver MLA David Eby to replace Wilkinson as Minister of Justice and Attorney General. = BC Liberal leadership race = Once the BC Liberal Party leadership election was underway to replace Christy Clark, who had announced her resignation on July 28, 2017, Wilkinson announced his candidacy on September 25. He made the announcement at the Pan Pacific Hotel in Coal Harbour with fellow BC Liberal MLAs Michelle Stilwell, Mary Polak and John Rustad, Doug Clovechok and Tom Shypitka endorsing him. He was eventually endorsed by 13 MLAs, the most of any candidate. On the initial ballot he placed third, behind Dianne Watts and Michael Lee, but the contest was decided by ranked voting so that by the fifth and final ballot Wilkinson won with 53% and became leader of the BC Liberal Party and the official opposition on February 3, 2018. At its subsequent annual convention, the party under Wilkinson unveiled a new brand identity with the slogan \\"Opportunity for All of B.C.\\" to replace Clark's \\"Today's BC Liberals\\". = Electoral reform = In the 2018 British Columbia electoral reform referendum, the BC Liberal Party under Wilkinson's leadership registered third-party advertising sponsors to support retaining the existing First-past-the-post voting system and reject a proportional representation system. On November 8 he participated in a province-wide televised debate against Premier John Horgan who argued in favour of proportional representation. The result of the referendum was 61% in favour of continuing with the current first-past-the-post voting system. = Legislation = During the 41st Parliament Wilkinson sponsored several private member bills. On September 13, 2017, he introduced the Election Amendment Act, 2017 (Bill M-201) which proposed to ban corporate and union political donations, impose a $5,000 annual limit for political contributions by individuals, ban loans except from Canadian banks or credit unions and ban in-kind donations of staff. While the bill did not proceed, the provisions were adopted in a more comprehensive government bill, Election Amendment Act, 2017 (Bill 3) that same year. On May 14, 2018, he introduced the Strata Pre-Sale Contract Flipping Tax Act, 2018 (Bill M-217) which sought to make 50% of the profit made in selling a condominium before it is available for occupancy subject to income tax. Again, while the bill did not proceed, the government, in Real Estate Development Marketing Amendment Act, 2018 (Bill 25), that same year made these contracts subject to the property transfer tax.

History  The first version of SWAD appeared in September 1999. In 2005 its use was extended to the University of Granada. The application was released as free software in January 2010 under Affero General Public License, version 3. In 2010 the system was used by 1,100 professors and 35,000 students. In 2011 it was used by 2,000 professors and 60,000 students in 2,800 courses. SWAD is currently available in 9 languages and used in the University of Granada Alt URL Alt URL Alt URL Alt URL Alt URL and the portal OpenSWAD.org. In November 2019 SWAD installation at the University of Granada housed 488 degrees (including undergraduate and graduate) with 7496 courses, 126060 students and 3514 teachers. The objectives addressed in the development of the platform SWAD can be specified depending on its potential beneficiaries: 50px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Australia license. * For teachers and other administrators of the platform, the objectives were carrying through internet the management tasks related to a course and its students, and improved mentoring and general communication with them. * For students, the objectives have been improved access to materials and information of the courses, the possibility of self-assessment at a distance, and the improvement of the communication both student-student and student-teacher. A fundamental criterion at the development of the platform has been to facilitate its use by users, emphasizing both the ease of learning and use for students and teachers (usability), and the time saving and quality improvement in various tasks related to teaching. For the institution or company, SWAD has the additional advantage of being fast and efficient, consuming very little computer resources, so being suitable for low-cost installations. Compared to other tools used for the same purpose, since its implementation in C language, SWAD does not require a big hardware and software infrastructure, even in large universities, being sufficient a single server.  Technical specifications   Server  SWAD core is a CGI programmed in C comprising almost all the functionality of the platform. The core is supplemented with some external programs like photo processing module and chat module. The server runs on a Linux system with Apache and a MySQL or MariaDB database.  Clients  Being a web application, the client can be any modern web browser. To use the chat you must have Java runtime environment. Besides the web client, there is an M-learning application for Android devices called SWADroid, which implements some of the most used features in the web version.  Hierarchy and roles   Hierarchical organization  SWAD can accommodate in a single platform one or multiple educational organizations. It uses the following hierarchical structure: * Countries * Institutions (universities, academies, organizations, companies,...) * Centres (faculties, buildings,...) * Degrees (degrees, masters,...) * Courses * Group types (lectures, practicals, seminars,...) * Groups (A, B, morning, afternoon,...) The central element of this hierarchy is the course, which can register several teachers and students.  Roles  Each user has a role of student, non-editing teacher or teacher at each of the course in which he/she is enrolled. In addition, some users may be administrators of one or more degrees, centres or institutions, as well as global administrators of the platform.

There are two chains of lakes, the northern chain and the southern chain. The northern chain extends across three cities: Winter Haven, Lake Alfred, and Lake Hamilton. It has ten lakes, connected by a series of canals. The ten lakes on the northern chain are Lake Haines, Lake Rochelle, Lake Echo, Lake Conine, Lake Fannie, Lake Smart, Lake Henry, Lake Hamilton, Middle Lake Hamilton, and Little Lake Hamilton. The southern chain is located almost entirely within the city of Winter Haven. It has 16, sometimes 18, lakes connected by a series of canals. The principal 16 lakes on the southern chain are Lake Howard, Lake Cannon, Lake Shipp, Lake Jessie, Lake Hartridge, Lake Lulu, Lake Roy, Lake Eloise, Little Lake Eloise, Lake Winterset, Little Lake Winterset, Lake May, Lake Mirror, Lake Idylwild, Spring Lake and Lake Summit. When water levels are high, Lake Blue and Lake Marianna also connect to the southern chain.Winter Haven Chain of Lake pre-BMAP Assessment, PBS&J;, FDEP Contract #WM913, Sept 2008 pg1-2 http://www.swfwmd.state.fl.us/documents/numeric- nutrient/ATTACHMENT_R_PBSJ_BMAP.pdf Hydrography Winter Haven and the chain of lakes sit at the headwaters of the Peace River basin. The southern chain has a total surface area of approximately . The largest lake in the southern chain is Lake Eloise, with a surface area of . The smallest lake in the southern chain is Spring Lake, with a surface area of . Paleolimnological studies have shown that the chain of lakes should have naturally high levels of tannins, which are algae and plant nutrients in the water. This creates the brown water color. These levels are scientifically measured using the Trophic state index (TSI), and the chain of lakes should have TSI numbers of 60 or higher.Winter Haven Chain of Lake pre-BMAP Assessment, PBS&J;, FDEP Contract #WM913, Sept 2008 pg1-3 http://www.swfwmd.state.fl.us/documents/numeric- nutrient/ATTACHMENT_R_PBSJ_BMAP.pdf Currently, the majority of the lakes in both chains are officially listed as 'impaired' by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.City of Winter Haven Memorandum, May 14, 2010, \\"Status of Nutrient Criteria / Impaired Waters in Winter Haven\\" http://www.polk.wateratlas.usf.edu/upload/documents/WinterHavenNutrientCriteriaMemoMay2010.pdf This effects how 'swimmable' and 'fishable' the lakes are. The impaired lakes on the southern chain are Lulu, Shipp, May, Howard, Mirror, Cannon, Jessie, Idylwild, Spring, and Roy. The impaired lakes on the northern chain are Conine, Smart, Haines, Rochelle, and Hamilton. These lakes have TSI numbers below 60. The chain of lakes, as the headwaters of the Peace River, are important to the hydrological and environmental health of the region. The city of Winter Haven, Polk County, the Southwest Florida Water Management District, the state of the Florida, and the federal government all have working projects to improve the water quality levels within the chain of lakes. Sometimes these projects work well with each other; sometimes they do not. Rapid urbanization around the chain of lakes threatens their long-term environmental health. Greater care by the residents in the area will be required to preserve the chain of lakes for future generations. History The Calusa were the first people to live in the chain of lakes area. Later, both the Creek and the Seminole were known to live and hunt in this area.\\"The Naming of Lakes in Polk County\\",Joe Spann, Polk County Historical Library, Bartow, 2007, http://www.polk.wateratlas.usf.edu/upload/documents/Naming%20of%20Polk%20Lakes.pdf The Seminole name for the entire chain of lakes is \\"We-hi-ack-pa.\\" The area had no European or American settlement until the Florida Armed Occupation Act of 1842, which created incentives for settlers. Some of the lakes on the chain were named by these early settlers, including Lake Eloise, named for the daughter of the first American settler on that lake. During the 1840s and 1850s, the United States government conducted the first surveys of the area. In 1849, Dr. John Westcott completed an extensive survey of the area. Westcott named several of the lakes on the chain after his personal friends, including Lake Howard, Lake Hartridge, and Lake Conine. Westcott, a devout Christian, also named Lake Canon, in reference to his religious beliefs. However, it was later renamed Lake Cannon by U.S. Army map-makers during the Seminole Wars. Several small battles and skirmishes during the Seminole Wars occurred on the chain of lakes. The Seminole leader Chipco is known to have lived along the shores of Lake Hamilton during the Second Seminole War. In 1883, Henry Plant successfully built the first railroad across Polk County, passing right through the chain of lakes area. Some of the lakes were named by railroad workers at this time. Lake Haines is named for Col. Henry Haines, a senior railroad official. Col. Haines was a prominent civil engineer and helped lay the roadbed used for the railroad tracks to cross the wetlands in this area. Nearby Lake Henry and the neighboring community of Haines City are also named for Col. Haines. The land around the chain of lakes was platted in 1884. By 1900, the area had a population of 400 people. The city of Winter Haven was incorporated in 1911. In the 1920s and 1930s, the citrus industry expanded throughout the area, with thousands of acres of groves along the chain of lakes. John A. Snively played a significant role in developing citrus groves in the area. During this period, many homes in the Colonial Revival architectural style were built along the Chain of Lakes, including most of the historic homes in the Interlaken neighborhood. In 1936, Dick and Julie Pope opened Cypress Gardens on Lake Eloise. Through his efforts to promote his theme park, Dick Pope Sr. helped to make the Chain of Lakes world famous. Chain of Lakes Park was built on Lake Lulu in 1966. The Boston Red Sox, and later the Cleveland Indians, did their spring training there. The park also hosted several minor league teams. The area has continued to grow since then. Transportation The first railroad line built in the area, by Henry Plant and Col. Henry Haines, passed close to Lake Henry and Lake Haines on the northern chain. The major roads passing near the chain of lakes today are U.S. 17, U.S. 92, State Road 544, and State Road 540. Jack Browns Seaplane Base is located on Lake Jessie. In addition, there is a multi-use paved hiking/biking trail known as the Chain of Lakes Trail.

Career Chi-Town Daily News In 2005, Dougherty founded the nonprofit Chicago Daily News, an online-only news organization devoted to hyperlocal coverage of Chicago neighborhoods. The name echoed that of the Chicago Daily News, a newspaper which had folded in 1978 and had been held in high regard by him. He even used Craigslist to advertise for writers. The organization shortly changed its name to Chi-Town Daily News. In 2007, it received $340,000 in funding from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation to build a network of trained citizen journalists to cover their Chicago neighborhoods. The news organization won national attention for its business model and journalism, including coverage in the Washington Post. and Boston Globe. Chi-Town Daily News attracted some criticism from traditional journalists, who argued that citizen journalism would encourage news organizations to lay off full-time, professional reporters in favor of unpaid volunteers incapable of producing high-caliber journalism. Chi-Town Daily News closed in September 2009, citing a lack of available philanthropic funds to continue operations. Chicago Current In 2010, Dougherty and a group of former Chi-Town Daily News reporters launched Chicago Current, an insider political paper modeled after Politico. Computer-Assisted Reporting Before launching the two online newspapers, Dougherty was the computer- assisted reporting editor at the Chicago Tribune, where he undertook investigations on coal mining and food safety. Earlier, he served as computer- assisted reporting editor at the Miami Herald, where he played a key role in the paper's investigation into the flawed presidential election of 2000, and the subsequent effort to examine and analyze all of the discarded ballots in Florida.

Youth in Uganda are the youngest population in the world, with 77% of its population being under 25 years of age. There are 7,310,386 youth from the ages of 15–24 years of age living in Uganda.  Definition of youth  Youth is a socially constructed intermediary phase that stands between childhood and adulthood.Furlong, Andy (2013). Youth Studies: An Introduction. Routledge: New York. UNICEF generally defines youth as being between the ages of 15 and 24 years old. The youth policy defines youth as all young persons, female and male, aged 12 to 30 years.  Demographics  In Uganda the male to female ratio is 100.2 males per 100 females. Life expectancy at birth for males is 42.59 years and 44.49 years for females. Ugandan youth experience different lifestyles depending on if they live in a rural or urban area. Many youth decide to migrate from the rural areas to the urban areas based on factors that include kinship ties and friendship ties, rural incomes, role of rural education, and the rural social system.  Education  Students at the Unyama Primary School in the Unyama IDP Camp. Uganda established Makerere University, its first public university in 1922 and a second public university in 1989. In the early 1990s, Uganda introduced private sponsorship into the public universities. By 2005, there were 27 universities in Uganda and of which 80% were private institutions.National Council for Higher Education. (2006). The state of higher education in Uganda. Kampala: National Council for Higher Education, Ministry of Education & Sports. The youth literacy rates between 2005 and 2010 were 90% for males and 85% for females. Only students who have successfully completed A-levels and passed their Uganda Advanced Certification of Education are eligible to enter post-secondary institutions. There are three types of publicly supported institutions in Uganda. They consist of autonomous institutions, institutions run by the Ministry of Education, and institutes administered by the Public Service Commission. As of 1998, Uganda’s enrollment in universities and institutions of higher education was up to 34,773 students. This is double the rate in 1991 when Uganda only had 17,585 students enrolled. The rate of females in 1998 enrolled was 33 percent of the student population which was an increase from 28% in 1991. Students who are nationals and are on government aide pay nothing for their tuition, pocket money expenses, transportation costs and boarding costs. The Ministry of Education covers all these students in their large annual budget that they receive from the Ministry of Finance. They estimate that they pay around 6,000,000 Ugandan shillings or 3,000 U.S dollars per student that they assist. According to the Young people fact sheet by UNFPA (2014), 78% of young people aged 13–18 years are currently attending school. 10% of those between 10% 6–12 years have never been to school. 22% of adolescents aged 13–18 have dropped out of school. Further still, 8.8 million young people aged 15–24 are not engaged in education, employment or under any training Employment  The unemployment rate for young people in Uganda ages 15–24 is 83%.World Bank. 2008. African Development Indicators 2008/2009. Washington, DC: World Bank This rate is even higher for those who have formal degrees and live in the urban area. This is due to the disconnect between the degree achieved and the vocational skills needed for the jobs that are in demand for workers. Those without a degree are also not able to obtain jobs because they lack the skills needed for the position or they don’t have the resources such as land or capital.Young Leaders Think Tank for Policy Alternatives. A Paper on the Challenges of (Un)Employment in Uganda. Some youth also have negative views on certain jobs so they are unwilling to take them if offered a position. Youth unemployment poses a serious political, economic, and social challenge to the country and its leadership. The cycle is making it increasingly difficult for Uganda to break out of poverty. Young women also more often have to stay at home in a maternal role from a very young age which limits their ability to work. Informal sector work accounts for the majority of young workers in Uganda.Garcia, Marito. 2008. Directions in Development- Human Development. World Bank 3.2% of youth work for waged employment, 90.9% work for informal employment, and 5.8% of the Ugandan youth are self-employed. According to Amamukirori B. & Mubiru A. (2018), in the population report, they indicate that there are wage differentials by gender in favor of the male among the employed youth. The youth in public sector earn more than those in private sector while those in Northern and Eastern region are the least paid. Further more, they highlight the agricultural sector as one that employs the highest number of youth, followed by trade, manufacturing and then the transport sector. The youth unemployment rate which now stands at 6.5%, is attributed it to mismatch between skills obtained through the education system and labour market demands.  Health  Age at sexual debut within this community in 2000 was reported at 16.7 years for young women and 18.2 years for young men, while the median age at marriage was 19.5 years for young women and 24 years for men. Information on sexual and reproductive health for young people comes from a variety of sources including parents, paternal aunts (ssenga), uncles (kojja), older brothers and sisters, peers, radio and newspapers. When asked if they had knowledge about HIV, 38% of males ages 15–19 said yes and 31% of females in the same age range said yes. Youth that were questioned about at what age people should become sexually active, all participants across all data collection methods stated that the ideal age is between 18 and 20 years. The participants also said that people actually started to have sex anywhere from 4 to 16 years, but all young people believed this was too early. Condom use is much higher amongst in-school youth rather than out-of-school youth. In-school youth also found that they had fewer sexual partners overall than the out-of-school youth and they are also more likely to be involved in family planning than the out-of-school youth.

Context The station was built by the Midland Railway on the circuitous Barrow Hill to Pleasley West line known as the Doe Lea Branch, because it ran for much of its length along the valley of the River Doe Lea. History The line was opened without ceremony on 1 September 1890. It initially provided a service of three trains each way between Mansfield and Chesterfield, taking about an hour from end to end.The service in 1890 Old Miner The line was single track between Seymour Junction and Pleasley West. Accordingly, the station had a single platform. Normal passenger traffic along the Doe Lea Branch dwindled over the years and finally ceased on 28 July 1930. Glapwell Colliery and others in the Doe Lea Valley were still going strong at this time, but all their coal went out northwards, so very little traffic passed through the station and the steep line through Rowthorn Tunnel. The opportunity was therefore taken to abandon the line from just south of Glapwell station to Pleasley Colliery West Junction a short distance South of Pleasley West. That meant the abandonment of Glapwell station itself, Rowthorn Tunnel and Rowthorn and Hardwick station. Rowthorn Tunnel was used for growing mushrooms then for storing ammunition during the Second World War. It is now filled in.

This allows for the virtualization of CPU, memory, disk and most importantly network IO. Upon such virtualization of hardware resources, the platform can accommodate multiple virtual network applications such as firewalls, routers, Web filters, and intrusion prevention systems, all functioning much like standalone hardware appliances, but contained within a single hardware appliance. The key benefit to such technology is doing all of this while maintaining the network performance typically seen with that of standalone network appliances as well as enabling the ability to administratively or dynamically program resources at will. Server virtualization history Server virtualization, a technology that has become mainstream, originally gained popularity when VMware entered the market in 2001 with its GSX server software. This technology gave IT organizations the ability to reduce the amount of rack space required to accommodate multiple servers and reduced the cost of powering and cooling data centers by consolidating server based applications onto a single piece of hardware. One of the problems with server virtualization is in how applications are networked together. Within a server virtualization environment, applications are interconnected by what is referred to as a virtual switch, which is very different from high-performing hardware-based network switches offered by the likes of Juniper Networks and Cisco Systems. Virtual switches are software-based switches and rely on the movement of packets up and down a software stack which relies on the same CPUs which are being used to drive the applications. Because of this software approach to switching, networking applications such as firewalls and routers, which require high levels of throughput and low levels of latency, were not ideal to operate within a server virtualized environment, while applications less sensitive to throughput and latency such as email and file sharing were ideal. Network virtualization history Initially, network virtualization only involved the separation of the control plane and the forwarding plane (management and packet transmission) within networking devices like switches. This has shifted to include the totality of virtualizing a network, including how the network is programmed, administered, and deployed, be it hardware, software, or management and packet transmission.

Southern Africa is the southern region of the continent Africa. It consists of countries such as: Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Lesotho is surrounded by South Africa (it is in the middle of South Africa). Through an attempt of keeping up with the developing world, and trying to meet the high demands of the growing population, Southern Africa has exhausted its many resources resulting in severe environmental damage. Southern Africa's log, and produce are the cores of their economy, and this region has become dependent on these resources. The continuous depleting and improper treatment of their natural resources have led Southern Africa to the state where they are. Some environmental issues that affect Southern Africa are: water pollution, air pollution, land degradation, solid waste pollution, and deforestation. The environmental damage affects not only the population's health, but also the species that live in the area, while also contributing to the worldwide issue of climate change. For more about: Water supply and sanitation in South Africa One of Southern Africa's biggest issues is the lack of clean water. According to The United Nations Convention on Climate Change on South Africa in 2000, the water around Africa is unevenly distributed, meaning that 60% of the water is situated in only 20% of the land. Less than 10% of Southern Africa's surface water is accessible and due to the fact that a majority of their ground water lay under large rock formations, ground water becomes difficult to access as well. Climate change and its attendant effects on temperature and precipitation may have an additional impact. Many Africans are moving to rural areas, adding to the already high demands for clean water and while demands are growing drastically, freshwater supplies remain limited. Adding to the high demands, Durban’s dam has decreased by 20% since 2010, and up to 30% of the water has either been stolen or given away illegally through international trading. “A review of water availability in 1996 estimated that the total average annual surface runoff was 150 million cubic metres, the maximum potential annual system yield was 33 290 million cubic metres, and total water annual requirements were 20 045 million cubic metres. Water requirements could increase by about 50% by 2030 (Department of Water and Forestry, 2000a).” Although South Africa has one of the best, cleanest water out of all the countries in Southern Africa, many don’t have access to basic sanitations. A majority of Southern Africa's accessible water is unclean, making the water vulnerable for water transmitted diseases to exist. Water- borne diseases such as Hepatitis A and Hepatitis E increase, while some of the water become so unclean that diseases such as: Typhoid fever, Leptospirosis, Schistosomiasis, and Bilharzia are transmitted through water contact. Causes of water pollution  Urbanization  As the population of people moving to urbanized areas increase, the demands for food supply also grow. As a mean to keep up with these high demands, the use of fertilization and sewage contamination also incline. Nitrates and phosphates found in fertilizers and sewage wastes causes eutrophication, which is harmful to other species in the environment. Eutrophication increases algae blooms, which may cause illnesses such as: diarrhea, hayfever, skin rashes, vomiting, fevers, gastroenteritis, muscle and joint pains, and eye irritations. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_issues_in_Southern_Africa 01/03/2018  Oil spills  South Africa is situated at the very tip of Southern Africa. This location causes South Africa to become very vulnerable to oil spills. High levels of oil is transported from the Middle East to Europe and America along the coast, making Southern African's water and ecosystem at risk to being severely damaged. It thus is prone to oil spill.  Coal mining  Coal mining is one of Southern Africa's main energy source, but it holds a huge negative impact on the land's water, air and soil quality. Acid mine drainage is the result of the excess coal mining that occurs. Sulphuric Acid is released from coal mining, and although the generalizing process is slow, the time it takes for the acid to neutralize is equally as slow. When clean, excess water is released from the rock masses that are broken through mining, it's mixed with the sulphuric acid causing the water to become toxic. This toxic, contaminated water kills plants and animals, while also dissolving aluminum and heavy minerals found in clean water (increasing toxicity level). Although rocks which contain calcium carbonate are able to neutralize the acidic water, Southern Africa does not have the rocks which contain these minerals. For a link to see the graph for the total primary energy supply in Africa, 2010 and more, click Here  Air pollution  Highveld in Gauteng Province In this developing region, low-grade fuels are used to meet high demands for food, and energy. SO and CO are released in the air, and due to deforestation and the growing amount of air pollution, the air pollutants in the atmosphere are slowly building up. During the winter, pollutants are trapped in the air due to the high pressure, and are unable to move or dissipate. In the summer, due to the low pressure, pollutants are dissipated through unstable circulation. Many women are also cooking indoors with fossil fuels, which is the main cause for the health problems in women and children. 75.2% of Southern Africa's energy come from Highveld Areas, where 5 of its 10 Eskom Power Stations are the largest in the world. Highveld areas are above sea level, making the oxygen level 20% less than the oxygen level in the coast. This results in an incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, and a severe nocturnal temperature inversion to occur; which results in smoke being trapped in the air 860 tons of SO is produced from 3 of their main power stations (Matla, Duvha and Arnot), “which exceeds the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) [exposure to particulate matter] standards of 180 mg.m-3 by 6 to 7 times during winter months (Annegarn et al. 1996 a,b)”. This high concentration of air pollution surround the area making it very dangerous to one's health. To see graphs indicating South Africa's share of CO emissions, click Here  Solid waste pollution  With the increase of population, and an increase in people who are moving to urbanized areas, the number of solid waste produced is increasing. South Africa's Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism estimates that over half of the population of South Africa lack \\"adequate\\" solid waste treatment, instead, waste is often dumped, buried or burned.  Deforestation  As the population inclines, Southern Africa's demand for land also increases, contributing directly and indirectly to deforestation. Deforestation re-rates in Southern Africa was greater than other areas of Africa in the 1990s and are predicted to stay high. due to degradation South Africa also tends to lose a big area that people settle in, for an example in one of the province of South Africa which is Gauteng, as one of the most high populated province it experience a lot natural disasters due to uncontrollable forces. Here in this province people always seek for place of settlement and the area is occupied to an extent that there is not enough space for plantation.  Soil degradation  With the decrease in water and the high demands for agriculture, Southern Africa's land is becoming less fertile. Climate change is also causing an increase in water evaporation from the soil, making it very difficult for produce in Southern Africa. Africa itself is located in an area where climate is unpredictable, making them vulnerable to climate change and while Southern Africa is semi- arid, it puts them at risk for desertification. Desertification causes an increase in soil erosion, making it difficult for plants to grow. This will lead to unsustainable food, and endanger Southern Africa's wildlife. Through time, soil erosion will result in harvesting alien plants. Alien plants threaten indigenous plants and reduce grazing areas, which contributes to soil erosion. Southern Africa's land is already over cropped and over-grazed as a result of Africa's undistributed lands. With the combination of alien plants and the exhaustion of their lands, Southern Africa's degraded land is beyond repair. Many countries use the method of irrigation as a way to prevent desertification and droughts. Unfortunately, only 4% of Sub-Saharan Africa is equipped for irrigation. With the decrease in rainfall, and the lack of irrigation, Southern Africa's land and soil will soon become arid.

Pyrodinium is a monospecific species with two varieties, Pyrodinium bahamense var. compressum and Pyrodinium bahamanse var. bahamense. Pyrodinium is well known for producing Paralytic Shellfish Toxins (PSTs), e.g. saxitoxin, and the bioluminescence that lights up the bioluminescent bays in Puerto Rico and the Bahamas.  Habitat and ecology  Pyrodinium bahamense, considered the sister taxon to Alexandrium, is a tropical photosynthetic euryhaline species of dinoflagellates found mainly in the Atlantic ocean.Usup, G., Ahmad, A., Matsuoka, K., Lim, P.T., Leaw ,C.P., 2012. Biology, ecology and bloom dynamics of the toxic marine dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense. Harmful algae 14, 301-312. It is found in marine waters that have more than 20 psu of salinity and are warmer than . The optimal salinity is considered to be around 35 psuWall and Dale, \\"THE HYSTRICHOSPHAERID RESTING SPORE OF THE DINOFLAGELLATE PYRODINIUM BAHAMENSE\\", 1969 and the optimum temperature is . An association between Pyrodinium bahamense occurrence and mangrove forests has been suggested, although, the presence of mangrove forest is not necessarily a predictor for presence of P. bahamense var. bahamense, as it is absent in western and southern Florida Bay.Phlips, E.J., Badylak, S., Bledsoe E.L., Cichra, M., 2006. Factors influencing the distribution and abundance of Pyrodinium bahamense in coastal ecosystems of Florida. Marine Ecology Progress Series 322, 99-115. However, regions where large cell densities of Pyrodinium are found are usually shallow and have varied salinities and long water residence times. P. bahamense has only been studied closely since the 1990s, since it was not cultured in labs before then. Several labs can now grow Pyrodinium in several common seawater based culture media such as ES-DK and f/2, but cell densities typically remain less than 6,000 cells mL−1 in culture and are lower than those normally obtained for Alexandrium. The difficulty of culturing P. bahamense is explained by its specific nutrition needs. Initially cultures were only successful with the addition of soil extract, but while soil extract does increase cell densities, it is not necessary for growth. The highest cell density in culture, 6,000 cells mL−1, was obtained by supplementing cultures with selenium, which is present in soil. The influence of soil-derived selenium on growth suggests that Pyrodinium requires terrestrial nutrients in order to reach bloom-level cell densities. Pyrodinium is able to grow with nitrate and urea as nitrogen sources, but has low tolerance to ammonia. Pyrodinium cannot grow with alanine, arginine, or histidine as nitrogen sources, indicating limited ability to assimilate organic nitrogen. Maximum growth rates and chlorophyll levels are observed when nitrogen levels are greater than 100 μM. Toxin production remains constant when nitrate is between 60 and 500 μM. Since toxin production remains constant even at nitrogen levels limiting to growth, toxin production must play an important role within Pyrodinium cells. However, the toxin profile (i.e. which PSTs are produced) changes under varying growth conditions, so nutrient conditions may affect toxicity. Pyrodinium is able to utilize organic and inorganic phosphorus.  Harmful algal blooms  Pyrodinium have caused caused more human illnesses and fatalities than any other dinoflagellates that cause Paralytic Shellfish Toxin or PST. It was initially widely believed that the compressum variety was toxic and found in the Pacific while the bahamense variety was nontoxic and found in the Atlantic, but a 1972 toxic algal bloom of Pyrodinium bahamense in Papua New Guinea McLean, Dewey M., \\"Eocladopyxis peniculatum Morgenroth, 1966, Early Tertiary Ancestor of the Modern Dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense Plate, 1906\\", \\"Micropaleontology\\", 1976 showed this was not the case. It is now known that P. bahamense is a major cause of seafood toxicity and paralytic shellfish poisoning, especially in Southeast Asia, and causes toxicity along Central American coasts.Gárate-Lizárraga, Ismael et al., \\"Occurrence of Pyrodinium bahamense var. compressum along the southern coast of the Baja California Peninsula\\", \\"Marine Pollution Bulletin,\\" 2011 In addition, there are at least two places in the world where both varieties of Pyrodinium bahamense are found together: the Persian GulfGilbert et al., \\"A fish kill of massive proportion in Kuwait Bay, Arabian Gulf\\", \\"Harmful Algae\\", 2002 and coast of Mexico. The ecophysiology of Pyrodinium blooms is not well understood. Unlike Alexandrium blooms, where resting cysts are often the most important seed-source for blooms, it is unclear whether resting cysts or background populations of vegetative cells are more important in initiating Pyrodinium blooms. However, cysts are abundant in the sediments of lagoons and bays where blooms form and the resuspension of sediment and cysts may indeed be important to initiating blooms. Blooms also tend to occur after periods of high rain, suggesting that a terrestrial-sourced nutrient is usually limiting. On a global scale, blooms seem to be linked to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), probably because of changes in precipitation and delivery of terrestrial nutrients.  Bioluminescence  P. bahamense displays bioluminescence when agitated, glowing blue. Pyrodinium bahamense is the phytoplankton primarily responsible for the bioluminescence in the bioluminescent bays, or \\"bio bays,\\" of Puerto Rico and the Bahamas. The bright cobalt blue light produced by these dinoflagellates when they are mechanically disturbed creates a magical effect that draws many tourists to the bays. Most of the bays are in reserves, and no swimming is allowed, but guests are able to kayak in the bays at night with local guides to observe the bioluminescence.  Morphology and anatomy  Pyrodinium bahamense cells are shaped like ellipsoids and are covered with thick, protective thecal plates that have many small, evenly distributed knobs and trichocyst pores. They also have an ornamental apical projection or node, as well as sulcal fins on either sides of the sulcus. The Pyrodinium resting cyst is spherical with many thin, tubular processes of variable length.  Life cycle  Sexual reproduction and formation of resting cysts typically occurs during bloom decline. In its dormant stages, P. bahamense develop spherical, double-layered cysts for protection. These cysts, called Polysphaeridium zoharyi in the paleontological classification system, are similar in both P. bahamense varieties and have tubular processes protruding from the outer layer.

Shuisky was made an Honored Artist of Russia in 1945 and received the Order of the Red Banner of Labour in 1946. He died in Perm shortly before his 70th birthday. A bust of Shuisky was displayed at an art exhibition in 1951 and is kept in the museum of the Perm Opera and Ballet Theatre.Porozov, Vladimir. \\"Шуйский, Михаил Григорьевич\\".

Biography  Shuisky was born November 13, 1883, in Novogeorgievsk province of Kherson (now Kirovohrad region) in Ukraine.S State archive of Saint Petersburg (Translated from Russian) His family soon moved to Kremenchuk, Poltava province. As a child, he sang in the family circle and appeared in the children's choir at the main Cathedral in Kremenchuk. In 1904, Shuisky graduated from the Kharkov Commercial College of Emperor Alexander III – one of the largest business schools institutions in the Russian Empire. He was a daily soloist with the choirboys for ten years at the school's Temple, which was called Holy Face of the Lord. In 1905, Shuisky entered the Saint Petersburg Conservatory to study solo singing. In response to the events of the first Russian revolution, classes at the Conservatory stopped. He went to Vienna to study under Professor Habeck at the Imperial Academy of Music and the Performing Arts, remaining until 1909. Shuisky in 1910 In 1910, a Russian member of parliament in Vienna invited Shuisky to participate in a concert in honor of Nikolai Gogol in Lviv. A review of this concert in the newspaper Prikarpatskaya Rus' (April 1910) said, \\"... Mr. Shuisky has a beautiful voice of extremely strong timbre and wide range, and may be considered the successor of the glorious Chaliapin.\\" After a concert in Vienna, where he sang an aria as Petruchio in The Taming of the Shrew, critics wrote \\"...Mr. Mikhail Shuisky played Petruchio in 'The Taming of the Shrew' with amazing skill.\\" In the newspaper Novoye Vremya of May 1910, critics wrote \\"Mikhail Shuisky has unique qualities as an opera singer. His baritone voice has a wonderful soft timbre and a wide range. Today, he can be compared only with Mattia Battistini. From everything we've heard at concerts, it can be assumed that M. Shuisky will take a place in the ranks of the finest singers of the world, maybe even the very finest.\\" Following many successful concert performances Shuisky was invited to sing at the Vienna Volksoper. In September 1911, Shuisky debuted as \\"Priest\\" in The Magic Flute. On October 21, 1911, he debuted as Biterolf in Tannhäuser. On November 18, 1911, he debuted as Escamillo in Carmen. In 1912, to supplement his repertoire, Shuisky signed a contract for the season 1912/1913, as the only dramatic baritone with the Landestheater in Linz and in the summer in Salzburg. Linz was in at that time considered the third largest city in the Austrian Empire. During the two years in the opera house in Linz, Shuisky improved and increased his visibility. A review in the newspaper Die Wahrheit April 1912, said, \\"M. Shuisky, as a leading actor in G. Verdi's opera Rigoletto, did something unique. His singing was great and wonderful in every way, with amazing purity of sound. Mr. Shuisky again proved his artistic skill brilliantly.\\" On March 25, 1912, an anniversary concert for Anatoly Arkhangelsky at the Regent Russian Embassy Church in Vienna consisted entirely of works by Russian composers: Turchaninov, Berezovsky, Gretchaninov, Mandyczewski, Scriabin, Bortkiewicz, Mussorgsky, Arensky, Rubinstein and Anatoly Arkhangelsky. Shuisky was listed as baritone soloist of the Opera Volksoper. Paul de Conne played piano. Shuisky received several proposals for contracts with the theaters Breslau, Linz, Leipzig, Munich, and Hamburg. On October 1, 1912, he signed a two-year agreement with the Imperial Theatre in Munich. On October 12, 1912, he inked a five-year agreement with the Hamburger und Altonaer Stadt-Theater in Hamburg. Political events made staying in Austria impossible. In 1913, Shuisky terminated all contracts and moved to Saint Petersburg. On March 30, 1913, in the city's Mariinsky Theatre, Shuisky successfully auditioned for voice jalong with tenor Malyshev. He had two years of experience on stage in Vienna, Linz, Salzburg, and therefore rejected the director's proposal as elementary. Shuisky, auditioned for Iosif Lapitsky, who was known in Saint Petersburg as a talented opera director and innovator. In 1912, he created the Musical Theater in Saint Petersburg. On March 10, 1914, he contracted with the Musical Theater. The Agreement covered August 1914 to January 1915. Shuisky acted the part of Escamillo in the opera Carmen by Georges Bizet. From the beginning of World War I Shuisky was actively involved in patriotic charity concerts that were organized by MI Gorlenko-Dolina in the auditorium of Circus Ciniselli, which had a capacity of 5,000 spectators. He received letters of appreciation from Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna and from Marie Pavlovna.\\"To His Excellency Mr Michael Grigorevich Shuisky: Your gracious participation in the Patriotic Supper, on September 11 this year, in the auditorium of the Ciniselli Circus, contributed to the remarkable success of that night, all the proceeds from which went toward medical supplies for the sick and wounded. By order of the Grand Duchess, I have the honor to thank you from Her Imperial Highness for your kind assistance in helping the sick and wounded soldiers. General-Adjutant Prince M. Tashunin. 22 September 1914\\" In 1916, Shuisky moved to Ukraine. During the German occupation and the Civil War in Ukraine, Shuisky was a teacher, soloist in concert performances and played the title role in Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin From 1923 to 1932 Shuisky was an Artist of Ukrainian State Opera – he worked at the Opera and Ballet Theater in Kiev and Opera and Ballet Theater in Odessa. Shuisky was a soloist. He taught at the conservatory and sang in concerts and on the radio. In 1932, as part of the Odessa Opera House committee, Shuisky went to Moscow, to the Ministry of Culture with his suggestions about how to stop conflicts between the creative team and the government's administration. The discussion led to Shuisky's exile to Perm. From 1932 to 1949 Shuisky continued his creative work at the Theatre of Opera and Ballet of Perm. On January 18, 1936, Perm newspaper Zvezda published an article, \\"The 25th anniversary of the opera singer Shuisky.\\" It recorded that the Perm City Council supported the application for Shuisky to be given the title of Honored Artist of the Republic, which had been made by music and opera lovers and groups of actors from Perm to the People's Commissariat of Russia. In 1945 Shuisky was awarded the \\"Honored Artist of the Russian Federation\\" is assigned to highly professional actors, who have received recognition from the public. In 1946, Shuisky was awarded the Order of the Red Banner, an established award for service in science, culture, literature, the arts, public education and other spheres of creative activity. On May 13, 1949, his 40th anniversary on stage was celebrated at a farewell performance. The program included scenes from Tosca (Shuisky as Baron Scarpia), Dubrovsky (Shuisky as Troekurov), and Prince Igor (Shuisky as Prince Igor). In 1949, Shuisky began teaching. Between 1951 and 1952 he wrote his memoirs, My Theatrical Memories, later archived at the Museum of the Opera and Ballet Theatre in Perm. In 1951, a regional art exhibition displayed a bust of \\"M.G. Shuisky, Honored Artist of the RSFSR.\\" The Sculpture is kept in the museum of the Opera and Ballet Theatre in Perm. September 11, 1953, Shuisky died of a brain haemorrhage at age 69. He was buried in Yegoshikha Cemetery (Quarter X, Grave number 50) . Tenor Ivan Kozlovsky had been one of Shuisky's students in Kiev. They maintained a lifelong friendship, and Kozlovsky took an active role in Shuisky's funeral.

Plot  Three MIT students – Jonah, Nic, and Haley – are on a road trip to move Haley to California, a decision that stresses Nic's relationship with Haley. Nic walks with forearm crutches, and the possibility of muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, or some other degenerative disease is implied but never specified. Haley feels Nic is distancing himself from her and Nic explains he does not want his disability to hold her back. During their stay in a hotel, Nic and Jonah discover that a hacker named NOMAD, who nearly got them expelled for breaking into MIT servers, has found their location and is taunting them with strange and ominous e-mails. They track NOMAD to an abandoned house in the middle of Nevada and decide to go after him. After finding nothing in the house, Nic and Jonah hear Haley scream and run outside, only to see her pulled into the sky before disappearing into a white light themselves. Nic, now with the number 2.3.5.41 tattooed on his arm, wakes up in a strange and sterile underground research facility where he is questioned by Dr. Wallace Damon, the head of the \\"transition group\\" in charge of helping Nic to cope with his strange situation. Damon tells Nic what they encountered near the house was an EBE: an extraterrestrial biological entity. Nic remains in a state of disbelief. Dr. Damon then shows him footage from Nic's own video camera and pauses where an alien face can be seen peering from behind a tree. Nic is taken to his room where he hears Jonah talking to him through a small vent in the wall, saying \\"(his) body feels weird.\\" Nic also notices that his legs, previously weak but functional, are now completely numb. When Dr. Damon questions him again, Nic tries to get answers about Haley's condition (who is in a coma at the time), but is unsuccessful. Following an unexplained experiment on a cow in another part of the facility, a security alarm goes off and Nic, along with other personnel, finds large dents with scorch marks running across the walls and no sign of Jonah. Nic asks Damon where Jonah went but Damon tells him that Jonah was never recovered from the house. Increasingly agitated, Nic tries to break Haley out but is intercepted. After being restrained, he is shocked to discover that his legs have been amputated and replaced by prostheses made from alien technology. Nic then uses these super-powered limbs to break Haley and himself out of the facility, only to discover they are in the middle of a vast barren desert. After hitching a ride with an old lady who seems sweet yet oddly troubled, Nic and Haley hijack an 18-wheeler truck to try to find a way around the seemingly endless canyon that extends around the facility and surrounding area. At a visitors center, they come across Jonah disguised as one of the facility workers dressed in a white hazmat suit. Jonah reveals that he too had limbs taken from him, as his forearms and hands have been replaced with the same alien technology as Nic's legs. Jonah speculates that they are in Area 51 (because they both have the same tattooed number, which adds up to 51), and that this is all a test. After Nic discovers indications of alien technology also implanted in Haley's spine, the trio drive up to a military checkpoint where Jonah tries to hack into their systems, only to be stopped by a hail of gunfire from the facility personnel. Nic and Jonah hug as the fatally wounded Jonah prepares for his final stand that will allow Nic and Haley to escape. Jonah uses his remaining strength and prosthetic alien arms to subdue the group of soldiers. However, Nic and Haley's escape is short-lived; as they approach the only bridge that would take them over the canyon to the outside world, they run into Damon and his military men, who blow out the truck's tires. Haley is evacuated by helicopter beyond the canyon and, knowing that Nic has mastered the use of his legs, Damon tells Nic \\"you can't reach her.\\" After hearing a loud horn coming from the sky, Nic realizes that Damon is NOMAD (Damon spelled backwards). Damon then explains that it was Nic who came looking for him, that this was his fault, and adding that Nic is \\"the perfect integration of human will and alien technology. Our finest achievement.\\" Agitated and emotionally compromised, Nic's bionic legs enable him to sprint at supersonic speed across the bridge where he hits an invisible barrier and breaks through. Nic finds himself inside what appears to be a different, larger exterior facility. Housed within it, through the broken barrier, can be seen 'Area 51\\", the Earth-like world with the canyon city. Looking in through the hole towards the bridge, he sees Damon walk up and remove his helmet to reveal that he is actually a robotic alien, with merely a human-like face. Nic turns back around, and through the glass sees stars and outer space. He realizes he is not in a government facility, but is actually on an immense alien spacecraft numbered 2.3.5.41 (matching the numerical tattoo on his arm) that is about to dock at their home world (signaled by the horn). A final zoom-out view reveals the whole ship, with a parabolic sun shield on the top and a large alien city, complete with skyscrapers, pointing away from the alien sun. In the distance, another similar city ship can be seen.

Director William Eubank stated in an interview, \\"The Signal, for me, is about choices and sort of what drives somebody – the decisions we make, whether we make them based on thinking logically or thinking emotionally. Nic is sort of a character who's being – he wants to be logical, because he believes from his computer background that is a stronger way to live your life, and that's a more reasonable way to live your life. Black and white decisions, yes or nos. Then he's sort of challenged to make an emotional choice. At the very start, he was sort of trying to push those emotions away... At the end of the movie, he chooses to embrace that emotional side and make a choice based on a feeling.\\" Co-writer Carlyle Eubank explained the film similarly, saying \\"The real crux of the film is how the characters... find who they are as people through adversity.\\" Actor Brenton Thwaites stated the film's metaphoric message of following one's heart over reason was what drew him to the project, saying \\"I love the little messages and metaphors throughout the film that tell you to really chase what you believe in and follow your heart... the message is so beautiful.\\" Screenwriter David Frigerio echoed his co-writers' sentiments in his explanation of the film's themes: Through metaphor, the film intends to explore the idea that though sometimes humans may attempt to live their lives based on rules and logic, working diligently to suppress their feelings, deep down there are emotions that cannot be eliminated. The so-called \\"Signal\\" is that internal gnawing fire of a human's inner voice that can tell what is true if listened for, and that makes humans human. Eubank explained the meaning of the film's title by saying the \\"Signal\\" is a \\"waiting for something, listening for something, having an open heart... there's levels of what the 'Signal' really is.\\" In the film, the character Nic finally listens and hears \\"The Signal\\", and in a fiery burst discovers his true feeling, love. Having found his emotions, Nic chooses to follow a course of action based on love. Eubank discussed this in saying the critical part of the film is \\"to watch [Nic] arc out, to decide 'You know what, I’ve been trying to think logically about this the whole time... and [have] always been trying to run away from my emotions, here’s a situation that says logically I shouldn’t do this or I’m at great risk if I do this, so logically I should do nothing.' And he decides to do something, and to go for it, and he embraces it.\\" This decision flies in the face of logic, but trusting love empowers him, and the transformation enables him to break out of the allegorical cave of darkness he had formerly found himself in and out into the wide field of reality. At Sundance, the filmmakers and actor Brenton Thwaites described the film as a Twilight Zone–style story, drawing heavily on Plato's Allegory of the Cave, and intended as a modern interpretation of the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, an element later noted by reviewers. The film utilizes nontraditional storytelling directions, which have frustrated some reviewers.  Production   Casting  Laurence Fishburne joined the cast on May 9, 2013.  Filming  Filming began in May 2013 in New Mexico, on locations including Albuquerque, Los Lunas and Taos. The New Mexico Film Office also announced the start of filming. On June 18 and 19, crews were filming scenes on the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge.  Music  The musical score for The Signal was written by composer and experimental musical instrument designer Nima Fakhrara. Fakhrara, who has a background as a dulcimer player and student of Persian classical music, approached the production seeking to contribute, having been a fan of Eubank's earlier film Love. As half of the film takes place indoors, Fakhara produced a number of custom instruments for the film designed to limit resonance, including a pagoda made of ceramic insulators, gongs, a number of bowed instruments, a steel marimba, and a tenor violin fashioned with viola strings. When the characters journey outdoors, the music and instruments change. A number of the custom instruments had to be transported to Skywalker Ranch, where Fakhrara was mastering the score. The music supervisor was Aminé Ramer. Fakhrara and Eubank went through 45 versions of the music for the opening credits scene before they chose a final version. A soundtrack album was released by Varèse Sarabande on June 10, 2014. Other songs featured in the film include: * \\"La villa dei delitti\\" by Gabriele Bazzi Berneri * \\"Tell Me Now\\" by Generationals * \\"Union\\" by Deptford Goth * \\"Piano Piece in A Major\\" by Mark Gordon * \\"Pace, Pace, Mio Dio (From La forza del destino)\\" by Emilie De Voght * \\"I'll Pretend\\" by Glen Morris * \\"Ever Night Lulu\\" by Johnny Appleseed * \\"2.3.5.41 (feat. William Grundler)\\" by Nima Fakhrara & Free the Robots * Charles Gounod's \\"Ave Maria\\" (which he arranged from Johann Sebastian Bach's 1st keyboard Prelude in C major from the Well-Tempered Clavier.)  Distribution   Marketing  On March 18, 2014, a teaser poster and some photos from the film were released, followed by the first official trailer next day. On March 26, 2014, Focus revealed a new poster for the film. On May 27, \\"ruagitated.com\\" was launched.  Theatrical release  Focus Features released the film, worldwide, on June 13, 2014. It was in limited release in North America for five weeks and grossed $600,896.

It earned $822,917 in video sales in the United States.The Signal, at the-numbers.com. Retrieved May 2, 2015  Reception  , the film holds a 61% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 89 reviews with an average rating of 5.84 out of 10. The site's consensus says, \\"Director William Eubank clearly has big ideas and an impressive level of technical expertise; unfortunately, The Signal fritters them away on a poorly constructed story.\\" The film received a score of 54 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 34 reviews. Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \\"B\\" rating, saying, \\"Hard science fiction meets tender hearts in a slow- burn, twist-filled thriller... The trio wind up in an abandoned shack in the middle of the Nevada desert, where they are attacked by forces unknown. It gets worse!... What is happening? Will Nic escape? And do we even want him to, given that the facility's workers all wear protective suits when interacting with their guests/test subjects?\\" The review concludes that \\"all this sounds like a souped-up episode of The Twilight Zone or The X-Files.\\" Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times wrote, \\"William Eubank's The Signal demonstrates the fine line between paranoid science-fiction fantasy and demo reel... After a brief excursion into found-footage horror, Nic wakes up in one of those antiseptic, white-walled secret compounds used for human experimentation in the movies. Mr. Eubank plays with our minds, and Nic's, for a while.\\" Rapold judges that \\"the story evolves into a kind of poor man's X-Men,\\" though \\"the grandiosity of the film's setups partly fits in with the guys' sense of righteous-geek drama, and you wouldn't be surprised to see Mr. Eubank directing a bigger-budget movie down the road...\\" Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post gave the film a one-and-a-half star rating and a half-scathing review: \\"Two of the major plot turns in The Signal—a good-looking sci-fi thriller with more fashion sense than brains—hinge on misdirection involving simple arithmetic and spelling. I won't spoil the fun by elaborating further, but when each moment arrives, it's cheapened by the implicit insult to the audience's intelligence. The twists feel less like jolts of genuine surprise than like being had by a third-grader with a good knock-knock joke.\\" O'Sullivan adds, \\"I'll say one thing: The general state of confusion fostered by the head-scratching plot is a surprisingly effective way of maintaining continued engagement with it—if by 'engagement' you mean 'This better lead somewhere.' Oh, it does. It's just a less than wholly satisfying destination, despite some fun detours. (Veteran character actress Lin Shay, in a nutty little cameo, is one such pleasure.)\\" In contrast, USA Today wrote, \\"Had Stanley Kubrick and David Lynch made a movie together, it might have looked something like The Signal. Visually stunning, emotionally stunted and weird as all get-out, this sci-fi tale (**1/2 stars out of four, rated PG-13...) isn't worthy of the canon of either master of disturbing imagery. But Signal thinks big, takes chances and has enough arresting scenes to stand apart from the science fiction films of late... Signal is so determined to remain mysterious—and pack a visual punch at the movie's climax—that it withholds too much... Instead, Signal aims to get you thinking. The story can be maddening to follow, but it sure is cool to look at.\\" Geoff Berkshire, who watched the film at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival, gave a similarly admiring yet disappointed review, calling it \\"Indebted to both District 9 and The Blair Witch Project, but unlikely to enjoy either of those films' sleeper success\\": \\"Exceedingly stylish and ultimately quite silly, The Signal is a sci-fi head trip better appreciated for the journey than the destination. The less audiences know going in, the more intrigued they'll be by the story's not entirely predictable twists and turns.\\" He writes that when \\"the film pulls its flashiest twist, which turns Nic into something like the Six Billion Dollar Teen,\\" \\"it's also the clear highlight of a film more interested in surface flash than in narrative coherence or character depth.\\"  See also * Alien abduction  References   External links   * Category:2014 films Category:2010s science fiction thriller films Category:American films Category:American science fiction thriller films Category:Techno-thriller films Category:Alien abduction films Category:Films about computing Category:Films about virtual reality Category:Films about disability Category:Films about couples Category:Films about friendship Category:Entertainment One films Category:Films set in 2015 Category:Films set in Nevada Category:Films shot in New Mexico Category:Films shot in Ohio Category:Focus Features films Category:Films directed by William Eubank ","title":"The Signal (2014 film)"},{"id":"39399300","text":"Rudderless is a 2014 American musical drama film which was the directorial debut of William H.

Meanwhile, his father Sam Manning (Billy Crudup) has succeeded in landing a large account at his advertising firm, and calls Josh to celebrate with him and skip that day's classes. Josh tells him he cannot make it but his father insists, though Josh begins to make his way to the campus library anyway. Sam continues to wait at the bar where he told him to meet him and even leaves a message for Josh who has apparently stood him up. He is distracted by a news report of a school shooting incident at his son's campus library on the television in the bar. Later, a memorial wake is being held at Josh's home by his mother, Emily (Felicity Huffman). It is inferred that Josh was one of the victims in the shooting. Due to the media coverage received, Sam has a difficult time being able to grieve in his own way with press being cordoned at the end of the street by police, and a news helicopter hovering above the family home. Sam is consoled by family and attendees while sitting alone to one side as his wife is greeting others. Sam walks into Josh's bedroom to look around, attempting to find some kind of understanding over the loss, and is interrupted by Kate Lucas (Selena Gomez), who tells Sam that she and Josh had been dating the year prior. Sam then makes his way to his own home and finds the media coverage is interfering with his daily life, and he eventually succumbs to alcoholism, as far as showing up intoxicated at his firm; acting erratically and kissing his receptionist in a drunken state, for which his employer is advising him to take time off to better cope with the situation. Two years later, Sam has removed himself from his former life and is now living on a sailboat on a lake, far from home, having taken a job as a contractor's assistant and for the most part drinking away his free time. His habits are causing habitual lateness and annoying his employer, who cautions Sam about repeated lateness. Getting up to relieve himself from the side of the boat has caught the chagrin of the governing board of the lake and the \\"wrath\\" of Alaird Dupree (because it is openly visible to other tenants and the small seafood restaurant nearby), the agent acting on behalf of the board. It is clear he dislikes Sam, and the feeling is very much mutual. Going for a drink with some coworkers after his day of working, he hides the details of his previous life and his true identity from everyone, even making up humorous stories about his past. (He tells his coworkers that he \\"fingered\\" Gotti and is in the protection of the Federal Witness Protection Program), Sam notices that \\"The Trill\\" tavern hosts open mic events for musicians. Returning to the marina, he encounters Emily waiting for him, who says she is moving to Tulsa and is now the mother of a new son. She requires his signature to place their former house up for sale. She has also brought the remainder of Josh's possessions—demo discs, instruments and gear—which Sam emphatically states he has no room for on his tiny sailboat. Emily tells him she was certain he would want it because they had played together since Josh was younger. Hours pass after Emily leaves. He tries his best to ignore the collection of his son's possessions over a meal. He storms over to where Emily had left it beside the road and begins to place it in a dumpster but stops, noticing the notebooks and discs, and begins to listen to them back on the boat, and read through the collection of lyrics and writings Josh left behind. He even begins to teach himself some his son's material. After work the next day, Sam decides to perform \\"Home\\", one of Josh's songs, at The Trill, and catches the attention of Quentin (Anton Yelchin), a young guitarist who was excitedly moved by the performance. The next day, Quentin brings Sam coffee and food and discusses the previous night performance, stating he believes there are other songs, and if there are, they could perform them together. Sam declares he is not interested, and continues to listen to more and teach himself his son's material. Quentin tries again the next day and shows him an alternate arrangement possibility for the song. The two end up sharing a meal and playing instruments together for the rest of the night. Sam neglects to tell Quentin that he was not the piece's actual author. At the end of the night, Quentin gets Sam to agree to perform together at The Trill, adding more and more to each arrangement, including a percussion section in the way of Aiken. The next day, Sam is introduced to Del (Laurence Fishburne), the owner and operator of the local music supply store, who reveals that he is selling his business and plans to retire and tour by motor home with his wife in his later years. Quentin shows Sam the 1978 Gibson Les Paul hanging in the store, but is unable to afford it (a source of good- natured joking between Quentin and Del). Upon leaving the store, Sam watches a staged meeting between Quentin and Willy, a bass guitarist, in hopes that they can include him in their performances, but Sam is resistant to starting a band. The next day, the quartet meet to practice in Quentin's garage beneath his apartment, and Quentin is very evasive about his own past. The group, now complete, has impressed The Trill owner (played by director William H. Macy) who asks them to perform regular Saturday nights as house entertainment, to which the band agrees—even Sam, reluctantly. The new name, “Rudderless”, quickly gains notoriety and local fame. Meanwhile, Quentin is revealed as extremely shy of the opposite sex, which Sam attempts to help him through, though Quentin finds the advice generally unhelpful. Sam arrives at Quentin's apartment one afternoon and meets his mother, Joyce, who Sam mistakes as an older prostitute after seeing Quentin hand her a small amount of cash as they hug. Quentin is embarrassed because his mother has had issues with (unspecified) responsibilities, even spending his junior year of high school living in a car, and has vowed never to lower himself to that level of poverty again. At the mall, Sam buys Quentin new clothing to give him a style, and develop confidence from it. It does help a little, and Quentin begins to enjoy the attention Rudderless has gained him. Following the show, as the band members are to go to a party, Sam sees Kate—now calling herself by her middle name, Ann, who shames him for playing the songs in public. The next day, Sam visits Josh's grave and finds it vandalized as Josh Manning is revealed to have been the killer in the school shooting incident where he died. Emily arrives with cleaning supplies, and implies that it is a fairly regular occurrence, and the two parents begin to clean off the graffiti from the headstone. Afterward, the two share some tequila, and it is revealed that today is Josh's birthday. Emily tells Sam that a couple of the other parents have reached out to her to forgive them for Josh's actions, but Sam still appears to be in denial. Emily insists that they had acted properly in their parental roles and they have nothing to feel guilty for and that Josh had to have been mentally ill to carry out such an act of violence. Continuing to drink into the Saturday he is scheduled to work, Sam goes to his job and, finding a yard hammock, falls asleep. His employer finds and fires him. Sam assures him that he had already quit and walks away. Later that day, the other members of the band arrive with girls, and spend the afternoon on Sam's boat. As Sam goes below, the other members plead with him about a local block party they have been invited to play, and it is entirely possible it could lead to bigger and better opportunities for Rudderless in the way of airplay and exposure. But Sam is reluctant, now knowing that Josh's songs would never be accepted when people find out the truth of their authorship. Sam visits Del the next day to acquire a new amplifier tube, and finds Del and wife Tina having gotten the RV stuck. Sam manages to get it out onto the street. Del asks him why he will not play the show, and Sam begins to question why he is really doing all of this. He arrives at Quentin's garage and insists that the song Quentin wrote will be the final song, finally pushing him out of his comfort zone. Feeling good about the outcome, Sam makes his way toward the street stage and is surprised to find Kate/Ann talking to the other three members on the stage, presumably telling them the actual origin of the songs they all assumed Sam wrote. She confronts him and tells him that the incident and her association with it had so interfered with her life that she had to change her name and leave school. She had been pursued and harassed by people and media alike, asking humiliating questions, even suggesting they had been members of a cult. Quentin asks Sam if it was true, and Sam acknowledges the truth for the first time. Quentin outright refuses to play the material and strikes Sam as he is walking away despite the other two trying to persuade him to play the material one time only, and then move on. Sam again goes into a drinking binge and returns home to the marina to find the Board had the area sealed with a chain link fence. Sam attempts to climb it and falls over to the opposite side, breaking the guitar neck of his guitar strapped to his back, ruining it. The next morning, the scheduled sailing regatta Alaird warned him about is loudly underway. The sailboat procession is disrupted by Sam playing the 1812 Overture on his electric, sailing directly into the course of the other boats, and casting some over the sides of their own craft, for which Sam is arrested. He calls Del to bail him out and is surprised when Del tells him he knew who he was the entire time, but did not know the songs were written by Josh. The next day, Sam visits the site of the shooting, and finds the erected memorial identifying the shooting victims by name. Sam breaks down in tears of grief over the guilt of Josh's actions, but finally accepts that he has lost his own son despite what he has done. Sam then visits Emily, bring her Josh's discs, and says that one day, the new baby will want to know who his half brother was beyond what history will paint him to be. Sam then visits Del's store and discovers Quentin has discarded his instruments, telling Del to sell them on consignment. Sam then asks if the offer on the store was a \\"good offer\\", implying that Sam would be interested in buying Del's store. He then goes to visit Quentin at the donut shop where he works, and implores him to continue playing and writing even if it is without Sam. Sam tells him that he found performing Josh's material addictive, offering catharsis to his life and the bond with Josh. He concludes the visit, having brought back Quentin's guitar cases. One contains the Les Paul that Quentin so long idolized and wanted. Finally, Sam performs the songs he had been working on, first admitting and telling the audience who Josh was, what he had done, and that he had written the song he was about to play. Closure for Rudderless lets us see Sam has been replaced by a new guitarist. Del has been given Sam's sailboat (presumably in payment), and Emily finally decides to listen to Josh's music. Sam completes the song, including (presumably) improvised lyrics about missing his son in the song's climax and leaves the stage.

Scenes were shot at University of Central Oklahoma. Filming wrapped on May 26, 2013. Reception Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 63% based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10; the site's critical consensus reads, \\"Rudderless asks its cast to carry an awful lot of weight for its occasionally manipulative story; fortunately, this talented bunch -- led by Billy Crudup -- is often more than up to the task\\". On Metacritic, the film has a score of 52 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". While many critics spoke positively of Macy's direction, the soundtrack, and the performances of Crudup and Yelchin, many found issue with the third-act revelation; writing for Variety, Dennis Harvey described it as a \\"bewildering error in narrative judgement\\".

Hamilton was born in Hobart to merchant Clyde Hamilton and Beatrice Lilian, née Paxton. He attended Leslie House School in Hobart before studying at the University of Sydney, where he received a Bachelor of Medicine in 1924. After studying ophthalmic medicine in England at the Royal College of Physicians and Oxford University (1928-29), he returned to Tasmania to set up his own practice. He was also honorary or consulting ophthalmic surgeon to the Royal Hobart Hospital, the Queen Alexandra Hospital for Women and the Royal Tasmanian Society for the Blind and Deaf. In 1937, Hamilton and Dr W. D.

The relief measures six feet in height and was carved in pink limestone. It depicts the King Naram-Sin of Akkad leading the Akkadian army to victory over the Lullubi, a mountain people from the Zagros Mountains. It shows a narrative of the King crossing the steep slopes into enemy territory; on the left are the ordered imperial forces keeping in rank while marching over the disordered defenders that lie broken and defeated. Naram-Sin in shown as by far the most important figure; he is shown towering over his enemy and troops and all eyes gaze up toward him. The weak and chaotic opposing forces are shown being thrown from atop the mountainside, impaled by spears, fleeing and begging Naram-Sin for mercy as well as being trampled underfoot by Naram- Sin himself. This is supposed to convey their uncivilized and barbaric nature making the conquest justified. The stele is unique in two regards. Most conquest depictions are shown horizontally, with the King being at the top- center. This stele depicts the victory in a diagonal fashion with the King still being at the top-center but where everyone else can look up to him. The second unique aspect of the piece is that Naram-Sin is shown wearing a bull- horned helmet or shown as the face of lion. Helmets of this type at the time when this stele was commissioned were only worn by the Gods. This stele is in essence telling the viewer that Naram-Sin is a victorious conqueror as a result of his divine status. But it also shows Naram-Sin gazing up toward two stars. Showing that although Naram-Sin is a god, a feat that was up to this point only achieved by deceased kings, he is still not the most powerful of gods.  Rediscovery  The stele is believed to originally be from Sippar, but was found at the Iranian site of Susa. It was taken out of Mesopotamia by the Elamite King Shutruk-Nakhunte in the 12th century BC. Shutruk-Nakhunte was a descendant of the Lullubi people, whose defeat the stele commemorated. He also claimed to carry the stele there himself. The already ancient inscription was kept, indicating respect for Naram-Sin's victory. He did, however, add an inscription declaring his own glory and tells how the stele was carried out of the city after the pillage of the city Sippar. In 1898, Jacques de Morgan, a French archaeologist, excavated the stele and it was moved to the Louvre in Paris where it remains today. Inscriptions Naram-Sin stele, inscription of Shutruk-Nahhunte in Elamite The inscription over the head of king Naram-Sin is in Akkadian language and script and fragmentary, but reads: The second inscription, to the right over the mountainous cone, is in Elamite and was written about 1000 years later by Shutruk-Nahhunte who took the stele and brought it with him to Elam:  Narrative  Naram-Sin is shown as a god-like figure on the stele. Naram-Sin is wearing the horned helmet showing his god- like status, and authority. He is supported by his ordered troops and feared by his defeated enemies. His face is that of lion or bull, signifying his powers. He is also depicted by showing no mercy to his enemy. One of the defeated people pleas for their lives on the top right as they run from Naram- Sin. This is for good reason because he is shown stepping on the dead body of one of the Lullubi people after kicking another off the side of the mountain. He has stabbed another in the neck with a spear and is holding an arrow to perhaps impale the next. The Lullubi people are shown in stark contrast to the Akkadian soldiers they are shown as a disorganized chaotic mess of individuals being trampled underfoot by the very organized Akkadians. King Naram-Sin standing over Lullubian corpses (detail). A tree native to the area is pictured between the two groups of soldiers, firstly to locate the battle in a specific place, and to help frame the stele. The Lullubi grovel before the conqueror who has destroyed them and will show no mercy. They are depicted as a broken group lacking discipline, conveying their uncivilized and barbaric nature, which in turn justified the conquest. They were seen as uncivilized and barbaric and the much stronger Akkadians deserve to rule over them. It is also there to strike fear into the hearts of any rebels that wish to challenge the rule of the King. This shows his lack of mercy and that any resistance is futile. Lullubi king Satuni appears standing to the right, imploring the Akkadian king to spare him (detail). Lullubi victims are usually shown with pointed beards and long braided hair.\\"The hair of the Lullubi is long and worn in a thick braid. They wear animal skins, while the Akkadian soldiers wear the proper attire for battle, helmets and military tunics.\\" in When a figure is shown wearing a horned helmet in Akkad at the time they would commonly considered a god. Here Naram-Sin is wearing just such a helmet and shows the viewer that Naram-Sin is in fact a god-king. Divinity is further represented in the three sun-stars pictured above the mountain top. Although there are indeed three stars, only two can be seen due to the fact that the stele was damaged at some point in its existence, effectively removing the third star. The sun-stars consist of a series of eight point stars which have flames radiating between the points. These are meant to represent the Assyrian god, Shamash, watching over the battle between the Akkadians and Lullubi people.Unknown. Victory of Naram-Sin over the Lullubi Tribes [stele]. Reign of Naram-Sin (ca. 2250 B.C.). Artstor, library.artstor.org/asset/AWSS35953_35953_31679780 The low depth, typical of similar reliefs, is unusual in the diagonal composition (compare the scenes on the Standard of Ur). This was perhaps to create a more interesting composition or to perhaps allow everyone depicted in the scene to look up to Naram-Sin. Naram's horned helmet and much larger size show him as powerful and godly. Perhaps given his divine and godly power, the sun could have been the god to give him his power. The text under the sun was written in Akkadian cuneiform and depicts the rise of the Akkadians over the Lullubians. Naram-Sin leading his army into destroying the last of the Lullubians shows just how powerful the Akkadians and Naram-Sin truly are and they are not a group to reckon with. Naram-Sin thought of himself as godly, which explains his depiction as very god-like.. Alternatively, the stele may depict a campaign to Cilicia; the strongest indication of this is the form of the booty—a metal vessel—carried by one of Naram-Sin's soldiers. Completely foreign to Mesopotamia, the vessel closely resembles Anatolian crafts from Troy and Cilicia. These vessels—ceramic or metal—were produced during the Early Bronze III Period, which is around the time of Naram-Sin's rule. File:Victory stele of Naram Sin 9069.jpgLower section.

Due to its invasive nature, it can be found in countries such as Pakistan (Punjab & Kashmir), China, Japan, Korea, India, Australia, South Africa, and has since been introduced to the Mid-Atlantic United States. There are no recognized subspecies in Catalogue of Life. Description Flowers of Oplismenus undulatifolius are typically very light in color compared to the deep-red flowers of Oplismenus hirtellus. Oplismenus undulatifolius is a shallow rooted perennial with stolons that may grow to several feet in length. The leaves of overwintering plants become brown and dead, but in the spring, new growth begins at the upper nodes of the stolons. In early fall, the sticky awns readily adhere to anything that brushes against them which makes for an effective mode of dispersal. The species is long with leaf-blades being slightly lanceolate, ovate, and are long and wide. Its inflorescence is long and is made out of 5-11 cuneate fascicles which are in length and carry 2-6 spikelets. Spikelets are lanceolate just like leaf-blades, and are in length. They are also glabrous and pubescent and have glumes which have smooth viscid awns which are long. The awns of lower glumes are purple, are in length and are 3-5 veined. The lower lemma is herbaceous and have 5-9 veins while the upper one is 5 veined with an awn that is . The species apex have a stout that is long. Flowers and fruits grow from July to November. This species grows particularly well in moist, shaded environments, in a variety of soil types. In Australia it grows in shady coastal forests at Coffs Harbour. Ecology In its native range, Oplismenus undulatifolius is a food source for many species of Lepidoptera, including Elachista kurokoi,, 2005: A revision of the Elachista praelineata group (Lepidoptera: Elachistidae) in Japan, with comments on morphology of the pupa in Elachista.

As an invasive species  Accidentally introduced into the United States in Maryland and Virginia, this species spreads quickly and is becoming extremely invasive in forested natural areas in the Mid-Atlantic region across numerous counties in Maryland and Virginia. The species was first reported in Maryland in 1996, growing around the Liberty Reservoir area and the northern section of the Patapsco River in Howard County. The grass spread quickly into connected natural areas in Baltimore and Carroll counties. By 1999 it was identified in Montgomery County at Wheaton Regional Park.Peterson, P.M., E.E. Terrell, E.C. Uebel, C.A. Davis, H. Scholz, and R.J. Soreng. 1999. (Scientific Note) Oplismenus hirtellus subspecies undulatifolius, A new record for North America. Castanea 64:201-202. In 2006 it was identified in Prince George's County at Little Paint Branch Park , the adjacent Beltsville Agricultural Research Center-East and the National Greenbelt Park. It had crossed into Virginia by 2004 where it was found growing at an site in Shenandoah National Park, and in a site at the Fraser Preserve along the Potomac River in Fairfax County. Once a population has become established, complete eradication from a site has proven to be extremely difficult due to a long-lived perennial life cycle, a long seed germination season (April–November), and considerable seed mobility of the species.

It is primarily operated by the French national railway company SNCF, and also in operation with the Moroccan national railway company ONCF. It is the 3rd generation of the TGV Duplex. The Euroduplex trains are interoperable, containing equipment allowing them to travel between several European continental countries with various types of electrification and signalling systems such as France, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and Luxembourg. A Moroccan variation is the first high speed train to operate in Africa. Description The Euroduplex trains are an evolution of the TGV Duplex Dasye and still share the main features. The drive is of type SNCF TGV POS asynchronous traction motors, European signaling system European Rail Traffic Management System. The trailers feature improved information systems and the 3UFC type feature new interiors with rotating seats and USB sockets. The main differences with the TGV Duplex Dasye: * UIC loading gauge with more headroom upstairs * Improved windows * Passenger Information System (SIVE) with voice announcements as in the TER trains. * Outside SIVE dynamic light display indicating the number of the train, its route and the number of the car * Fixed filler gaps on all doors, * Control over the train hot boxes (two sensors per box for redundancy) * Overall control of each axle * Improved accessibility for wheelchairs The 3UFC type have new interiors that include: *New seats design in both classes *Rotating seats USB sockets in first class *Individual lights are now included in the seats History Riding on the success of the concept TGV Duplex, and praised by customers, the company decided to develop a fleet of interoperable trains, especially suitable for 15 kV 16 ⅔ Hz (only 8 trains TGV Sud-Est could operate at this current and 19 trains are then TGV POS), the train is a tricurrent version of TGV Duplex. The Euroduplex has entered commercial operation by the French national railway company on .

In June 2007,bimonthly journal Railways \\"The engine SNCF equipment in 2008-2009\\", No. 175, September–October 2009, page 15 in addition to 25 extra TGV Dasye sets (+ 3 others 2008), the SNCF has placed a large order for 55 Alstom tricurrent high speed trains, TGV 2N2. These 55 trains can be divided into: * 30 trains \\"3UA\\" (tricurrent Germany), numbered 4701-4730 (4 international) for services from France to Germany and Switzerland. Prototypes were tested from August 2010, the remaining deliveries expected between 2011 and 2014; * 10 trains \\"3RU\\" (tricurrent Spain), numbered 801 to 810, for services between France and Spain (deliveries from 2013); * 15 trains \\"3UF\\" (tricurrent France), numbered 811-825, intended for domestic traffic in France (deliveries from 2014); * A Power Reserve \\"3UA\\" compatible with the 55 cars and also for the TGV POS and TGV Duplex Dasye. In April 2010, the first train RGV, numbered 4701, was tested at La Rochelle. On 16 June 2010, the train arrived at the site of ELWT Conflans to be equipped with different systems to perform many tests in the coming months before commercial operation. Between 20 and 30 July 2010, the train conducted speed tests in Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the French Alps. SNCF and Alstom organized the symbolic delivery of the first train on May 30, 2011 on the LGV Est.book the SNCF TGV Duplex 3rd generation  date = May 30, 2011 The 2007 contract included an option for 40 additional trains. SNCF exercised this option to take delivery of the second batch of Euroduplex sets from 2015. These the 3UFC type (the \\"C\\" stands for capacity) and named \\"l'Océane\\" were delivered between 2016 and 2019 and have replaced some sets on TGV Atlantique with the opening of the LGV Sud Europe Atlantique. They offer a new inerior design and a improved capacity by 10% due to the third car being multi-class and were delivered between 2016 and 2019 and are numbered from 851 to 891 (minus 866 who is only constitued of the power reserve motor). To save the jobs of the Alstom factory of Belfort, the french state announced in October 2016 a order of fifteen trains to be used on the Intercity line between Bordeaux and Marseille. That order was done by the SNCF in February 2017. These trains are from the 3UFC type numbered from 836 to 850 and are in delivery starting from August 2019 and are used with the others 3UFC. Finally in July 2019, the SNCF announced the order of twelve trains that will be delivered between 2021 and 2022 (which would be shortly before the arrival of the first Avelia Horizon). The complete fleet would have 122 trains once the final order would be done. ONCF ONCF TGV 2N2 Euroduplex. ONCF Moroccan TGV coach delivery. RAn ONCF Alstom RGV2N2 high-speed trainset at Tanger Ville railway station in November 2018. The Moroccan fast train Al Boraq (The Lightning) lives up to its name. In December 2010, the Moroccan company ONCF ordered 14 sets of the Euroduplex for Kenitra–Tangier high-speed rail line. The contract of €400 million expected commissioning in 2015. The trains are electrified at 25 kV and 3 kV and can operate at up to on the section Tangiers — Kenitra and between on the Moroccan conventional network. The Moroccan trainsets have a total capacity of 533 passengers in two first class carriages, five second class carriages, and a catering coach, instead of the French configuration of three first class coaches, four second class coaches, and a catering coach. The first two cars will be delivered during the summer of 2015, transported from the port of La Rochelle by the ship Ville de Bordeaux. The project being more than two years late on its initial schedule (due to land acquisition difficulties), Alstom Transport incurs additional costs, in particular through the forced storage of several trains in its factories. The first dynamic tests of a train (No. 1201, specially assigned to tests) began in January 2016, on the classic line connecting Tangier to Casablanca, with drivers who were specially trained (partly in France, by the SNCF ); these tests were completed in July 2016. At the same time (on 11 July), the twelve trains were delivered1. LGV testing began in February 2017 and was completed in June 2018; during one of them, carried out on May 4, 2018, the train rode at 357 km/h (which constitutes the record of rail speed in Africa). The maintenance center, with a total capacity of 30 trains and an area of 14 hectares, is located in Tangier-Moghogha. Usage SNCF Since its introduction into commercial service, the 4700 numbered trains operate priority international services: *Alleo Paris-Est — Stuttgart — Munich (via LGV East Europe) *Alleo Frankfurt — Strasbourg — Lyon- Part-Dieu — Marseille (via the LGV Rhin-Rhône and Mediterranean) *Lyria Paris- Gare de Lyon — Basel — Zürich (via the Rhine-Rhône) since January 2012 (three of the six round trips, the others were being operated by TGV POS until December 15 2019 where Lyria started operating exclusively with the Euroduplex) The trains are used on domestic routes (via the LGV Est to Strasbourg, Reims, Remiremont, but also via the Rhin-Rhône to Colmar and Mulhouse among others). The 800 numbered trains are designed to provide international services to Spain: *Elipsos: Paris-Gare de Lyon — Lyon Part Dieu — Montpellier — Figueres — Barcelona (in a pool with TGV Duplex Dasye) The 3UFC are all operating from Paris Montparnasse firstly towards Bordeaux — Agen — Montauban — Toulouse — Arcachon — Dax — Bayonne — Biarritz — Saint-Jean-de- Luz — Saint-Jean-de-Luz — Pau — Lourdes — Tarbes. Then towards Le Mans — Rennes — Quimper — Brest — Angers — Nantes — Saint-Nazaire — Le Croisic — Les Sables-d'Olonne ONCF Since November 26 2018, the Moroccan trains make the connections between Tanger and Casablanca via Rabat.. The name of the commercial service is Al Boraq. It is operated in partnership with SNCF, within the framework of the joint venture \\"Moroccan high-speed train maintenance company\\".

The anchor store is HOM Furniture. There are 2 vacant anchor stores that were once JCPenney and Sears. It is managed by Mid-America Real Estate Group. History The downtown area of Wausau was blighted by many vacant buildings in the late 1970s. A referendum was passed in 1979 to allow Richard E. Jacobs' Jacobs Visconsi & Jacobs Group to build the mall. Approximately 67 buildings were demolished to make way for the mall, which opened on August 3, 1983. To commemorate the opening, a five-day-long celebration was held. Its original anchors were J. C. Penney, Sears, and Prange's (later Younkers). Walgreens, an original tenant, moved out in 2003. In 2006, the mall owners began a renovation which included new seating areas and an improved mall entrance. Two years later, the food court was expanded, using space vacated that same year by a McDonald's. The mall lost all three anchor stores between 2014 and 2018, with Younkers being the last of the three to close; in June 2019, HOM Furniture opened as the center's sole anchor store, having acquired the previously closed Younkers location.https://wausaupilotandreview.com/2018/01/31/wausau-center-younkers- to-close/ References External links *Wausau Center Category:Buildings and structures in Marathon County, Wisconsin Category:Shopping malls in Wisconsin Category:Shopping malls established in 1983 Category:Wausau, Wisconsin Category:1983 establishments in Wisconsin ","title":"Wausau Center"},{"id":"39399692","text":"Back Country Suite is the debut album by blues/jazz pianist and vocalist Mose Allison which was recorded in 1957 and later released on the Prestige label.Prestige Records discography accessed May 16, 2013 The album features the first recording of Allison's \\"Young Man Blues\\" (titled simply \\"Blues\\") which was later covered by The Who on their album Live at Leeds.

The Reading Terminal Market in Center City is one of America's oldest and largest public markets. Shopping options in Center City include Fashion District Philadelphia, The Shops at Liberty Place, Jewelers' Row, South Street, Old City's 3rd Street Corridor, and a wide variety of standalone independent retailers. The Rittenhouse area, known as Philadelphia's outdoor shopping mall, includes Rittenhouse Row, a four-block section of Walnut Street, which has higher-end clothing chain stores and some hipster-inspired clothing stores. The parallel streets of Sansom and Chestnut have some high- end boutiques and clothing retailers. Old City, especially the 3rd Street corridor, has locally owned independent boutiques and art/design galleries. Midway between Old City and Broad Street is the Reading Terminal Market, with dozens of take-out restaurants, specialty food vendors, and small grocery store operators, a few of which are operated by Amish farmers from nearby Lancaster County. Philadelphia has a few eclectic neighborhood shopping districts, which generally consist of a few blocks along a major neighborhood thoroughfare, such as in Manayunk or Chestnut Hill. The Italian Market in South Philadelphia offers groceries, meats, cheeses and housewares, historically from Italy, but now from many nationalities. Two famed cheesesteak restaurants, Geno's and Pat's, are located nearby. There are several large shopping malls and strip malls in the region, including Philadelphia Mills in Northeast Philadelphia, and many in the suburbs, most notably the King of Prussia mall in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, from the heart of the city. The King of Prussia mall is the largest shopping mall on the U.S. East Coast and the largest in the country in terms of leasable retail space.  Innovation  During the 20th century, the city was a focal point of retail innovation. Suburban Square in Ardmore, Montgomery County, is sometimes considered the first modern shopping center in the world. Built in stages from 1927 to 1931, it was one of the first institutions to define the Pennsylvania Main Line in the 1920s. More importantly, it contains one of the oldest surviving department store branches in the country, a Strawbridge & Clothier, now a Macy's as of recently. Since then, large malls such as Cherry Hill Mall and King of Prussia have opened nearby. Some of the first modern discount stores followed. Much of Kmart's earlier growth was in the Philadelphia area during the early 1960s. Defunct chains such as Bradlees, Caldor, Jamesway, Ames, Woolco, Two Guys, Hills Department Stores, Zayre, Richway, Korvettes, Nichols, Gaylords, Murphy Mart, and later Value City were concentrated in Philadelphia and other East Coast markets. This growth occurred largely during the 1950s–1970s, before the national growth of Wal- Mart and Target in the 1980s. Another was Strawbridge's own, Clover. Philadelphia was the home of many pioneering supermarket chains during the same period, many of which had trademark architecture. The longest-running of these is Acme, formerly known as American Stores and Super Saver. Other examples are long-defunct Food Fair (Pantry Pride) and Penn Fruit, but Acme has closed many stores and was sold to Albertsons. They have however acquired many stores from their failed rivals. A&P;, based in New York City, once had Philadelphia as a core market. After many previous store closings, the company shuttered its entire Philadelphia division in 1982. Due to a union outcry, it built some new stores and reopened others as Super Fresh from 1982 to 1985. The A&P; name lives on in the nearby New York/New England market. More recently, the company acquired established Philadelphia/New York chain Pathmark. Many of these stores that have closed were replaced by franchises such as Shur-Fine, Supervalu, IGA, and Thriftway/Shop 'n Bag. Many other former supermarkets have become off-price stores such as Big Lots, Family Dollar, and Dollar General. Current major players in the region today include ShopRite, Save-a-Lot, Aldi, Giant-Carlisle, and local chain Genuardi's. Failed family-owned chains are Clemens and Giunta's. Newer upscale chains include Whole Foods, Wegmans, and Trader Joe's. There are few Wal-Mart Supercenters in the immediate area. In nearby markets, Safeway, Stop & Shop, Giant-Landover, Kroger, Food Lion, and formerly Grand Union operate. Drug chains CVS, Rite Aid, and formerly Eckerd and Drug Emporium are common in the region. JCPenney also for many years operated the leading Thrift Drug chain. All these chains often anchored shopping centers along with a supermarket. Acme for many years also owned \\"Rea & Derick\\" drugstores under this arrangement, in partnership with the Rexall chain. In recent decades, supermarkets have added pharmacies of their own. At the same time, drugstores have relocated to corner locations or \\"inherited\\" obsolete supermarkets. Similar trends have occurred in other cities. Food Fair/Pantry Pride and Stop & Shop also shared many shopping centers with subsidiaries J.M. Fields and Bradlees, often with the stores directly connected. In fact, both divisions were acquired the same year, in 1961. Several J.M. Fields stores gave way to Bradlees as well. There once were many small enclosed malls in the area with a similar style, such as MacDade Mall. Pennsylvania is also unique in that it has a \\"State Store\\" system for non-beer alcohol sales. Wine and spirits are only sold at stores operated by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, which are ubiquitous in Philadelphia. For many years, these stores were called \\"State Store\\", only had \\"counter\\" service, and were strictly closed on Sundays. Many of them were and still are small but important anchors in shopping centers. In the 1970s, all but a few \\"urban\\" locations were made into conventional stores with aisles. Later, their hours, selection, and square footage have greatly been expanded. To this day, however, the stores lack a consistent name and logo. Some are called simply \\"liquor store\\", while most have some variation on the words \\"Wine & Spirits\\" or \\"Wine & Spirits Shoppe\\". The state also allows winery retail stores. Also important to the local economy are Wawa, Comcast, Citizens Bank, Sunoco, and Lukoil. These companies all have many major sponsorships. Philadelphia has had its share of local retailers as well, many of which have been bought out or closed. Many national big-box and mall retailers have arrived since the 1980s.

History The property was the site of the \\"Old Englyshe Fayre\\", an open area entertainment venue, built by Court, Butcher and Co (Elsie Court and Thomas W. Butcher) in 1897. The foundation stone for the theatre was laid by the owner, James Gallop, on 20 February 1904. Tenders for the project had been let in January of that year and when the foundation ceremony was performed, James Brownlie, the contractor, had completed the foundations and commenced the brickwork for all external walls. The project consisted of the theatre and five shops on a site adjoining the Freemasons Hotel, (now Sail and Anchor Hotel) at that time also owned by James Gallop. Entry was between shops into a foyer on ground floor, to stalls in the auditorium and a staircase led to supper rooms over the shops, accessible to the dress circle, with a balcony over the pavement. The King's Theatre was opened on 27 September 1904. It was also commonly known as the Dalkeith Opera House, in reference to the owner, James Gallop of (the suburb of) Dalkeith. The large, two storey, theatre building was designed to accommodate 1,200 people. The venue was used by a range of promoters presented live performances from concerts, pantomime, plays to follies featuring singers, dancers, musical and acrobatic numbers. It was also used to screen films and as a boxing venue. The King's Theatre was used during World War I by a repertory group known as the Black Butterflies. The building still stands with its rendered brick, decorative cornice, stuccoed parapet and pediment. The theatre had a sliding roof, a large fly system and twelve dressing rooms. The street frontage is now given over to shops. In 1991 the venue was opened as Metropolis Concert Club Fremantle, in 2002 following extensive renovations the club was re-opened as Metropolis Fremantle. In December 2015, Adam Ryan Kennedy, a bouncer working at the club, placed a patron into a chokehold and hit his head against a wall while unconscious. He was sentenced to eight months in prison along with fines.

He died in his twenties from either poisoning or exhaustion. Career Aaron and his twin brother, Marion \\"Lindberg\\" Sparks, were born in Corona, Lee County, Mississippi, to Sullie Gant and Ruth McWhorter. They later took the surname of their stepfather, Carl Sparks. In 1920, the family moved to St. Louis, where Pinetop had \\"rudimentary music education at school\\". He and his twin brother formed a group, with Aaron playing the piano in a boogie-woogie style and Marion singing. They were accompanied by the guitarist Pete Bogans and the trombone player Ike Rogers. The boys had a sister, Jimmie Lee, who never recorded songs but, according to Henry Townsend, had a wonderful singing voice. Townsend recalled in his memoir that Pinetop played, like all other St. Louis musicians, in the \\"speakeasy type places\\", such as Nettie's on Delmar Boulevard. Their first recording session was in 1932, when they recorded a number of blues and boogie-woogie songs. Pinetop (who got his nickname from playing Pinetop Smith's hit \\"Pine Top's Boogie Woogie\\") has been praised for \\"excellent technique\\", capable of both \\"fierce boogie-woogie style\\" and \\"chorded basses and rich treble passages\\" to accompany his brother. Pinetop also recorded \\"Bad Luck Blues\\" with Dorothea Trowbridge and \\"Whiskey Blues\\" with Elizabeth Washington, both in 1933. Most often, the brothers played together only occasionally. Notable recordings by Pinetop include \\"Every Day I Have the Blues\\", a song he wrote with his brother, recorded July 28, 1935 for Bluebird Records (catalog number B-6125) and reissued on the compilation album Windy City Blues (Nighthawk, 1992). In 1949, the song was recorded under a different title by Memphis Slim. Death There are rumors the brothers did not always get along and did not have steady employment. They also frequently had run-ins with the law. Pinetop drank heavily, and Lindberg killed a man (in self-defense), for which he spent time in the workhouse in 1937. Pinetop died, apparently of poisoning, in 1935. Townsend, however, claims that Pinetop was in the habit of never saying no to a gig; playing all throughout the weekend and consequently work 24 hours without sleep. It was these work habits, combined with heavy drinking (to stay awake) that led to Pinetop's death. \\"He just done burned himself out\\", according to Townsend. Pinetop Sparks' grave went unmarked for nearly eight decades, before a fan club finally honored him. In 2014 - 78 years after Sparks' death - thanks to the work of a non-profit organization, the Killer Blues Headstone Project, a headstone was laid at Father Dickson Cemetery in Crestwood, Missouri, a historically black cemetery in St Louis. A keyboard adorns the lower casing of the stone, with his name, dates of birth and death, and the epitaph \\"Every Day I Have the Blues\\".

In addition to being named in the colts team of the year and win the league coaches award. AFL career Kent at training in November 2015 Kent was recruited by the Melbourne Football Club with their third selection and forty-eighth overall in the 2012 national draft. After strong form in the Victorian Football League (VFL) for Melbourne's affiliate team, the Casey Scorpions, he made his AFL debut in the sixty-one point loss against at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in round six. He started the match as the substitute, but came into the match in the first quarter, replacing the injured co-captain, Jack Grimes. He played the next week before he was omitted for the round eight clash against at the Melbourne Cricket Ground; he returned to the senior side for the ninety-five point loss against at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in round ten and did not miss a match for the remainder of the season to finish with fifteen matches for the year. Kent played his first match for the 2014 season in the thirty-two point loss against at Spotless Stadium in round three. He played the next week before he was forced to be a late withdrawal from the round five match against after injuring his calf at training. He missed the next month of football before returning from injury through the VFL, and returned to the AFL side for the one point win against at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in round thirteen. He played every match for the remainder of the year, playing thirteen matches in total. Kent started the 2015 season in the AFL when he played in the twenty-six point win against Gold Coast at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in round one. He played the first four matches of the year before suffering a hamstring injury in the second quarter of the round four win against Richmond, with the initial prognosis ruling him out for one month. After requiring surgery on his hamstring, he was forced to miss nearly three months of any football. He returned from injury via the VFL Development League, where he tore his hamstring again and missed the next four weeks. He didn't play another AFL match for the season, he did, however, play the last three VFL matches of the year. After having his first pre-season without suffering from an injury, and playing every match in the 2016 NAB Challenge, Kent played in the opening match of the season in the two-point win against Greater Western Sydney at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He played the first seven matches of the year before missing the round eight match against the in round eight due to a back injury; he returned the next week in the sixty-three point win against at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In July, he signed a two-year contract, tying him to the club until the end of the 2018 season. He played his fiftieth AFL match in the twenty-nine point win against at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in round twenty. After playing twenty matches for the season, he was praised by Fox Sports Australia journalist, Tiarne Swersky, where he was named as one of Melbourne's \\"most important and lively players up forward,\\" furthermore, he finished tenth in Melbourne best and fairest count, and was named in the initial 22under22 squad. Kent had a delayed start to the 2017 season after experiencing a persistent back injury during the pre-season. He didn't play his first match of the year until the twenty-nine point loss against at Etihad Stadium in round three. He played two matches before he was omitted for the round five match against Richmond at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He was recalled to the AFL side for the forty-one point win against at Adelaide Oval in round eight and could only manage two consecutive matches before he was dropped for the round ten match against Gold Coast at TIO Traeger Park. It took nearly two months for Kent to find his way back into the senior team, which was delayed due to a club suspension for breaching club rules on alcohol protocols. He returned to the AFL side a week after his club suspension for the eight point win against Carlton at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in round sixteen. In his second match back in the AFL, he dislocated his shoulder when tackling Rory Sloane in the match against Adelaide at TIO Stadium and he missed the remainder of the season, playing just six games for the year. At the conclusion of the 2018 season, Kent requested a trade to St Kilda. He was officially traded on 12 October.

They have been able to fight against strong epidemic diseases.  Health status   Life expectancy  Zimbabwe had an average life expectancy of 55.68 years according to the 2014 CIA estimate.  Malaria  Malaria is a major health problem in Zimbabwe with about half the population at risk. Malaria epidemiology varies across the country ranging from year-round transmission in lowland areas to epidemic-prone areas in highland areas. Transmission is seasonal, occurring primarily between November and April, correlating closely with rainfall. According to Zimbabwe's District Health Information System-2, approximately 82 percent of malaria cases in 2016 originated from three eastern provinces (Manicaland, Mashonaland East, and Mashonaland Central), with 39 percent of all cases and 31 percent of all deaths coming from Manicaland. The concentrated trend of malaria cases and deaths in three provinces has remained consistent since 2013. Reported cases decreased from 1.8 million in 2006 to 281,000 in 2016 (20.5 per 1,000 population per year). New cases mostly occur along the Zimbabwe-Mozambique border, including Manicaland, where Anopheles funestus (mosquito vector) resistance to pyrethroid class insecticides was identified in 2013. It is difficult to quantify if the case burden in this area is also due to migration across the border, strengthened surveillance systems, or ineffective malaria control interventions.  Cholera  A 2008 cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe began in August 2008, swept across the country and spread to Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa and Zambia. By 10 January 2010 there had been 98,741 reported cases and 4,293 deaths making it the deadliest African cholera outbreak since 1993.Epidemiological Bulletin Number 41 Week 1 (week ending 10 January 2010), Retrieved on 19 April 2008. The Government of Zimbabwe declared the outbreak a national emergency and requested international aid. There was also a 2018-2019 cholera outbreak with a total of 10,421 cases, including 69 deaths. Following Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, 490,000 people were vaccinated in Chimanimani and Chipinge districts in Manicaland Province with the goal of preempting a possible cholera outbreak.UNICEF, 2019. Cyclone-affected communities in Zimbabwe being vaccinated against cholera [WWW Document].

OCHA. URL https://www.unocha.org/southern-and-eastern-africa-rosea/cyclones-idai-and- kenneth (accessed 12.2.19). There were no cholera cases following the cyclones in Zimbabwe, but there were cases in neighboring Mozambique.Cambaza, E. et al. (2019) ‘Outbreak of Cholera Due to Cyclone Kenneth in Northern Mozambique, 2019’, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 16(16). doi: 10.3390/ijerph16162925.  HIV/AIDS  Zimbabwe was and still is one of the countries that have been strongly afflicted by HIV/AIDS.Owomoyela, Oyekan (2002). \\"Culture and Customs of Zimbabwe\\", p. 108. Greenwood Press, London. . Many of the males were affected, hence leaving many widowed females. This happened to bring on a sense of independence and the role of the breadwinner for the females – changing the roles of the sex. The immensity of this health issue can be clearly determined through this particular statistic: one in every five children are orphaned due to the HIV/AIDS crisisElder, James. \\"HIV/AIDS: A deadly crisis each day in Zimbabwe\\", Unicef, Bulawayo, 24 March 2005 . Retrieved on 25 April 2013. – making an overall number of approximately 1 million orphans due to AIDS in 2011. The use of a four-question survey administered to large numbers of children may reduce the number of children put through the invasive medical test for HIV, and therefore save money. In 2011 the number of people living with HIV/AIDS reached approximately 1.2 million, when Zimbabwe had a population of approximately 12.75 million at that time. People infected with HIV/AIDS made up 9.41% of the population.  Tuberculosis, a  Zimbabwe is ranked among the 22 countries, where tuberculosis occurs frequently. In 2000, the incidence rate of tuberculosis reached 726 incidents per 100,000 people, whereas in 2011 the number decreased to 603 incidents per 100,000 people. In 2011, the number of incidences of tuberculosis in Zimbabwe was 80 thousand, and the number of deaths from this disease was 3.4 thousand. Africa is the top continent where tuberculosis occurs frequently, as it reached an estimated value of 2.3 million for incidences in 2010 by the World Health Organization.  Maternal and child health  According to the UNDP, Zimbabwe has eight Millennium Development Goals, the fourth is Child Health. Zimbabwe's infant mortality rates have been decreasing. In 2000, the infant mortality rate was 63 deaths per 1000 people, whereas in 2010 the infant mortality rate was 45 deaths per 1000 people. This is an optimistic result from the goals that the Zimbabwean government – the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare – has set up, in order to decrease the infant/child mortality rates. Some of the most common diseases that these young children are facing are hunger: iron deficiency anaemia, vitamin A deficiency, and mentally impaired (iodine deficiency), and childhood diseases: acute respiratory infections, diarrhoeal disease, and malaria.United Nations World Food Programme (WFP)(2007). World Hunger Series 2007 : Hunger and Health, Table 6a. The World Food Programme, Rome. . Among these, the most common disease is 35,000 children suffering with mental impairment disabilities due to iodine deficiency. Many of the commonly occurring diseases which often to lead to death are regarding hunger – nutritional deficiencies are causes of much infant mortality in Zimbabwe. HIV/AIDS is also an immense conflict in Zimbabwe – it also affects their infant mortality. HIV/AIDS is transmitted many ways, one of which is through the process of giving birth – passing through the birth canal and breast feeding.Rom, William N (2007). \\"Environmental And Occupational Medicine\\", p. 745. Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia. . As the number of mothers infected with HIV/AIDS increases, the amount of infant mortality due to HIV/AIDS will also increase. HIV/AIDS is also one of the eight Millennium Development Goals that is wished to be achieved by Zimbabwe. Ranking 14th as the country with the highest rate of maternal mortality, Zimbabwe had 570 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2010. It has decreased significantly from 2000, when the maternal mortality rate was 640 deaths per 100,000 live births. According to the UNDP, maternal death mainly occurs due to AIDS-related diseases, hemorrhaging, and hypertension. In many cases, the pregnant women and mothers lack in iron, causing iron deficiency anaemia; some women also deal with neural tube birth defects – all of these which may be passed onto their children.  Contraception  Zimbabwe has been the central focus of promoting contraceptives and their methods of use to countries within Africa. It began a new industry where they produce wooden penises to be exported to other parts of Africa, for demonstration purposes.Keller, Bill. \\"Zimbabwe Taking a Lead In Promoting Birth Control\\", The New York Times, New York, 04 September 1994. Retrieved on 30 April 2013. The use of contraceptives in Zimbabwe has definitely changed the size of its population and the growth rate – steadily declining. There are many civil servants who work for the government to promote and inform families in the rural areas of contraceptives and its uses. Female condoms are used in Zimbabwe as a source of contraception. Their use is approximately 94-97% more effective in decreasing the risk of becoming infected with HIV, as compared to male condoms.Frost, Laura J., and Michael Reich (2008). Access: How Do Good Health Technologies Get to Poor People in Poor Countries?\\". Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies, Cambridge, Massachusetts. .It has been tested in Kenya, Thailand and the United States of America that female condoms are more efficient in terms of protecting the genital areas from becoming infected with STDs and STIs as compared to male condoms. Female condoms became accessible for the Zimbabwean women after they signed petitions and presented them to the government to allow access to this source of contraception during the mid 1990s. Recently, the use of contraceptives has been greatly demanded by the Zimbabwean youth.Manyalo, Primrose Nanchani. \\"Zimbabwe's Youth Push for Greater Access to Contraception\\", Impatient Optimists,05 September 2012. Retrieved on 2 May 2013. A large number of the youth have proclaimed that they are embarrassed to go into pharmacies and clinics to obtain contraceptives, because the workers think that they are too young to be involved in sexual intercourse or sometimes it is frowned upon by the workers and the society due to the \\"no sex before marriage\\" belief. Due to this unfriendly service by the workers and the shame the society puts on these young adults, the youth demanded easier, faster access to the contraceptives from the Zimbabwean government. This indicates that the use of contraception is occurring in many parts of Zimbabwe – hence explaining its falling population growth rate. It also shows how truly Zimbabwe fulfills its duties as the country to promote contraception to other parts of Africa.  Environmental conditions/factors affecting health   Water pollution  The state of water and its cleanliness in Zimbabwe is at its lowest. The nature of water and its function as the crucial element of life is known as the opposite for the people of Zimbabwe. In Zimbabwe, water contains not life but life-threatening diseases due to contamination from industrial works. One of the major origins of water pollution is Zimbabwe's small industry of mining. By mining for gold, platinum, and other precious, expensive metal alloys, mining makes up for one third of the earnings from Zimbabwe's exports. Although the mining industry is a profitable method of income for Zimbabwe, it is responsible for the many causes of water pollution. As they mine for precious metals, the miners are successful in finding them but also unfriendly guests of zinc, iron, nickel, copper and cobalt metals.Mlambo, Musapindira. \\"Zimbabwe's river system heavily polluted\\", The Standard, 7 April 2013. Retrieved on 1 May 2013. An excessive amount of these metals in water deteriorates the health of humans but also the lives of animals and plants – hence it is dangerous for any type of organisms to consume. For example, intakes of excessive zinc may cause internal organ damage and reduce the immune system's function. Although zinc is a major nutrient supplied with food, an excessive amount of it is harmful. Other diseases that occur in Zimbabwe due to water pollution are cholera, typhoid, infectious hepatitis, Giardia, Salmonella, and Cryptosporidium.McCracken, Kevin, and David R. Phillips (2012). \\"Global Health: An Introduction to Current and Future Trends\\", p. 234. Routledge, New York. . However, despite all this, because water is needed and the people of Zimbabwe are becoming more vulnerable and desperate, they consume this greatly contaminated water – hence, contamination-related health issues and epidemics arises.  Air pollution  Air pollution is also a growing problem in Zimbabwe, due to industries, poor waste management and transportation. The World Health Organization has set up a limit for the emission of sulfur dioxide to 20 μg/m3 24-hour mean. In Harare, Zimbabwe, that limit has been exceeded to 200 mg/m3.Mawire, Wallace. \\"Air pollution tops WHO limit\\" , The Zimbabwean, 18 April 2012. Retrieved on 30 April 2013. This is only the beginning of the reality of the air pollution in Zimbabwe, especially in its capital, Harare. The release of sulfur dioxide is harmful to the life of humans and other organisms. The inhaling of sulfur dioxide leads to lung diseases, breathing difficulties, formation of sulfurous acid along with the moisture of the mucous membranes causing a strong irritation and prevents the respiratory system's role in defending the body against foreign particles and bacteria. Hence, it can be concluded that the inhaling of sulfur dioxide is tremendously detrimental to the life of organisms. Not to mention, as sulfur dioxide is emitted into the atmosphere, it forms into acid precipitation as it reacts with water, nitrogen oxides and other sulfur oxides. This is an ecological consequence that arises from the burning of fossil fuels, which is performed in many countries and many industries for the formation of energy, power plants, and automobiles. Acid precipitation can lead to asthma, bronchitis, lung inflammation, emphysema, and other lung and heart diseases. In 2007, the number of cars per 1000 person was 114, as compared to 17 cars per 1000 person in its neighbor, Zambia.\\"Motor vehicles (per 1,000 people)\\" Zimbabwe has a decently great number of cars, mostly all of which are low second-handed. These low second-handed cars do not meet the standard emission rates of Zimbabwe, hence being a greatly environment-polluting factor, becoming hazardous to the lives of Zimbabwe citizens. Poor waste management also disrupts the harmony of health and the lifestyle of Zimbabwe. As mentioned above in water pollution, clean water is difficult to obtain. Hence, those who can afford bottled water are forced to buy them in order to provide themselves with drinking water. However, once they are done with using the bottles, the bottles are often thrown away or burned. The burning of plastic releases toxic and carcinogenic fumes, which if inhaled causes great damage on the body. Some of the chemicals released in this process are benzo(a)pyrene and other polyaromatic hydrocarbons. These fumes pollute the atmosphere, causing a greater long-term damage which will eventually work against the health and lifestyle of Zimbabwe.

By definition, modes of action are characterized by FATS because the combination of common responses that represent each fish acute toxicity syndrome characterize an adverse biological effect. Therefore, toxicants that have the same mode of action elicit similar sets of responses in the organism and can be classified by the same fish acute toxicity syndrome.  Background  During the 1970s, large-scale production of chemicals dramatically increased initiating new legislation to appease public concern about potential harmful effects. After implementation of the Toxic Substances Control Act in 1977, the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) required chemicals, new and existing, to be assessed for risks to human health and ecological systems. Since thousands of new chemicals are registered a year, it is important to utilize a screening technique that predicts toxicity of chemicals in a consistent, efficient manner. As a result, researchers in the field of toxicology focused on the development of QSAR models as a means of assessing toxic effects of chemicals in fish. In toxicology, the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) approach is a method for predicting toxicity based on the properties and structure of a toxicant. This method has been developed under the assumption that a group of chemicals, with similar structural components, will result in similar toxic effects due to having the same activity, or mode of action. In other words, the toxicity of a chemical is directly related to the chemical's structure. Therefore, QSAR are used to create predictive computer programs and models to correlate structure and activity of chemicals. Overall, the objective is to aid in toxicology by providing databases and predictive models for classifying toxicants by modes of action as well as estimate acute toxicity of a chemical. To utilize the QSAR approach, researchers need to establish a pool of variables to be considered in this modelling process. QSAR models are differentiated by groups of chemicals characterized by a common mode of action. However, limited data is available on defined relationships between toxic responses and chemicals with known modes of action. Consequently, toxicologists have focused on the development of FATS to define these responses to better predict modes of action. This approach focuses on grouping chemical and functional responses in a manner so that individual chemicals with known modes of action can be separated into specific FATS. Overall, FATS aid QSAR models by providing a systematic way of defining and predicting modes of action.  Determination  In 1987, McKim and colleagues began a series of experiments to characterize FATS. These experiments involved whole-fish in vivo analyses. The animals used in these experiments were Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss formerly known as Salmo gairdneri). The fish underwent surgery prior to the exposure to implant respiratory and cardiovascular monitoring devices, and immobilize them. During the experiment, the fish were kept in a Plexiglas respiratory-metabolism chamber, which was filled with Lake Superior water. Water temperature was maintained for the duration of the experiments, and other water quality parameters (pH, total hardness, alkalinity, and acidity) were recorded once. The toxicants used in these experiments were chosen because they had a known mode of action. The only exception to this was the narcotics. McKim et al. and Bradbury et al. used compounds known to be narcotics, and with a discriminant function analysis Bradbury et al. and colleagues identified two separate narcosis syndromes, I and II, which correspond to nonpolar and polar narcotics, respectively. By using compounds with known modes of action, these scientists could develop sets of respiratory-cardiovascular responses unique to a particular mode of action. In the first experiment, two narcotics, tricaine methanesulfonate and 1-octanol, and two uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation, pentachlorophenol and 2,4-dinitrophenol, were used. During the second experiment, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and respiratory irritants were evaluated. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were an organophosphate, Malathion and a carbamate, Carbaryl. The respiratory irritants were Acrolein and Benzaldehyde. In part three of the experiment series, polar narcotics phenol, 2,4-dimethylphenol, aniline, 2-chloroaniline and 4-chloroaniline were evaluated. In the last experiment, central nervous system seizure agents were analyzed. These included an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, Chlorpyrifos; two pyrethroid insecticides, Fenvalerate and Cypermethrin; two cyclodiene insecticides, Endrin and Endosulfan; and a rodenticide, Strychnine. The duration of the exposure depended on the experiment, but the range was from 24 to 48 hours. Therefore, exposure resulted in acute toxicity. The Rainbow trout were exposed to a 24- to 48-hour lethal concentration of the toxicant. The respiratory and cardiovascular responses monitored throughout the exposure were cough rate, ventilation rate, ventilation volume, total oxygen consumption, oxygen utilization, heart rate, arterial blood pressure, arterial blood oxygen, arterial blood carbon dioxide, arterial blood pH, hematocrit, hemoglobin, electrocardiogram, plasma ions (calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, and chloride), and osmolality. Pre-dose values were obtained prior to the exposure. The responses were measured at two-hour intervals throughout the exposure, except for blood parameters, which were measured every four to eight hours, and blood ions, which were measured just before death. Using the results of the experiment, each toxicant was then characterized by a set of respiratory-cardiovascular responses. Statistical analyses were used to determine significant differences in responses between toxicants with different modes of action. Finally, because each toxicant had a known mode of action, the set of responses characterized the mode of action.  Types   Nonspecific  = Narcosis = *Narcosis Narcosis refers to the general depression of biological activity from exposure to a nonspecifically acting toxicant. Toxicants that induce narcosis are known as narcotics or anesthetics. Alcohol is an example of a narcotic and can result in intoxication, a form of narcosis. Using the FATS approach, researchers are able to predict toxicity by assessing responses elicited by narcotics. Narcotics are a diverse group of chemicals including: inert gases, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, alcohols, ethers, ketones, aldehydes, weak acids and bases, and aliphatic nitro compounds. Although narcosis can be induced by a wide range of chemical agents, there are a few chemicals that are not considered narcotics. This includes chemicals that: form irreversible bonds by electrophilic reaction; are metabolically activated by electrophiles; form Schiff bases with amino groups; and any type of a Michael acceptor. In general, narcotics are non-reactive. Many organic chemicals in high enough concentrations induce narcotic symptoms. Thus, most toxicants can be considered narcotics. Baseline toxicity, or lowest toxicity is often used to refer to narcosis because this mode of action is considered the minimal effect. QSAR models are often used to predict minimum or baseline toxicity of chemicals acting through nonspecific mechanisms. = Mechanisms of action = Narcosis is a reversible state that is considered nonspecific because a single mechanism of action has yet to be established. Although the mechanisms of narcosis remain unclear, current theories suggest that narcosis is associated with altered structure and function of cell membranes. The Critical-Volume Hypothesis theorizes that symptoms of narcosis are due to the toxicant dissolving in the lipid component of a cell membrane. This results in an increased volume of cell membranes and consequently, altered membrane structure and function. The Protein Binding Theory suggests that a narcotic binds to receptors on the hydrophobic region of cellular membrane proteins. In both theories, the cell membranes are targeted by narcotics resulting in decreased functionality, narcosis. = Symptoms = General responses to narcotics include: lethargy, unconsciousness, and overall depression in respiratory-cardiovascular activity. Narcosis can result in death by nonspecific, sustained symptoms. In the final phases of narcosis, McKim and colleagues observed tissue hypoxia, generalized loss of respiratory- cardiovascular function and ultimately, respiratory paralysis. For example, rainbow trout exposed to two narcotics, MS-222 and 1-octanol exhibited a variety of respiratory-cardiovascular responses. The narcotic symptoms included: loss of reaction to external stimuli, loss of equilibrium, decline in respiratory rate and medullary collapse. = Narcosis I and narcosis II = Studies have suggested that two distinct modes of action exist for narcosis: narcosis I and narcosis II. Narcosis I is induced by nonpolar compounds while narcosis II relates to polar compounds. If polar and nonpolar narcotics induced the same effects, baseline-narcosis models should be able to accurately predict toxicity for both groups of chemicals. However, polar compounds have exhibited greater toxicity than predicted by baseline toxicity models. This difference in toxicity between nonpolar and polar narcotics supports the theory that two separate mechanisms of action exist for the different modes of narcosis. Based on the QSAR approach, differences in the chemical structure can be used to predict the activity of toxicants. The polarity of toxicants can be used to differentiate narcotic modes of action into the two groups: narcosis I and narcosis II. In narcosis I, nonpolar chemicals induced generalized depression of respiratory-cardiovascular responses. I narcosis II, polar chemicals first result in increased activity. The unique response of narcosis II is supported by research conducted on rainbow trout. When exposed to polar narcotics, rainbow trout first exhibited increased muscular activity followed by incoordination and unresponsiveness to external stimuli. In general, narcosis II is characterized by greater toxicity than narcosis I. Thus, Baseline-narcosis models should be used for predicting the toxicity of nonpolar narcotics. In addition, narcosis I is the generalized depression of biological activity. In contrast, narcosis II symptoms include stimulation of respiratory-cardiovascular responses followed by generalized depression of activity.  Specific  *Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation*AChE inhibitors *Irritants *CNS seizure agents *Respiratory blockers*Dioxins A toxicant which exhibits a specific mode of action binds to a site on a particular biological molecule thereby altering or inhibiting a biological process. In comparison, a toxicant that exhibits non-specific action, also referred to as a narcotic, simply depresses biological activity by unknown means. Scientists are still unsure what site(s) a narcotic binds to, and the biochemical responses that result. Specific action is unique in comparison to non-specific in that relatively lower amounts of toxicant are needed to elicit a response. Because lower concentrations of toxicant are need to elicit a response, specific modes of action are usually seen before non- specific modes of action. Ultimately, with high enough concentrations though, most toxicants are narcotic (demonstrate non-specific modes of action). There are a variety of specific-action FATS which have been studied and documented. These include acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors, respiratory irritants, respiratory blockers, dioxin, central nervous system seizure agents, and uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation. Acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme which degrades acetylcholine an important neurotransmitter, has been demonstrated to be inhibited by particular toxicants like organophosphates and carbamates. Respiratory irritants bind to respiratory tissue membranes, which are the first tissue membranes available for exposure. Respiratory blockers are known to affect the electron transport chain in the mitochondria of cells. Central Nervous System seizure agents are associated with effects such as partial or whole body seizures and coughing. Dioxin is recognized as having a different mode of action than the others, but has not been studied by the FATS method. = Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation = Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation are specifically acting toxicants. Oxidative phosphorylation is a coupling reaction in which ATP is synthesized from phosphate groups using energy obtained from the oxidation-reduction reactions in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. ATP production is very important because it is essentially the energy currency in biological systems. Under normal circumstances, oxidation-reduction reactions in the mitochondrial electron transport chain produce energy. This energy is used to shuttle protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, from the mitochondrial matrix into the inner membrane space. This creates a pH gradient where conditions are acidic (i.e. higher concentrations of protons) in the inner membrane space, and more basic (i.e. low concentrations of protons) in the mitochondrial matrix. Due to this gradient, protons pass through ATPase, a protein embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane, down their concentration gradient, into the mitochondrial matrix driving the production of ATP. Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation disrupt the production of ATP. They do so by binding to the protons in the inner membrane space, and shuttling them into the mitochondrial matrix Therefore, the chemical gradient which drives ATP synthesis is broken down and energy production slows. Oxygen consumption increases to counteract the effects of low ATP production. Also, lactic acid concentrations increase as tissues are switching to anaerobic metabolism which poisons the mitochondria. Cardiovascular-respiratory responses associated with exposure to uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation, as determined by the FATS experiment, are the following. Overall, metabolic rate increased so rapid and continuous increases in ventilation volume and oxygen consumption was observed. However, changes in ventilation rate or oxygen utilization were not been observed. This means the fish increased water flow across their gills, but oxygen removal from the water was maintained at a constant rate. However, oxygen consumption increased in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, in an attempt to reproduce the proton gradient and stimulate ATP production. However, the toxicant continued to break down the proton gradient, inevitably leading to mortality.  Applications  As mentioned previously, FATS have been used to establish models that predict toxicity of chemicals. For instance, FATS data is used to develop quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. QSAR models developed using FATS data are then used to establish computer based systems that predict toxicity. For example, Russom and colleagues used Fathead Minnow (Pimephales promelas) 96-hour acute toxicity tests data, FATS data and QSARs to create a computer based expert system that predicts chemical toxicity based on chemical structures and properties. These models and systems are useful for screening chemicals to prioritize more toxic substances for further toxicity testing. This is particularly useful for industrial chemicals with unknown toxicity. This due to the quantity of industrial chemicals with unknown toxicity, for which individual toxicity testing is not realistic. In addition, models and computer systems that predict toxicity are also cost- effective in comparison to running toxicity tests on all unknown chemicals. In conclusion, predictive screening techniques derived from FATS data are practical and cost efficient.

Discrepancy is concerned with coloring elements of a ground set such that each set in a certain set system is as balanced as possible, i.e., has approximately the same number of elements of each color. The Beck–Fiala theorem is concerned with the case where each element doesn't appear many times across all sets. The theorem guarantees that if each element appears at most times, then the elements can be colored so that the imbalance is at most . Statement Formally, given a universe : [n] = \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\ldots , n\\\\\\\\} and a collection of subsets : S_1, S_2, \\\\ldots, S_m \\\\subseteq [n] such that for each i \\\\in [n], : \\\\vert \\\\\\\\{j; i \\\\in S_j \\\\\\\\} \\\\vert \\\\leq t, then one can find an assignment : x : [n] \\\\rightarrow \\\\\\\\{-1,+1\\\\\\\\} such that : x(S_j) \\\\leq 2t-1, \\\\forall j \\\\text{ where }x(S_j) := \\\\sum_{i \\\\in S_j} x_i.  Proof sketch  The proof is based on a simple linear-algebraic argument. Start with x_i = 0 for all elements and call all variables active in the beginning. Consider only sets with \\\\vert S_j \\\\vert > t. Since each element appears at most t times in a set, there are less than n such sets. Now, enforce linear constraints \\\\sum_{i \\\\in S_j} x_i = 0 for them. Since it is a non-trivial linear subspace of \\\\mathbf{R}^n with fewer constraints than variables, there is a non-zero solution. Normalize this solution, and at least one of the values is either +1,-1. Set this value and inactivate this variable. Now, ignore the sets with less than t active variables. And repeat the same procedure enforcing the linear constraints that the sum of active variables of each remaining set is still the same. By the same counting argument, there is a non-trivial solution, so one can take linear combinations of this with the original one until some element becomes +1,-1. Repeat until all variables are set. Once a set is ignored, the sum of the values of its variables is zero and there are at most t unset variables. The change in those can increase x(S_j) to at most 2t-1.

installed at the newly constructed Hillsboro Ballpark in Oregon, United States. The stainless steel sculpture, commissioned by the City of Hillsboro, stands tall at the stadium's entry plaza. Installation of the work began on June 10, 2013. Description Barometer, commissioned by the City of Hillsboro for the newly constructed Hillsboro Ballpark, was designed by Northwest sculpture Devin Laurence Field. Field's design was chosen from twenty qualified candidates by an artist, design team, the Hillsboro Arts & Culture Council, and the Parks and Recreation Department. The stainless steel sculpture stands tall at the stadium's entry plaza. According to Fields, \\"the piece takes the overall triangular form of the baseball diamond held aloft by columns and illuminated with color changing, sound activated LED lights. The laser-cut skin of the diamond form is adorned with intricate patterns of baseball bats and balls [and other sports equipment]. Around the sculpture are various 'instruments' people can play, a giant horn, a rattle roller, drum sets and chimes that together form a symphony of sounds. When no one is at the park there is no colored light, when there is noise it lights up — the louder the noise, the brighter the light. The art is a veritable Barometer of excitement for the ballpark.\\" See also * 2013 in art * List of public art in Hillsboro, Oregon * Weather Machine, a sculpture in Portland, Oregon that displays daily weather predictions References External links *Art at Hillsboro baseball park to respond to Hops fans with lights and music *Hillsboro Hops to chip in on public art at sports complex Category:2013 establishments in Oregon Category:2013 sculptures Category:Interactive art Category:Outdoor sculptures in Hillsboro, Oregon Category:Stainless steel sculptures in Oregon ","title":"Barometer (sculpture)"},{"id":"39400269","text":"Statue of Saint Maginus in Santa Maria del Mar, Barcelona. Saint Maginus (Spanish: San Magín; Catalan: Sant Magí) was a Catalan hermit in the late third and early fourth centuries in Tarragona. Orphaned early, he was a hermit in a cave on Mount Brufaganya for thirty years. Upon the arrival of the Roman prefect Dacian to Tarragona, persecuting Christians under the edict of Emperor Maximian, Maginus tried to convert them to the faith and was imprisoned. Freed miraculously, he left the city by a gate now called San Magin, where he dedicated a chapel and returned to Mount Brufaganya. Captured in the cave again, he was taken to Tarragona and transferred to Gaià, where he was beheaded on 25 August 306. He is the patron saint of Tarragona and his feast day is on August 19.

He belongs to Channal Zarakzai family and also the Nawab of the Zehri tribe and chief of Jhalawan. Zehri succeeded Abdul Malik Baloch as chief minister Balochistan, Pakistan on 24 December 2015 as part of the power sharing deal brokered in the resort town of Murree. Zehri is the central president of the Pakistan Muslim League's Balochistan branch and a confidant of ex Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. On 7 June 2013, Zehri was appointed senior minister of Balochistan with portfolios of communication works, mines, minerals and industries. On 9 January 2018, due to the imminence of a no confidence vote against him, Zehri resigned from his post as Chief Minister to prevent the brewing of a political crisis. Biography Nawab Sanaullah Zehri was born in Anjeera in the Khuzdar District, Balochistan, Pakistan, on 4 August 1961. His father, Sardar Doda Khan Zehri, was a tribal leader and an activist in the Pakistan Movement who played a crucial role in gathering Balochistan's support for the cause of Pakistan. He graduated with a BA degree in political science in 1983 from the University of Balochistan. Upon graduating from Balochistan University, he ran in the 1990 Balochistan Assembly general election, performing well on the PML(N)'s conservative platform. During this time, he campaigned for local government in Balochistan. In 1997, he contested and triumphed in a senate election, representing Balochistan until 1999. Zehri ran for the PB-50 (Khuzdar-I) constituency on the National Party's platform during the 2002 general election. He served as the provincial minister of prisons and tribal affairs until 2003. In 2008, the National Party boycotted the general elections. Zehri disagreed with the move, left the party, and in February he won a seat in the Assembly under his own, newly founded National Party Parliamentarians. In September 2006, Zehri participated in a loya jirga called by the Khan of Kalat, Mir Suleman Dawood Jan, following the death of Akbar Bugti. On 6 January 2010, he joined the Pakistan Muslim League. In August 2011, Baloch was selected by PML(N) as the assistant secretary general of the PML-N for Balochistan. In 2013, Zehri defended his constituency on PML (N)'s platform and was initially named as candidacy for Chief Minister of Balochistan. However, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif instead approved the appointment of Abdul Malik Baloch to be elevated as the Chief Minister of Balochistan. On 16 April 2013, Zehri escaped an assassination attempt on his life when his convey came under a bomb attack in his native Khuzdar district. The attack killed his son, Sikander Zehri, brother Mir Meharullah Zehri and nephew Mir Zaid. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), accepted responsibility for the attack on Zehri. On 7 June 2013, Zehri was appointed senior minister of Balochistan.

It is found in the west and central Indo-Pacific Ocean. The genus name comes from the Greek eikon, meaning portrait or image and possibly referring to the way the marginal plates frame the disc, and aster, meaning star. The specific name comes from the Latin longus manus and refers to the long, slender arms. Description Iconaster longimanus has five thin, tapering, flattened arms. It grows to a diameter of about with a central disc about across. It has a marginal row of large plates that resemble mosaic tiles and contrast in colour with the disc. The margin is usually tan with symmetrically arranged dark brown bands and the disc is orange-brown. Distribution Iconaster longimanus is native to the tropical west and central Indo-Pacific Ocean. Its range includes south eastern Arabia, the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, the South China Sea, Indonesia and northern and western Australia. It is found at depths of between in deep reef areas. It is common in Singapore where its typical habitat is lower reef slopes and adjoining areas of rubble where it feeds on lithophytes growing on rocks and coral fragments. Biology Not a lot is known about the feeding habits of Iconaster longimanus but it is believed to include in its diet detritus, bacteria, micro-organisms and small benthic invertebrates.

Retrieved on 16 May 2013. He is also known as the former President & CEO of Maybank from 2008 to 2013, Malaysia's largest public listed company and one of the leading financial services groups in Southeast Asia. His major contribution to corporate world is overseeing the turnaround of UEM Group, Telekom Malaysia and Maybank. Background Abdul Wahid was born in Johor Bahru, Johor, in 1964 and was the ninth child out of eleven siblings. He received his secondary education at MRSM Seremban from 1977 to 1981 before furthering his study to United Kingdom under Majlis Amanah Rakyat (MARA) scholarships. With over 28 years of corporate and public sector experience, Abdul Wahid has led three major organisations in financial services, telecommunications and infrastructure development. He led the transformation of Telekom Malaysia into a regional telecommunications group (prior to its demerger with Axiata in 2008) and spearheaded the turnaround of the UEM Group, Malaysia's leading infrastructure conglomerate following its takeover by Khazanah Nasional in 2001. Abdul Wahid is a fellow of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), United Kingdom, a member of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA) and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England & Wales (ICAEW). Careers 1987–2001: Early years Abdul Wahid started his career with KPMG Peat Marwick in 1987. He then worked at an investment bank, Bumiputra Merchant Bankers Berhad from 1989 to 1991, joining the Corporate Banking Department. He was then appointed as Senior Vice President, Finance, Administration & Secretarial of Kumpulan Fima Berhad from 1991 to 1994. He subsequently became Director of Group Corporate Services cum Divisional Director, Capital Market & Securities of Amanah Capital Partners Berhad from 1994 to 2001. Abdul Wahid also served as Chairman of Amanah Short Deposits Berhad and the Association of Discount Houses in Malaysia as well as Director of Amanah Merchant Bank Berhad during this period. 2001–2004: United Engineers (Malaysia) Berhad (UEM) & UEM World Berhad Abdul Wahid joined Telekom Malaysia as a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) on 1 March 2001 before he was appointed as Managing Director cum Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of UEM Group in October 2001. UEM Group (then UEM- Renong Berhad Group) was in the middle of debt restructuring plan when Abdul Wahid took over. It led to the takeover by Khazanah Nasional in 2001 which received mixed reactions by the public. The first step that Abdul Wahid did to address these predicaments was to unlock the value of its highway concessions led by PLUS Expressways. The toll concession was reviewed to lower the toll rate increase (from 5% pa to 3.2% pa) but increased every 3 years. This allowed space for UEM's debts to be restructured and thereafter undertook its IPO listing on Bursa Malaysia in July 2002. Another step taken by Abdul Wahid was to dispose the non-core assets in order to reduce the Group's debt to a more manageable level. After 2 and a half years later, the Group's debt was halved to a more sustainable level of RM16 billion with the bulk of it in the form of project financing. The UEM Group was back on profitable track with annual profit of RM500 million and revalued net assets of RM10 billion. Khazanah Nasional not only achieved its main objectives in the takeover but also doubled the value of its investments within 3 years. 2004–2008: Telekom Malaysia Berhad (TM) Abdul Wahid returned to Telekom Malaysia (TM) as CEO in July 2004 as part of the larger transformation plan of Government- linked companies (GLCs). He was given a mandate to transform TM into a regional telecommunications company with a particular emphasis on mobile communications. His experience in turning around UEM Group and being the CFO of TM before had given him a very conducive environment to carry out the mandate. He addressed the fundamentals of the business; organisationally, culturally, customer service wise and business wise. As a part of the efforts to enhance shareholder value, it was decided that the TM Group would be better off being demerged into two separate listed entities. TM International (now known as Axiata Group) with Celcom and other regional mobile communications business under its wings were successfully demerged and listed on Bursa Malaysia in April 2008. This left TM being repositioned as the National High Speed Broadband (HSBB) Champion spearheading the national HSBB deployment in Public Private Partnership with the Government of Malaysia. The demerger \\"unleashed\\" Axiata Group to grow further across Asia. 2008–2013: Maybank In May 2008, Abdul Wahid was appointed as President and CEO of Maybank, replacing Tan Sri Amirsham Abdul Aziz who was appointed as a Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in charge of the Economic Planning Unit (EPU) after the 12th General Election. In the three months prior to his arrival, Maybank finalised three major acquisitions', An Binh Bank in Vietnam, Bank International Indonesia (BII) and MCB Bank in Pakistan. He faced three major challenges in the first few months at Maybank. Firstly, he had to follow through on the three major acquisitions costing some RM11 billion and to raise the necessary equity and debt capital required to fund the acquisitions. Second, to deal with the Global Financial Crisis that was unfolding with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, among others, in September 2008. And third, to improve the financial performance of Maybank. While the corporate finance team was busy completing the three acquisitions, the rest of the management and staff members were busy implementing the performance improvement program called LEAP30 - a series of 30 initiatives identified to improve Maybank's performance and restore its market leadership. After 18 months, assets and deposits grew faster, customer service enhanced, asset quality improved and profit after tax bounced back to a record RM3.8 billion for financial year 2010. Maybank was back as the number one bank in Malaysia and the most valuable company listed on Bursa Malaysia. Though this left the team, Board and shareholders happy, there was still a concern when it came to sustainability. Professional fatigue was evident and there was a need to revise the organisational structure and revisit the company's mission. Thus, a \\"Tiger Summit\\" was held in Putrajaya which gathered the top 1,000 managers and leaders. This summit agreed to adopt a new mission for Maybank of Humanising Financial Services. This means; to provide people with convenient access to financing, to provide fair terms and pricing, advising customers based on their needs, and being at the heart of the community. This was not just a rallying call but a reason for being for the 40,000 Maybankers in Malaysia and across Asia. Organisationally, a new \\"House of Maybank\\" was created with three business pillars of Community Financial Services, Global Wholesale Banking and Insurance & Takaful with Islamic Financial Services and International Operations straddling across the three business pillars. With the new mission and new \\"house\\", Maybank continued to extend its leadership not only as the number one bank in Malaysia but also as one of the top regional banking groups with presence across all ten ASEAN countries. 2013–2016: Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Abdul Wahid was appointed as a Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in charge of Economic Planning on 5 June 2013. He oversees a number of government agencies such as Economic Planning Unit, Public-Private Partnership Unit (UKAS), Department of Statistics, Ekuiti Nasional Berhad (EKUINAS) and Talent Corporation (TALENCORP), TERAJU and Yayasan Pendidikan Peneraju Bumiputera. In a statement, Abdul Wahid admitted that being appointed (non-elected) as one of the Minister in the Prime Minister's Department is a humbling experience for him. He pledged that he will do everything in his power to help Malaysia in achieving the vision 2020 vision.

Plot outline A feckless troupe of European exotic dancers and their piano player led by a bumbling manager stumble upon a castle after encountering a ferocious storm. The castle, inhabited by Count Gabor, his assistant and a vampire, is little refuge for the traveling showgirls as they slowly fall under the spell of the un-dead demon. Vera, one of the reluctant dancers and the living doppelgänger of the vampire's dead wife, Margherita Kernassy—who has been dead nearly 200 years—becomes the object of affection for both Count Gabor and the vampire. Cast Cast adapted from the book Italian Gothic Horror Films 1957-1969. Release Under the title L'ultima preda del vampiro, this film was released in Italy on November 28, 1960 through Film Selezione. The film grossed a total of 72.193 million Italian lira. Richard Gordon, a producer and distributor of low-budget horror and science fiction films was looking for European horror films to release in the United States through his company Gordon Films. In 1963, he was invited for a French-language screening of The Playgirls and the Vampire through Janus Films, a New York-based company who specialized in releasing arthouse films. A day after the screening, Gordon phoned Janus' agent in Paris and purchased the film rights while preparing an English-language version of the script with Peter Riethof. Gordon eventually sold the rights to the film to Joe Solomon of Fanfare Film who released the film as The Playgirls and the Vampire, promoting it as an adult film. It was released in the United States on July 4, 1963. Later, Gordon released a less explicit version of the film under the title Curse of the Vampire for television audiences. Home video The film was released on DVD by Image Entertainment in the United States on August 24, 1999. Reception From contemporary reviews, the Monthly Film Bulletin referred to the film as only being four years old but resembling a film that was 50 years old. The review concluded that it was a \\"pathetically tatty rehash of vampire clichés\\" and that the \\"Acting, direction, and photography are unspeakable.\\". \\"Tube.\\" of Variety opined that the film was a \\"strictly second-rate horror melodrama. A totally shop-worn, sex-propelled fang-bat-and-tomb opera.\\" From retrospective reviews, AllMovie and TV Guide gave the films low rankings rating them 1 1/2 and 1 star out of five respectively. In his analysis of the film, Louis Paul noted various similarities with Renato Polselli's film, The Vampire and the Ballerina, and with several subsequent Italian productions. He described the film as \\"satisfying on most levels, including the sexploitive one\\", and noted it was the first horror film featuring \\"a group of travelers [...] stranded at a malevolent and evil place\\", one of the topoi of the genre.

France and Italy will be in those early days the main countries where the art reproduction will be used. From nineteenth century several museums gradually opened, generally tied to Universities and Academies of Fine Arts with the goal of teaching art history in a practical and dynamic way.http://www.bilbao.net/castella/cultura_euskera/equipamientos_culturales/museos/museo_reproducciones.pdf One of the first fine arts museum was opened in Britain in 1857. The aim of the governments of that time, was to show to the common people the \\"culture of humanity.\\" The reproduction of works of art, has been useful to teach art, but apart from that it gives the chance to have testimonies of many [works that during the Second World War were destroyed. However, during the twentieth century, museums of reproductions suffered a great decline, surpassed only now, with the modernization of some of them like the Berlin museum, the Trocadero, the Victoria & Albert Museum, etc. Foundation and beginning The Reproductions Museum Bilbao was founded in 1927, after an intense campaign done by various institutions at a time when in the rest of Europe, the reproduction of artistic works was in decline. The museum focused its activity on artistic and cultural offerings of the town and on improving student learning of the Section of Fine Arts, School of Arts and Crafts. Manuel Ramírez Escudero was one of the main promoters of the museum. Since 1928, he has chaired the Board of Trustees of the same, a position that he held until 1967.http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/124474 Following the proposal by Ramírez Escudero in 1922 to the Board of Basque Culture, on October 1, 1927, approved the creation of the museum, once the council and the city of Bilbao gave their approval to the project. It is therefore one of the oldest museums in Bilbao. The Board of Trustees was constructed by distinguished figures from the artistic world, professionals such as: Ángel Larroque, Ricardo Bastida, and Higinio Basterra. The museum has been located in different venues throughout its history. First, and as of 1957, it was located in the basement of Berastegi School. It later moved to a local rehabilitated Conde Mirasol Street (where it is currently the administrative headquarters and didactic). Since the enlargement of the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in the neighborhood of San Francisco in 2006, the museum houses the temple main exposure. Reproductions From the beginning, the museum officials prevailed above all the quality of the work that they loved playing, rather than quantity. Thus, efforts were made to acquire works directly from the British Museum. Shipments of parts to play had the invaluable help of the illustrious businessman from Biscay called Ramón de la Sota. At the same time, taking into account the proximity of the Museum of Fine Arts in Bilbao, it was asked to give some works. The earliest works come from the workshop to the Museum of Benito Madrid Bertolozzi: \\"Leda\\", the \\"David\\" of Verrochio, \\"The Boy of the Thorn\\", \\"The Belvedere Torso\\", \\"Slave\\", \\"Torso of Subiaco\\", \\"Torso\\" by Phidias, \\"Apollonius\\". Later, also in Madrid, reach other famous works as \\"Discobole\\" or \\"Venus of Horses\\". On the other hand, unsuccessfully raised basement house the works of the Madrid Museum of Reproductions. From foreign museums reach of museums like Munich, works like \\"Hercules\\" or \\"Hurt Warrior.\\" Berlín: \\"Hermes\\" of Praxiteles. London will be acquired \\"Injured Lioness\\" or \\"Three Fates\\". Louvre \\"Charioteer of Delphi\\", \\"Venus of Milo\\" or \\"Winged Victory\\".

Originally a feature of Google+, Hangouts became a stand-alone product in 2013, when Google also began integrating features from Google+ Messenger and Google Talk into Hangouts. In 2017, Google began developing Hangouts into a product aimed at enterprise communication. Hangouts is now part of the G Suite line of products and consists of two primary products: Google Meet and Google Chat. Google has also begun integrating features of Google Voice, its IP telephony product, into Hangouts, stating that Hangouts is designed to be \\"the future\\" of Voice. Google plans to transition users to Meet and Chat in June 2020, but will continue to support the consumer version of classic Hangouts, raising some speculation in the matter after Google Meet became free. History Prior to the launch of Hangouts, Google had maintained several similar, but technologically separate messaging services and platforms across its suite of products. These have included the enterprise-oriented Google Talk (based on XMPP), Google+Messenger, and the Hangouts feature of Google+, which provided chat, voice, videoconferencing features. However, its increasingly fragmented and non-unified suite of messaging offerings was also facing growing competition from services such as Facebook Messenger, iMessage, and WhatsApp. A decision was made to scrap the existing Google Talk system and code a new messaging product through a collaboration with multiple development teams. Following reports that the new service would be known as \\"Babel\\", the service officially launched as Hangouts during the Google I/O conference on May 15, 2013. On February 16, 2015, Google announced it would be discontinuing Google Talk and instructed users to migrate to the Hangouts app on the Chrome browser platform. In January 2016, Google discouraged using Hangouts for SMS, recommending to instead use Google's \\"Messenger\\" SMS app. In May 2016, at Google I/O 2016, Google announced two new apps: Google Allo, a messaging app with AI capabilities (AI-powered bots and selfie features) and Google Duo, a video calling app. Google's Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones released later that year were the first Google devices shipped with Duo and Allo preinstalled instead of Hangouts. Google has since confirmed that the new apps will not replace Hangouts; Hangouts will remain a separate product. In December 2018 Google announced Allo would be discontinued in March 2019 with some of its features migrated into Google Messages. On August 15, 2016, Google announced that Hangouts on Air would be discontinued on September 12, 2016, and would be folded into YouTube Live, but later on September 11, 2016, Google said the Hangouts on Air shutdown date would be moved up from \\"September 12, 2016\\" to \\"August 1, 2019\\", to free all some livestreams on YouTube. Users will have to switch to other livestream programs. On January 6, 2017, Google announced that the Google Hangouts API would shut down on April 25, 2017. On March 9, 2017, Google announced that Hangouts would be targeted at business users with the Hangouts brand divided into two products: Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. Meet would focus on video conferences and Hangouts Chat would be focused on instant messaging with additional features such as bot assistant and threaded messaging. The features would be targeted at business customers while consumer versions would use a freemium model. Google stated in December 2018 that \\"classic\\" Hangouts would be disabled by October 2019. In November 2018, the desktop Chrome app version of Hangouts started displaying these banner messages at the top of its window: \\"The Hangouts Chrome app will be replaced by the Hangouts Chrome extension soon.\\" This has generated many negative user reviews on the Chrome Web Store pages for both the Hangouts extension and the app. In August 2019, Google announced that the G-Suite version of Hangouts will be replaced by \\"Meet\\" and \\"Chat,\\" and push the shut down to June 2020. In April 2020, in response to COVID-19, Google Meet became free for all users, raising speculation as to the future of Google Hangouts. Features A video conference meeting facilitated by Google Hangouts Hangouts allows conversations between two or more users. The service can be accessed online through the Gmail or Google+ websites, or through mobile apps available for Android and iOS (which were distributed as a successor to their existing Google Talk apps). However, because it uses a proprietary protocol instead of the XMPP open standard protocol used by Google Talk, most third-party applications which had access to Google Talk do not have access to Google+ Hangouts. Chat histories are saved online, allowing them to be synced between devices. A \\"watermark\\" of a user's avatar is used as a marker to indicate how far they have read into the conversation. Photos can be shared during conversations, which are automatically uploaded into a private Google+ album. Users can also now use color emoji symbols in their messages. As with the previous Google+ Hangouts, users can also perform a group video chat with up to 10 users at a time. In 2016 Google upgraded Hangouts to 25 concurrent users in HD video for Work/Education. The new Google Hangouts app on iOS integrates a Google Voice number to some extent, but on Android the SMS support in Hangouts doesn't fully integrate with Google Voice for calls or texts. Integration was first expected by 2014, but was deprecated in January 2016. The reason for the delay appears tied to Google switching away from the XMPP protocol it used, as mentioned above. For Google Chrome, users do not need to install a plugin. However, for Internet Explorer 11, the user must install the \\"Google Talk Plugin\\" to be able to use the video features. In Android 4.4, Hangouts is integrated with text messages sending and receiving functions, which is the default SMS app on the Nexus 5. For other Android phones, users can choose to open the SMS function when they download the new version of Hangouts via Google Play. SMS conversations are shown in a drawer on the left side. The update also adds GIF support and a new location-sharing button, which allows the user to send their GPS location to their contacts. Hangouts includes the ability to make free voice calls to other Hangouts users, and charges users (via pre-registered credit) to call landline and mobile phones internationally except for calls to the United States and Canada which are free of charge. Currently, Android users must have both the Google Hangouts and Hangouts Dialer apps installed if they wish to call landline or mobile telephone numbers via the public switched telephone network. Users will have to utilize YouTube Live for live-streaming events. Reception As of May 2013, Google Hangouts faced criticism from the Electronic Frontier Foundation as they felt that Google was \\"moving in the wrong direction\\" by shrinking its support for the open standard protocol XMPP. The new protocol makes it much more difficult for multi-chat clients like Pidgin and Adium to support Google Hangouts. They must reverse engineer the protocol. Additionally, the tight integration of Google Hangouts and Google+ can lead to the unwilling sharing of personal information with others. On November 30, 2014, Make Use Of hailed Google Hangouts as the \\"best messaging app on Android by far\\". , Google Hangouts has a score of 2 out of 7 points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Secure Messaging Scorecard. It has received points for having communications encrypted in transit and for having completed a recent independent security audit. It is missing points because communications are encrypted with keys that the provider has access to, users can't verify contacts' identities, past messages are not secure if the encryption keys are stolen, the code is not open to independent review, and the security design is not properly documented.

It is a part of the Boyden–Hull Community School District. Their mascot is the Comet. The school's athletic teams compete in the Siouxland Conference. A few sports are shared with Rock Valley High School, a fellow Siouxland Conference member. The combined teams are known as the Nighthawks. History The merged Boyden–Hull School District was approved in a December 1958 vote of the Sioux County board of education. Boyden and Hull were separate school districts until July 1, 1959. The first school board election as a consolidated school district had taken place in March 1959, followed by the first classes on August 31, 1959. Hull High School's student newspaper was called Hull High Lights. Its athletic teams were known as the Wild Cats. Before the merger, Hull's basketball team had been to the state playoffs five times. Boyden Public School's mascot was the Bombers. Boyden's student newspaper was the Buzz Bomb. Technology and services Smart Boards were first installed in 2007. A one to one computing initiative was started in the 2011–12 school year, as was the school's use of Moodle. The district shares some classes with the nearby Rock Valley High School and George-Little Rock High School through polycom videoconferencing technology. Online classes are available for dual high school and college credit though Northwest Iowa Community College (NWICC). A school resource officer was assigned to the district beginning with the 2010 school year. Boyden–Hull and Rock Valley hired a joint transportation director in July 2018. In 2018, Boyden–Hull began a joint vocational education program with Sioux Center Community Schools and NWICC. Facilities A new school building was completed by the 1964–65 school year. Most of the school building was remodeled in the 1980s. The auditorium was renovated in July 2013 and reopened in time for the 2013–14 school year. The gymnasium was refurbished in 2015. A remodeling project worth $11.2 million was approved in February 2018. Additions to the school took place throughout 2018 and 2019. A vote to acquire land from the city of Hull and Herman Oldenkamp for Boyden–Hull's team sports took place in August 1964. Boyden–Hull's athletic field was named for the consolidated district's first superintendent, A. R. Hesla, in 1974. The football and track facilities there are shared with Western Christian. The concession stand at Hesla Field was rebuilt in summer 2016. Extracurricular activities The STORM (Students Teaching Others Role Modeling) Team was organized in the late 1990s. The student organization is mainly active around Red Ribbon Week and also volunteers at the local chapter of the Ronald McDonald House. Boyden–Hull Summer Theatre began in 2009. Athletics =Comets= A men's basketball team by the Boyden–Hull Comets moniker had begun play by the 1960–61 school year. Men's track began by 1961, and baseball by 1963. Boyden–Hull began fielding a football team in 1964. By 1965, the school had joined the Siouxland Conference. The Comet wrestling program started in the 1976–1977 school year. Boyden–Hull tied West Harrison for a men's state track title in 1970. The women's track team's highest finish was in 1984. They tied Le Mars Gehlen for second place.

Boyden–Hull faced North Linn for a second time in 2020, defeating the Lynx to win their first 2A championship, and fourth overall. The Comet volleyball team has been to state twice, in 1991 and 2011. =Shared sports= Boyden–Hull continued fielding athletics teams solely under the Comet moniker until the 1980s. Starting that decade, football and baseball were shared with George. Little Rock joined the partnership in 1987, and Boyden–Hull left, electing to combine their football and baseball teams with Rock Valley. In 1990, the official sport-sharing agreement was struck. The combined Boyden–Hull/Rock Valley teams split home games at each school, and the team name was adjusted depending on where the teams played. While in Rock Valley, teams were known as the Rockets, and in Hull, they went by the name Comets. The BHRV collective began by sharing baseball and football, and expanded to softball in 1993, followed by the subsequent merger of the track and field and cross country teams in 1997. In 1999, the BHRV alliance decided on a separate mascot, and have since been known as the Nighthawks. The Boyden–Hull/Rock Valley football team made it to the championship game for the first time in 2009, falling to Solon High School. In their second title game appearance, BHRV defeated Union High School for the 2016 2A championship.

The episode first aired on May 10, 2013 and centered on Gordon Ramsay attempting to help Amy and Samy Bouzaglo, owners of Amy's Baking Company in Scottsdale, Arizona. The episode marked the only time in either the UK or the US versions of Kitchen Nightmares history that Ramsay was unable to complete the restaurant's transformation due to conflict with the owners. The owners' violent behaviors received negative attention on social media, and the manner in which they responded to this critical reception further fueled the controversy, prompting Forbes to refer to this as an example of how a business should not react to comments posted on social media. A follow-up episode, \\"Return to Amy's Baking Company\\", aired as the season 7 premiere on April 11, 2014. Synopsis Amy and Samy Bouzaglo, the husband and wife owners, explain the history of their restaurant: Samy invested over a million dollars to build the restaurant in 2006 in order to fulfill Amy's dreams. About two years prior to the episode's filming, bloggers began writing negative reviews of the restaurant's food and the owners' behaviours. Amy says the reviews are \\"lies\\" and states that they cost the restaurant a \\"tremendous amount of business\\".Hahnefeld, Laura (May 23, 2013). \\"Chasing Amy: Overcooked Reality and the Decline of Western Civility\\". Phoenix New Times. One of the verandas of Amy's Baking Company The day before Ramsay arrives, the camera crew witnesses an intense argument between Samy and a customer. It starts when the customer complains to Samy that he and his friend had been waiting for a pizza for over an hour, causing Samy to lash out at him and order the two customers to leave, but not before insisting that the two customers pay for the drinks they have received. Samy then turns his attention to the customer's friend, while Amy threatens to call the police. Just when it appears that Samy and the customer will come to blows, a cameraman steps in and escorts the customers out of the restaurant. Amy then berates and insults the other customers in the restaurant before storming back into the kitchen. Upon his arrival, Ramsay is initially impressed with the kitchen's good hygiene and organization, though becomes more wary when Amy admits that she closes the restaurant if either she or Samy is not there. After the initial discussion, Ramsay prepares to sample the dishes. Though he liked one of the desserts he tried when meeting the couple initially, he had a rather negative response towards the other menu items: the fig and pear prosciutto pizza was very sweet and made with under-cooked dough; the blue ribbon burger was not medium rare as requested, with a combination of condiments that Ramsay finds bizarre, and a bun dripping with grease; the red pepper ravioli exhibits a combination of sweet and spicy flavors that Ramsay called \\"confusing\\" and he learns from Samy that it was mass-produced frozen ravioli despite the menu advertising it as freshly made; and the salmon burger was overcooked and its presentation was unappealing. Samy reveals to Ramsay that he does not tell Amy about the problems with the dishes as he knows she does not deal well with criticism. At another point during the sampling, Ramsay learns from one of the servers, Miranda Winant, that neither she nor the other servers make any tips, but that they instead go to Samy. Ramsay discusses this with Samy, who justifies the policy by saying he does much of the front-of-house work; though Miranda reveals Samy does not always properly input the orders and often omits dishes that were ordered as a result of this. Later during dinner service, Ramsay criticizes Amy and Samy for the food he was served during lunch and Amy responds by denying any wrongdoing because Samy refused to tell her the problems about the food. He also criticizes Amy for using frozen ravioli instead of making it fresh, and announces to the customers that the ravioli is off the menu, which doesn't sit well with Amy. Throughout the night, customers are seen complaining about the long waiting, and several customers are shown sending back their dishes they disliked. At one point, Amy accidentally gives the wrong table number to Miranda. Subsequently, when giving food to Katy Cipriano, another server, as well as the table number, Katy asks, \\"Are you sure?\\" Amy responds by accusing her of having an \\"attitude problem\\" and demands that she should leave. When Ramsay witnesses a customer giving a tip intended for the servers and Samy taking it for himself, Samy again defends the policy, stating that the waiting staff receive an hourly wage. This prompts Ramsay to inform the customer that all tips go to the restaurant's management and not the servers, to which the customer replies, \\"That's horrible.\\" Samy and Ramsay then get into a heated, profanity-laced argument, in which Ramsay tells Samy he is not allowed to take his servers' tips. Amy closes the restaurant, and fires Katy on the spot. Samy attempts to change Amy's mind, but Amy does not relent, later describing Katy, who leaves the premises in tears, as a \\"poisonous little viper\\". Ramsay returns to the restaurant the next day, only to find it closed. Ramsay takes this opportunity to talk to Henry and Jessica who previously worked in the restaurant. Both describe horrible working experiences; Henry claims Samy made him wash his car and Jessica claims that at least 50 people were fired during the 18-month period when she worked at the restaurant. Ramsay then attempts to talk to Amy and Samy, telling them what they are doing wrong. Amy refuses to listen and becomes increasingly aggressive and hostile towards Ramsay. Samy even reveals that they had actually fired 100 employees, not 50. As a result, Ramsay realizes they are not open to making any changes and leaves the restaurant, and in a concluding monologue, states that this is the first time he has met restaurant ownership that he could not help. He also started to talk to Pam, another worker, who admitted to Ramsay that on one occasion, Samy had hit her. Before leaving the area he cites the fact that the restaurant has gone through a hundred staff members, stating that Amy and Samy have infuriated the local community and are incapable of accepting criticism, and believes that they would not have adhered to any changes he would have implemented to improve the restaurant regardless. Production The episode was shot in December 2012. On December 10 a local media interview with a diner described his altercation with Samy during taping. The diner saw what he thought was an act for the purposes of the show, but a producer told him that \\"what was happening was real\\". The diner went on to explain that police were on the scene by the time he left the restaurant. The diner reported that the police were responding to a \\"911 hangup call\\" from the restaurant, and that they left after \\"concluding everything was fine\\". Reception and reaction Entrance of the restaurant The episode premiered on May 10, 2013, and was viewed by approximately 3.34 million people. It earned a 1.2/5 share in the 18–49 demographic, meaning it was seen by 1.2% of all 18- to 49-year-olds and 5% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode met with praise from reviewers, with one critic writing, \\"The episode is nothing short of amazing.\\" Archived from the original. Retrieved May 8, 2017. After the show aired, the restaurant, which is located in a shopping center at Scottsdale Road and Shea Boulevard, became a momentary tourist attraction. The restaurant received extensive negative feedback on their official Facebook page. When owners Amy and Samy responded by denouncing people who posted negative comments, they provoked more of the same, not only on Facebook, but also on Yelp and Reddit. Forbes used the reactions as a poster example of how a business should not react to comments on social media. The owners later stated that they were hacked, and that they had not posted any of the comments.Erwin, Elizabeth (May 14, 2013). \\"Restaurant owners slammed on national TV speak out\\". KPHO-TV.

Harlan Page Peck was the lyricist and Carl A. Langlotz (sometimes Karl Langlotz) was the composer. The lyrics were changed in 1987 to address sexism at the newly co-educational institution. For a brief time the song was sung to the melody of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" before Langlotz wrote the music on demand. The lyrics were the result of a songwriting contest by the Nassau Literary Review. Composition Freshman student Peck penned the words that year and published it in the March 1859 issue of the Nassau Literary Review, which is the oldest student publication at Princeton and also the second oldest undergraduate literary magazine in the country. The winter 1858-59 issue of the magazine had offered a prize for a college song and Peck won. Peck would go on to pen both the Class of 1862 ode and the Class of 1862 poem. Later in Spring 1859, German teacher Langlotz composed music for the song. The song has four verses of lyrics and a refrain. The lyrics were originally sung to the melody of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\", but William C. Stitt (Class of 1857), a student at the Princeton Theological Seminary found this arrangement unsuitable. He sought out Langlotz and stood over him until he composed more suitable music. The song and its lyrics then appeared in Songs of Old Nassau, the first Princeton songbook, Spring 1859. According to Langlotz' autobiography Lyric change The first women were admitted to Princeton in the late 1960s and the song was considered sexist by 1987, when Princeton had reached 35% female enrollment. Some such as Daily Princetonian journalist Jack Goodman question whether changing the lyrics of the Princeton alma mater would serve any real purpose. The impetus to change the lyrics came in late 1986 from Janet Sarbanes, daughter of United States Senator Paul Sarbanes. Sophomore Class of 1989 President David Littell helped lead the petition to gain 500 signatures for a referendum on the issue. A Princeton alum lyricist was consulted to for suggested revisions. In December 1986, the student council voted in strong support of revising the song. In late February 1987, the student body rejected the revision by an 872 to 794 margin, but the vote was not considered to represent a quorum. As a result of insufficient opposition in the voting and inconclusive forums and polls, the revision was referred to the office of the president and board of trustees. The following week, Princeton President William G. Bowen noted that \\"Old Nassau was written to be inclusive for the Princeton of its day,\\" going on to say \\"These changes in lyrics allow it to be more inclusive for today's Princeton.\\" The refrain was changed from \\"In praise of Old Nassau, my boys, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! Her sons will give while they shall live, three cheers for Old Nassau.\\" to \\"In praise of Old Nassau, we sing, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! Our hearts will give, while we shall live, three cheers for Old Nassau.\\" The Princeton board of trustees, student government and alumni council all ratified the revision. Other universities followed Princeton's lead. Dartmouth endured controversial change to \\"Dear Old Dartmouth\\" in 1988, University of Chicago held a competition for an entirely new alma mater during the 1990–91 school year, due to the original song's sexist content. Harvard made lyric adjustments to \\"Fair Harvard\\" in the late 1990s.

Isolated species were gram-negative, microaerophilic and curve shaped. These organisms resembled Campylobacter sputorum in their morphological and phenotypic characteristics and were given the name Campylobacter sputorum subsp. mucosalis. A study, using DNA homology experiments, found that Campylobacter sputorum subsp. mucosalis is a distinct species and is not a subspecies of C. sputorum. Thus, its name was changed to Campylobacter mucosalis.  Description  The cells are short, irregularly curved, and gram-negative and may appear as spiral forms 0.25 to 0.3 μm in diameter and 1 to 3 μm long. They move using a single polar flagellum. Coccoid bodies and filaments may be seen in older cultures. Colonies are 1.5 mm in diameter, circular, and raised with surfaces. The colonies have a dirty yellow color that is best seen by smearing a colony on a piece of white paper. Requires either hydrogen or formate as an electron donor for growth. Grows under microaerophilic conditions (6% O2, 5% CO2, 15% H2, 74% N2) where O2 serves as the electron acceptor or anaerobic with fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor.  Procurement  Isolated from the intestinal mucosa of pigs with porcine intestinal adenomatosis, necrotic enteritis, regional ileitis and proliferative hemorrhagic enteropathy, also isolated from the oral cavities of pigs.  Distinguishing characteristics  Campylobacter mucosalis strains can be distinguished from all other catalase-negative Campylobacter strains except C. concisus by their requirement for H2 or formate for microaerophilic growth and H2 fumarate or formate and fumarate for anaerobic growth. Although C. concisus strains are similar to C. mucosalis in phenotypic characteristics, they have only a very low level of DNA homology with C. mucosalis. Campylobacter mucosalis strains can be distinguished from Campylobacter concisus strains by their susceptibility to cephalothin, by their ability to grow at , and by the dirty yellow color of their colonies.  Cases of human infection  Two cases of infection in children were reported in 1993. They recovered without the use of antimicrobial therapy.

Politically, the mall is situated in the municipality of Wallisellen. The mall was opened in 1975, being modeled on similar malls in the United States. Like its US progenitors, the mall was intended to be accessed by car, and it is located close to the A1 motorway and provides spacious car parking. In 2010, phase 2 of the Stadtbahn Glattal opened, including an elevated tram stop linked to the mall by a footbridge. Before that the public transportation connections were limited to three bus lines (nr. 94, 759 and 787) connecting the center to the railway stations Zürich Airport, Zürich Oerlikon, Dübendorf, Wallisellen and Dietlikon. When built, the mall was jointly owned by the Migros, Globus and Jelmoli groups, each of which operated an anchor store within the centre. Today the mall is owned by Swiss Life. The Migros store still exists, as does the (now Migros owned) Globus store, but Jelmoli no longer has any involvement. In addition to the two remaining anchor stores, there are four specialty markets, five restaurants, four bars and 90 specialty shops. In front of Glattzentrum is the newly built open-air Richti shopping center.

Theocharous (Cyprus University of Technology) in 2008. In their paper \\"Harming Democracy in Mediolatry Societies: Decoding the Marketing of War and Animosities through Photo Images\\",\\"Harming Democracy in Mediolatry Societies: Decoding the Marketing of War and Animosities through Photo Images\\", Journal of Political Marketing, Volume 7, Numbers 3/4, pp. 338–62 the authors consider consumption of war through utilization of marketing and, in particular, of social marketing. The marketing of war has been described as a key element of the form of militarism known as neomilitarism. Neomilitarism has been defined as a form of militarism that is distinguished by the reliance on a relatively small number of volunteer fighters; heavy reliance on complex technologies; and the rationalization and expansion of government advertising and recruitment programs designed to promote military service.Roberts, Alasdair. The Collapse of Fortress Bush: The Crisis of Authority in American Government. New York: New York University Press, 2008, 14 and 108-117. The concept has been further developed in the book The Marketing of War in the Age of Neo-Militarism, co- edited the same authors.The Marketing of War in the Age of Neo-Militarism, co- edited by Kostas Gouliamos and Christos Kassimeris (European University Cyprus): Routledge Advances in Sociology, 2012 For Gouliamos and Kassimeris, the marketing of war is shaped by the mechanisms of manufacturing decision- making of the lobbying industry on both sides of Atlantic. As a result of the intensification and escalation of the 'marketing of war', the whole civil society is heavily militarized while the LifeWorld is colonized by the apparatus of stratocracy. Moreover, the book assesses the inherent meaning of such militarization from a critical, interdisciplinary perspective. Against the background of democracy and capitalism, The Marketing of War in the Age of Neo-Militarism challenges prevailing accounts of the \\"military–industrial complex\\" as it explores significant interrelated themes denoting the accelerating process of militarization of society.

The wood frame building is square with a pyramidal roof; its walls are mostly composed of tall windows, with shiplap siding below the windows and on the roof. This design was a standard design used by U.S. Forest Service fire lookouts at the time, and several of the other contemporary lookouts in the national park also used this style of construction.

She is best known for her roles as Zarife in the Turkish TV series Farewell Rumelia and Nigar Kalfa in the TV series Muhteşem Yüzyıl.  Early life  Filiz Ahmet was born in Skopje, SR Macedonia. She is of Turkish descent. Filiz Ahmet has dual Macedonian and Turkish citizenship. Her mother works as a prompter, while her grandfather, Lüftü Seyfullah, was a Macedonian stage actor and co-founder of the Macedonian-Turkish Theatre. The first play she watched in the theater was The Idiot, based on the novel by the same name written by Fyodor Dostoevsky. She developed a lifelong passion for theater, and was 6 when she first appeared on stage. Ahmet's childhood coincided with the Yugoslav Wars. Due to the conflict, her family decided to go to Sweden, and later returned to Macedonia when she was 15. Filiz Ahmet graduated from medical school and then the Academy of Fine Arts in Skopje in 2003. Ahmet is multilingual and is able to speak Macedonian, Albanian, Turkish, Swedish, English, Serbian, and Bulgarian.  Career  Ahmet began as a stage actress and received several performance awards. She did not plan to act on-screen, and her busy theater schedule allowed little time for anything else. However, her breakthrough performance occurred in 2007 when she appeared in the role of Zarife in the series Farewell Rumelia. To make her character more expressive, Ahmet spoke her role in the Macedonian Turkish dialect. After this series, she received offers in various television series. Her next project was Balkan Wedding, where she took the role of Galina in 2009.  Magnificent Century  In 2010, Ahmet received the role of Nigar Kalfa in a primetime historical Turkish television series, Muhteşem Yüzyıl (The Magnificent Century). The show was very successful in the Balkan region and Turkey, and was broadcast in 45 countries. The series had 204 million viewers worldwide. Her work with Muhteşem Yüzyıl brought her positive responses and acclaim from critics.

The song signalled a departure from Foxx's previous solo work which had focused on a sparse electronic sound whereas Europe After The Rain features a warmer sound, using acoustic and electric guitars, acoustic piano and live drums to produce the music. The bass and string sounds were however produced by a synthesiser. Foxx has several times stated that this change in musical direction was caused by a visit to Italy after the Metamatic period, where he worked with director Michaelangelo Antonioni for the soundtrack of his film Identification of a Woman. Although the single only reached no. 40 in the UK Singles Chart, Foxx performed the song on UK music show Top of the Pops where Foxx's new more romantic style was presented in the clothes and setting to accompany the performance in stark contrast to that of \\"Underpass\\" on the same show some eighteen months previously. For this performance Foxx was seen playing acoustic guitar, flanked by three other musicians on piano and keyboards. These musicians were Eddie and Sunshine and Duncan Bridgeman of the band Shake Shake, who had collaborated with Foxx in writing B-side \\"A Long Time\\" in 1980. The Top of the Pops footage was issued officially for the first time in 2013, on the DVD of the artist's Metadelic collection. No video was made for the single.

Artwork for the 12\\" version is identical to the 7\\" except for the wording of the additional track. \\"Europe After The Rain\\" is also the title of a painting by Max Ernst, who would have been known to Foxx as a former art-student and graphic artist.

He is one of the most prolific and prominent contemporary artists in Belgium. His ground-breaking work deals with biocultural diversity and identity. Central to his oeuvre is the chicken, which, through his projects, is revealed as both an artwork and a metaphor for society. By bringing together and exploring the interplay between art, science and philosophy in his work, Vanmechelen reflects upon our global heritage and examines the way that we choose to live and evolve. Multi-disciplinary scientific collaborations and community engagement are integral to Vanmechelen's approach. Vanmechelen's work first gained worldwide recognition in the late nineties, with the launch of his Cosmopolitan Chicken Project (CCP), an artistic crossbreeding project with chickens. Since its inception nearly twenty years ago, the resulting art work has been shown in exhibitions all over the world. It has also attracted growing interest amongst scientists. Each successive generation of the CCP has proven to be more resilient, longer living, less susceptible to disease, and less aggressive than the previous one. In collaboration with the University of Leuven, the Cosmopolitan Chicken Research Project (CC®P) now studies the genetic make-up of the various CCP crossings and its potential implications for science. Vanmechelen's scientific collaborations have earned him an honorary doctorate from the University of Hasselt (2010) and the Golden Nica Hybrid Art award (2013). Vanmechelen has several projects and foundations parallel to the CCP: The CosmoGolem, The Walking Egg, MOUTH, COMBAT, The Planetary Community Chicken (PCC), The Cosmopolitan Chicken Research Project (CC®P), and MECC, all of which he manages from his Open University of Diversity,. In 2017, Koen Vanmechelen moved his studio and foundation headquarters to LABIOMISTA, situated in a former public zoo in the Belgian city of Genk. The artist's work is an investigation of and an ode to the beautiful diversity and hybridity of life: Vanmechelen often collaborates with scientists and experts from different disciplines, such as Jean-Jacques Cassiman, Rik Pinxten and Marleen Temmerman. Vanmechelen's art work is as diverse and hybrid as the Cosmopolitan Chicken itself: a unique mix of paintings, drawings, photography, innovative 3D-techniques, video, installations and wooden sculptures. The common visual theme throughout these various methods of expression are the chicken and the egg. These have, over the years, become important symbols to Vanmechelen, allowing the artist to interconnect scientific, philosophical, and ethical issues, and to frame the subject of debates and lectures. A new species of flat worm discovered in Venice (It) during the artist solo exhibition Nato a Venezia at the biennial of Venice was in 2013 named Trigonostomum Vanmecheleni in honour of the artist. Biography Koen Vanmechelen lives in Meeuwen- Gruitrode, in the northeast of Belgium. He is an honorary citizen of his native town of Sint-Truiden. Since 2017, the artist has been based at his new studio, LABIOMISTA, built by Swiss architect Mario Botta. Occupying the grounds of a former public zoo in Genk, LABIOMISTA will open to the public in spring 2019. Alongside the artist's studio, it will host a culture and animal park, and an educational and research center, including the Open University of Diversity. He is a self-taught artist who studied hotel management in Antwerp and worked several years as a cook and pastry chef in Belgian top restaurants. His father is an artist, his mother a fashion designer. Vanmechelen's interest in chickens and birds started at an early age, due to the trips he made with his uncle Louis Gonnissen, a famous Belgian ornithologist and television personality. At the age of five, he says in an interview, he already had a breeding coop in his bedroom.De Standaard Online, 12 november 2005. Lees de kip en je weet waar we als mens naartoe gaan Conservators Jan Kenis, Jan Hoet and illustrator Gregie de Maeyer launched him into the world of art in the early nineties. His first works consisted mainly of wooden constructions, assemblages and cages for birds. This aligns him with the Belgian tradition of assemblage artists. In the nineties, Vanmechelen quickly evolved into a conceptual artist and later on a multi-, trans- en interdisciplinary artist. During the late nineties, Vanmechelen launched his Cosmopolitan Chicken Project (CCP), which occupies a unique place in art history. It gave him fast national and international recognition in and outside the art world. Despite his aviophobia, the artist has adopted a nomadic lifestyle. “Movement creates opportunities for transformation and mutation”, says the artist, who is always on the move and spends much of his time abroad. He is constantly trying to connect his projects to different realities planet wide, finding balances between art, science and the world. Vanmechelen: “I am trying to connect people and ideas, finding the right intersection of space and time to hatch the egg in the infinite collision of beautiful ‘accidents’ created by perpetual movement.” Hence Vanmechelen’s fascination for biological and cultural diversity, or biocultural diversity. Among the streams that facilitate the ebb and flow of endless motion, migrating people and other animals, he looks for the genes and memes that have always been gathering. Some of these he takes home. In his home base in Meeuwen-Gruitrode, he has collected scores of bird and other animals - and keeps more than one thousand chickens: Gallus Gallus, the 21 breeds of Mechelse hybrids and other species. In total, Vanmechelen has 3,000 chickens on eight farms on three continents. All of it flows from Vanmechelen’s belief that art belongs in society, engaging with people. The artist’s major on-going projects have a consistent community focus: Cosmogolem, a global art-based children’s rights project; the Walking Egg, a developing world fertility project; and Combat, a WW1 remembrance project. In 2011, the foundations supporting these works were grouped into a new institute called the Open University of Diversity. In 2016, Vanmechelen launched his Planetary Community Chicken (PCC) project. As the new cross-breed is being introduced to underserved communities worldwide, the MOUTH foundation leads on the sustainable development aspects of the initiative. MOUTH is a not-for-profit organization set up by a group of European doctors and scientists in partnership with Vanmechelen in 2016. It brings together art, science and people to explore the applications and impact of biocultural diversity. Vanmechelen has presented his work on almost every continent, from the U.S. to China and Iceland to Senegal. In Belgium his work has been shown at numerous museums and locations: the Verbeke Foundation, Watou, Museum M and Z33. He has also participated in solo and group exhibitions in, amongst others, The National Gallery (London), Victoria and Albert Museum (London), Museum Kunst Palast (Düsseldorf), Muziekgebouw aan ‘t IJ (Amsterdam), Macro (Rome), MAD Museum (NY), Belvedere (Vienna), ZKM (Karlsruhe) and Pushkin Museum (Moscow). Besides making regular appearances at the Venice Biennale, his work has been shown at the Biennials of Moscow, Havana, Dakar and Poznan, at the Triennial of Guangzhou, at the World Expo Shanghai 2010, at Manifesta 9, and at dOCUMENTA (13). Foundations  Cosmopolitan Chicken Project (CCP) The Cosmopolitan Chicken Project (CCP, 1999) is a global, transdisciplinary and transtemporal examination of the themes of biocultural diversity and identity through the interplay of art, science and beauty. In the CCP, artist Koen Vanmechelen crossbreeds chicken breeds from different countries. His ultimate goal is the creation of a Cosmopolitan Chicken carrying the genes of all the planet’s chicken breeds. Much more than a mere domesticated animal, the chicken is art in itself. It serves as a metaphor for the human animal and its relationship with the biological and cultural diversity of the planet. While the native breeds that descended from the original chicken (the Red Junglefowl) are evolutionary dead-ends (being shaped to reflect the typical cultural characteristics of its community), Vanmechelen’s crossings are solutions. Many years of crossbreeding have shown that each successive generation is more resilient, it lives longer, is less susceptible to diseases, and it exhibits less aggressive behavior. Genetic diversity is essential, proves the Cosmopolitan Chicken Research Project (CC®P), which studies the various Cosmopolitan Chickens. In the millennium year 2000, Vanmechelen presented his first ‘crossing’, the Mechelse Bresse, a ‘crossing’ born out of the Belgian species Mechelse Koekoek and the French Poulet de Bresse. To date, twenty-one purebreds have been included in the CCP. According to Vanmechelen, humanity will only be able to thrive and stay “healthy” in a situation of maximized diversity, a notion reflected by the results of the repeated crossbreeding of races which had previously only been inbred: the offspring of the CCP have longer lifespans and higher fertility rates than the average domesticated chicken, as well as a more effective immune system, making them less liable to be stricken by disease. This intercultural approach has resulted in a chicken carrying traces of DNA from chicken races all over the world: Belgium, France, the U.S., Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Mexico, Thailand, Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Egypt, Cuba, Italy, Senegal, China, Slovenia and Austria. The CCP has also spawned a plethora of drawings, paintings, sculptures and installations.  Cosmopolitan Chicken Research Project (CC®P)  The Cosmopolitan Chicken Research Project (CC®P) is the more scientifically oriented half of the CCP. In collaboration with esteemed Belgian human geneticist Jean-Jacques Cassiman, Vanmechelen researches the genetic make-up of the chicken races participating in the CCP. The database generated by this research has been said to be the most extensive one in Belgium. The results of the research have been presented in the form of virtual representations as well as 3D-printed sculptures. The piece Evolution of a Hybrid represents three chicken chromosomes, two isolated from inbred, domesticated chickens, the third from a crossbreed: “Chromosomes are laid out in circles, connecting at one tip of the chromosome and wrapped in spherical shapes. The longest chromosomes (chromosomes 1 and 2) cross at the top of the sphere. The number of homozygous and heterozygous polymorphisms along the chromosomes are indicated by peaks pointing inwards and outwards, respectively. As a result, inbred chickens have relatively more peaks pointing inwards while crossbred chickens have more peaks pointing outwards.”  CosmoGolem  The CosmoGolem foundation centers around diversity and children's rights. Its main symbol is the CosmoGolem statue, a wooden giant four meters in height, based on an earlier, much smaller version created by a young Vanmechelen. All CosmoGolem statues are hollow on the inside, which allows for children all over the world to fill them with little bits of paper on which they have written their dreams and wishes for the future. The statues are opened via a small hatch located at their hearts. The aim of the CosmoGolem foundation is to build bridges between different cultures all around the world and to stress the importance of (cultural) diversity, and deal which also underlies the Cosmopolitan Chicken Project. At the moment, there are over 30 CosmoGolem statues, spread all over the globe, in countries such as the Netherlands, India, Pakistan, Tanzania, Poland, Chile and Belgium. The most recent addition to the project will be the Golem that will be inaugurated on August 1, 2019 in Valparaiso, Chile. COMBAT/CWRM COMBAT was a project commemorating the one hundredth anniversary of the start of the First World War. It was an offshoot of parent project Coming World Remember Me (CWRM), a collaboration between Vanmechelen and Jan Moeyaert. The ultimate goal of CWRM was to produce 600,000 small clay statues, one for every soldier killed on Belgian soil during WW1, by the end of 2018, the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War. The statues were made by the public, aided by international workshops. At the end of the project, they were all part of a land art installation near the Palingbeek in Ypres, former no man's land. The temporary installation was finalized in April 2018 and covered a surface of several hectares. The Walking Egg The Walking Egg foundation is a non- profit organization focusing on the problem of infertility in developing countries, and also conducts research in the field in collaboration with co- founder Willem Ombelet, who also founded the Genk Institute for Fertility Technology. A small egg, walking on two short chicken legs, forms the organization's logo. In 2013, it was announced that the Walking Egg foundation had developed a much cheaper form of in vitro fertilization, reducing the cost of a single cycle with 90%. This new method, instead of using expensive carbon dioxide, uses two much cheaper chemicals, citric acid and bicarbonate of soda, to produce carbon dioxide – making it a much more affordable process for poor people worldwide. The Walking Egg tries to bring inexpensive in vitro fertilization techniques to countries usually associated with overpopulation, yet also plagued by the effects of infertility: \\"If you don't have a child in Africa, or also South America or Asia, it's a disaster. It's a disaster from an economic point of view, a psychological point of view. They throw you out of the family. You need to help them and nobody helps them.\\" However, the techniques developed by the Walking Egg foundation aren't destined exclusively for people in developing countries. Because of the cost of a conventional fertilization cycle, the cheaper treatment has received attention from wealthier countries as well.  MOUTH  MOUTH is a philanthropic foundation which brings together art, science and people for diversity. It partners with individuals and organisations worldwide to put diversity front and center of the global development agenda. The aim is a new, more constructive social and ecological balance. Launched in 2016, MOUTH is a scientific and practical evolution of the CCP project and Vanmechelen's wider work on diversity. It convenes, supports and fundraises globally in four interdependent areas: * The Laboratory: provision of open-access samples and data for biological and medical research * The Community: citizen-led enquiries into the impact of biocultural diversity on everyday lives * Public Engagement: art and conferences to share information and broaden public discourse on diversity * Field Science: research into livestock to improve nutrition outcomes and raise incomes of vulnerable people The work of Belgium artist Koen Vanmechelen is the transformational motor of what MOUTH does. With his Cosmopolitan Chicken Project and subsequently the Planetary Community Chicken, Vanmechelen has created a chicken for the communities of the world. One that unites the values of diversity and productivity and brings together the benefits of the global and the local. The chickens hold a unique genetic diversity that has generated the interest and collaboration of international scientists in medical and livestock research. Both practical and as a mirror for social and ecological choices, Vanmechelen's art inspires and enables change for a more constructive social and ecological balance. MOUTH's Global Open Farms are physical locations for the encounters and collaborations between art, science, industry and communities. The Global Open Farms are also the breeding places from where our uniquely diverse cohort of chickens are distributed to the communities, and with them the educational, development and small scale food and community enhancement projects. The principles of generosity and sharing economy are central values in all our farms. MOUTH helps enable field research through live and laboratory samples, field data, network development, public engagement, communication, and discovery through art. The Cosmopolitan and the Planetary Community Chicken Projects have generated chickens with the potential of increased resilience, fertility and immunity. Its contribution to science has already earned Vanmechelen an honorary doctorate from the University of Hasselt (2010) and the Golden Nica Hybrid Art award (2013). In 2017, the Cosmopolitan Chicken and Planetary Community Chicken Projects were picked up by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in Ethiopia, and included in their 'pathway out of poverty' research for Sub Saharan Africa. The repeated introduction of different DNA from new purebred chickens in the Cosmopolitan Chicken strain has resulted in new generations of chickens with a genome displaying remarkable increased and novel potential for gene transcription and expression. The new chickens contain 13 million SNP DNA, compared to 4-5 million in a normal chicken. With the Planetary Community Chicken, this diversity is crossed with the dna of local commercial chickens in different locations in the world. MOUTH harnesses the value of this work through the set up and management of an open biodatabank, containing dna, plasma and microbiome samples from the different flocks.  LABIOMISTA  LABIOMISTA, the battery, studio Koen Vanmechelen LABIOMISTA, literally 'mix of life', is in itself an all-encompassing art project, set up as a model for the philosophical ideas on which Vanmechelen's work is based. LABIOMISTA hosts Vanmechelen's first Open University of Diversity and related foundations. The site is also where the artist's animals live and breed. It is both a laboratory and a library of biocultural diversity. With support from local government as well as private stakeholders, and in collaboration with Flanders and Limburg Tourism, LABIOMISTA is being developed as a public-private partnership between Vanmechelen and the city of Genk. The 24 hectare site will be open to the public summer of 2019. It consists of three parts: a villa, park and studio designed by influential Swiss architect Mario Botta, each one representing a different identity: humans, nature, and the interplay and tension between them. As visitors enter this world, a pair of stellar sea- eagles look down upon them from their cage above the studio, while the red jungle fowls, the source of all domesticated chicken life, continue to forage just meters away. A new exploration between man and nature begins. It is a search for a new, more sustainable balance.  New Broods (Projects)   Planetary Community Chicken (PCC)  In 2016, Vanmechelen launched the Planetary Community Chicken (PCC) as a natural response to the positive outcomes of the CCP, and as a way to take his art and findings on diversity out into society. The project focuses on bringing new, healthier chickens to the world's communities, and emphasises the importance of diversity and local, small-scale community farming for long-term sustainability. The project starts with the idea that, every year, a rooster of the newest CCP crossbreed will be paired with a local commercial hen somewhere in the world. This chicken will absorb the genetic pool of the CCP rooster and the local commercial hen and produce a vital community chicken that can provide its host community with eggs and meat. Its name consists of CC and the date of creation. The first is called CC2016, Community Chicken 2016. The introduction of a new ‘cosmopolitan genome’ to the local flock puts an end to the ongoing cycle of genetic erosion that results from local inbreeding and industrial highly efficient mono- cultural production. It promises greater resilience and adaptability. In turn, the local chicken provides familiarity and the necessary characteristics suited for the local environment, as well as resistance to domestic threats. In each community into which the PCC is introduced, Vanmechelen makes an art exhibition at the venue for the crossing and, through it, encourages public discussion about the value and meaning of diversity and identity. The beauty of ‘the other’, the coming together of the global with the local are visualised in a wide variety of works. The new crossbred chicks hatch in the galleries and museums – with exhibition materials often constructed and recycled by local communities - before being transferred to selected free- range flocks.  SOTWA  SOTWA – meaning umbilical cord – developed in 2014. With SOTWA, Koen Vanmechelen explores the benefit of crossbreeding between cattle stock in Africa, where climate change increasingly threatens the tribe's traditional cattle herding. The project started in Tanzania where the artist gave a Kenyan cow for adoption to the Masaai tribe. Fresh blood and DNA were injected to the herd, strengthening the resilience of the herd through crossbreeding and thus offering it a more viable chance for the future. The skin and horns were later returned to the artist to create artworks. Anno 2018 the project is extended to Zimbabwe (in collaboration with the Future of Hope) and Ethiopia (in collaboration with ILRI).  MECC  In the Mushrooms, Egg, Chicken, Camelids project, Koen Vanmechelen explores the boundaries dividing different species. Real crossings are not possible, but it explores whether substances from one organism can migrate to the organism of another species. MECC is an innovative art/research project, supported by IWT (Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology) in which researchers in molecular virology from Ghent University and Flanders Institute for Biotechnology collaborate with the artist to explore possible interactions between mammals (camelids), birds (chickens) and mushrooms. The project aims to show that in some way we are all related and interconnected, part of the same universe. Man is also part of a planetary superorganism. He is bioculturally connected with all other species, some of which can be of vital importance for our survival. The art is finding the appropriate intermediary agents that form the bridge between the species; here chickens and mushrooms. From a scientific standpoint, the possible transfer of immunologic substances and resistance will be studied. Dromedary antibodies promise to be a powerful weapon against viruses, but their merits cannot be fully delivered to humans yet. In studying the chickens, the focus lies on the Mx gene, which provides natural protection against various viruses, including bird flu. The Mx gene of monoculture chickens, however, barely demonstrates any antiviral activity. This might be linked to the limited genetic diversity of various artificial chicken breeds. The hypothesis is that the greatly increased genetic diversity of the Cosmopolitan Chicken can reinforce the antiviral activity of the Mx gene.  LUCY - PEEL PETUUM MOBILE  LUCY is a collaboration between Koen Vanmechelen and Heyde Hoeve, a collaboration of four pig farmers in Holland that differentiate through their focus on transparency and sustainability in food production. With LUCY, a bio-diverse pig is created. A new pig that tells the story of the search for a better, more sustainable economic system. After the recent focus on monoculture in farming, the project argues that crossbreeding is essential and the only solution for sustainable production. LUCY is the result of the crossing between the industrial Duroc and the Mangalica, a hardy type of Hungarian pig. Through an open stable, visitors are offered a unique view in the essential part of the process: the beginning. The title of the project LUCY - PEEL PETUUM MOBILE embodies all these elements. The primal sow LUCY (first female), Peel (the location of HeydeHoeve) and Petuum (huge amount of data on diversity) serve as a reference to an infinite process of crossing, a perpetual motion in time and space. The concept contributes to the wider debate on intensive animal farming. It shows the farm per definition as a generator of diversity and sustainability. The multitude of different animals and techniques makes the farm a mini diversity Hub. Through an open stable at Heyde Hoeve, visitors are offered a unique view in the essential part of the process: the beginning. LUCY, however, is determined to see the world herself. She travels in a food truck constructed by artist Koen Vanmechelen; the LUCY BOAR a hot dog stand on wheels. The LUCY DOG tells her story; it is food for the brain and the stomach. Know what you eat, knowledge is the food of the soul. LUCY was developed by Koen Vanmechelen and Heyde Hoeve. The Foodmonkeys created culinary hot dogs based on the concept. The collaboration is part of the project FoodLabPeel in which ZLTO bkkc and Peel Network collaborate to develop new perspectives on intensive farming in The Peel, Eindhoven.  COSMOCAFE  In 2017 artist Koen Vanmechelen created a café as a continuously evolving living art work. A 19 century building on the Groenmarkt of Sint-Truiden, where in January 2016 the first chicken from Koen Vanmechelen's Planetary Community Chicken project saw the light of day, now houses ‘the staminee of the future’. A collaboration between artist Koen Vanmechelen and entrepreneurs Ben Elen and Pascal Vossius. The cosmocafé illustrates the need for diversity and multiculturalism through the work of Vanmechelen. As a visitor, you literally become a part of his art through the “art of food/food of art concept”. The crosspollination between individuals makes the world a better place. Because enjoyable get-togethers in the microcosm of the cosmocafé make the cosmos a whole lot better. The cosmocafé straddles local and global. It is a small café, but it has its eyes on the world. It is an authentic city café, an innovative catering business, and a living work of art. The cosmocafé wants to stimulate conversations. A place where you can not only meet people, but actually join in the conversation. Where words and ideas are formed. For each Euro you spend in the cosmocafé, part goes to the MOUTH Foundation. After the inauguration of the Human Rights Pavilion at the 58th Biennale of Venice in 2019. Different pop-up COSMOCAFE's will host SoTO dialogues around the world. Starting the world tour in Tulum, Mexico it will visit the city's of: Venice, Italy; Santiago, Chile; Medrisio, Switzerland; London, UK; Genk, Belgium; Turku, Finland; Valparaiso, Chile. Current projects ;Human Rights Pavilion The Human Rights Pavilion is an evolving artwork by renowned Belgium artist Koen Vanmechelen, initiated in the context of the 58th Biennial of Venice, 'May you live in Interesting Times', in collaboration with Global Campus of Human Rights, Fondazione Berengo and the MOUTH Foundation. With the Human Rights Pavilion, Vanmechelen explores the complexities of human nature, the possibility of a universal concept of human rights and the role of art in its development. He presents nature as a human right and contemplates its safeguarding in the Anthropocene, the era in which the human impact on the Earth's geology and ecosystems reaches critical proportions. The Pavilion develops over a period of 18 months at different global locations and through a wide variety of partners. It is built up of three chapter: SoTO Dialogues, SoTO Environment and SoTO legacy. SoTO which is short for Survival of the Other gives name to the different chapters, and weaves the Vanmechelen's fundamental philosophy through the various elements of the work: every organism needs another organism to survive. At the end of 2020, all inputs are consolidated by the artist and reworked into a unifying OPUS, a collective memory of our moment in time and space, which will be presented to UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the European Commission and to the President and Curator of the 59th Venice Biennale of Art with a call to establish a recurrent supra-national Pavilion of Human Rights as part of the Venice Biennale of Art. The Open University of Diversity ; The Open University of Diversity The ‘Open University of Diversity’ (OpUnDi, 2012) combines the different Foundations that originate from Koen's work. But it is more than this: The Open University of Diversity is Koen Vanmechelen's intellectual platform and forum, with the objective to create an inclusive community of innovative minds and thinkers around the topic of biocultural diversity, the central theme of Koen's oeuvre. OpUnDi has become a think tank and a meeting place for cross-pollination. Scientists, philosophers, artists and other experts from different domains are invited to make the OpUnDi community stronger and more diverse. Debates, symposia, conferences and expert meetings are organized and informed by the works of art that will be on permanent display. OpUnDi serves as an intellectual space where art and sciences can intersect. As such, OpUnDi does not have one fixed location. It will always be on the move. Its inauguration took place during the 54th Venice Biennale in the library of the Palazzo Loredan, the historic seat of the Institute of the Sciences, Letters and Art. The official opening in Belgium was held at the beginning of 2012. Since that day, OpUnDi has not only found a home in La Biomista in Genk, it has also branched out to Detroit and Havana and is constantly searching for opportunities for new platforms in the rest of the world. ; The Accident The Accident is a biennial magazine published by Koen Vanmechelen which explores the main themes underlying his art: biocultural diversity and hybridity. Every issue deals with a specific topic. The Accident's purpose is twofold. Firstly, it gives its international readers a better understanding of the core concepts of Vanmechelen's hybrid art and its importance for contemporary society by putting his artistic quest into a multidisciplinary perspective. The magazine also serves as a breeding center for new ideas that can infect the artist himself. Exhibitions and awards In 1996, he was awarded the Gustav-Heinemann-Friedenspreis, in 2005 he became an honorary citizen of his birth town Sint-Truiden and in 2013 he received the Golden Nica Hybrid Art for his Cosmopolitan Chicken Project. Vanmechelen has presented his work on almost all continents, from the United States to China and from Iceland to Botswana. In Belgium, his work was exhibited in many museums and other loci. According to Vanmechelen art should leave the cage of the museum as often as it can. He participated in solo and group exhibitions in among others National Gallery London, Victoria and Albert Museum (London), Museum Kunst Palast (Düsseldorf), Muziekgebouw aan ‘t IJ (Amsterdam), Zentrum Paul Klee (Bern), MAD Museum (New York) and Pushkin Museum (Moscow). His work was also shown at dOCUMENTA 13, the Biennials of Venice (2009, 2011 and 2013), Manifesta, Dakar and Poznań, triennial of Guangzhou and the Shanghai World Expo 2010.

He served as the Minister of Civil Affairs between 2010 and 2016, and formerly served as Deputy Communist Party Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region, among other roles. He was investigated by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection in late 2016, was assigned responsibility for corruption at the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and stripped of his post as minister. His party membership was put on two-year probation. Career Li Liguo is a native of Yutian County in Hebei province. He began working in January 1970 at the Construction Equipment Factory of Shenyang, capital of Liaoning province, and joined the Communist Party of China in November 1974. Li worked at a number of factories in Shenyang for 15 years, until entering the government in June 1985, when he was appointed Deputy Secretary of the Communist Youth League of Liaoning province. From January 1990 to 1993 he was the Vice Mayor of Panjin, a prefecture-level city in Liaoning. He also enrolled in post-secondary education programs on a part-time basis, earning a master's degree in engineering in April 1992 from Northeastern Institute of Engineering (now known as Northeastern University). In January 1993 Li Liguo was transferred to Tibet Autonomous Region, becoming the Deputy Communist Party Secretary of the autonomous region in January 1999 and Vice Chairman of the Tibet CPPCC in 2003. In December 2005 Li was transferred to the central government and appointed Executive Vice Minister of Civil Affairs. He was promoted to Minister in June 2010, replacing retiring Li Xueju. In March 2013 he was reappointed Minister of Civil Affairs of the Li Keqiang cabinet. Li is a full member of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Investigation In the October 2016 footage of Xinwen Lianbo, Li Liguo was missing from the attendees of the sixth plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, stirring speculation that he had been sacked due to scandal. He was successively removed from his positions beginning in November. On January 9, 2017, it was confirmed at a news conference that Li Liguo was undergoing investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI). Li was the first sitting minister of Li Keqiang Government to come under investigation by the CCDI since Xi Jinping assumed General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in 2012. On February 9, 2017, the CCDI announced that Li Liguo was stripped from his position as Minister of Civil Affairs and demoted to deputy- department-level () for failing to impose strict party discipline at the ministry and allowing \\"systematic corruption\\" to occur under his watch. His party membership was put on two-year probation, pending future consideration. He also lost his eligibility to be a delegate to the 18th Party Congress.

After the metal work piece is removed from the tool or deformation implement, the elastic deformation will be released and only the plastic deformation will remain. When a metal forming tool is planned and designed to deform a work piece, the shape imparted by the tool will be a combination of elastic and plastic deformation. The release of the elastic deformation is the spring back often observed at the end of a metal forming process. The spring back has to be compensated to achieve an accurate result. Usually that is realized by overbending the material correspondent to the magnitude of the spring back. That means for the practical side of the bending process, the bending former enters deeper into the bending prism. For other sheet metal forming operations like drawing it entails deforming the sheet metal past the planned net shape of the part, so that when springback is released from the part, the plastic deformation in that part delivers the desired shape of the part. In the case of complex tools the spring back has to be already considered in the engineering and construction phases. Therefore complex software simulations are used. Frequently this is not enough to deliver the desired results. In such cases practical experiments are done, using the trial-and-error plus experience method to correct the tool. However, the results (workpieces) are only stable, if all influencing factors are the same. This mainly includes: * Yield strength of the sheet * Chemical composition of the sheet * Structure of the material (e.g. direction of grain during production process) * Wear of tools * Material temperature * Aging processes of the raw material (significant for aluminium and copper) * Deformation rate The list of factors may be continued. Springback assessment of final formed products is a difficult problem and is affected by the complexity of the formed shape. The NUMISHEET 93 conference benchmark problem involves the draw bending of a U-channel using three measured parameters. Parameterless approaches have been proposed for more complex geometries but need validation. Practical example: electronic bending tools with spring- back compensation Electronic bending tool with integrated angle measurement and spring-back compensation The electrical industry mostly uses flat materials of copper and aluminium producing equipment for the electrical industry, especially switchgear and busbar production. The properties between two different charges of those materials vary strongly, having a critical influence on the dimensions. In the 60s, Dieter Ehrt invented the bending technology for flat material which measures each bend angle and provides spring back compensation. This gives the bend angle of flat materials true accuracy. This is attained by using bending prisms with electronic angular measurement technology. The principle is easy, but smart: While bending two flat bolds supporting the material turn around. The bolds are directly connected to the angular sensors. A computer or rather the machine control then calculates the required final stroke. The spring back of every bend is compensated regardless of material type. If the measuring accuracy is 0.1º, a high angle accuracy of +/- 0.2º is achieved instantly with the first work piece without any rework. Because no adjustments are required, material waste amounts and setup times drop considerably. Even inconsistencies within a single piece of material are automatically adjusted.

The three represented the Rajasthan Royals in the 2013 Indian Premier League. In a separate case, Mumbai Police arrested Vindu Dara Singh and Chennai Super Kings Team Principal Gurunath Meiyappan for alleged betting. In July 2015, the RM Lodha Committee suspended India Cements and Jaipur IPL, owners of Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals respectively, for two years. Additionally, Sreesanth, Chandila and Chavan were cleared of all the charges after they were found not guilty by the Patiala House Courts.However, in January 2016, Chandila was given a life ban from all forms of cricket by the BCCI. In March 2019, the Supreme Court lifted the life ban imposed by BCCI on Sreesanth. Investigation details Sreesanth was arrested at his friend's house, whereas Chandila and Chavan were arrested from their team hotel in Mumbai. Rajasthan Royals suspended the contracts of the three players until the investigation was complete. Delhi police have claimed that Chavan has confessed being involved in the spot fixing. The police also claimed that Chandila had tried to get other players, including Chavan, involved in the spot fixing under the direction of the bookies. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) suspended the players till further investigation. BCCI secretary Sanjay Jagdale, said, \\"The BCCI is shocked and saddened at the recent developments. The BCCI has zero tolerance to corruption. We will offer all cooperation to the Delhi police and all other authorities in their investigations in this matter. The IPL Governing Council has met and decided that the cricketers found involved will be dealt with severely.\\" On 4 June 2013, Delhi Police said that Sreeshant, Chandila, Chavan and 23 other people arrested by them in the spot-fixing scandal were going to be charged with the provisions of Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) since they were acting under the command of underworld dons Dawood Ibrahim and Chhota Shakeel. Sreesanth, Ankeet Chavan and 17 other people (including 14 alleged bookies) who were arrested by the Delhi Police were released on bail on 10 June 2013 by a Delhi court due to lack of evidence to be charged under MCOCA. Ajit Chandila had not applied for bail. Bombay High Court has sought investigation progress report from Mumbai Crime Branch during the hearing of a public interest litigation filed by social-activist Ketan Tirodkar. Delhi Police chief Neeraj Kumar said they had been taping phone calls since April 2013. He added, \\"Further arrests will be of bookies and no more players will be arrested.\\" The International Cricket Council withdrew umpire Asad Rauf from the Champions Trophy in the wake of reports that the Mumbai Police were conducting an investigation into Asad Rauf's activities in the IPL spot fixing scandal. Arrest of bookies Sunil Bhatia, a bookie arrested by Delhi Police, said that he was involved in fixing in Indian Cricket League and Bangladesh Premier League besides the IPL leading to speculations that the entire fixing scandal runs even deeper. A team of Delhi Police Special Cell officers arrested Yahya Mohammad in the early hours of 24 May 2013 from the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad in connection with the cricket betting. Ahmedabad Crime Branch arrested bookie Vinod Mulchandani from the Satellite Area of Ahmedabad city on 25 May 2013. 12.8 million INR in cash, laptops and mobile phones were seized from his possession. Vindu Dara Singh was arrested for alleged links to bookies in this spot fixing. He was later released on bail on 3 June 2013 by a Mumbai court. Gurunath Meiyappan case Call records of Vindu Dara Singh in connection with the betting scandal showed that he was in frequent contact with Chennai Super Kings (CSK) team principal and BCCI president N. Sreenivasan's son-in-law, Gurunath Meiyappan. To investigate whether frequent calls to Meiyappan were for betting, Mumbai Police issued summons to him. On 24 May 2013, Gurunath Meiyappan was arrested on charges of betting, conspiracy and cheating after he was questioned by the Mumbai Crime Branch. After his arrest, the CSK franchise immediately disowned him. In a press statement on 24 May 2013, India Cements, which owns the CSK franchisee said: \\"Mr. Meiyappan is neither the owner, nor the CEO/Team Principal of the Chennai Super Kings. [He] is only one of the members (Honorary) of the management team of the Chennai Super Kings.\\" The main reason for the immediate disowning of him was that, his arrest could lead to termination of the CSK franchise. This was because of the Clause 11.3 (c) of the Franchise Agreement, which stated On 26 May, BCCI announced that a three-member commission would investigate the role of Meiyappan in the spot- fixing and betting scandal. On 31 May 2013, a senior Mumbai Police official said that Meiyappanan had been warned by an official from the International Cricket Council's ACSU. Meiyappan was later released on bail by a Mumbai court, on 3 June 2013. Raj Kundra case On 5 June 2013, Rajasthan Royals team co-owner Raj Kundra was questioned by the Delhi Police for alleged involvement in illegal betting. On 6 June 2013, Delhi Police claimed that he had confessed to them of placing bets on his IPL team through a bookie who was his friend. On 7 June 2013, Rajasthan Royals team management said that Raj Kundra would be suspended and all his shares in the team taken back if the charges against him of betting were proved. Because of this, he was suspended from the IPL by the BCCI on 10 June 2013. Supreme court observation On 25 March 2014, the Supreme Court of India told N. Srinivasan to step down from his position on his own as BCCI president in order to ensure a fair investigation into the betting and spot-fixing charges levied against his son- in-law Gurunath Meiyappan who was team principal of Chennai Super Kings, else it would pass verdict asking him to step down. The Supreme court said it was \\"nauseating\\" that N. Srinivasan continued as BCCI chief. Mukul Mudgal Committee In October 2013, Supreme Court of India appointed a three- memberhttp://www.dnaindia.com/sport/report-bihar-cricket-association-to- oppose-nilay-duttas-name-1900288 committee headed by Justice (Retd.) Mukul Mudgal to probe allegations of betting and spot fixing in the Indian Premier League (IPL).http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/ipl-spot-fixing-mudgal- committee-to-decide-extent-of-punishment/1/404091.html The committee submitted its report to the Supreme Court in February 2014. The details of the report have not been made public. The other members of the committee are Additional Solicitor General of India L Nageswara Rao and senior advocate and former cricket umpire Nilay Dutta. The former Indian Cricket Captain Sourav Ganguly has also been appointed as a part of the committee and a part of the investigating process of the committee.http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/sourav- ganguly-inducted-into-mudgal-panel-to-probe-ipl-spot-fixing-and-betting- scandal/articleshow/36264053.cms Reactions Initially, Sreesanth's father Shantakumaran Nair termed his son's arrest to be a \\"larger conspiracy\\", and blamed cricketers M. S. Dhoni and Harbhajan Singh for connecting his son with the scandal, but later retracted the statement. There were reports that the Delhi and the Mumbai police were in an unfriendly competition between each other and there was a lack of coordination between them. These reports were later dismissed by Maharashtra Home minister R.R. Patil saying that the two teams were co-operating with each other to uncover the truth.

It is used as a food fish in some countries, and is also sometimes caught by fisheries harvesting other species. The IUCN redlist currently lists it as Least Concern, in part due to its widespread distribution and also partly because its use/interaction with fisheries does not occur throughout its entire range, nor is it thought to be at risk of overharvesting due to its deep water nature.

She lives and works in Padua.http://www.guggenheim- venice.it/inglese/collections/artisti/biografia.php?id_art=108 Work Apollonio was born in Trieste on 12 November 1940. She and her family moved to Venice when she was eight. In Venice she attended the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia. In 1963 Apollonio produced her first work, Metal Reliefs with Alternate Color Sequences. She shared with other Op-Artists the interest in a depersonalized art, as opposite to Abstract Expressionism. She used industrial material in her process, creating dynamic and fluctuating environments in the user's perception. In 1965 she became part of the international Op Art movement, meeting and exhibiting with artists such as Gruppo N Padua; Gruppo T Milan; Getulio Alviani; Dadamaino and Azimuth Milan. In the same year she was invited to Nova Tendencija 3, an international group show held at the Galerija Suvremene Umjetnosti in Zagreb, to Aktuel ’65 at the Galerie Aktuel Bern and, together with Getulio Alviani and Paolo Scheggi, the Oeuvres Plastiques et Appliquèes at Galerie Smith in Bruxelles. In 1975 Apollonio started making work based on the hortogonal relationship of parallel colored lines. In 1981 she expamded her practice to textiles, showing her works at the Laboratorio Artivisive Foggia and later, in 1983, at the exhibitions Morbide & Trame, at the Civica Galleria d’Arte Contemporanea in Foggia and Testi Tessili, at the Il Monte Analogo Library in Rome. In 2007 she presented her work Spazio ad attivazione cinetica 1967-1971/2007, a 10-meter rotating disc, in the Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt for the international show Op Art, where she was invited to exhibit together with Victor Vasarely, Bridget Riley, François Morellet, Julio Le Parc and Gianni Colombo.

A single-engine biplane with an unusually narrow gap between the upper and lower wings, it did not enter production. Design and development Hanriot followed their successful HD.3 two-seat fighter with another of that kind, the bigger, heavier and more powerful HD.5. This was an equal span two bay biplane, the bays defined by two pairs of parallel interplane struts on each side, assisted by wire bracing. The wings were almost rectangular in planform, though with slightly angled tips, mounted without stagger. The interplane gap was unusually small, with the upper wing so close to the fuselage that its leading edge required a deep, slot-like cutout for the pilot's head. Behind him the trailing edge also had a cutout, this for the movement of the rear gunner's Lewis gun(s). The HD.5 had short span, horn balanced ailerons. Its tailplane, mounted on top of the fuselage, had a straight leading edge, angled tips and carried slightly tapered, horn- balanced elevators with a cutout for rudder movement. The fin was small but the rudder was broad chord and low; it was very rounded and extended down to the keel. The fuselage of the HD.5 was flat-sided with rounded decking. The fighter was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 8Fb upright V-8 engine, water-cooled with a rectangular frontal radiator, and had a fixed conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels on a single axle attached by V-struts to the lower fuselage, assisted by a tailskid. The sole prototype began flight tests in the late spring of 1918 but there was no further development.

Produced by founding member and primary recording artist Jack Tatum, the EP was released nine months after the band's second studio album, Nocturne (2012). Regarding the release, Jack Tatum stated: \\"I feel like I’ve accomplished in seven songs, on this EP, what I really wanted to do with Nocturne, which is to find a way to compromise all of the things [I am] musically. I think I did that more with this EP than I have everything in the past.\\" Background and recording In 2012, Wild Nothing released its second studio album, Nocturne, to widespread critical acclaim and a significantly increasing fanbase. Influenced by the band's busy tour schedule, songwriter and primary recording artist Jack Tatum began crafting a follow-up EP, stating: \\"I had a lot of frustration in touring Nocturne, kind of in my own head really, not to do with anyone else. [...] It’s such a stupid thing to complain about and I am aware of that, but when you do it constantly it sort of deadens you to your own music and you kinda hate your own songs after a while. I started to realize that I wasn’t happy with what I’d been doing.\\" Tatum subsequently began writing and recording the EP during a three-month break from touring at the end of 2012. Tatum noted, \\"It’s pretty difficult for me to write on tour; I usually build up general ideas on tour – not necessarily even musical ideas, just whatever’s inspiring me at that moment. As much as I love touring, I’m always so happy to be home, and I seem to have these creative bursts when we first get off the road – I guess that’s how the new EP came about.\\" Writing and composition Prior to recording the EP, Tatum was influenced by David Bowie, Brian Eno and David Byrne, stating: \\"This EP is rooted in [the] past year [where] I got on this kick of rediscovering massive influential artists and digging deep into their records. Almost like researching why this person is so respected, like David Bowie, Brian Eno, and David Byrne. So I listened to a lot of Talking Heads, Eno’s rock albums, as well as his early ambient albums, and of course, Bowie’s Berlin trilogy.\\" Regarding the EP's track listing, Tatum noted, \\"Some of the songs are very poppy but I tried to make them stranger, awkward or weird at certain points.\\" Release Regarding the decision to write and record an EP not long after Nocturne's release, Tatum noted: \\"You can do whatever you want with [an EP], like it’s a free pass. People don’t really expect as much from an EP, so you’re free to do what you want to do. And that is what was so empowering about this particular experience for me. I never needed to take a step back and obsess over what kind of music I was making. I didn’t think that some people might think it’s weird that I’m making this electronic pop song or I’m making this really ambient, droney song. I just did what I wanted to do and it felt good not to think about the outside perspective. I do that so much. I spend a lot of time worrying about what other people think. But this EP was the most fun I’ve had writing and recording in a long time. [...] A lot of times bands put out EPs with the leftover tracks that didn’t make it onto the album for some reason. But this was not like that for me.\\" Artwork Empty Estate's artwork features paintings by New York-based artist Eric Shaw. Regarding Shaw, Jack Tatum stated, \\"[He's] a friend of a friend. I sent the record to a friend of mine and he said, “This sounds a lot like what my friend’s art looks like.” So I browsed through tons of his paintings and really fell in love. It really fit what I was trying to do with this EP. I almost feel like while I was making it I kind of thought of it as pop art in a way.\\" Critical reception Empty Estate received positive reviews upon its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 72, based on 13 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".Critic Reviews for Empty Estate. Metacritic. Retrieved 16 May 2013. AllMusic writer Fred Thomas said: \\"Empty Estate, while every bit as polished (if not more so) than the fancifully recorded Nocturne, sets itself apart by exploring different absent-minded stylistic detours on almost every track. [...] Ultimately any of these tracks could be the jumping-off point for an entire album's worth of material, and hearing them all together makes for a more interesting presentation.\\" Consequence of Sound's Amanda Koellner issued the album with a positive review, praising the track, \\"A Dancing Shell\\": \\"Funky dance track (yes, you read that correctly) “A Dancing Shell”, with its symphony of synths and addictive groove, is so impressive that you begin to wonder why Tatum didn’t slap a few more tracks on the record and call it a full-length. A trippy black and white photo graced the cover of Gemini, a teal and peach design on Nocturne, and this EP is dressed exactly how it sounds: a little more vibrant and a little more stoned.\\" Ian Cohen of Pitchfork, however, gave the album a mixed review, stating: \\"[Tatum's] second EP, Empty Estate, has the same relationship to its full-length predecessor as the Golden Haze EP did his debut: it’s noticeably bolder, sounds more expensive and crafted with live performance in mind. But it’s also the first time Tatum’s music hasn't improved on what came before.\\" Paste's Mack Hayden noted, \\"It’s no Nocturne or Gemini, but Tatum still proves to be a visionary consistent in his trajectory of progressing confidence. It’s hard to call this a misstep at all, but its best quality is keeping hope alive for what will come next.\\" Track listing Personnel ;Musicians *Jack Tatum - vocals, guitar, bass guitar, piano, synthesizer, percussion, drum programming *Tommy Gardner - drums (1 and 5) *Al Carlson - baritone saxophone (6) ;Recording personnel *Jack Tatum - producer *Al Carlson - engineering, mixing *Claudius Mittendorfer - mixing (4) ;Artwork *Eric Shaw - paintings and illustrations *Ryan McCardle - design and layout References Category:2013 EPs Category:Wild Nothing albums ","title":"Empty Estate"},{"id":"39402020","text":"The Nova Scotia Paramedic Society (NSPS) is a professional association established in 2011 that promotes the study, research, and communication of the history of Emergency Health Services (EHS) within the province of Nova Scotia, Canada.

The Act was passed with the support of the Scottish National Party, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. The opposition, Scottish Labour. refused to support the legislation because the Act failed to claw back an estimated £125m windfall profit from alcohol retailers. The Labour MSP Malcolm Chisholm, the former Minister for Health and Community Care, disobeyed his party's whip and supported the government. Legal challenge A legal challenge to the minimum pricing legislation failed at the Court of Session. The Scotch Whisky Association, the Confédération Européenne des Producteurs de Spiritueux and the Comité Européen des Entreprises Vins appealed the judgement. The act was delayed, with a legal challenge by the Scotch Whisky Association being referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union by the Court of Session. The decision of the court, delivered in December 2015, was that such legislation would only be lawful if alternative policies such as higher taxes would not be effective in protecting public health. Scottish judges would be required to consider evidence on this point. On 15 November 2017, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom unanimously rejected the Scotch Whisky Association's case, ending the legal battle, arguing that minimum pricing was a \\"proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim\\".

It was reputedly founded by King William the Lion of Scotland (1165-1214). The course was a right-handed oval, round, with a run-in of around . It was home to Britain's oldest horse race, the Lanark Silver Bell, which after a gap of three decades following Lanark's closure, is now contested again at nearby Hamilton Park Racecourse. The original Silver Bell is commonly reported to have been a gift of William the Lion in the 12th century. While the original bell no longer exists, the present one dates from the 17th century. The course also staged the longest handicap in the racing calendar, the William the Lion Handicap, which closed the Scottish flat racing season. The first aviation meeting to be held in Scotland was held at Lanark Racecourse between 6 and 13 August 1910. This location was chosen because the land was relatively flat, the racecourse already had facilities for a paying public, there were stables to act as hangars for the aeroplanes and the racecourse was accessible by both road and by rail, especially as The Caledonian Railway Company were prepared to construct a new station near the main entrance. The aeroplanes were transported to the meeting by rail, as aviation technology at the time was not advanced enough to safely fly there. The Lanark meeting took place shortly after a similar event in Bournemouth at which Charles Rolls lost his life. Influenced by this, it was decided that no aircraft would fly closer than away from the spectators. For the first time, aeroplanes were accurately timed over a straight measured distance, allowing the first world records to be set, covering flights over . The meeting was described by The Aero magazine as 'the most successful yet held in Britain'.Arthur W.J.G. Ord-Hume. Scotland's Aviation History, Stenlake Publishing, 2014.

The palace is located in La Candelaria district. Along the cobblestone streets of La Candelaria are other formal buildings such as the Plaza de Bolivar, the Palacio de Justicia, and the Casa de Nariño, as well as a library and museums. The palace was converted into Bogotá's city hall in 1974. History Eastern side of the Liévano palace. The site where the Liévano now stands originally featured a number of administrative buildings, and the residence of Sanz de Santamaria and the Viceroys till 1810. Seriously damaged by the 1827-28 earthquakes, they were demolished and, in 1848, were replaced by a building known as the Galerías Arrubla, built by Juan Manuel Arrubla between 1843 and 1848. Bogotá's largest building at the time with a façade long, it was the centre of the city's business interests as well as the seat of the municipal administration. After the building was completely destroyed by fire in 1900, one of its owners, the engineer Indalecio Liévano, managed to persuade the other owners that the French architect Gaston Lelarge (1861–1934) should be invited to draw up plans for a new building. In 1903, in agreement with the city authorities, a contract was concluded for the construction of a new building designed by Lelarge. Under the supervision of the architect Ricardo Lieras Codazzi the building was completed in 1907 at the same location where the galleries had been gutted earlier in 1900. Liévano built it with his own funds. Lelarge's design respected the proportions of the old Arrubla building but adopted a Neoclassical idiom which was new to the capital. However, the city administration acquired all the ownership rights of the palace in 1960. After it had finally been decided the building should become the city hall, it was adapted to the purpose in 1974 by Fernando Martinez Sanabria under the architect Fernando Martinez\\"Palacio Liévano\\", Bogotá Humana.

Architecture Completed in the Neoclassical style (French Renaissance, as some describe it), the building is rectangular, three storeys high and flanked by large sections with Mansard roofs at either end. The façade consists of 32 windowed bays on each of its floors, decorated with balconies, columns, pilasters and capitals. Iron is used for ornamental detailing.

The mayor's office on the first floor is a large room divided into a waiting room, the actual office and a lounge. The second floor is the most luxurious of all with its high-ceilinged sitting room known as the Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada. Decorated with plaster reliefs and furnished with plush red curtains and chairs, it was here Bogotá's most illustrious citizens met to take key decisions.María Camila Peña, \\"Las entrañas del Palacio Liévano\\", ElEspectador.com.

There is also a columned (of rectangular columns) arched portico at the ground level which runs along the front of the building and which serves the purpose of only providing shade and protection against rains. In the courtyard of the palace, the bust of José Acevedo y Gómez, a national hero, has been installed. The 450th anniversary of the city was marked by affixing 24 plaques in the walls of the palace on the first floor, recording the history of the city.

It is designed specifically for representing stochastic programming problems and, through recent extensions, problems with chance constraints, integrated chance constraints and robust optimization problems. It can generate the deterministic equivalent version of the instances, using all the solvers AMPL connects to,http://www.ampl.com/solvers.html or generate an SMPS representation and use specialized decomposition based solvers, like FortSP.  Language Features  SAMPL shares all language features with AMPL, and adds some constructs specifically designed for expressing scenario based stochastic programming and robust optimization.  Stochastic programming features and constructs  To express scenario-based SP problems, additional constructs describe the tree structure and group the decision variable into stages. Moreover, it is possible to specify which parameter stores the probabilities for each branch of the tree and which set represents the scenario set. Other constructs to easily define chance constraints and integrated chance constraint in an SP problem are available as well. Using these language constructs allows to retain the structure of the problem, hence making it available to the solvers, which might exploit it using specialized decomposition methods like Benders' decomposition to speed-up the solution.  Robust optimization constructs  SAMPL supports constructs to describe three types of robust optimization formulations: * Soyster * Bertsimas and Sim * Ben-Tal and Nemirovski  Availability  SAMPL is currently available as a part of the software AMPLDev (distributed by www.optirisk-systems.com). It supports many popular 32- and 64-bit platforms including Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. A free evaluation version with limited functionality is available.http://optirisk-systems.com/products_ampldevSP.asp  A stochastic programming sample model  The following is the SAMPL version of a simple problem (Dakota), to show the SP related constructs.

It opened in 1886 and closed to scheduled services in 1950, though it was served by excursion trains until 1964. Context The station was built by the Midland Railway near the junction of the circuitous to Westhouses via line known as \\"The Teversall & Pleasley Branch\\" and the equally circuitous to Pleasley line known as the Doe Lea Branch because it ran for much of its length along the valley of the River Doe Lea. The railways always spelt Teversal as \\"Teversall\\", most other sources use \\"Teversal.\\" In this article Teversall is used for railway items, and Teversal otherwise.Spelling of Teversal: via oldnotts History The station was opened without ceremony on 11 May 1886 when the Teversall & Pleasley Branch opened to passenger traffic. It initially provided a service of four trains each way between Mansfield and Alfreton via Mansfield Woodhouse, Teversal and Tibshelf, taking about 40 minutes from end to end. Services more than doubled on 1 September 1890 when the Doe Lea Branch opened, giving four trains a day from Mansfield to Chesterfield via Mansfield Woodhouse, Bolsover and Barrow Hill.The service in 1890 Old Miner The station originally had two platforms with a typical MR country station building on the western (northbound) side. Unusually the signal box was on one of the platforms. By 1950 all trace of the southbound platform had been erased. By 1930 the passenger service South from Pleasley West to Westhouses was down to one train a day southbound and, curiously, two a day northbound. Normal passenger traffic along the Doe Lea Branch was three trains a day with an extra on Saturdays. On 28 July 1930 both passenger services were withdrawn. Glapwell Colliery and others in the Doe Lea Valley were still going strong at this time, but all their coal went out northwards, so very little traffic passed through the steep line through Rowthorn Tunnel. The opportunity was therefore taken to abandon the line from just south of Glapwell station to Pleasley Colliery West Junction, a short distance South of Pleasley West, though a short length was left at the Pleasley end as a siding. Although closed in 1930 the station remained physically intact and was used until 1963 for excursion traffic to places such as Skegness. It was therefore duly renamed in 1950 from \\"Pleasley\\" to \\"Pleasley West\\" to avoid confusion with its neighbour which became \\"Pleasley East\\". Through traffic was rendered impossible from 1964 when the line North from Pleasley Colliery to the junction with what is now the Robin Hood Line closed. Pleasley Colliery subsequently sent its coal underground to Shirebrook and Teversal Colliery closed in 1980 after which the line through Pleasley West was redundant. It was closed on 7 January 1981 and lifted by November 1982. The station has been razed to the ground.

The Menagh Air Base had been a crucial military base used by Syrian military aircraft to bomb rebel forces in the north of the country, particularly in Aleppo city. Siege 2012 The first major rebel assault against the base came in the weeks following the start of the Battle of Aleppo. Rebel fighters from the Free Syrian Army and affiliated groups launched an attack against the air base on 2 August 2012 using a combination of small arms, rocket-propelled grenades, and five tanks they captured during the Battle of Anadan. The base was used by Syrian Air Force helicopters and jet aircraft to bombard rebel positions, and seizing it was seen as vital to the rebels in their advances across northern Syria.The News International, 3 August 2012, Rebels use tanks to attack air base The initial rebel attack on the base in early August was fought off by government troops entrenched inside the air base's perimeter, though rebel commanders said they would continue the siege and capture the base.Daily Telegraph, 2 August 2012, Syrian rebels use captured army tanks to attack Aleppo airforce base Heavy fighting broke out on the night of 27 December and continued \\"all night\\", as rebels once again assaulted the besieged base.

The remaining defenders were receiving supplies of weapons and food, as well as medical evacuations by helicopter; however, these flights became increasingly risky for pilots as rebel forces gained access to heavy weaponry and fired upon government helicopters. At this point the rebels estimated roughly 300 soldiers remained defending the air base. Soldiers who defected from the base reported that food supplies were a major issue and that soldiers were given rations of dry rice and wheat and told to \\"make what they can from it\\". Self-inflicted injuries were also reported as soldiers attempted to get away from the fighting.C. J.

Several insurgent militias taking part in this coordinated effort were actually hostile toward each other (for example, the Northern Storm Brigade had clashed with ISIL as late as July 2013); nevertheless, they put their differences mostly aside for the final attack on Menagh Air Base. The rebels prepared their assault against the base with a three-day long bombardment using artillery, mortars, and machineguns.

The role of JAMWA in the siege, however, strengthened outside perception of the Syrian insurgency as one relying heavily on foreign Jihadists. Extremist islamists generally portrayed the victory as being one for their cause. Regional expert Joanna Paraszczuk argued that the importance of JAMWA in the siege of Menagh Air Base should not be overstated, however, as the victory was achieved through the coordination of numerous rebel groups and not just the activities of JAMWA.

His rise in the ranks became rapid after his maternal uncle became Pope Clement XII. He was soon after made a cardinal and served in various positions within the Roman Curia. His beatification cause opened soon after his death but remained stalled until its resumption in 1940. The cause has since stalled once more. Life Education and priesthood Giovanni Antonio Guadagni was born in 1674 to a noble house in the Medici-ruled Florence as the second of four children to Donato Maria Guadagni (1641-1718) and Maddalena Corsini (???-1679); his maternal uncle was Pope Clement XII. On the maternal side he was related to Saint Andrea Corsini. His siblings were (in order): Tommaso (1668-???), Neri Andrea (1673-1748), and Elisabetta. His father married twice more after Maddalena died: to Maria Maddalena Niccolini (d. 1683) and Maria Alamanni, with whom he had four children. He received his doctorate in civil and canon law from the Pisan college on 3 May 1696. Guadagni later travelled to Rome to practice law but upon his return to Florence in 1697 decided to become a priest. He entered the Order of Discalced Carmelites in Arezzo (against the wishes of his parents) and assumed the religious name \\"Giovanni Antonio di San Bernardo\\" at the convent in Arezzo around 1669. He made his solemn profession of vows on 1 November 1700 and would undertake theological and philosophical studies in Florence at convents that the order managed. He was ordained to the priesthood on 11 March 1702 in Florence. Episcopate Guadagni was later named as the master of the novices and then as the provincial father for his order. It was at the request of the Grand Duke that he was promoted to the episcopate. Pope Benedict XIII appointed him as the Bishop of Arezzo on 20 December 1724 and he received his episcopal consecration a week later in Santa Maria della Scala church from his uncle and future pope Lorenzo Corsini. But he first had to receive a special dispensation from his Carmelite vow not to accept ecclesial dignities, in order to assume the ecclesial office. Guadagni was enthroned in his new see on 9 March 1725. In 1730 he affirmed opposition and his diocese's opposition to Jansenist heresies. His uncle's election as pope brought the bestowal of the pallium on Guadagni in the chapel of the Quirinal Palace on 22 November 1730. The pallium was normally only bestowed on metropolitan archbishops. In his uncle's pontificate, as a cardinal-nephew, he pursued the pope's pastoral and spiritual plans. Cardinalate Pope Clement XII raised him to the cardinalate on 24 September 1731 as the Cardinal-Deacon of Santi Silvestro e Martino ai Monti and he accepted in obedience to the pope. Guadagni arrived in Rome from Arezzo on 7 November and then entered though Porta Pia on 11 November before receiving the red hat on 22 November and his titular church on 17 December. Guadagni was enthroned in his church on 30 December at a solemn Mass. He was appointed to several important congregations in the Roman Curia and held posts in the Congregation of Bishops and Regulars and the Congregation for Rites amongst others. In 1732 he assumed the duties as the Vicar General of Rome after having resigned from his see in Arezzo. Guadagni was later appointed as the Cardinal-Bishop of Frascati in 1750 and also became the Vice-Dean of the College of Cardinals. On 10 April 1750 (two months after being made the Frascati titular head) he entered the Frascati suburbicarian see to commence a pastoral visit and oversaw the restoration of several churches while presiding over Confirmations and other Masses as well as leading rosaries. He later became the Cardinal-Bishop of Porto e Santa Rufina in 1756. He participated in the conclave in 1740 that elected Pope Benedict XIV and also participated in the conclave in 1758 that elected Pope Clement XIII. Guadagni served as the camerlengo from 1743 until 1756. Death He died in Rome in 1759 and was buried at the left side of the main altar in Santa Maria della Scala in the tomb that he had constructed for himself. He also composed the inscription that was placed on the tomb. He became reputed for his holiness and was said to have been buried with the odor of saintliness. Beatification process The beatification process opened in Rome in 1763 in an informative process tasked with research into the late cardinal's life and his virtues and which closed in 1764. But the cause stalled at some point and remained dormant until it was reactivated under Pope Pius XII on 27 November 1940. But the cause stalled at a later point and remains so at present.

Graham was born in Canada. \\"Marcus Graham\\" was a pseudonym for \\"Shmuel Marcus.\\"  Newspapers  Graham was the editor of several anarchist publications including MAN!, The Anarchist Soviet Bulletin, Free Society (name was changed from The Anarchist Soviet Bulletin), and The Road To Freedom. Graham is also believed to have been the publisher of the Ellis Island Weekly a hand-written anarchist newspaper published by anarchists held on Ellis Island. In particular, MAN! was an important anarchist newspaper in the United States during the 1930s. MAN! While advocating no specific anarchist program, was a successor of the tradition of Italian insurrectionist anarchism. It had direct links to that school of thought, with it growing out of the dissolution of an Italian anarchist newspaper. Over the span of its publication, MAN! had an “expansive” international circulation. In addition, chapters formed across the United States associated with the “International Group” that published MAN!. MAN! Published commentary and analysis of world events of interest to anarchists such as the Spanish Civil War and published biographical sketches of largely forgotten anarchists such as Luigi Galleani, Robert Reitzel, Carl Nold, Kate Austin, and Chaim Weinberg. Graham was also a prolific contributor to the anarchist press and his writings have appeared in the aforementioned newspapers in addition to War Commentary, Freedom, Resistance, Anarchy, Black Flag, and Match!.  Books  Graham produced two anthologies during his life. An Anthology of Revolutionary Poetry (Active Press, 1929) and MAN!:An Anthology of Anarchist Ideas, Essays, Poetry and Commentaries (Cienfuegos Press, 1974). Graham contacted Scottish anarchist Stuart Christie to publish the MAN! anthology.  Repression  Graham was the target of federal government repression from the 1910s into the 1930s. In the late 1910s, he was arrested and held for distributing The Anarchist Soviet Bulletin. Graham was held for six months while the government tried to determine his country of origin. The government threatened to deport him, but Russia, Mexico, and Canada all refused to accept him. In the late 1920s, Graham was arrested again and threatened with deportation to Mexico where he had just visited to promote his Anthology of Revolutionary Poetry. Hearings were held in the case but it failed due to pressure from the literary community. In the 1930s, Graham was again the target of repression. In 1936, Graham's home was raided as part of an attempt to suppress his newspaper MAN!. The government attempted to serve its 19-year-old deportation warrant but the charges did not hold. In 1940, a printer handed over proofs of MAN! to the federal government and its publication was suspended.

It is aimed at LGBT groups who share a common life experience, and uses a mobile phone's Global Positioning System to locate users. Currently the application is available on IOS.  History  Mifinder was launched in November 2012 by a UK based company which created the app after working with diverse communities over a decade and found that there was no community-oriented application that allowed people from diverse ethnic, religious, sexual and disability backgrounds to find each other and actively make friends, and gain social support with other communities around them based on their location. Mifinder later expanded to include \\"Life Experiences\\" to help people such as wheelchair users to connect with one another. Mifinder evolved to specifically focus on life experiences as it is driven by the principle that people who have gone through similar experiences can have greater mutual understanding, and therefore can offer more support to one another. Life Experiences UK charity Scope's tech blog described Mifinder's product evolution, explaining that the app is now uniquely aimed at groups in society with often higher rates of isolation, as people connect with each other based on a shared ‘life experience’. These experiences include visual, hearing or other specific impairments, or an experience such as being new to an area or learning a language. Momentum Magazine wrote that Mifinder now also includes \\"Life Experiences\\" filters, such as wheelchair users and coping with parenting. Mifinder is reported to be driven by the principle that people who have gone through similar experiences can have greater mutual understanding, and therefore can offer support to one another, for example to seek advice about accessible venues, local support and information about the area. Mifinder was keen to emphasise that the focus is on community and friendships.  Product  According to Tourism For All UK, in order to use the application the user selects the communities he/she belong to, uploads their photo and profile text, and their reason for using the application. They select the communities to engage with, in any combination. A thumbnail screen then appears, showing the profiles of the closest 120 users who fit the exact chosen criteria, ordered on the screen according to how far they are from the user in metres and miles at that moment. The user is then able to instant message, share photos and their exact location with car and walking directions with any user they choose. This GPS works globally. Mifinder caters to a variety of life experience, ethnic, religious, sexual and disability communities. In addition to Life Experiences, these include the globally dispersed such as Baha'i, Ismaili, Jewish, Traveler, those small in number such as Australian Aborigine, Native American etc. The app's filters mean that a user who identifies with several groups, such as a black gay Christian or a Jewish, disabled male etc. can see who around them shares the same characteristics and connect with them via GPS. People who are not from minority communities can use the app to meet a diverse range of people around them. Users can also select “support” if they are looking for social support from other users for example if they are disabled, new to an area or may not speak the local language. Mifinder also allows community groups and organizations to have a ‘real time’ presence on the app. The filters are said to encourage people to engage with other communities who they may not have otherwise socialized with. This application was designed to strengthen community ties and reduce isolation on an individual level and act as a tool for greater cohesion. Mifinder also allows community groups and organizations to have a ‘real time’ presence on the app.  Reception  Momentum Magazine, an online publication for the UK disability sports community, said \\"Mifinder have made it easier for people with a variety of life experiences, including wheelchair users, to meet each other in realtime.\\" It added that the app \\"provides countless opportunities for not only organising sports events and finding new members for teams, but also for simply making meaningful connections and sharing local information.\\" Carrie-Ann Lightley, head of Tourism for All’s Information service, an independent charity supporting tourism and leisure opportunities for disabled people stated “I would highly recommend Mifinder® to people with disabilities as it could have a real and invaluable benefit to their lives and their ability to access support, networking and dating. It is an excellent idea and a unique concept for those people who may feel lonely and isolated, so overall a great product” The application is listed as a founding partner of Go-On-Gold, which is a national campaign to raise awareness about the barriers faced by disabled people in accessing computers and the Internet, and to help remove those barriers.  Security  According to the developers, security is paramount including options to instantly block and report users, and to turn distance off. Exact location is never shared unless given and all profile photos are checked by real people and there are profanity filters. According to the developers these controls make it as \\"secure as it can possibly be\\".

Early life and education Mohapi was born in the rural village of Jozanashoek in Sterkspruit (former Transkei) on 2 September 1947. He obtained a degree in Social Work from the University of the North – Turfloop. Mohapi met Nonhle Haya in 1971 and they got married in 1973, with their first child Motheba being born in 1974 and the second one Konehali in 1976. Politics Mohapi joined the South African Students' Organisation and the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) while he was at Turfloop. His first detainment came in October 1974 after SASO leaders celebrated the independence of Mozambique. He was released in April 1975 after spending 164 days without having been charged. During the Human Rights Violations Hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa held in East London on 15 April 1996, his wife stated that it took the family months to find out where he was detained and she was there for a week before they allowed her to see him for two minutes. Mohapi was also elected permanent secretary of SASO and also worked as director of Zimele Trust which was an organisation that took care of ex-political prisoners and their families. In September 1975, he was banned under the Suppression of Communism Act and confined to the areas of King Williams Town and Zwelitsha. Death in detention On 16 July 1976, Mohapi was detained under Section 6 of the Terrorism Act, making him the first to be detained under that section. He was suspected of involvement in transporting youngsters across the border to Botswana for military training. On 5 August 1976, Mohapi was found with a pair of jeans tied around his neck which hung from the bars in his cell. Police produced a suicide note addressed to Captain Schoeman, claiming Mohapi had committed suicide in his cell. The letter read: > Death Cell Kei Road, 5/8/76 > This is just to say goodbye to you. You can carry on interrogating my dead > body. Perhaps you will get what you want from it. Give my regards to my > people at home, Aunt Sheila & her family & to my friends my love to you > always. Mapetla Two days before his death, he managed to smuggle a note on a strip of toilet paper to his wife Nonhle, assuring her of his ability to cope. An inquest held later found that the note was forged but no one could be held responsible for the death of Mohapi. His wife sued the police Minister with claims that the authorities staged his death. A hired handwriting expert determined that Mohapi’s signature was forged but no charges were filed. Steve Biko’s letter to the principal magistrate regarding the death of Mohapi was written on 12 January 1977. It reads: > I have been asked by the attorney representing the Mohapi family in the > above matter to make myself available for consultations on the 16th January > with their counsel as well as attend the inquest which has been set down for > the 17th and 18th January. Kindly grant me the necessary permission to enter > the premises of the King Williams Town Magistrate’s Court on the relevant > dates and to attend the consultation which will be held somewhere in King > Williams Town. I do not as yet know where exactly Mr Mxenge plans to have > the consultation. Yours faithfully Biko was at the time banned from leaving King Williams Town due to his involvement with the BCM. Nonhle Mohapi was also detained following her husband’s death and subjected to both physical and psychological torture. She stayed in solitary confinement for 6 months and upon her release, was banned. During her testimony before the TRC, she also mentioned how the police would attempt to make her sign blank pages, which she always refused. She learned during that time that Biko was also detained. The police would also torture her by claiming that her youngest daughter had died and they would release her only if she cooperated with them.

Kennedy is best known for completing the Melbourne marathon and Melbourne Ironman less than 9 months after a near fatal stroke and heart attack. Personal life Kennedy was born in Sydney, Australia to Annette and Edmond in a family of 3 children. At the age of 16 Terry joined the Royal Australian Navy and went on to earn the Australian Service Medal at the age of 20. He now resides on the New South Wales Central Coast with his wife Briohny Kennedy and has two children and regularly competes in endurance triathlons. Career Early career After leaving Castlemaine secondary, he joined the Royal Australian Navy. Kennedy left the Royal Australian Navy and went to work in sales for various Telecommunications companies and then in advertising. Family and Motivation Kennedy's normal life changed forever. He was 35 kg overweight, unfit, unmotivated and unhappy. When his son Archie was born with a rare brain condition Septo-optic dysplasia, he underwent several operations and spent many months in hospital, Kennedy then decided a change was needed and lost 35 kg to better himself for his family. His father was then diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer. His father had run marathons so he decided to use this newfound fitness to train for and run a marathon in his honour whilst he underwent treatment. Stroke and Heart Attack 5 days before what would be his first marathon Terry suffered a brain stem stroke and heart attack at the age of 33. The stroke left him without the ability to see, walk or talk. Drawing from the inspiration of those around him, Kennedy dedicated himself to talk, see and eventually walk again undergoing a vigorous rehabilitation program. As soon as Terry could walk again he set out to finish the goal he had originally set himself and entered the Melbourne marathon. He completed the Melbourne marathon 8 weeks out of hospital and 4 weeks after learning to walk again. Kennedy had run 44 km, when the distance for the race was 42.2 km, this was due to zigzagging which was put down to balance issues. A neurologist advised him to cycle and swim to assist in the balance issues he was having. After beginning work in cycling and swimming, he signed up as a late entrant to The Melbourne Ironman. Terry hadn't swam 50m or cycled a kilometre in 15 years so he underwent an arduous training program and completed the Melbourne Ironman in March 2013 some 8 months after being discharged from hospital. Hawaii Ironman In July 2013 Kennedy won a place into the Hawaii Ironman World Championships. Kennedy was awarded his place in the October 2013 event by public vote under the Kona Inspired completion as one of the 6 most inspirational athletes around the world. Kennedy was followed by The Project (Australian TV program) during the event. Kennedy went on to complete the grueling event overcoming severe sunburn and dehydration during the race to become a Hawaii Ironman World Championship finisher a little over a year after losing and then regaining the ability to see, talk and walk. Motivational Speaking In 2013 Kennedy established himself as a public speaker. He delivers a motivational and inspirational presentation detailing his story of overcoming tremendous adversities one after the other and coming out on top. Terry captured headlines across Australia with his story of dealing with near death experiences far beyond his control and then controlling what he could in regaining his health to complete an Ironman event. =Teachings= A big part of Kennedy’s speaking focuses on challenging people to discover a purpose and develop and set big goals. He strongly emphasises the importance of accountability not allowing circumstances outside of your control to hinder your goals. Kennedy advocates looking forward after a crisis and not be discouraged by challenges and setbacks, which may arise. He inspires audiences to create big goals and announce them publicly and in turn creating personal accountability.

The stream originates in the San Juan Mountains and flows for through the San Juan National Forest and private lands to its confluence with the San Juan River in Archuleta County, Colorado. Colorado classifies the Rio Blanco as an Aquatic Life Coldwater Class 1/Recreation Class 1 waterway supporting water supply and agricultural uses. The river also features native cutthroat trout and introduced rainbow trout fishing. Restoration project The river at the Blanco Diversion Dam, in late summer with low flow Downstream of the dam, at the start of the lower Blanco The San Juan–Chama Diversion Project, which was started in 1971, diverted water from the river at the Blanco Diversion Dam and eventually led to reduced water flow and a loss of aquatic habitat in the Rio Blanco. In 1998, Colorado included a 12-mile reach of the lower Rio Blanco on its list of impaired waters for failure to support its aquatic life due to sediment. A grass roots project organized by the residents aided by numerous local statewide and federal agencies to restore the stream channel to match the altered flow regime, resulted in the river's physical and biological function and water quality being improved. In 2008, Colorado removed the Rio Blanco, including the 12-miles of the lower reach, from the state's list of impaired waters. Fishing The tributary Rito Blanco, from Blanco Basin Road near US highway 84 Parts of the river range from wide, and fishing is permitted along the side creeks including Rito Blanco. Most of the trout are in the range. There are of the river that were transformed by hydrologist Dave Rosgen, from being wide and shallow to a deep flow that now supports a variety of trout. Rosgen's plan included placing boulders and old trees on the river banks to direct the waters toward a channel that would be more defined. He also constructed a tube to divert away the gravel and sand, which allows water to flow through, but the sediment is routed to a holding area which is regularly emptied and used elsewhere. Cost of the renovation was about $1 million. The three-mile stretch may be fished by guests of El Rancho Pinoso, a privately owned ranch near the river.

The first baboon she ever saved, in 1980, also died in the blaze, with two other baboons. Born Rita Neumann, she joined the League of German Girls (the girls' wing of the Hitler Youth) at age 8. She enjoyed the sports competition, and being able to escape an “overprotective mother”. As for Nazism, she said that “only today, in hindsight, do I understand the total madness we were subjected to”. Her plans to qualify as a veterinarian were thwarted by the postwar West German policy of favouring war veterans for admission to universities. After working in a Hamburg zoo, she followed a mining engineer, Lothar Simon to South Africa in 1953 and became his wife. While married to Simon she became a proficient pilot and he later died, with her 17-year-old daughter, in a 1972 light aircraft crash. Ten years later, she bought the small Lowveld farm that would become her baboon centre. A short-lived second marriage which ended in divorce, was to Piet Miljo, a South African. At first the centre rescued a variety of small animals, such as bushbabies, civets, warthogs, duikers, porcupines, assorted reptiles and birds. Soon large numbers of orphaned, injured and abused chacma baboons were being brought to the centre. Despite being listed in the CITES Appendix II, they enjoy almost no protection under South African law. Shrinking and degrading their habitat has brought them into conflict with farmers. Prior to Miljo's sanctuary, no facilities existed in South Africa for rehabilitating these orphans. Consequently, in 1989 she started the centre to nurse orphaned and injured baboons back to health, at the same time pioneering methods of reintroducing troops of convalesced baboons back into their natural habitat. The first such group of 10 baboons was released back into the wild in 1994, confounding many skeptical professional primatologists. In all, more than a dozen troops, totalling some 250 baboons, were released in the last 20 years of her life. Her standard response to police and prosecutors who harassed her and regarded baboons as vermin, was \\"Who are you to tell God that he should not have created baboons?\\" Sponsorship from IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare), and other financial backing, resulted in a steady stream of volunteer workers, scientists and students, and the rehabilitation facility became known around the world. Nelson Mandela's presence at one of the successful releases of rehabilitated troops in 2002, eased her persecution by authorities. Her ideals followed those of Jane Goodall’s with chimpanzees in Tanzania, Dian Fossey’s with gorillas in Rwanda and Biruté Galdikas’s with orangutans in Indonesian Borneo. However, Rita Miljo had not started her work with formal scientific training, and she was motivated to help animals for humanitarian reasons. In 1980 she removed a battered young baboon from a national park in Angola. She rescued many baboon orphans, finding one clinging to the dead body of its mother in a garbage dump. A number of rescued baboons were being held captive for their faeces which could be used in tribal medicines. Others were the subject of medical experiments.

Between 1994 and 1999, after the publication of the Murphy Report, Nova Scotia transitioned to a single ambulance service provider. This resulted in the AOANS members being bought–out and their ambulance services merged into the new system. The AOANS was formally dissolved in 2002.  History  Early history Prior to 1968, the vast majority of ambulance services in Nova Scotia were based out of funeral homes. The funeral homes had been the only service available twenty- four hours day with vehicles capable of transporting patients in a horizontal position. In 1968, eight Nova Scotia funeral homes decided to remove ambulances from their list of services provided to their community. Originally intended as just a favour for neighbours, the funeral homes became unable to meet demand. Robert Schaffner was instrumental in forming the AOANS in 1969 and subsequently served as its president for many years. The original 28 funeral home and ambulance company owners who had formed the AOANS, presented two requests to the then Health Minister Richard Donahoe: *That the provincial government take over ambulance services with the assistance of ambulance company owners. *That the provincial government financially assist existing ambulance company owners to upgrade services and provide real ambulance services to the public. Donahoe was not receptive to either request, but Dr. Tom McKeough (then Minister of Municipal Affairs) accepted something had to be done. The Department of Municipal Affairs thus provided $300,000 for an ambulance subsidy. In June 1971, due to public apathy and lack of government funding, AOANS voted to withdraw services. After the strike, additional funding was subsequently provided with the intent to increase the standard of ambulance services. From that point until the early 1990s, different branches of the Nova Scotia provincial government administered an agreement between the AOANS and themselves. Post-1990 In early 1990s, the Nova Scotia Department of Health (DOH) administered the contract between the Ambulance Operators Association of Nova Scotia and the Province of Nova Scotia. This contract did not specify standards for response times nor establish levels of medical care to be provided, rather it primarily specified claim evaluation and payment. In 1993, Cape Breton Island native Dr. Ron Stewart, who had been instrumental in organizing emergency medical services in southern California earlier in his career during the 1970s, was elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly and was appointed the Minister of Health. Stewart commissioned several reports on health care reform, one of which – Report: Emergency Health Services Nova Scotia (the \\"Murphy Report\\") – was conducted by Dr Mike Murphy, the director of emergency services at the Isaac Walton Killam Children's Hospital. It offered a comprehensive evaluation on the state of the province's ambulances. Murphy was critical of the AOANS for primarily being concerned with dictating prices to the government with little concern for standards for response times or levels of care. Stewart stated \\"No more. It will now be on our terms. The reform will be very deep.\\" The recommendations of the Murphy Report were subsequently adopted and by 1994 the transformation of Nova Scotia's ambulance system had begun, with the provincial government taking over control of ground ambulance operations and consolidating them into a single entity called Emergency Health Services. Before 1995, there were over 50 funeral home, private and public ambulance company owners belonging to AOANS. The ambulance companies had inconsistencies in terms of medical care provided to patients, levels of staff qualifications, the type and condition of ambulances, and working conditions for staff. Oftentimes, the type of care patients received was dependent on where they resided in the province. Between 1994 and 1999, the contract for ground ambulance services in Nova Scotia was gradually taken over by the newly formed department of Emergency Health Services (EHSNS), Nova Scotia Department of Health. The Department of Health's EHSNS negotiated buy–out terms with each of the AOANS operators in the province. Then a single private ambulance company, Emergency Medical Care Inc (EMC), executed the purchases. All private companies were now consolidated under a single ambulance company for the entire province. Emergency Medical Care Inc is a subsidiary of Medavie Health Services that, along with Medavie Blue Cross, is part of the Medavie group of companies. The last AOANS board, listed as 1138315 NOVA SCOTIA LIMITED in the Nova Scotia Registry of Joint Stocks, included Arnold Rovers as President/Director and Lawrence Stordy as Secretary. The Effective Date of Strike Off was October 12, 2002.  Education and certification  Pre-1970, ambulance drivers were not required to have any training to transport the sick and injured in Nova Scotia. In the mid-1970s, ambulance drivers were only required to have a class 4 drivers license and first-aid training. In 1980,http://dalspace.library.dal.ca/bitstream/handle/10222/47624/NSMB%201987%20Vol.66%281%29%201-31_OCR_150dpi_PDFA1b.pdf?sequence=1 the first two-week AOANS training program was launched with ambulance attendants being trained to level of Emergency Medical Attendant (EMA) AOANS, in conjunction with the Government of Nova Scotia Department of Health, was responsible for the Emergency Medical Attendant (EMA) certification of ambulance attendants. This certification was not recognized outside the province of Nova Scotia. Currently in Nova Scotia, only one institute in Dartmouth teaches a nationally accredited paramedic course. Registration to practice as a Primary Care Paramedic or Advanced Care Paramedic in Nova Scotia is now under control of Emergency Health Services, Nova Scotia Department of Health.  References  * R.J.

Garman was a gifted child and won school prizes for literature and history. A conscientious objector during the Second World War, he worked on a farm at South Harting, West Sussex near his grandmother's house. A friend from childhood, Kathleen Walne, said, \\"He was an eccentric, but a lovely one. He was a favourite in our household\\". Career He developed as a talented painter although suffering from mental instability, which was diagnosed as schizophrenia. (It was said on his death that he had \\"destroyed most of his canvasses in fits of depression\\".) In January 1950 he had an exhibition at the Redfern Gallery in London and in a foreword to the catalogue the artist and critic, Matthew Smith, wrote, \\"About the painting of Theodore Garman I can only say I look at them with wonder, admiration and even astonishment\\". Wyndham Lewis, in a review of the exhibition for The Listener, called him \\"an important newcomer\\". In March 1952 Theodore had a second exhibition at the Redfern Gallery. On 22 January 1954, after an incident at the Chelsea School of Art in which he was accused of stealing a figurine to use in a still life, his mother tried to protect him by having him admitted to hospital. A struggle occurred in the ambulance and he suffered a heart attack and died before his thirtieth birthday. He was buried at St Mary and St Gabriel church, South Harting, Sussex, which he had depicted in several paintings. Works One of the most popular paintings at The New Art Gallery Walsall, is his Summer Garden, South Harting (1944, oil on canvas, 66×76 cm). This shows the back garden of his grandmother's house. Visitors voted it their favourite painting in the collection. It is one of a collection of paintings by Theodore in the Garman Ryan Collection which his mother, who grew up in nearby Wednesbury, donated to Walsall. Other paintings by him in the collection include an early work, Stubbers Green Pool, Shelfield (c.1939, pastel; see Stubbers Green Bog) which shows a scene from Walsall which he visited with his mother to see her former nanny. Picture window in June (1951, oil on canvas 183x122 cm.) and The Wooden Monk (c. 1950s, oil on canvas, 127×102 cm.) are big pictures which bring together striking juxtapositions of mediaeval works of art and natural growth of flowers and leaves.

Imdad Hussain Chandio popularly known as Imdad Khan Chandio is the leader of Cholyani-Chandio tribe in Sindh. He has been a prominent leader of PML-N and held a diverse range of political and non-political appointments. In the year 1999, he was appointed as the Finance Minister of Sindh province; prior to that he was the Director of TVO (Trust for Voluntary Organisations), member Bait ul Maal-Pakistan; Chairman Khidmat Committee Larkana Division; Board member of Agriculture University Tando Jam and was the President of PML-N Sindh from 2001-2004 during the Musharraf era when the entire PML-N leadership was forced to be in exile; he led the party with utmost courage and resolve. Currently, he is the central Vice-President of Pakistan Muslim League (N). Early life Imdad Hussain Chandio was born in the village of Shamo Khan Chandio District Larkana, Sindh Pakistan. He completed his primary education from Taluka Warah and then went to pursue his secondary education from Taluka Mehar from where he passed with flying colours. He was an avid reader from his childhood and used to read literary books, poetry, novels, autobiographies and was especially attracted towards the subject of history. However, due to early death of his father he was not able to pursue his education further and was compelled by the circumstances to go back to his hometown and lead his tribe along with taking care of his agricultural lands, fish farms and other businesses. Nevertheless, his devotion for academics and books made him read rich literature ranging from socialism to economics; this led him to become a polite, humble and upright man. He never compromised on principles and is regarded as one of the most upright politicians in Larkana.  Political activism His passion for books made him become discontent with the feudal mindset and prevailing wadera culture at that time. Hence, he joined Tehrik e Istiqlaal as a young leader and was appointed as member of Central working committee. He followed the footsteps of his father by revolting against the local feudals who used to suppress and exploit the masses. He went against the local feudals and protested against the dictatorial regime of Zia ul Haq; therefore, he embarked on a courageous journey to purge his area from feudals and as well as continued his struggle to revive democracy in Pakistan during the dictatorial regime of Zia ul Haq when he led the like minded people in protests. During the course of which it was discovered that he had dynamic oratory and was a passionate speaker. He was a leading member in the movement to restore democracy (MRD). For which, he was imprisoned in jail for one year without being given any right of trial. Unflinched by his resolve to restore democracy, all the cases against him were dismissed and he was freed following which he became a prominent local political leader in Larkana. His passion to serve people made him contest for the election of chairman baldia warah where he got elected unopposed. He served the people with utmost devotion and was called upon by the chief of PML-N, Mian Nawaz Sharif to join his party. Following which he formally joined the PML-N and was made the divisional president of Larkana and member central working committee of PML- N. From then onwards, there was no going back and Imdad Hussain Chandio emerged as one of the most prominent politicians of Sindh. Contribution Imdad Hussain Chandio is regarded as one of the most respected and humble politicians of Sindh. It is because of his crystal clear past record and good reputation among the locals and politicians that he is said to earn nothing but respect. He is humble yet vociferous which could be judged by the fact that he stood like a might oak tree during the times of turmoil in the Musharraf era when every effort was made to lure him to join the PML-Q, but he refused categorically. His unwavering stance to stand by his parent political party (PML-N) strengthened democratic culture and showed the young party workers the way to pursue one's political commitments and ideology even in the face of grave threats and hardships. His speeches in various conferences, seminars, public rallies, demonstrations and television talk shows elicit that he is an epitome of a true leader who stands by his principles. He continues to stand by the democratic values of statesmanship, humbleness and uprightness. Mr. Imdad Hussain Chandio is considered to be persevering, steadfast and patient as he is considered as a pillar of MPL-N in Sindh, despite all the hardships he has faced in his political life be they: political cases, financial problems caused by the opposition, or tribal entanglements caused by a few notorious people. His main contribution is to unite a very large number of Sindhi workers under the banner of his party and making PML(N) a popular mass party is Sindh. He is also called as Chief of Cholyani tribe. He also contributed a lot to resolve the tribal feuds among different tribes, and set the tradition of taking delegations to rival groups to convince and encourage them to resolve their bloody feuds through traditional dispute resolution mechanisms through the involvement of notables. Such community based dispute resolution is one of the main alternate to rival groups in the absence of rule of law and very corrupt judiciary and administration. * Chandio  References  * https://www.facebook.com/ImdadHussainCholianiPmln?ref=br_tf * https://web.archive.org/web/20130715072154/http://www.pmln.com.pk/our_leadership.htm  External links  Category:Living people Category:Pakistan Muslim League (N) politicians Category:Baloch people Category:Sindhi people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Imdad Chandio"},{"id":"39402866","text":"József Pongrácz (10 September 1891 - March 1959) was a Hungarian wrestler.

When a Vanniyar girl from Sellankottai village, and a Dalit boy, from the neighbouring Dalit colony of Natham, fled due to parental opposition to get married, a caste panchayat held on the morning of 7 November by leaders from both communities ruled that the girl be returned to her family. Distraught at her decision to stay with her husband, her father allegedly committed suicide. The discovery of his body later that day is said to have provoked a 1,500-strong mob to rampage through Natham and two smaller Dalit settlements, Kondampatti and Anna Nagar, where it set ablaze over 200 houses, damaged at least 50 others, and allegedly looted valuables and cash worth lakhs of rupees. The mob rampaged for four hours and was brought under control after arrest of 90 men and an additional deployment of 1000 policemen. While Ramadoss, belonging to Vanniyar political outfit Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), had rubbished allegations that his party orchestrated the incident, many Dalits believe otherwise. His party is said to have fomented tension between Vanniyars and Dalits by publicly condemning marriages between the two. Many of the victims had blamed the fecklessness of the police and the district administration as this was a planned incident where a caste mob had been mobilised from 22 neighbouring villages. Though around 300 policemen were present on the spot anticipating trouble, they failed to control the violent gathering as the mob was eight times higher than the number of deployed forces. The Sub-inspector of Police, belonging to same caste of boy, and the constables responsible for maintaining peace in the area have since been transferred or suspended. The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) described the attack as well- organized and pre-planned. Background The Vanniyars are an intermediate caste dominant in northern Tamil Nadu and form 12-13% of the state's population. The Adi Dravidar community, formerly called Paraiyars, make up approximately half of the state's Dalit population and form around 10% of the state's population. Dharmapuri had been a stronghold of the Naxalite movement until the early 2000s, and the Communists and other Leftist groups encouraged a solidarity between different communities and ensured casteism was significantly reduced. With the collapse of Naxalism, the people, once monolithic in their opposition to untouchability and discrimination, were now lured by caste identities and the promise of power. Thus began an era where Dalits were made vulnerable by radicalised groups and Vanniyars turned sanctimonious about their perceived position in society. This inevitably led to clashes between the communities. These caste attitudes were strengthened by politicians, especially those of Vanniyar political outfit PMK. In April 2012, PMK MLA, Kaduvetti Guru incited caste fanaticism when he asked the members of community to kill non-Vanniyar men who marry Vanniyar women at a Vanniyar youth meeting held in Mamallapuram.  Incident  The unrest was sparked with the eloping of 20 year-old Divya, a Vanniyar from Sellankottai village, with 19 year-old E. Ilavarasan, a Dalit from the neighbouring Natham colony. Both were college students, and had been in a relationship for a long time. Their relationship was known to Ilavarasan's parents for at least a year before their elopement. The couple fled from the area when their parents opposed the marriage, and got married in a Salem temple on 12 October 2012. After their flight, Ilavarasan's parents fled too, fearing an outburst of violence from the Vanniyars. Two weeeks later, on 7 November, a caste panchayat of both communities was gathered, in which the couple were ordered to come home. When they refused, many Vanniyar community members taunted Divya's father, G. Nagaraj, for bringing \\"shame\\" to the community. Facing humiliation and distraught over the refusal of his daughter to return, he hung himself on the same evening. His body was discovered the next day. For his funeral, Vanniyars from 22 other villages had gathered. That afternoon, a 1500-strong Vanniayar mob marched towards the Natham colony, bearing Nagaraj's body, shouting caste slogans and cutting trees to block the Tirupattur highway. At the time, most of the Dalit men, who were daily-wagers in Coimbatore and Bangalore, were away, and the women and children that were there fled into nearby fields. Around 4:30, the mob charged into Natham bearing petrol and weapons. They looted every house, and torched many of them. The mob then moved on to Anna Nagar, 1.5 km away, and repeated the process while shouting obscenities. 36 out of 50 houses in the colony were set on fire. In Kodampatti, the mob was able to torch 14 houses but broke apart when a police team arrived. The head of the Sellankottai village claimed the villagers of Sellankottai had nothing to do with the violence. Aftermath As many as 268 homes of Dalits (of the Adi Dravida community) near Naikkankottai in Dharmapuri district were torched by the higher-caste group. The victims have alleged that ‘systematic destruction’ of their properties and livelihood resources has taken place. Around 1500 who were homeless after the incident were put up in a ground nearby and were provided food and clothing and also sanctioned Rs 50,000 as relief from Tamil Nadu Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. The affected people staged a fast demanding Chief Minister to visit the affected areas and to increase compensation. Reactions * Members of National Commission for Scheduled Castes after visiting the colonies blamed the attitude of the state police for failing to control the violence and stated that rise in status of Dalits are not tolerated by dominant caste Hindus which results in incidents of violence. They also alleged that the violence was a well-organized and planned attack on Dalits and not a spontaneous anguish over a single incident of suicide. * Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, a Dalit-based political party demanded a CBI probe into the incident as it did not have faith in local police inquiry. VCK president Thol. Thirumavalavan compared the incidents to 1990s Kodiyankulam violence where the main reason for the violence was upward mobility of Dalits in economic, educational, political fronts. * Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party constituted a fact finding committee came out with a report which stated It also blamed the state government for not taking enough steps to restore normalcy or implementing relief measures. * Communist Party of India (Marxist) MLAs K. Balakrishnan, P. Dillibabu and K. Bheema Rao visited the affected people to console and provide relief materials. They told the attack which seem to be well planned could not be prevented because of Intelligence failure and failure to keep a check on Kangaroo courts and demanded police to take action against those responsible under SC-ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act * Bharatiya Janata Party in Tamil Nadu said that the government has failed to check increasing incidents of breakdown of law and order and the police are not given full power to deal with it. * PMK founder S. Ramadoss claimed there were many 'staged love marriages' happening in the state where Dalit men lure Vanniyar women claiming to be in love and later duping them, ask for a ransom after marriage through Kangaroo courts. This was seen as a budding parallel to Love Jihad promoted by Hindutva groups. He also stated the mob that indulged in violence was cutting across castes / party lines unlike mentioned in sections of media / parties as mainly consisting of Vanniyar/PMK men. He also formed an alliance of caste Hindu organizations against Dalit assertion. asking for amendment to prevent the \\"misuse\\" of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and a ban on intercaste marriages, which was opposed by VCK and Periyarist groups like Dravidar Kazhagam. Probe and court proceedings The Tamil Nadu government transferred the probe from local police to Crime Branch CID. More than 90 persons were arrested and cases were filed against over 200 people. The Madras High Court has stated the incident as serious and instructed the state authorities to submit a status report and the counter affidavit on that date. A PIL was filed seeking the suspension of District collector and Superintendent of police for inaction. On 3 December 2012, The district collector told the court that adequate relief measures were provided to victims and steps have been taken to maintain law and order in the area. The Superintendent of Police said cases have been registered and 142 people have been arrested. High Court termed the relief insufficient and ordered the state to provide a relief of 7.32 crore. A fresh PIL was filed asking for effective monitoring of offenses under SC-ST act and transfer the probe to CBI. The petition was posted along with the other petitions in the case. Tamil Nadu govt then declared solatium to individuals were ready to the tune of 7.32 crore as per court order. On 9 February 2013, 91 people including some of whom who were falsely arrested for passing by near the violence area were let off and asked to appear before the CBCID. On 29 March, the high court gave bail to 28 accused in the case. No one was convicted.  Ilavarasan's death  On 15 March 2013, Divya's mother filed a petition in the Madras Court claiming Ilavarasan had kidnapped her daughter. In June, Divya visited her mother and eventually decided to separate from Ilavarasan, which, according to her, was because of the lingering weight of her father's suicide. On 3 July, Divya declared she had \\"no more feelings\\" for Ilavarasan. The next day, his body was found on the Coimbatore railway track. Three days after his death, the Superintendent of Police ruled the death to be a suicide. Four days after the incident, the Jaylalitha-led AIADMK government set up a one-man commission led by Justice S. R. Singaravelu to determine the cause of Ilavarasan's death. On 28 June 2014, the police arrested four Dalits from Natham in the case, claiming to have found Naxalite pamphlets in their houses. Villagers claimed they had been forced to dig a grave at the spot where his body was found. In November 2016, a CID report claimed he committed suicide while drunk, a claim strongly rejected by Ilavarasan's family. The Singaravelu commission delivered its report in 2019 claiming his death was caused by him jumping onto the railway tracks in depression, and being hit by a passing train. However, the commission's findings were against contested by Ilavarasan's family and social activists, who continued to suspect Ilavarasan's death was an \\"honour\\" killing. In particular, one forensic pathologist who examined his body thought the injuries present were too few to have been causing by hitting a train.

It is part of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, and was released in October 2013 for the Wii U and Nintendo 3DS in PAL regions by Nintendo and by Sega in North America and Japan. A port for Microsoft Windows was later released in November 2015. Lost World focuses on the efforts of Sonic the Hedgehog to stop the Deadly Six, an alien tribe that serves as the game's main antagonists, as they seek to siphon energy from the Lost Hex, the game's setting. Sonic and his long-time sidekick Tails must team up with Doctor Eggman, normally their enemy, to stop the Deadly Six, leading to conflicts among the three parties. While the gameplay is typical of the Sonic series in some ways, it adds parkour mechanics and features largely cylindrical level design with an emphasis on alternate pathways. The game also features the Wisp creatures from Sonic Colors as power-ups. The game began development shortly after the 2010 release of Sonic Colors. It was designed to be streamlined and fluid in movement and design, using tube-like level design and a simple, bright color scheme. The game received mixed reviews upon release; its controls and the Deadly Six were frequently criticized, but its visuals and audio were seen positively. Downloadable content was released both alongside and after the game's release, adding features such as additional levels and a new type of Wisp power. Gameplay Sonic Lost World is a platform game with action-adventure elements, in which the player controls Sonic the Hedgehog as he travels across the Lost Hex in order to rescue captured animals and stop the Deadly Six. Levels range from side-scrolling 2D levels to fast-moving 3D linear levels to levels taking place on spherical worlds similar to the canceled Sonic X-treme and the Super Mario Galaxy series. This also translates to the 3DS version, as it was the first handheld game in the series presented entirely in 3D. In-game screenshot of the \\"Frozen Factory\\" level from the Wii U version. The game uses a new control system which allows players to control Sonic's speed. Simply moving the directional controls will move Sonic at a moderate pace, allowing for more precision. Holding down a trigger button will cause Sonic to sprint, allowing him to move faster and perform new parkour moves, such as running up and along walls and hopping over small ledges. In the air, Sonic can perform a double jump, which returns from Sonic Colors, a homing attack, which can now target multiple enemies in quick succession, and a new kick attack, which can be used to defeat stronger enemies, or knock them into others. Also returning from Colors are the Wisp creatures, which provide short-lived power-ups to Sonic. The Wisps' powers are now controlled using the Wii U GamePad's touchscreen and gyroscopic features. Alongside returning powers such as Drill, Laser and Rocket, new powers include Eagle, which lets Sonic fly through the air, Asteroid, which atomizes objects in his path, and Rhythm, which lets him bounce along a path of notes. There are also some Wisps exclusive to each version of the game. During the game, players can rescue animals by destroying enemies or opening containers, allowing players to progress, or find Red Star Rings that open up circus-themed bonus stages where players can earn more animals. Collecting all the Red Star Rings in the game unlocks the ability to transform into Super Sonic. The Wii U version supports both co-operative multiplayer, in which a second player can control a remote controlled vehicle to assist Sonic, and competitive multiplayer, in which a second player can use the Wii U Gamepad screen to race against the other player. The game also supports Miiverse and Off-TV Play functionality. Using Miiverse, players can exchange items such as Wisps or shields, which grow more effective if they are used by other players. The 3DS version supports both local and online multiplayer for up to four players. Players may also customise RC vehicles in the 3DS version, which can then be used in the Wii U version. Plot Characters Seven returning characters from previous Sonic games star in Sonic Lost World. The protagonist, Sonic the Hedgehog, must defeat the main antagonist Doctor Eggman and stop the Deadly Six. Aiding him in his quest is his best friend Tails, a fox who has the ability to fly. Knuckles the Echidna, Sonic's strong friend, and Amy Rose, his self-proclaimed girlfriend, also make relatively minor appearances. The main antagonist of the series, Doctor Eggman, is a mad scientist who seemingly turns over a new leaf to help Sonic stop the Deadly Six. Eggman's henchmen Orbot and Cubot make a return appearance. Also serving as the main antagonists and boss characters are the Deadly Six, a group of the world's indigenous Zeti race consisting of Zazz, a hyperactive Zeti; Zomom, an obese and dim-witted Zeti; Master Zikin Miaz, the elderly founder of the tribe and Zavok's teacher; Zeena, a flirtatious and self-absorbed Zeti; Zor, a diminutive and pessimistic Zeti; and Zavok, the tribe's leader. The tribe plans to steal the life energy from Sonic's world to increase their own power. Story Sonic and Tails pursue Doctor Eggman, who has captured several of their animal friends with the intention of using them to power his robot army. While the two attempt to retrieve a falling capsule filled with animals, Eggman shoots down Tails' plane. However, they end up discovering a world in the sky known as the Lost Hex, and crash land there. As they explore the world, the duo discover that Eggman has enlisted the aid of a group of the world's indigenous Zeti race, collectively known as the Deadly Six, using a magical conch to keep them under his command. However, when Sonic rushes in and kicks the conch away, the Deadly Six betray Eggman and take control of his Badnik army. They then start to use one of Eggman's machines to siphon energy from Sonic's world below, planning to drain all of its life force until there is nothing left and use it to power themselves up. Reluctantly, Sonic agrees to work with Eggman, believing that he needs his help to stop the machine, though this seems to cause some distrust between him and Tails. As Sonic battles his way throughout the Lost Hex, the Deadly Six concoct a plan to capture Sonic and turn him into a robot under their control, but they end up accidentally capturing Tails instead. After Eggman is seemingly killed, Sonic comes across the Deadly Six as they prepare to use the roboticized Tails against him. However, prior to the conversion, Tails managed to reprogram the process to retain his free will and instead helps Sonic to defeat them. Upon reaching the machine and finding it already switched off, Eggman reappears, having faked his death and used the energy harvested to power his latest giant mech. Sonic defeats Eggman, sending him falling to the planet's surface, and he and Tails restore the stolen energy to the world below before returning home. In a post-credits scene, Orbot and Cubot find Eggman, who has survived his fall, and they dig him out of a soft spot of dirt he landed on. Upon realizing that half of his mustache is missing, Eggman throws another tantrum, prompting Orbot and Cubot to run away in fear. Development Development for Sonic Lost World started shortly after Sonic Colors was finished, when a few core members started the experimentation for the former and took place over two-and-a-half years. Sonic Team sought to streamline the controls, increase the length, and add more diverse levels compared to previous entries in the series. After reviewing the history of the franchise with Sonic Generations, game producer Takashi Iizuka hoped to \\"deliver a new experience\\" with Sonic Lost World. Development started on PC, with early experiments involving \\"twisted tube-type level[s]\\" inspired by Jack and the Beanstalk. As the concept \\"was totally new\\", early levels had to be remade \\"over and over.\\" Players were given greater ability to control Sonic's speed in an effort to create a more traditional platforming experience. The parkour mechanic was introduced to maintain a more fluid sense of movement, in contrast to previous Sonic games where running into a wall would force the player to a complete stop. Iizuka stated that \\"This game is like going into the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland, an action game where you can experience many strange and fun experiences.\\" Development ultimately focused on the Wii U and 3DS because of the success of previous Sonic games on Nintendo platforms. Because Wii U \\"has two monitors to use\\", Sonic Team decided to include both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. The Wii U GamePad's touch screen and gyroscope were employed to activate the returning Color Powers. The 3DS version, co-developed with Dimps, was designed to \\"fully utilize\\" the 3DS hardware with 3D gameplay and motion controls. Development was harder on 3DS due to its more limited processing power. Iizuka stated that the Color Powers are \\"essential\\" to the level design of the 3DS version, while they work as an \\"additional tool\\" in the Wii U version. A simple art style was used to make objects stand out more against the backgrounds, and to keep the game running at a consistent 60 frames per second. The design of the new \\"Deadly Six\\" villains was based on that of an ogre, and each one's appearance was intended to reflect a certain key characteristic of their personality, which the developers hoped players could see \\"just by looking at them.\\" The Wii U version of the game was directed by Morio Kishimoto, the director of Sonic Colors and the lead designer of Sonic and the Black Knight, while the 3DS version was directed by Takao Hirabayashi, the director of Sonic Colors DS, and previously lead designer of Sonic Unleashed PS2/Wii. Sega trademarked the title Sonic Lost World in May 2013. The game was revealed on May 17, 2013 in a Nintendo Direct announcement, as part of an exclusive partnership between Sega and Nintendo for the Sonic the Hedgehog series. It is one of three games in this partnership, the other ones being the fourth entry to the Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games series, and Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal, a game based on the Sonic Boom animated series. Sega reported that more on the game would be revealed before E3 2013, and that the game would contain both returning and new original characters, both in enemies and friends of Sonic. The first trailer for the game was released on May 28, a day earlier than previously announced. A downloadable demo of the game's first stage was made available for both consoles on October 9 in Japan and in mid-November in North America and Europe. To promote the release of Sonic Lost World, Hardlight Studios released an update for Sonic Dash that includes a boss battle against Zazz, one of the Deadly Six. Super Smash Bros. for Wii U also includes a stage based on Windy Hill Zone from the game as well. The soundtrack was composed and directed by Tomoya Ohtani, with Takahito Eguchi handling the orchestration and cutscene music. Naofumi Hataya also contributed a single piece, the theme for \\"Desert Ruins Zone - Act 3\\". A three-disc soundtrack, Sonic Lost World Original Soundtrack Without Boundaries, was released physically in Japan and digitally worldwide via iTunes and Amazon Music on November 27, 2013. Post- release support A special, limited stock \\"Deadly Six\\" edition of the Wii U version of the game was available for pre-order, which included special \\"Nightmare\\" downloadable content (DLC), featuring a new stage and boss battles based on one of Sonic Team's previous games, Nights into Dreams.... Clearing the DLC unlocks a special Color Power, the Black Bomb, normally only obtainable via Miiverse. Pre-ordering the game from Amazon.com allowed the player to start off with twenty-five extra lives. A patch for the Wii U version was released on December 10, 2013, adding additional features such as button controls for some Wisps and the traditional extra life reward for collecting 100 rings. On December 18, 2013, Nintendo announced two exclusive pieces of free DLC for the Wii U version based on other Nintendo games. The first DLC stage, \\"Yoshi's Island Zone\\", was released on the day of the announcement, with a second installment, \\"The Legend of Zelda Zone\\", released on March 27, 2014. Reception Sonic Lost World received mixed or average reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. During its opening week in the UK, Sonic Lost World charted at #11 on the All-formats chart for sales, but achieved the top spot on the Wii U chart and #4 on the Nintendo 3DS chart. As of the end of 2013, Sega had shipped 640,000 copies of the game. As of March 31, 2014, the game had sold 710,000 copies. The game's presentation was well received. Chris Plante (Polygon) praised the Wii U version's visuals and music as \\"arguably the best\\" in the series. Tim Turi (Game Informer) wrote that \\"The orchestrated tracks evoke Mario Galaxy in the best ways.\\" Mark Walton (GameSpot) and Chris Scullion (Computer and Video Games) singled out the candy-themed \\"Dessert Ruins\\" level as a visual highlight. However, Turi made note of \\"ultra-compressed\\" cutscenes in the 3DS version. Vince Ingenito (IGN) was favorable to the \\"pleasant\\" art direction and stable framerate, but criticized the \\"subdued\\" color palette. Roger Hargreaves (Metro) stated that the \\"imaginative\\" designs and \\"spectacular set piece[s]\\" kept him \\"interested to know what comes next.\\" Chris Schilling (Eurogamer) was effusive: \\"Blue skies forever!\\" Strong criticism was directed at the game's control scheme, especially the new parkour mechanic. Turi \\"never got a good feel for the rhythm of wall running and jumping, and felt lucky to pass sections where it was forced.\\" Hargreaves, Walton, and Matthew Castle (Official Nintendo Magazine) agreed. Ingenito found it problematic that Sonic tends to wall-run on every nearby vertical surface. Schilling singled out the multi-lock homing attack, writing that while it usually worked \\"perfectly well\\", it appeared to \\"inexplicably fail\\" on occasion. Ingenito, Turi, and Hargreaves agreed. Castle struggled with the homing attack \\"locking on too late or attacking enemies in awkward sequence.\\" However Justin Towell (GamesRadar) defended the control scheme, explaining that while it had a learning curve, it also \\"modernize[s] environmental traversal\\" and \\"provide[s] a distinct safety net\\". Towell argued that Sonic was mainly hard to control in 2D because there are \\"so many rules for how Sonic reacts contextually to his environment\\". Reona Ebihara (Famitsu) stated that the ability to slow down made the game easier to play for beginners. However, Turi criticized Sonic's \\"odd sense of momentum\\" and imprecise jumps, stating that switching between two speeds is \\"jarring\\" and produces \\"touchy platforming\\". Schilling excoriated the \\"profoundly frustrating\\" controls as the worst in the series, explaining that \\"Sonic's too sluggish while walking, and too skittish to cope with the trickier platforming bits when running\\". Ingenito agreed: \\"I've played a lot of Sonic over the years, and the controls have never felt as alien and inconsistent as they do here.\\" Several critics felt that Sonic controlled better on the 3DS. Jose Otero (IGN) said the parkour \\"felt great\\" and \\"turned most obstructions into minor hurdles\\" in this version. Joe Skrebels (Official Nintendo Magazine) felt that Sonic \\"controls far better at top speed on 3DS\\". Stephen Totilo (Kotaku) stated that the 3DS version does a better job of teaching the controls, although Turi derided its \\"constant, lengthy tutorial text\\". However, Schilling called the homing attack \\"even more capricious\\" on 3DS. Reaction to the game's level design was mixed. Turi made note of oddly placed invisible springs in the Wii U version's \\"confusing\\" and \\"aggravating\\" levels, and expressed frustration with the 3DS version's \\"head- scratching\\" puzzles. Walton preferred the \\"inoffensive\\" 2D sections to the \\"frustrating mishmash of speed and exploration\\" found in 3D. Plante praised the Wii U version's 3D stages as \\"wildly creative exercises in platforming experimentation\\" while decrying its 2D stages as \\"so clunky and tiresome that it's hard to imagine a time when a side-scrolling Sonic was actually good.\\" Philip Kollar (Polygon) was harsher on the 3DS version due to its \\"confusing and labyrinthine\\" level design and \\"awkward puzzles\\". Ingenito stated that the Wii U version's levels were stuck in \\"design gridlock\\" and \\"lack[ed] rhythm and cohesion\\". Otero praised the 3DS version's \\"better levels\\" as \\"competently made race tracks full of alternate pathways\\", but called the \\"trial and error\\" required to complete the \\"slower-paced 3D stages\\" \\"incredibly frustrating\\". Castle stated that the Wii U version's \\"best stages play to the strengths of Sonic's tiered speed\\", while Skrebels felt the 3DS version featured levels well-suited for handheld play. Totilo praised \\"the intuitive, flowing, player- friendly levels of the 3DS version\\" but panned \\"the badly-explained, choppy, punitive levels of the Wii U version\\". Schilling wrote that \\"I came perilously close to biting my GamePad at one particularly sharp difficulty spike.\\" Edge noted that \\"Sonic games, and platformers in general, have always been about memorizing the lay of the land, but rarely have mistakes been so costly or heavily punished.\\" The alternate gameplay styles polarized many critics. Daniel Cairns (VideoGamer.com) and Castle highlighted the level where Sonic becomes a giant snowball as \\"genuinely excellent\\" and \\"a cool riff on Monkey Ball\\", whereas Turi and Ingenito described it as \\"atrocious\\", \\"uncontrollabl[e]\\" and \\"the exact opposite of fun\\". Turi \\"received multiple game overs during a mundane mandatory pinball sequence.\\" Walton felt that some of the Wisps were an \\"amusing aside,\\" but problematic motion controls and short time limits impaired their utility. Justin Speer (GameTrailers) stated that the Wisps felt out-of-place in the Wii U version. Totilo preferred how the Wisps were implemented in the 3DS version, but Towell stated that while they were \\"more integral\\" to the design, they tended to interrupt \\"the free- form gameplay\\" with \\"clumsy mechanic[s]\\". Towell described the 3DS version's motion-controlled Special Stages as \\"borderline unplayable\\". Totilo and Castle criticized the Wii U version's Jetpack Joyride-style flying levels as \\"regrettable\\" and \\"horribly imprecise\\". Turi and Totilo criticized the Wii U version's balloon-popping minigame as \\"mind-numbing\\" and \\"awkward\\". Turi called the Wii U version's co-op mode \\"useless\\". Castle wrote that \\"Two-player races would be a cool addition were it not for the horrible framerate issues.\\" The Deadly Six were negatively received. Although Towell enjoyed their \\"fun, stereotypical personalities\\", he was disappointed by their \\"awful\\" dialogue. Speer called the boss battles \\"weirdly anticlimactic\\", and Ingenito stated they were \\"some of the most boring in the series' history\\".

It consisted of the Italian commune of Pontecorvo, an enclave of the Papal States from 1463 within the territory of the Kingdom of Naples. The principality was created by Napoleon for his Marshal Jean Baptiste Bernadotte. It was nominally sovereign, but the prince did have to take an oath to the king. The principality was short-lived. In 1815, after the Napoleonic Wars, the town was ceded back to the Papal States. In 1820, the 'Republic of Pontecorvo’ seceded from the Papal States, but Papal rule was restored in March 1821. In 1860, it joined Benevento, the other southern Italian papal enclave, in being united with the new Kingdom of Italy.

During the demobilization period of 1919, the Regular Army and its air arm answered a call to defend the southern border against raids from Mexico, and to halt smuggling of illegal aliens and narcotics into the United States and weapons from the United States into Mexico. Background : see also Pancho Villa Expedition Revolution and disorder in Mexico and trouble along the U.S.-Mexican border in March 1913 brought on the hurried organization of the 1st Aero Squadron, the U.S. Army's first tactical unit equipped with airplanes. In 1916 the squadron took part in General Pershing’s Punitive Expedition into Mexico in pursuit of Mexican revolutionist Pancho Villa. Difficulties along the border continued during World War I while the United States was at war in Europe. Mexican bandits often raided American ranches to secure supplies, cattle, and horses, and in doing so sometimes killed the ranchers. U.S. troops stationed along the border shot raiders as they pursued them into Mexico. The biggest clash came in August 1918, when more than 800 American troops fought some 600 Mexicans near Nogales, Arizona. A 1st Aero Squadron Curtiss R–2, Signal Corps No. 71, at Columbus, New Mexico, 1916. Border patrol was one of the many activities being considered for the postwar United States Army Air Service. However, no aviation units had been assigned to duty on the Mexican border, when a large force of Villistas moved northward in June 1919 toward Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico (opposite El Paso, Texas), garrisoned by Mexican government forces. Major General DeRosey C. Cabell, Commanding General of the Army Southern Department, received orders to seal off the border if Villa took Juarez. If the Villistas tired across the border, Cabell was to cross into Mexico, disperse Villa's troops, and withdraw as soon as the safety of El Paso was assured. The general ordered Air Service men and planes from Kelly Field and Ellington Field, Texas, to Fort Bliss, near El Paso, for border patrol. American troops under Brig. Gen. James B. Erwin, Commander of the El Paso District of the Southern Department, were on alert when about 1,600 of Villa's men attacked Juarez during the night of 14/15 June 1919. Stray fire from across the river killed an American soldier and a civilian, and wounded two other soldiers and four civilians. Around 3,600 U.S. troops crossed into Mexico, quickly dispersed the Villistas, and returned to the American side.Army Hist Div, Order of Battle, 111, pt 1, 610–11.Clarence C. Clendenen, Blood on the Border: The United States Army and the Mexican Irregulars (London, 1969), pp 351–355 Air Service surveillance mission United States Army Air Service Mexican Border Patrol Map, 1919–1921. As a result of this incident, Air Service personnel equipped with war surplus Dayton-Wright DH-4 aircraft were ordered to Fort Bliss, Texas, on 15 June. Major Edgar G. Tobin, an ace who had flown with the 103d Aero Squadron in France, inaugurated an aerial patrol on the border on the 19th. By mid- September the force grew to 104 officers, 491 enlisted men, and 67 planes from the 8th Surveillance Squadron, 9th Corps Observation Squadron, 11th Aero Squadron, 90th Aero Squadron and the 96th Aero Squadron. In the summer of 1919, the Air Service planned to assign at least nine Aero Squadrons and one Airship Company for surveillance of the entire Mexican border from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean. The original plan called for two Observation Squadrons (the 9th and 91st) of the Western Department to patrol eastward from Rockwell Field, California, to the California-Arizona line. Three Surveillance Squadrons (the 8th, 90th, and 104th) and four Bombardment Squadrons (the 1lth, 20th, 96th, and 166th) of the Southern Department were to be distributed along the border from Arizona to the Gulf of Mexico. On 1 July 1919, three surveillance squadrons were organized into the Army Surveillance Group (ASG) headquartered at Kelly Field. In September the four bombardment squadrons formed the 1st Day Bombardment Group, also with headquarters at Kelly Field. In addition the 1st Pursuit Group and its squadrons (27th, 94th, 95th, and 147th) were moved from Selfridge Field, Michigan, to Kelly at the end of August to be available if needed. The three groups (surveillance, day bombardment, and pursuit) comprised the 1st Wing at Kelly. Commanded by Lt. Col. Henry B. Clagett, the 1st Wing became responsible for aerial patrol of the border in the Southern Department. Also in August, work started on a large steel hangar for an airship station at Camp Owen Bierne, Fort Bliss (which later became part of Biggs Field).ASNLs, Sep 3, 1919, pp 1–2, Dec 3, 1919, p 1. Operations The Air Service soon scaled down the plan for border patrol. Although minor incidents continued to occur, Pancho Villa never succeeded in rebuilding his forces. The major threat had been dispelled by the time aerial patrol began. From January 1920 on, the mission of the Mexican Border Patrol in the Southern Department was assigned to the 1st Surveillance Group which had moved its headquarters to Fort Bliss and gained an extra squadron, the 12th. The group's squadrons operated in two flights, each patrolling a sector on either side of its operating base. From the Gulf of Mexico westward, the deployment was as follows: * 8th Aero (later Surveillance, later Squadron) (Attack) : Headquarters, Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas, 25 May 1919 :: Flight operated from: McAllen Field, Texas, after 25 July 1919 : Headquarters moved to: McAllen Field, Texas, 13 August 1919 :: Flight operated from: Laredo Field, Texas, 15 August 1919 : Squadron re-combined at: Kelly Field, Texas, 2 July 1921 : The 8th's patrol sector was from the mouth of the Rio Grande at the Gulf of Mexico to Eagle Pass, Texas. * 90th Squadron (Surveillance) : Headquarters, Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas, 15 May 1919 :: Flight A operated from: Eagle Pass Field, Texas, 27 August 1919 :: Flight B operated from: Kelly Field No. 2, Texas, 30 September-29 November 1919 : Headquarters moved to: Sanderson Field, Texas, 29 November 1919 :: Flight A operated from: Eagle Pass Field, Texas, to 12 June 1920 :: Flight A operated from: Del Rio Field, Texas, 12 June 1920 – 30 June 1921 : Squadron re-combined at: Kelly Field, Texas, 2 July 1921 : The 90th's patrol sector was from Eagle Pass to Lajitas, Texas. * 104th Surveillance Squadron (later 13th Squadron (Attack)), 25 May 1919 : Headquarters, Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas, 1 June 1919 : Headquarters, Fort Bliss, Texas, 6 November 1919 :: Flight operated from: Marfa Field, Texas, 6 November 1919 – 3 September 1920 :: Flight operated from: Marfa Field, Texas, 17 November 1920 – 30 June 1921 : Squadron re-combined at: Kelly Field, Texas, 2 July 1921 : The 13th's patrol sector was from Lajitas to El Paso, Texas * 12th Aero, (later 12th Squadron (Observation) ) : Headquarters, Fort Bliss, El Paso, Texas, 9 January 1920 :: Flight operated from: Douglas Field, Arizona from 10 January 1920 : Headquarters moved to: Nogales Field, Arizona, 12 April 1920 :: Flight operated from: Douglas Field, Arizona from 12 April 1920 : Headquarters moved to: Douglas Field, Arizona, 1 February 1921 :: Flight operated from: Nogales Field, Arizona from 1 February 1921 : Squadron re-combined at Biggs Field, Texas, 28 September 1921 : The 12th's patrol sector was from El Paso, Texas to Yuma, Arizona Western Department Area: Jones Chronology, Jun 18, 1919.Maurer, Combat Squadrons.

Officers of the 8th Surveillance Squadron – McAllen Field Texas, 1920 The border patrol mission started with DH-4s and Curtiss JN-4 Jennies, with both eventually replaced with updated Dayton-Wright DH-4Bs. Most of the first planes were not properly equipped for field service. Not knowing what turn events on the border might take, the Army wanted the planes ready for any eventuality. Colonel James E. Fechet, Air Service Officer at the Southern Department, found it no easy task to obtain bomb racks, machine gun mounts, cameras, and other equipment. There was a delay, for example, in installing synchronized Martin guns because parts supplied with the guns did not fit the planes on the border. The radios on some planes could send only in code and could not do that very well. Compasses were unreliable, maps sketchy and of little use. The country over which the men had to fly was wild and rough and sparsely populated, with few places for safe emergency landings.ASNL, Sep 3, 1919, pp 1–2. Air Service squadrons flew along the border searching for bands of men and reported to the nearest cavalry post how many men they were, where they were, which way they were heading, what they were doing, and how many horses and cattle they had. The timing of the patrols varied so raiders would not know when the next plane would appear.Maj Henry H. Arnold, History of Rockwell Field (1923), p 87, MS in AFHRC 168.65041 Airfields The patrol bases were hurriedly created. One of the young lieutenants who flew from Marfa Field in the summer of 1919 remembered the flying field as a pasture at the eastern edge of town. Its five hangars were made from canvas. A double row of ten or twelve tents served as officer and enlisted quarters and sheltered flight headquarters and supply. The lieutenant, Stacy C. Hinkle, recalled his tour of duty on the border as “a life of hardship, possible death, starvation pay, and a lonely life without social contacts, in hot, barren desert wastes, tortured by sun, wind, and sand.” The boredom was as bad as the physical hardship and discomfort, the sole recreation being drinking and gambling. Even so, Hinkle thought the airmen better off than the poor fellows at cavalry outposts up and down the border. Primary airfields used in the Border Patrol mission were: * Calexico Field, California : * Del Rio Field, Texas : * Douglas Field, Arizona : * Eagle Pass Field, Texas : * El Centro Field, California : * Fort Bliss, Texas : * Kelly Field, Texas : * March Field, California : * Marfa Field, Texas : * McAllen Field, Texas : * Nogales Field, Arizona : * Ream Field, California : * Rockwell Field, California : * Sanderson Field, Texas : Secondary airfields used on an as-needed bases, without garrisons, were at Bosque Bonite, Texas; Brownsville, Texas; Candelaria, Texas; Columbus Airfield, New Mexico; Fort Huachuca, Arizona; Lajitas, Texas; McAllen, Texas; Wellton, Arizona; Yuma, Arizona. and Zapata, Texas. Border incidents 12th Aero Squadron at Camp Little near Nogales, Arizona, 1920 Pilots flying along or near the border were under orders not to cross. But they often got lost and strayed into Mexico. At times they went over deliberately, apparently on the spur of the moment. Occasionally, they crossed to carry out a special assignment. Addressing the National Congress of Mexico on 1 September 1919, President Venustiano Carranza said U.S. military planes had crossed the frontier several times. While his government had protested, the incursions had been repeated.Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States, 1919 (Washington: Department of State, 1934), 11, 537. The Mexican president was probably not aware that one of the flights violating Mexico's sovereignty had been made by the ranking pilot of the U.S. Air Service. Inspecting the border patrol in July 1919, General Billy Mitchell had taken Colonel Selah H.R. \\"Tommy\\" Tompkins, 7th Cavalry Commander, for a reconnaissance. Burke Davis, The Billy Mitchell Affair (New York, 1967), pp 55–56. =Chihuahua city flyovers= In fact, the day President Carranza addressed the Mexican Congress, Ignacio Bonillas, Mexican Ambassador to the United States, protested the flight of two Air Service planes over Chihuahua City, during the afternoon of August 28. James B. Stewart, American Consul in Chihuahua, had already reported the incident. Soon Stewart was back with another dispatch and Bonillas was protesting again-more American planes had flown over Chihuahua on 2 September. Two more planes showed up in the morning of the 5th. When Stewart said these incidents embarrassed members of the American colony, Acting Secretary of State William Phillips replied: “War Department promises to issue strict orders against repetitions.“Foreign Relations, 1919, 11, 561–62. 90th Squadron (Attack) – Dayton-Wright DH-4s, Sanderson Field, Texas, 1919 Not long afterward, Ambassador Bonillas complained that the crew of an Air Service airplane had fired a machine gun several times while flying over Nogales, Arizona. Some of the shots hit a dwelling across the border in Nogales, Sonora, luckily without injuring anyone. The Mexican government wanted the guilty persons found and punished. Several weeks later the State Department responded that an Air Service lieutenant was being tried by general court- martial for the shooting.Foreign Relations, 1919, 11, 564-65. =Candelaria border incursion of 1919= Another incident protested by the Mexican government began with two Americans getting lost while on a routine flight in the Big Bend area of Texas on Sunday morning, 10 August 1919. When their plane crashed in Mexico they ended up getting kidnapped on 13 August by a Villista desperado named Jesus Renteria. The bandit sent the ransom note to a rancher at Candelaria, along with telegrams which he forced the airmen to write to their fathers and the Secretary of War, the Commanding General of the Southern Department, and the commanding officer of U.S. forces in the Big Bend District. Renteria demanded $15,000 not later than Monday, 18 August, or the two Americans would be killed. 90th Squadron (Attack) – Dayton-Wright DH-4, Sanderson Field, Texas, 1919 The ransom was paid for one of officers but when Matlack took the remaining $7,500 to get Lieutenant Davis. On the way to the rendezvous he overheard two of Renteria's men talking about killing him and Davis as soon as the rest of the ransom money was paid. At the rendezvous, Matlack pulled a gun, told the Mexicans to tell Renteria to “go to hell,” and rode off with Davis and the money. Avoiding the ambush, Matlack and Davis safely crossed into the United States. At daybreak on Tuesday, August 19, 1919, Captain Matlack once again crossed the border, this time leading Troops C and K, 8th Cavalry, in pursuit of Renteria and his gang. Air Service planes scouted ahead of the cavalry seeking to spot the bandits. They also gathered information on the condition of the trails and the location of waterholes, and conveyed it to the troops by dropping messages. =Seizure of plane by Mexico= A few months later another plane landed in Mexico after its crew followed the wrong railroad tracks. Patrolling on Monday, 2 February 1920, 1st Lts. Leroy M. Wolfe and George L. Usher intended to pick up the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad west of Douglas, Arizona, and follow it to Nogales. Visibility was poor and the compass did not work properly. Sighting a railroad, Wolfe and Usher followed it for some time until it ended. Lost and having engine trouble, they landed and were taken into custody by Mexican officials. The tracks they had steered by ran due south instead of west, and had led them to Nacozari, Sonora, seventy-five or eighty miles below the border. Though treated well, Wolfe and Usher were not set free until 2 February. They waited three more days for release of their airplane, shipping it to Douglas by train. De Havilland DH-4 bomber with members of the 90th Squadron (Surveillance) at Sanderson Field, Texas, ca 1920. =Crash in Baja = On border patrol with the 9th Corps Observation Squadron, Lts. Frederick Waterhouse and Cecil H. Connolly disappeared after taking off from Calexico Field, California, bound for Rockwell Field, on 20 August 1919. A search begun the next morning gradually extended farther and farther south in Baja California. When three weeks passed with no trace of the missing men, the search ended. A month later it was learned their bodies had been found near Bahía de los Ángeles on the coast of the Gulf of California, 225 miles south of Calexico. From the evidence that could be gathered, it appeared Waterhouse and Connolly became lost in a rainstorm and hugged the coast of Baja California southward, thinking they were headed north along the Pacific Coast. They landed safely on the beach about twenty miles north of Bahia de Los Angeles. Their sole chance for survival seemed to be staying with the plane until found. Tortured by heat, thirst, and hunger, they waited seventeen days, but the search never reached that far south. Finally two fishermen came along and took them in a canoe to Bahia de Los Angeles. There the Americans were murdered, apparently for the little money they had. Their bodies, buried in the sand, were discovered within a day or two by an American geological survey party and rediscovered a week later by an American mining engineer. The news, however, did not reach Rockwell Field until 13 October. Three days later, a Navy ship, USS Aaron Ward, sailed from San Diego with a group of Army officers to recover the bodies. Arnold, History of Rockwell Field (1923), pp 87–91. The full story of this incident is yet to be written. Experimental 13th Squadron (Attack) – Dayton-Wright XB-1A, at Kelly Field, Texas, Used in the Border Patrol Conclusion As time went on, air border units spent less time on patrol and more in training with the Army infantry, artillery, and cavalry units. Air Service personnel further practiced aerial gunnery and formation flying, experimented with radio and other signaling systems, located and marked emergency landing fields, and worked to upgrade facilities and equipment. At first, units tried to cover their sectors every day. Later, the number and seriousness of border violations by Mexicans decreased, and the patrols tapered off. In the autumn of 1920, the schedule for the 1st Surveillance Group called for flights twice a week. When exercises with ground forces or other activities interfered, patrols might be canceled for days or even weeks at a time. Brig. Gen. William Mitchell’s need for men and planes from the border for bombing tests against naval vessels off the Virginia Capes in June 1921 brought border patrol to an end.The 12th Observation Squadron, at Fort Bliss until 1926, sporadically flew patrols along the border during that time See also *United States Army Air Service (May 24, 1918 – July 2, 1926) Bibliography Notes References * * * \\\\- Total pages: 67 * \\\\- Total pages: 626 External links Category:20th-century military history of the United States ","title":"United States Army Border Air Patrol"},{"id":"39403036","text":"Callopistria latreillei, Latreille's Latin, is a moth of the family Noctuidae.

Biography Jones was educated at Brasenose College at Oxford (Fellowship at All Souls, 1569) and married Mabel Ussher, sister of James Ussher (later Primate of All Ireland) in Ireland c. 1602. Irish historian James Ware claimed he was called \\"the vivacious Bishop of Killaloe\\" for having married a young wife at the age of threescore (60).James Ware, The Whole Works of James Ware concerning Ireland, Volume 1, Dublin: E. Jones, 1739, p. 596 He held several church posts in Ireland, finally becoming Bishop of Killaloe in 1633. His Puritan leanings were deplored by Archbishop Laud, but he remained in office until his death in 1646 at the reputed age of 104. He was buried in St. Werburgh's Church, Dublin. He was Dean of Ardagh (1606–1625) and Dean of Cashel (1609-1633), when he renovated Cashel Cathedral and instituted a choir there.The Ecclesiologist, August 1867, \\"The Cathedrals of Ireland\\" (part V), John Jebb, p. 191 Two of his sons were themselves bishops – Henry Jones (1605–1682) and Ambrose Jones (d. 1678).

Several writersOxford Dictionary of National Biography, \\"Lewis Jones\\"Alumni Oxonienses, Volume II, Joseph Foster, Oxford: Parker & Co., 1891 believe Jones graduated from Brasenose College in 1580, which would correspond to a date given for his age in a letter of Archbishop Laud and make him about 86 at his death. On the other hand, the story of Jones as \\"the vivacious Bishop\\" given by James Ware and his editor Walter Harris – in a work supposedly printed by Jones' granddaughters – would argue for the earlier date of graduation. Genealogist Robert Leech, in a 19th-century work on the Jones family, posited that there were several Lewis Joneses active at the time, and the Dean of Ardagh was a different Lewis Jones, the son of Thomas Jones, Archbishop of Dublin.The Jones Family in Ireland, Robert Leech, Yonkers, New York: M.

Biography   Education and early career  André Hambourg was born in Paris on 5 May 1909. Entering the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Arts Decoratifs in 1926, he studied sculpture under Paul NiclaussePaul Niclausse (1879–1958) was a French sculptor, most famous for his art deco medals cast in bronze. He was awarded the Legion of Honor, and was a professor at both the École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. for four years. The young artist then entered the studio of Lucien Simon at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts. While in the middle of his academic studies, Hambourg had his debut solo exhibition at the Galerie Taureau in Paris in 1928. He was only 19 years old at the time. Because of the early recognition of his talent, Hambourg became active in the important Paris salons in the first stages of his developing career. In 1931, he was made a member of the Salon de l’Art Français Indépendant and the Salon de l’Oeuvre Unique.  Africa  The first of Hambourg’s many honors was the Prix de la Villa Abd-el-Tif,The Villa Abd-el-Tif was a villa in Algiers used by the French Government as part of a bursary for artists and sculptors from 1907-1961. The prize and villa was designed to be the North-African counterpart of the Prix de Roma. awarded in 1933. As a result, the artist traveled to North Africa for the first time, and would spend nearly ten years working in Algeria and Morocco. The powerful sunlight, as well as the bleak poverty of this region, inspired Hambourg’s canvases. In 1937, he executed a large mural for the Algerian Pavilion at the Exposition Internationale of Paris, earning the title of Laureate of the Exposition. Throughout his years in North Africa, Hambourg would exhibit his paintings in numerous one-man shows in Algeria, Oran and Paris. Eighty of his works were shown at such a show, at the Musée d’Outre-Mer in Paris in 1939.  Military service  In 1939, Hambourg was mobilized as a military reporter and draughtsman and worked on the staff of the Journal de Commissariat a la Guerre, the newspaper of the French army, under the pseudonym Andre Hache. Special missions on combat vessels led to his appointment as a war correspondent in 1944 with the staff of inter-allied SHAEF.Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force was the headquarters of the Commander of the Allied force in northwest Europe from 1943 until the end of War World II. U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower was in command of SHAEF throughout its existence. In this role, he took part in the German, Alsace and Atlantic Front campaigns, as well as the liberation of France. In recognition of his wartime contributions, Hambourg was decorated with the Croix de Guerre. Before the end of the war, Hambourg became the first French delegate to the Four Arts Aid Society. For his aid to French artists during this time, Hambourg was made a Chevalier of the Ordre de la Sante Publique. After returning to his artistic career for a short time, Hambourg became the official painter of the Navy in 1952. He undertook numerous voyages aboard French Navy vessels on missions all around the world including: Venice, the Soviet Union, Israel, Britain, the Ivory Coast, the United States, and Mexico. From these global travels, the artist brought back many sketches and preparatory drawings for future paintings and illustrations. His international trips would have a lasting influence on his artwork. Hambourg’s adventurous maritime career resulted in his receiving the honor of Laureate of the Salon de la Marine, and becoming the official painter of the Marine Ministry.  Late career  In 1970 five hundred of his works formed a prestigious retrospective at the Maison de Culture in Bourges. Other notable shows include Drawings of Venice at Galerie Varine-Gincourt in Paris (1979), Bonjour New York at Wally Findlay Galleries in New York (1985), The Presence of André Hambourg at the Salon du Dessin (1986), André Hambourg in the Ivory Coast at Galerie Guigne in Paris (1987), and finally André Hambourg in Venice at Galerie Apesteguyin Deauville (1989). Having past experience creating mural decorations for ships, Hambourg was asked to complete a 195 square foot mural, for the Audience Chamber of the new European Court of Justice in Luxembourg in 1972. One year later, this panoramic work was unveiled at an opening ceremony in the Hotel de Ville, attended by the President of Luxembourg, Robert Lecourt, as well as the Duke and Duchess of Luxembourg. On 4 December 1999 André Hambourg died in Paris after a long and prosperous career. Today his works can be found in the collections of museums such as the Musée National d'Art Moderne, the Musée national de la Marine,In 2003, Hambourg's work was presented in the museum's Luminous Algeria, Through the Eyes of Seascape Painters (1830-1960) exhibition and the Musée des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie.  Personal life  Hambourg married Nicole Rachet, the granddaughter of Eugène Boudin’s doctor and friend, in 1948.  Artist and illustrator  Hambourg wrote and illustrated two books relating what he had seen and experienced as a military correspondent. Berchtesgaden-Party and From Algiers to Berchtesgaden were published in 1947. The artist was also a prolific illustrator of collectors’ books for nearly 40 years. His illustrations are found in the following titles: * Georges Duhamel's La Pierre d'Horeb 1953) * Kipling's The Return of Imray (1956) * Léo Larguier's St-Germain-des-Prés (1958) * Henri de Régnier's Venetian Life (1959) * Sully Prudhomme's Private Diary (1960) * Honfleur Lights by Lucie Delarue-Madrus (1964) * Joseph Kessel's Land of Love and Fire (1967) * Henry de Montherlant's Gypsum Flower (1967) * A Way of Looking at the Gardens of Versailles based on a text by Louis XIV (1974) * Robert Pariente's Venice Notebook (1979) * Posthumous Works by Albert Camus (1979) * Robert Pariente's Paris in Full (1985) * Provence by André Suarès (1993)  Awards  Hambourg would receive many honors and awards over his lifetime.

Biography Prince was born in West Garforth, Yorkshire. He went to London where he apprenticed in, and in due time joined, the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers. Although a member of the Clothworkers he was a cheesemonger by trade. He settled in the parish of St Martin Orgar where, although an Independent, he stayed within the Anglican church. Prince supported the Parliamentary cause in the English Civil War and served in the Blue regiment of London's trained bands until invalided out after being badly wounded in 1643 at the First Battle of Newbury. During the war he supplied he Parliamentary armies with cheese and butter and became moderately wealthy. In November 1647 he was one of the men who presented the Agreement of the People to Parliament and was one of those imprisoned for this act. By December he was free and campaigning for the Levellers cause. In 1648 he continued to agitate and became recognised by both supported and detractors as a prominent Leveller. He was appointed as one of the Levellers' treasurers and in December was a signature to the petition presented to Sir Thomas Fairfax, the Army commander, objecting to the Army's dismissal of the second Agreement of the People. In March 1649 he was arrested with the other Leveller leaders: John Lilburne, Richard Overton, and William Walwyn, and incarcerated in the Tower of London when the Levellers published a tract against the military government (the second part of) Englands New Chaines Discovered. While in the Tower the prisoners continued to publish pamphlets. Two of these can be directly linked to Prince: The Picture of the Councel of State, contains Prince's account of his arrest and examination by members of the Council of State, and The Silken Independents Snare Broken, a reply by Prince to an attack upon the Levellers by some leading London Independents. Prince was released along with the other leading Leveller prisoners after Lilburne was found not guilty of high treason at his trial in October 1649. Prince continued to live in London until at least 1657 and was mentioned by Lilburne as one who would provide security for him if he were allowed to return from exile. Prince also spoke up for Lilburne at his 1653 trial. Family Prince married Elizabeth; they had two children who were baptised in the parish of St Martin Orgar. One died as an infant.

When he was 14, Poon Tip won his first award for business from Junior Achievement for selling 10,000 \\"Weather Worm\\" bookmarks on the counters of drug stores in Calgary, Alberta. Poon Tip studied business at Mount Royal University in Calgary but transferred to study Tourism in Tourism College, which is now CDI College in Calgary, Alberta. On June 3, 2019, Bruce was granted an honorary Doctor of Laws from Capilano University to recognize his community contributions on the local, national and international level.https://www.capilanou.ca/about-capu/get-to- know-us/news/2019/title-129644-en.php Career  G Adventures  In 1990, Bruce Poon Tip cofounded G.A.P Adventures (later renamed G Adventures) at the age of 22 from his apartment in Toronto with Anita Voth, whom he met while working at the Toronto office of an Australian tour operator, Worldwide Adventures. Poon Tip recognized that there was a gap in the tourism industry for those seeking grassroots travel experiences, such as an alternative to resorts and cruise ships. His belief was that if travel was done correctly it could connect global cultures and lead to greater global wealth distribution. Unable to secure a loan from a financial institution to start the business, Poon Tip maxed out two credit cards to provide seed money to fund the first trips for the company. One of the first trips that G Adventures offered was a local home stay with an Amazonian tribesman named Delfin and his family in the Amazon jungle in Ecuador. This partnership of embracing local cultures and travellers directly benefitting local communities was a cornerstone for Poon Tip's vision of travel. To this day, the trip remains a part of G Adventures offerings. Over the next two decades, Poon Tip led G Adventures to 40% sales growth each year, including during the global recession of 2008, when Poon Tip turned down an offer of $100 million to sell G Adventures. It was at this time that Poon Tip realized the potential for G Adventures to grow beyond being a company that simply offered trips, but one that had a primary emphasis on organizational culture with a set of core values and a business model rooted in freedom and happiness that transcended the travel industry and was easily relatable to customers and employees alike. Under Poon Tip's leadership, G Adventures has been named by National Geographic Adventures Magazine as a best 'Do It All Outfitter' on Earth and is a six-time recipient of the Top 10 Employers for Young People, a lifetime platinum recipient of the 50 Best Managed Companies and for ten consecutive years was named as one of Canada's fastest growing companies by Profit (magazine). G Adventures also received multiple Best Workplace Awards, as a result of employee surveys conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute. Poon Tip is an authority on social entrepreneurship, 'quintuple bottom line' versus 3BL, corporate social & environmental responsibility, leading with service and innovation.  Planeterra Foundation  In 2003, Poon Tip founded Planeterra, a NGO that helps local people develop their communities, conserve their environment, and provide social solutions to local business challenges. Select Planeterra projects include a woman's weaving co-op in Peru Hope Africa, a day school for HIV/AIDS orphaned children in South Africa and New Hope Cambodia Vocational Training Restaurant in Cambodia, which provides marginalized people in that community with hospitality skills to help them obtain new dignified job opportunities. In 2013, Planeterra announced a $1 million partnership with the Multilateral Investment Fund and the Inter-American Development Bank to fund five community-based tourism programs in Central and South America, which was a first for the tourism industry.  Speaking engagements Poon Tip has spoken on sustainability and tourism at the 2010 TED (conference) Whistler, TED Bangkok and TEDx Toronto events, and spoke at the International Business Leaders' Forum at the inaugural United Nations World Tourism Organization Seminar on Ethics in Tourism. He has also presented at the UNWTO Conference on Climate Change and Tourism in Switzerland, the Ecotourism and Sustainable Tourism Conference in the USA and addressed the UN World Tourism Forum for Peace and Sustainable Development. At the request of the World Bank and UNESCO, Poon Tip was asked to lecture in China on Sustainable Development and has also presented at the United Nations launch of The Year of Eco Tourism in New York City.  Looptail: How One Company Changed The World by Reinventing Business  On September 17, 2013, Poon Tip released his first book, Looptail: How One Company Changed the World by Reinventing Business a major book release from HarperCollins Canada and Business Plus (publisher).. Looptail tells the story of how Poon Tip built G Adventures into a socially responsible business and evolved it into a social enterprise. Looptail is the first business book to be endorsed by the 14th Dalai Lama, who wrote the foreword for the book and praised Poon Tip for being \\"one of those entrepreneurs who understand that human dignity, freedom, and genuine well- being are more important than the mere accumulation of wealth\\". The book debuted at #1 on the Globe and Mail hardcover non-fiction bestsellers list and at #4 on the New York Times How-to/advice list.  Awards and achievements  Bruce has received many awards for business and workplace leadership and entrepreneurism over the years.

Its membership is made up of companies involved with the events and entertainments technology sector.  History  PLASA was originally known as the British Association of Discothèque Equipment Manufacturers (BADEM), a name used between 1976 and 1983. In 2010 PLASA merged with the Entertainment Services and Technology Association. and demerged in 2015. John Simpson, the PLASA Governing Body Chair at the time, said \\"This has been a difficult period for PLASA but it is also an opportunity for us to refocus. PLASA has a chance to reassess its role in this industry, its relationships and communications with its members, and the future directions of its commercial activities.\\" Also during this time PLASA Show was relocated to Earls Court and CEO Matthew Griffiths left his post. Peter Heath took the role of CEO in April of 2016. In the same year PLASA Show move back to the West London venue London Olympia. Since then, PLASA Show has steadily regained popularity with the 2018 edition of the show being the “busiest and most vibrant show in recent history”.https://www.psneurope.com/broadcast/plasa-2018-the-most-vibrant-in- recent-history  Activities  PLASA's activities include lobbying, organising trade show events (including the PLASA Show), publishing both technical and industry news products (such as Lighting & Sound International and Lighting & Sound America), developing industry standards and developing industry certification schemes. PLASA performed lobbying of Ofcom and other British Government entities in the late 2000s when users of radio microphones and similar devices complained that their equipment would be rendered unusable as a result of proposed plans to auction the radio spectrum utilised by many of such devices as part of the digital television switchover. After merging with ESTA, PLASA took on the role of maintaining the industry standards for DMX512 and RDM. PLASA have also been responsible for the development of a UK National Rigging Certificate, which launched in 2007 for individuals working in the entertainments rigging industry. Each year, PLASA hands out PLASA Awards for Innovation and Sustainability Award. The PLASA Awards for Innovation aim to emphasise this focus on true innovation. The procedure ensures that all nominated products are vetted to show that they offer something new to the industry. PLASA has been a part of the European Ecodesign Coalition which includes prominent industry bodies from across Europe. The purpose of the coalition has been to campaign against Ecodesign lighting regulations and propose exemptions for stage lighting. In 2018 PLASA collaborated with Hamish Dumbreck of JESE Ltd, Peter Willis of Howard Eaton Lighting and Wayne Howell of Artistic Licence to present Plugfest, a three-day residential event in Gatwick, UK for lighting technicians and developers to test the interoperability of their products.

Levy (born April 10, 1938) is an educator, museum director, art historian, designer/photographer, and musician. In his current role as President of the Education Division of Cambridge Information Group, Levy is also President of Sotheby's Institute of Art and Chairman of Bach to Rock. He was President and Director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art and Corcoran College of Art and Design in Washington, DC, from 1991 to 2005, and Chancellor of The New School for Social Research in New York City from 1989 to 1991. From 1970 to 1989 Levy was Executive Dean and CEO of Parsons School of Design. He holds a bachelor's degree from Columbia College, Columbia University and a master's degree and PhD from New York University. Early life Born in Brooklyn Heights, to artist parents Edgar LevyEdgar Levy Artfact Archives and Lucille Corcos,Jewish Women's Archive - Jewish Women EncyclopediaSmithsonian Archives of American Art Edgar Levy and Lucille Corcos Papers, 1928-1975 Levy moved at age three with his family to an 18th-century farmhouse on South Mountain Road in Rockland County, New York. “The Road” had been settled by a group of well- known artists, writers, musicians, and actors including John Houseman, Milton Caniff, Maxwell Anderson, Kurt Weill, Lotte Lenya, Hugo Robus,Forum Gallery Hugo Robus [1885-1964] Morris Kantor, and Henry Varnum Poor. Thus, at an early age Levy was immersed in a creative community that also included his parents’ New York friends - his godparents, the sculptors David SmithKaufman, Jason E. \\"Portrait Gallery reveals the art hiding behind our neighbors’ closed doors.\\" Washington Post April 15, 2011. and his wife, Dorothy Dehner, as well as the painters John Graham, Richard Lindner, Arshile Gorky, Vaclav Vytlacil, Mark Rothko (Marcus Rothkowitz), I. Rice Pereira; designers William Golden, Cipe Pineles, Will Burtin; and architect/historian James Marston Fitch. Education Levy had planned on a conservatory education but, influenced by family-friend and neighbor, the philosopher Charles Frankel, he attended Columbia University’s Columbia College where he majored in philosophy with an emphasis on aesthetics and art history. After Columbia, Levy attended New York University’s Institute of Fine Arts and the university’s SENAP division, from which he received a master's degree and a PhD in organizational theory. His doctoral dissertation was an analysis of the failure of Parsons School of Design in the 1960s and of the strategies and history that underlay its merger with The New School for Social Research. Parsons School of Design In 1962, Levy was appointed Director of Admissions at Parsons School of Design, becoming the school’s vice president in 1968. Following the resignation of Parsons’ president in 1969 and the imminent prospect of Parsons’ insolvency, Parsons’ trustees instructed Levy to close the school. Instead, he negotiated a merger with The New School for Social Research. Under Levy's stewardship, over the following two decades Parsons grew from a small, struggling, non- degree-granting trade school into one of the largest and most diversified visual arts colleges in the United States, offering multiple undergraduate and graduate degrees in a diverse range of visual arts disciplines. During Levy's 19-year tenure as its CEO, Parsons became an international college of the arts, with campuses in Los Angeles, France, The Dominican Republic, and Japan. Parson's enrollment grew from 480 in 1970 to 12,000 by the early 1980s, and it became the principal financial support for its parent university, The New School. Levy developed and often wrote curricula for more than 30 new bachelor's and master's degrees as well as for continuing education offerings in every visual arts discipline. He taught Art History at Parsons and SUNY and created special programs for arts education and research in Italy, West Africa, Israel, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and Greece. The Otis Art Institute of Parsons School of Design In 1979, Levy negotiated Parsons’ annexation of The Otis Art Institute of Los Angeles County, renaming it The Otis Art Institute of Parsons School of Design (now Otis College of Art and Design) and creating a bicoastal college of the arts. This was the first (and maybe the only) time in American higher education in which a private educational entity absorbed a public institution. The Otis/Parsons partnership spanned a very successful 12 years; ending when Otis become an independent privately supported college, shortly after Levy's 1991 departure from Parsons and The New School to head Washington, DC's Corcoran Gallery and College of Art. The New School of Jazz and Contemporary Music and Mannes College of Music In 1987, Levy established The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music. He wrote the school's initial curriculum and, with the help of his musical collaborator, saxophonist Arnie Lawrence, recruited a faculty of jazz artists including Sir Roland Hanna, Tommy Flannigan, Chico Hamilton, Jimmy Heath, Donald Byrd, Reggie Workman, and Red Mitchell. Offering New York's first undergraduate degree in jazz, the school has since grown to become internationally recognized as one of the most influential conservatories in its discipline. In 1989, during his tenure as The New School's Chancellor, Levy and his colleagues merged the Mannes College of Music into the university's community of schools. The Corcoran Gallery of Art In January 1991, Levy became President and Director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art and its college of art, the Corcoran College of Art and Design.Lewis, Jo Ann. \\"Mr. Levy's Corcoran; The Director and His New Directions.\\" Washington Post April 24, 1992. The Corcoran is the third oldest museum in the United States and Washington, DC's oldest art institution. Levy took the Corcoran's helm amidst the aftershocks of a national firestorm created in 1989 when the museum cancelled a politically controversial exhibition of photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe. > One of the sparks that ignited the “culture wars” of the early 1990s, the Mapplethorpe incident decimated the Corcoran's constituency of supporters, wrecked its attendance, and seriously threatened its future financial viability. Over his 14-year tenure, Levy rebuilt both the museum and its college of art, mounting more than 300 exhibitions and expanding the museum's 1990 attendance of 80,000 to just under one million by 2004. He increased the Corcoran's assets from $8–22 million, led a capital campaign that raised $110 million, increased its membership by 600 percent, and doubled the college's undergraduate enrollment. He created the school's first master's level graduate programs, acquiring and restoring an historic 19th century Georgetown schoolhouse to house them. Delaware College of Art and Design (DCAD) In 1995-1996, responding to a request by a public/private partnership in Wilmington, Delaware, to create a college of art in the city's downtown center, Levy and Corcoran Dean, Sammy Hoi, developed a strategic plan, helped raise local funds, and formed a partnership between the Corcoran and New York's Pratt Institute, to co-found and manage the Delaware College of Art and Design, a two-year school of art. DCAD also provided an articulated transfer path for students wishing to continue their studies and complete a four-year degree in either Washington, DC, or New York City. The school thrives today and the Corcoran/Pratt partnership continues to exemplify innovation in higher education and the arts. Proposed Frank Gehry Wing of the Corcoran In the first years of the 21st century, architect Frank Gehry was retained to create a new and final wing for the Corcoran museum and college. The resultant design was received with acclaim and $110 million was raised towards its $160 million cost. Following the collapse of the Internet bubble in 2001-2002 and the untimely death in 2004 of the Corcoran's chairman of the board, the Corcoran board underwent a significant change of leadership and abandoned the Gehry project. As a result, Levy resigned as President/Director, subsequently accepting his current post with Cambridge Information Group. Cambridge Information Group (CIG) In 2005, Levy began a consulting relationship with Cambridge Information Group (CIG), and, in 2007, became President of its Education Group and of its graduate school, Sotheby's Institute of Art. At that time, the Institute had campuses in London and New York City. In 2011 Levy created an interdisciplinary degree that combines the study of art business and connoisseurship with hands-on training in interior design grants graduates a master's degree from Sotheby's Institute of Art and an Interior Design Certificate from the New York School of Interior Design. In 2012 Levy established a partnership with Claremont Graduate University in Los Angeles County, creating a third major center for the Institute. Sotheby's Institute of Art enrolls approximately 450 full-time students, primarily in programs leading to master's and PhD degrees. In 2007 Levy, with his wife Carole Feld and partner Jeff Levin, founded Bach to Rock (B2R), a chain of music schools with an innovative curriculum based on the formation of small bands and targeted primarily to young people in grades K–12. Under the management of CIG's Education Group, B2R currently operates six schools in the Washington, DC, region and is franchising nationally, beginning with new centers in the suburbs of New York City, Philadelphia, PA, and Sacramento, CA. Community service and awards Levy was made a Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres by the Republic of France and in 1995 honored by the NYU School of Education with a \\"Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award\\" for his work as an \\"extraordinary arts administrator, art scholar, performing musician, philosopher and aesthetician.\\" The following year (1996) he was named Washingtonian of the Year by Washingtonian Magazine. As a graphic designer, Levy art-directed some 60 publications annually at Parsons School of Design, many of which won design awards and commendations from such organizations as the New York Art Directors Club and the American Institute of Graphic Design (AIGA). He holds honorary degrees from The New School and Cedar Crest College. He has served as a Commissioner of Arts and Humanities for the District of Columbia, as an advisor to the Smithsonian Institution, and as a trustee of the National Foundation for the Advancement of the Arts, the National Association of Schools of Art and Design, and the National Hospice Foundation. He currently serves on the boards of the Alliance for Young Artists and Writers (The Scholastic Art and Writing Awards) and the Larry Rivers Foundation. He is a member of the Century Association (NY) and the Cosmos Club (Washington, D.C.). Personal life Since his late teens, Levy has had a second career as a jazz musician and has played and toured in the United States, Europe, and Asia with some of the leading jazz artists of the 20th century. These have included Jimmy Heath, Chico Hamilton, Junior Mance, Arnie Lawrence, and Donald Byrd. He has also performed with singer Joni Mitchell and with actor/musician George Segal. With his close friend and associate, the artist Larry Rivers, he created The East Thirteenth Street Band, which recorded for both Rizzoli and Atlantic Records, performing throughout the United States in the 1980s and early 1990s. From the 1960s onwards Levy has free-lanced as a photographer and created a photographic body of work on the American industrial landscape that has been exhibited in museums and galleries in the United States and abroad. In 1959 Levy married graphic designer and design historian, Janet Meyer. They have two children, Thomas William and Jessica Anne Levy. Separated in 1982 and later divorced, Levy married Carole L. Feld, then a Vice President at PBS, in 1992. Their son, Alexander Wolf Levy, was born in 1995. Levy and his family live in Washington, D.C.

It has been significantly altered since European settlement in the 1830s, and is the site of a large number of demolished structures. Hutchison summarises the work of Pearson () with comment that Pearson counted 72 structures, most demolished, in the vicinity of Arthur Head. Archaeologist Michael Pearson in his 1984 report identified the following: * 1851 Lighthouse (first) * 1876 Lighthouse (second): in diameter, high; constructed by convicts in 1876–1879; decommissioned in 1902. * 1834 Courthouse (first) * 1840 Courthouse (second) * 1852 Police station complex * Lighthouse keeper quarters * Harbourmaster quarters The structures remaining on the head are the Round House, the oldest remaining building in Western Australia, and the pilots' cottages, all of which are heritage listed.

It was also shown in Melbourne, Australia, on ABV-2 during 1956/1957. The series appears to have entered the public domain, with several episodes viewable on the Internet Archive. Most of these episodes are syndication copies which run about 24 minutes; The original broadcasts had featured a somewhat elaborate opening sequence involving well-dressed people entering a theater, including a sponsor I.D. (as can be seen on the episode The Big Crush), and this elaborate opening sequence was replaced with a very short (for the 1950s) opening sequence for syndicated repeats, resulting in a shorter running time. Premise Robert Beanblossom was a real estate salesman who worked for Willis Thackery at the Thackery Realty Company. Cast *Bob Cummings....Robert Beanblossom *John Litel .....Willis Thackery *Julie Bishop.....Julie Marshall Production Mort Greene was hired to produce the show. He later alleged that Cummings tried to force Greene off the show and bring in his partner, Don Sharpe. Ed Boloin later joined as producer. Cummings helped write and direct some episodes. Over the series' run, the comedy was toned down. Scenes showing smoking blowing out of Cummings' ears during a kiss were eventually dropped after adult viewers claimed the show was tending too much to slapstick. \\"I'm not sure whether it was a good idea\\", said Cummings. \\"The kids loved it and we've had hundreds of letters of protest. And the kids often decide what the set is tuned to, at least until they go to bed.\\" The timeslot later shifted from 8-8.30pm. Cummings reacted angrily to charges the show mistreated animals. Cummings later complained that the lead character was too silly and too much of the writing was bad and illogical. The show was executive produced and part owned by Don Sharpe, who was also connected with I Love Lucy and Terry and the Pirates. When My Hero was released to bad reviews, Sharpe admitted it needed fixing. \\"It's tricky to come up with something every week that's tricky and believable\\", he said. \\"We hope that eventually the personality of Cummings will become so dominant to the viewer that the plots won't look bad.\\" Lawsuit Mort Greene was a producer and writer on the show. Greene later alleged that he was stripped of \\"all authority\\" on the show by Cummings and his wife, yet Cummings held him responsible for the \\"derisive commentary\\" the show received from reviewers. Greene said this hurt his reputation and sued the Cummingses for $119,500. A sheriff tried to serve papers on Cummings concerning the lawsuit at the studio gate for RKO-Pathe in Culver City. He alleged that while he put the papers through the window Cummings drove his car, dragging the sheriff down the street. \\"I thought at the time he was an autograph seeker\\", said Cummings. Both cases later settled out of court. End of the show According to one report, the show \\"enjoyed nothing but popularity. Cummings, who possesses histrionic depth and power far richer and deeper, nonetheless brought to a character implausibly named Beanblossom the full, heartwarming exaultation of the naive and ingenuous youth whom life has not and shall never hurt. The fantasy of the well meaning office worker was heightened from story to story, with characteristics out of a gamut of sources from Don Quixote, Paul Bunyan and Ivanhoe to Lohengrin.\\" Cummings reportedly turned down three film offers while making the show. It had a budget of $30,000 and was selling into syndication at $6,000 a week. Cummings, on the advice of his wife, elected to make no more episodes until they could wait and see what effect the show was having on demand for Cummings as an actor. Cummings was offered $250,000 for his share in the show but he turned it down. The show was repeated in 1954. Cummings later said \\"I was a pretty unhappy lad after the failure\\" of the show. He admitted the failure of the series left him \\"as dead as it was possible to be in this business\\". He blamed this on going to air without a sufficient backlog of scripts. \\"[We] were constantly on a deadline and had to grab at every script that came along, good or bad.\\" He also felt it was a mistake to aim the show at the children's audience. \\"Sure it's easy to develop a following that way but kids are the most fickle audience in the world. Once they drop you, you're finished forever.\\" He rectified both these things for his next, more successful show, The Bob Cummings Show. Cummings added that the show had a long run in syndication. Episodes Reception The Los Angeles Times thought the show would \\"rival I Love Lucy\\" in popularity. The New York Times accused it of being a copy of I Love Lucy and said \\"Cummings brought a magnificent terribleness to his part.\\" The Los Angeles Times later called some golfing scenes between Cummings and Reginald Denny \\"some of the best comedy seen on TV.\\" References External links * *Episode The Big Crush on the Internet Archive Category:NBC original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:Black-and-white American television shows Category:1952 American television series debuts Category:1953 American television series endings Category:1950s American sitcoms ","title":"My Hero (American TV series)"},{"id":"39403266","text":"Keith McLellan (born 14 July 1929) is a former Australian athlete, and rugby union, and rugby league footballer who played in the 1950s.

When he arrived at Leeds there were four other Australians; Arthur Clues, Bob McMaster, Bruce Ryan and Teddy Verrenkamp plus a New Zealander Bert Cook. By 1955 McLellan was the sole Australian at the club. McLellan made his debut for Leeds in the 6-11 defeat by Doncaster on Saturday 19 January 1952, scoring his first try for the club. He subsequently played in 215 games for Leeds in 7 seasons from 1952-58 scoring 217 points. A strong defender, he was a perfect foil for the attacking genius of Lewis Jones with whom he was centre partner for 6 seasons Keith McLellan was captain of Leeds for 3 seasons 1955/56-1957/58. He had his best season in 1956–57 when he captained Leeds to a 9-7 victory over Barrow in the Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 11 May 1957, in front of a crowd of 76,318, becoming only the second Australian to lead a winning team at Wembley (after Harry Bath captained Warrington to victory in 1949–50). His leadership was crucial in Leeds' 16-10 victory over Halifax after being down 0-10 in the 3rd round of the Challenge Cup 9 March 1957, and in scoring a match winning try in Leeds 13-11 victory over Wigan in the first round, 9 February 1957. McLellan played his last game for Leeds against Hunslet 29 September, 1958, before returning to Australia. Honors Keith McLellan won a Challenge Cup Final winners medal in 1956-57 and two Yorkshire County League winners medals during the 1954–55 season and 1956–57 season. He was runner-up to teammate Lewis Jones in the Rugby League Press Writers Player of the Year award in 1956-57. He and Jones were also voted the best centre pairing in the League that year. He won two cap(s) for Combined Nationalities while at Leeds in the 15-19 defeat by France on 3 January 1954, and captained the Rugby League XIII in the 19-8 victory over France on 16 April 1958. He was inducted into the Leeds hall of fame in 2017 along with his centre partner 1952-58, Lewis Jones Non-Playing career Keith McLellan received a Diploma in physical education from Sydney Teachers College in 1949 and a Masters of Education degree from University of Sydney in 1969. He taught at secondary schools in Australia and Yorkshire before becoming a foundation staff member of Wollongong Teachers College (amalgamated with the University of Wollongong 1982) in 1962. He coached their rugby union team 1962-68. He retired as a Senior Lecturer in Education from the University of Wollongong in 1990 and purchased the Terrace Bookshop in Kiama which he ran for 5 years. Genealogical information Keith McLellan married Gwen Maston, the sister of Australian Olympic silver medallist and athletics coach, June Ferguson, on 12 November 1951.

Boel & Zonen, was a shipyard on the river Scheldt in Temse, Belgium, which produced ships from 1829 until 1994. History The Boelwerf was founded in 1829 by Bernard Boel (1798-1872), who had worked as a carpenter at the Antwerpen South shipyards. He was succeeded by his son Jozef Boel. During the first fifty years of its existence, the shipyard built wooden ships and employed a limited number of workers. The company built only one ship a year, mainly tjalks. Starting from 1900, the number of ships built, and with it the number of employees, grew steadily. After World War II, J. Boel & Zonen flourished after breaking through internationally. At the company's 150th birthday, the Zaat, as the shipyard was known in the local dialect, counted 3,000 employees. A considerable part of them were locals from Temse. The anniversary coincided with the construction of a 57,000 m³ LPG carrier with the symbolic construction number 1500: the Petrogas II, which still sails under the Singapore flag and is now called Hariette N. During the same period, the Boelwerf's trade union delegation became a model of strijdsyndicalisme (\\"battle unionism\\") in Belgium. The leaders of this delegation, Jan Cap (ACV) and Karel Heirbaut (ABVV) often got national attention for their actions. On 19 December 1980, J. Boel & Zonen underwent a series of demergers. Several holding and shipping companies, such as the Almabo holding and its gas carrier division Exmar, were sliced off, leaving only the actual shipyard, now called Boelwerf. After Cockerill Yards, a shipyard in Hoboken, across the river Scheldt, had gone bankrupt, the Boelwerf acquired Cockerill's shipyard. Following this merger, the company employed 3,500 workers in two large shipyards. End Due to the international crisis in ship building, the Boelwerf got into financial straits in the mid-1980s and was declared bankrupt on 28 October 1992. The court-appointed receiver, Christian Van Buggenhout, filed a complaint for fraud, which he withdrew consequently. From the mid-1980s until the beginning of the 1990s, the shipyard had been kept afloat by the government, which had offered large shipping loans to the shipyard's potential clients. After the bankruptcy, most of these loans were either remitted or lost. After several strikes and a union occupation, the company was restarted in 1993 under the ownership of the Flemish government holding Gimvindus. The company changed its name to Boelwerf Vlaanderen. This company finished the last seven orders and was declared bankrupt on 30 November 1994. Again, the receiver, Jozef Dauwe, had a lot of trouble cleaning up the mess. On 12 October 2004, the Boelwerf Vlaanderen board members were convicted of fraud with European education funds. Redevelopment In recent years, the former industrial estate, measuring almost 87 ha (215 acres), has been turned into an extension of Temse's town centre. In 1998, the grounds were bought by the development association Nieuw Temse nv, consisting of construction contractor Cordeel from Temse, earthworks contractor Grondwerken Aertssen from Stabroek, and ING Real Estate. Development plans include an industrial area for SMEs and a 30 ha (80 acre) residential area. When construction will be finished, the area will host about 200 houses and 750 flats. In 2010, the municipal administration was concentrated in Administratief Centrum De Zaat, the former Boelwerf headquarters. Famous ships *E.R.

R. (1962). Principles of the self-organizing system.in Principles of Self-Organization: Transactions of the University of Illinois Symposium, H. Von Foerster and G. W. Zopf, Jr. (eds.), Pergamon Press: London, UK, pp. 255–278. It establishes that systems minimise a free energy function of their internal states, which entail beliefs about hidden states in their environment. The implicit minimisation of free energy is formally related to variational Bayesian methods and was originally introduced by Karl Friston as an explanation for embodied perception in neuroscience, where it is also known as active inference. The free energy principle explains the existence of a given system by modeling it through a Markov blanket that tries to minimize the difference between their model of the world and their sense and associated perception. This difference can be described as \\"surprise\\" and is minimized by continuous correction of the world model of the system. As such, the principle is based on the Bayesian idea of the brain as an “inference engine”. Friston added a second route to minimization: action. By actively changing the world into the expected state, systems can also minimize the free energy of the system. Friston assumes this to be the principle of all biological reaction.Shaun Raviv: The Genius Neuroscientist Who Might Hold the Key to True AI. In: Wired, 13. November 2018 Friston also believes his principle applies to mental disorders as well as to artificial intelligence. AI implementations based on the active inference principle have shown advantages over other methods. The free energy principle has been criticized for being very difficult to understand, even for experts. Discussions of the principle have also been criticized as invoking metaphysical assumptions far removed from a testable scientific prediction, making the principle unfalsifiable. In a 2018 interview, Friston acknowledged that the free energy principle is not properly falsifiable: \\"the free energy principle is what it is — a principle. Like Hamilton’s Principle of Stationary Action, it cannot be falsified. It cannot be disproven. In fact, there’s not much you can do with it, unless you ask whether measurable systems conform to the principle.\\"  Background  The notion that self-organising biological systems – like a cell or brain – can be understood as minimising variational free energy is based upon Helmholtz’s work on unconscious inferenceHelmholtz, H. (1866/1962). Concerning the perceptions in general. In Treatise on physiological optics (J. Southall, Trans., 3rd ed., Vol. III). New York: Dover. and subsequent treatments in psychology and machine learning. Variational free energy is a function of observations and a probability density over their hidden causes. This variational density is defined in relation to a probabilistic model that generates predicted observations from hypothesized causes. In this setting, free energy provides an approximation to Bayesian model evidence.Beal, M. J. (2003). Variational Algorithms for Approximate Bayesian Inference. Ph.D. Thesis, University College London. Therefore, its minimisation can be seen as a Bayesian inference process. When a system actively makes observations to minimise free energy, it implicitly performs active inference and maximises the evidence for its model of the world. However, free energy is also an upper bound on the self-information of outcomes, where the long-term average of surprise is entropy. This means that if a system acts to minimise free energy, it will implicitly place an upper bound on the entropy of the outcomes – or sensory states – it samples.  Relationship to other theories  Active inference is closely related to the good regulator theoremConant, R. C., & Ashby, R. W. (1970). Every Good Regulator of a system must be a model of that system. Int. J. Systems Sci. , 1 (2), 89–97. and related accounts of self-organisation,Kauffman, S. (1993). The Origins of Order: Self-Organization and Selection in Evolution.

Non-equilibrium phase transition and self-organisation in physics, chemistry and biology (3rd ed.). Berlin: Springer Verlag. and embodied cognition. Because free energy can be expressed as the expected energy of observations under the variational density minus its entropy, it is also related to the maximum entropy principle.Jaynes, E. T. (1957). Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics. Physical Review Series II, 106 (4), 620–30. Finally, because the time average of energy is action, the principle of minimum variational free energy is a principle of least action.  Definition  These schematics illustrate the partition of states into internal and hidden or external states that are separated by a Markov blanket – comprising sensory and active states. The lower panel shows this partition as it would be applied to action and perception in the brain; where active and internal states minimise a free energy functional of sensory states. The ensuing self-organisation of internal states then correspond perception, while action couples brain states back to external states. The upper panel shows exactly the same dependencies but rearranged so that the internal states are associated with the intracellular states of a cell, while the sensory states become the surface states of the cell membrane overlying active states (e.g., the actin filaments of the cytoskeleton). Definition (continuous formulation): Active inference rests on the tuple (\\\\Omega,\\\\Psi,S,A,R,q,p), * A sample space \\\\Omega – from which random fluctuations \\\\omega \\\\in \\\\Omega are drawn * Hidden or external states \\\\Psi:\\\\Psi\\\\times A \\\\times \\\\Omega \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} – that cause sensory states and depend on action * Sensory states S:\\\\Psi \\\\times A \\\\times \\\\Omega \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} – a probabilistic mapping from action and hidden states * Action A:S\\\\times R \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} – that depends on sensory and internal states * Internal states R:R\\\\times S \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} – that cause action and depend on sensory states * Generative density p(s, \\\\psi \\\\mid m) – over sensory and hidden states under a generative model m * Variational density q(\\\\psi \\\\mid \\\\mu) – over hidden states \\\\psi \\\\in \\\\Psi that is parameterised by internal states \\\\mu \\\\in R  Action and perception  The objective is to maximise model evidence p(s\\\\mid m) or minimise surprise -\\\\log p(s\\\\mid m). This generally involves an intractable marginalisation over hidden states, so surprise is replaced with an upper variational free energy bound. However, this means that internal states must also minimise free energy, because free energy is a function of sensory and internal states: : a(t) = \\\\underset{a}{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,min}} \\\\\\\\{ F(s(t),\\\\mu(t)) \\\\\\\\} : \\\\mu(t) = \\\\underset{\\\\mu}{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,min}} \\\\\\\\{ F(s(t),\\\\mu)) \\\\\\\\} : \\\\underset{\\\\mathrm{free-energy}} {\\\\underbrace{F(s,\\\\mu)}} = \\\\underset{\\\\mathrm{energy}} {\\\\underbrace{ E_q[-\\\\log p(s,\\\\psi \\\\mid m)]}} - \\\\underset{\\\\mathrm{entropy}} {\\\\underbrace{ H[q(\\\\psi \\\\mid \\\\mu)]}} = \\\\underset{\\\\mathrm{surprise}} {\\\\underbrace{ -\\\\log p(s \\\\mid m)}} + \\\\underset{\\\\mathrm{divergence}} {\\\\underbrace{ D_{\\\\mathrm{KL}}[q(\\\\psi \\\\mid \\\\mu) \\\\parallel p(\\\\psi \\\\mid s,m)]}} \\\\geq \\\\underset{\\\\mathrm{surprise}} {\\\\underbrace{ -\\\\log p(s \\\\mid m)}} This induces a dual minimisation with respect to action and internal states that correspond to action and perception respectively.  Free energy minimisation   Free energy minimisation and self-organisation  Free energy minimisation has been proposed as a hallmark of self- organising systems when cast as random dynamical systems.Crauel, H., & Flandoli, F. (1994). Attractors for random dynamical systems. Probab Theory Relat Fields, 100, 365–393. This formulation rests on a Markov blanket (comprising action and sensory states) that separates internal and external states. If internal states and action minimise free energy, then they place an upper bound on the entropy of sensory states : \\\\lim_{T\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\underset{\\\\text{free-action}} {\\\\underbrace{\\\\int_0^T F(s(t),\\\\mu (t))\\\\,dt}} \\\\ge \\\\lim_{T\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{T} \\\\int_0^T \\\\underset{\\\\text{surprise}}{\\\\underbrace{-\\\\log p(s(t)\\\\mid m)}} \\\\, dt = H[p(s\\\\mid m)] This is because – under ergodic assumptions – the long-term average of surprise is entropy. This bound resists a natural tendency to disorder – of the sort associated with the second law of thermodynamics and the fluctuation theorem.  Free energy minimisation and Bayesian inference  All Bayesian inference can be cast in terms of free energy minimisation; e.g.,.Roweis, S., & Ghahramani, Z. (1999). A unifying review of linear Gaussian models. Neural Computat. , 11 (2), 305–45. When free energy is minimised with respect to internal states, the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the variational and posterior density over hidden states is minimised. This corresponds to approximate Bayesian inference – when the form of the variational density is fixed – and exact Bayesian inference otherwise. Free energy minimisation therefore provides a generic description of Bayesian inference and filtering (e.g., Kalman filtering). It is also used in Bayesian model selection, where free energy can be usefully decomposed into complexity and accuracy: : \\\\underset{\\\\text{free-energy}} {\\\\underbrace{ F(s,\\\\mu)}} = \\\\underset{\\\\text{complexity}} {\\\\underbrace{ D_\\\\mathrm{KL}[q(\\\\psi\\\\mid\\\\mu)\\\\parallel p(\\\\psi\\\\mid m)]}} - \\\\underset{\\\\mathrm{accuracy}} {\\\\underbrace{E_q[\\\\log p(s\\\\mid\\\\psi,m)]}} Models with minimum free energy provide an accurate explanation of data, under complexity costs (c.f., Occam's razor and more formal treatments of computational costsOrtega, P. A., & Braun, D. A. (2012). Thermodynamics as a theory of decision-making with information processing costs. Proceedings of the Royal Society A, vol. 469, no. 2153 (20120683) .). Here, complexity is the divergence between the variational density and prior beliefs about hidden states (i.e., the effective degrees of freedom used to explain the data).  Free energy minimisation and thermodynamics  Variational free energy is an information theoretic functional and is distinct from thermodynamic (Helmholtz) free energy.Evans, D. J. (2003). A non-equilibrium free energy theorem for deterministic systems. Molecular Physics , 101, 15551–4. However, the complexity term of variational free energy shares the same fixed point as Helmholtz free energy (under the assumption the system is thermodynamically closed but not isolated). This is because if sensory perturbations are suspended (for a suitably long period of time), complexity is minimised (because accuracy can be neglected). At this point, the system is at equilibrium and internal states minimise Helmholtz free energy, by the principle of minimum energy.Jarzynski, C. (1997). Nonequilibrium equality for free energy differences. Phys. Rev. Lett., 78, 2690.  Free energy minimisation and information theory  Free energy minimisation is equivalent to maximising the mutual information between sensory states and internal states that parameterise the variational density (for a fixed entropy variational density). This relates free energy minimization to the principle of minimum redundancyBarlow, H. (1961). Possible principles underlying the transformations of sensory messages . In W. Rosenblith (Ed.), Sensory Communication (pp. 217-34). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. and related treatments using information theory to describe optimal behaviour.Linsker, R. (1990).

Predictability, complexity, and learning. Neural Computat., 13 (11), 2409–63.  Free energy minimisation in neuroscience  Free energy minimisation provides a useful way to formulate normative (Bayes optimal) models of neuronal inference and learning under uncertaintyFriston, K. (2010). The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory? Nat Rev Neurosci. , 11 (2), 127–38. and therefore subscribes to the Bayesian brain hypothesis.Knill, D. C., & Pouget, A. (2004). The Bayesian brain: the role of uncertainty in neural coding and computation. Trends Neurosci. , 27 (12), 712–9. The neuronal processes described by free energy minimisation depend on the nature of hidden states: \\\\Psi = X \\\\times \\\\Theta \\\\times \\\\Pi that can comprise time-dependent variables, time-invariant parameters and the precision (inverse variance or temperature) of random fluctuations. Minimising variables, parameters, and precision correspond to inference, learning, and the encoding of uncertainty, respectively.  Perceptual inference and categorisation  Free energy minimisation formalises the notion of unconscious inference in perception and provides a normative (Bayesian) theory of neuronal processing. The associated process theory of neuronal dynamics is based on minimising free energy through gradient descent. This corresponds to generalised Bayesian filtering (where ~ denotes a variable in generalised coordinates of motion and D is a derivative matrix operator):Friston, K., Stephan, K., Li, B., & Daunizeau, J. (2010). Generalised Filtering. Mathematical Problems in Engineering, vol., 2010, 621670 : \\\\dot{\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}} = D \\\\tilde{\\\\mu} - \\\\partial_{\\\\mu}F(s,\\\\mu)\\\\Big_{\\\\mu = \\\\tilde{\\\\mu}} Usually, the generative models that define free energy are non-linear and hierarchical (like cortical hierarchies in the brain). Special cases of generalised filtering include Kalman filtering, which is formally equivalent to predictive codingRao, R. P., & Ballard, D. H. (1999). Predictive coding in the visual cortex: a functional interpretation of some extra-classical receptive-field effects. Nat Neurosci. , 2 (1), 79–87. – a popular metaphor for message passing in the brain. Under hierarchical models, predictive coding involves the recurrent exchange of ascending (bottom-up) prediction errors and descending (top-down) predictionsMumford, D. (1992).

Predictions not commands: active inference in the motor system. Brain Struct Funct. , 218 (3), 611–43  Perceptual learning and memory  In predictive coding, optimising model parameters through a gradient ascent on the time integral of free energy (free action) reduces to associative or Hebbian plasticity and is associated with synaptic plasticity in the brain.  Perceptual precision, attention and salience  Optimizing the precision parameters corresponds to optimizing the gain of prediction errors (c.f., Kalman gain). In neuronally plausible implementations of predictive coding, this corresponds to optimizing the excitability of superficial pyramidal cells and has been interpreted in terms of attentional gain.Feldman, H., & Friston, K. J. (2010). Attention, uncertainty, and free-energy. Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, 4, 215. Simulation of the results achieved from a selective attention task carried out by the Bayesian reformulation of the SAIM entitled PE-SAIM in multiple objects environment. The graphs show the time course of the activation for the FOA and the two template units in the Knowledge Network. Concerning the top-down vs bottom-up controversy that has been addressed as a major open problem of attention, a computational model has succeeded in illustrating the circulatory nature of reciprocation between top-down and bottom-up mechanisms. Using an established emergent model of attention, namely, SAIM, the authors suggested a model called PE-SAIM that in contrast to the standard version approaches the selective attention from a top-down stance. The model takes into account the forwarding prediction errors sent to the same level or a level above to minimize the energy function indicating the difference between data and its cause or in other words between the generative model and posterior. To enhance validity, they also incorporated the neural competition between the stimuli in their model. A notable feature of this model is the reformulation of the free energy function only in terms of prediction errors during the task performance. \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial E^{total}(Y^{VP},X^{SN},x^{CN},y^{KN})}{\\\\partial y^{SN}_{mn}}=x^{CN}_{mn}-b^{CN}\\\\varepsilon^{CN}_{nm}+b^{CN}\\\\sum_{k}(\\\\varepsilon^{KN}_{knm}) where, E^{total} is the total energy function of the neural networks entail, and \\\\varepsilon^{KN}_{knm} is the prediction error between the generative model (prior) and posterior changing over time.Abadi K.A., Yahya K., Amini M., Heinke D. & Friston, K. J. (2019). Excitatory versus inhibitory feedback in Bayesian formulations of scene construction. 16 R. Soc. Interface) Comparing the two models reveals a notable similarity between their results while pointing out to a remarkable discrepancy, in that, in the standard version of the SAIM, the model's focus is mainly upon the excitatory connections whereas in the PE-SAIM the inhibitory connections will be leveraged to make an inference. The model has also proved to be fit to predict the EEG and fMRI data drawn from human experiments with a high precision.  Active inference  When gradient descent is applied to action \\\\dot{a} = -\\\\partial_aF(s,\\\\tilde{\\\\mu}) , motor control can be understood in terms of classical reflex arcs that are engaged by descending (corticospinal) predictions. This provides a formalism that generalizes the equilibrium point solution – to the degrees of freedom problemFeldman, A. G., & Levin, M. F. (1995). The origin and use of positional frames of reference in motor control. Behav Brain Sci. , 18, 723–806. – to movement trajectories.  Active inference and optimal control  Active inference is related to optimal control by replacing value or cost-to-go functions with prior beliefs about state transitions or flow.Friston, K., (2011). What is optimal about motor control?. Neuron, 72(3), 488–98. This exploits the close connection between Bayesian filtering and the solution to the Bellman equation. However, active inference starts with (priors over) flow f = \\\\Gamma \\\\cdot abla V + abla \\\\times W that are specified with scalar V(x) and vector W(x) value functions of state space (c.f., the Helmholtz decomposition). Here, \\\\Gamma is the amplitude of random fluctuations and cost is c(x) = f \\\\cdot abla V + abla \\\\cdot \\\\Gamma \\\\cdot V. The priors over flow p(\\\\tilde{x}\\\\mid m) induce a prior over states p(x\\\\mid m) = \\\\exp (V(x)) that is the solution to the appropriate forward Kolmogorov equations.Friston, K., & Ao, P. (2012). Free- energy, value and attractors. Computational and mathematical methods in medicine, 2012, 937860. In contrast, optimal control optimises the flow, given a cost function, under the assumption that W = 0 (i.e., the flow is curl free or has detailed balance). Usually, this entails solving backward Kolmogorov equations.Kappen, H., (2005). Path integrals and symmetry breaking for optimal control theory. Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment, 11, p. P11011.  Active inference and optimal decision (game) theory  Optimal decision problems (usually formulated as partially observable Markov decision processes) are treated within active inference by absorbing utility functions into prior beliefs. In this setting, states that have a high utility (low cost) are states an agent expects to occupy. By equipping the generative model with hidden states that model control, policies (control sequences) that minimise variational free energy lead to high utility states.Friston, K., Samothrakis, S. & Montague, R., (2012). Active inference and agency: optimal control without cost functions. Biol. Cybernetics, 106(8–9), 523–41. Neurobiologically, neuromodulators like dopamine are considered to report the precision of prediction errors by modulating the gain of principal cells encoding prediction error.Friston, K. J.

Moston Park Bowling Green at St George's Square, site of the former Moston Park Moston Park was a late 19th- century sports and recreation ground situated off Mough Lane and Owler Lane. St Georges's Square now stands in this area. It was owned by a James Taylor and was used for horse racing, dog racing, wrestling, rabbit coursing and other events and was popular with Manchester residents due to its close proximity to Moston railway station. A hotel and occasional public house, The Railway Hotel, served the park. The hotel was located on the corner of Owler Lane and what is now Hollinwood Avenue. The park and hotel were not universally popular in the district. In 1878, when opposing the application for a beer licence for The Railway Hotel, the rector of Moston, the Rev Thomas Wostencroft, stated that 'Frequenters of Moston Park were a rough lot and it was not fit for any female or even for respectable men to travel in third class carriages on the railway from Moston when there was anything special going on at the grounds kept by Mr Taylor.

A growing population and new post war housing around Whitegate End saw the need for a daughter church to be planted there, on the site of what had come to be known as the 'hut'. The foundation stone for St George's was laid on Whit Sunday 9 June 1957, and opened on 27 April 1958 by the Bishop of Middleton. St George's became Chadderton's newest parish in October 2014. The church was consecrated by Mark Davies, Bishop of Middleton, 57 years after the foundation stone was laid. The M60 split the parish, and St George's took on greater significance, eventually superseding its closed parent church which was subsequently demolished in May 2017.http://www.oldham- chronicle.co.uk/news-features/99/chadderton-extra/88555/by-george-church-is- newest-parish- after-57-yearshttp://www.emmanuelwithstgeorges.org.uk/aboutus.htm Boundary dispute Throughout the Tudor period from the time of Henry VII to the close of Elizabeth's reign, a violent dispute was waged locally between the manorial lords of Chadderton, Foxdenton and Werneth on one hand and the incumbent of Nuthurst Manor (Moston) on the other. It all concerned the rights of pasturage on the open moors. The dispute first emerged with Edmund Chadderton, who held Little Nuthust Hall, claiming exclusive grazing rights on the unenclosed moorland (Theale Moor) which divided his manor from Chadderton and Hollinwood. The feud was handed down from generation to generation. In 1526, Nuthurst bailiffs chased the Chadderton livestock off the moors. Retaliation from Chadderton soon followed with 200 armed farmers and labourers descending across Theale Moor where they were met by the Nuthurst men and bailiffs. A miniature battle ensued and the quarrel became more violent as time went on. The feud was only finally resolved at the end of the sixteenth century when boundary stakes were set up on the common moors.P28 Chadderton Chapters (1972), Lawson M, http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/10662238/In_the_Labyrinth_John_Dee_and_Reformation_Manchester.pdf Notable people Samuel Collins (1802–1878) was a 19th-century poet and radical.

See also This station is not to be confused with Langwith-Whaley Thorns which is about half a mile to the north on the same line. Nor is it to be confused with Shirebrook North which was a good mile away in Langwith Junction on a different line altogether. The site in \\"External Links\\", below, contains wonderful photos of Langwith, but nevertheless confuses matters by using the heading \\"Langwith Junction.\\" The best way to get a handle on the Langwiths is to realise that Langwith is not a place, but an area which includes several settlements, notably Langwith Bassett, Upper Langwith, Nether Langwith, Langwith Maltings and Langwith Junction. The first three are long-established and predominantly rural. Langwith Junction is a product of the railway age which adapted the local naming convention, Langwith Maltings is not a formally defined community, but sees itself as a distinct entity. Whaley Thorns was a product of the coal age, but only locals know where Nether Langwith ends and Whaley Thorns begins. Context The station was built by the Midland Railway on its Nottingham Midland to Worksop line. The station was designed by the Midland Railway company architect John Holloway Sanders. The line and station were closed to passengers in 1964. The line was reopened in 1998 as the Robin Hood Line but the station was not reopened, the community being better served by a wholly new structure half a mile to the North, called Langwith-Whaley Thorns. In Henry Priestley's wonderfully evocative 1962 photograph of Langwith station the colliery winding gear visible in the distance marks the approximate site of Langwith-Whaley Thorns station. History The station was opened with some bunting, flags and ceremony on 1 June 1875. It initially provided a service of six trains each way, three between Mansfield and Worksop and three between Mansfield and Sheffield Victoria. The line was and remains double track. The station had two opposite platforms and a stone station building very similar to those at Shirebrook West, Elmton & Creswell and Whitwell. The original Whitwell station has been dismantled and meticulously rebuilt at the Midland Railway Centre, the new Robin Hood line Whitwell station is a new building on the original site. The last day of service was 10 October 1964, closure having been delayed for a week to serve the annual Nottingham Goose Fair.

Accessed via ancestry.com paid subscription site, 8 July 2020. he was eldest son of Peter King, 6th Baron King, by Charlotte, daughter of Edward Tredcroft of Horsham. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, and succeeded to the title in 1793. After a short tour on the continent he returned to England on coming of age, and took his seat in the House of Lords. Following the Whig traditions of his family, King acted with Lord Holland, whose motion for an inquiry into the causes of the failure of the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland he supported in his maiden speech, 12 February 1800. His habits, however, were somewhat reclusive. Except to oppose a Habeas Corpus Suspension Bill, or a bill to prolong the suspension of cash payments by the Banks of England and Ireland, begun in 1797, he at first rarely intervened in debate. King, in 1811, gave his leasehold tenantry notice that he could no longer accept notes in payment of rent, except at a discount varying according to the date of the lease. Ministers, alarmed that his example might be followed widely, quickly introduced a measure making notes of the Banks of England and Ireland payable on demand legal tender in payment of rent out of court, and prohibiting the acceptance or payment of more than 21 shillings for a guinea. King opposed the bill, and justified his own conduct in a speech later published in pamphlet form; but it passed into law, and was followed in 1812 by a measure making the notes legal tender in all cases. King's political career was cut short by his sudden death on 4 June 1833. Views King was an early opponent of the Corn Laws, which he denounced as a \\"job of jobs\\". He supported Catholic emancipation and the commutation of tithes, and opposed grants in aid of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, pluralities and clerical abuses. He was suspected of a leaning to presbyterianism, with attacks on him made as Hierarchia versus Anarchiam (1831) by Antischismaticus and A Letter to Lord King controverting the sentiments lately delivered in Parliament by his Lordship, Mr. O'Connell, and Mr. Sheil, as to the fourfold division of Tithes (1832) by James Thomas Law. Works On the currency question King published a pamphlet Thoughts on the Restriction of Payments in Specie at the Banks of England and Ireland, London, 1803, which went to a second edition. Enlarged, it was reissued as Thoughts on the Effects of the Bank Restrictions, 1804, and was reprinted in A Selection from King's speeches and writings, edited by Earl Fortescue, London, 1844. In this tract King argued that the suspension had caused an excessive issue of notes, particularly by the Bank of Ireland, and a consequent depreciation of the paper and appreciation of bullion; and advocated a gradual return to the system of specie payment. It was reviewed by Francis Horner in the Edinburgh Review, and attracted attention, but without any practical result. King published also: * A pamphlet On the Conduct of the British Government towards the Catholics of Ireland, 1807. * Speech in the House of Lords on the second reading of Earl Stanhope's Bill respecting Guineas and Bank Notes. * The Life of John Locke, with extracts from his Correspondence, Journals, and Commonplace Books, London, 1829; new edition 1830, 2 vols.; in Bohn's Standard Library, London, 1858. *A Short History of the Job of Jobs, written in 1825, first published as an anti-cornlaw pamphlet, London, 1846.

His best friend in the Coast Guard, Lieutenant Thomas \\"Speed\\" Bradshaw (Randolph Scott), is a highly regarded, but reckless pilot. In a daring rescue at sea, both men are involved in saving Tobias Bliss (Walter Connolly), the captain of a tramp steamer. At the base hospital, the two officers visit the rescued man and meet Nancy (Frances Dee), his granddaughter. Both friends fall in love with her, but Speed proposes first; broken-hearted, Ray still acts as the best man at the wedding. The marriage falters, and when Nancy is fed up with many lonely nights alone, she leaves Speed. In trying to win her back, Speed crashes while stunting over her house. Grounded and facing a court-martial, the disgraced pilot finds out that his best friend is missing while on an Arctic rescue mission. Nancy coaxes Speed and his co-pilot, O'Hara (Warren Hymer), to attempt a rescue, and after a harrowing crash-landing in the Arctic, an injured Ray is located. Speed manages a dangerous takeoff and flies his friend back home, to find a relieved Nancy waiting for him. Cast As credited, with screen roles identified:\\"Cast: Coast Guard (1939)\\". IMDb.

It is a retail operation that features a large selection of natural science curiosities, taxidermy, numerous varieties of carnivorous plants, succulents, bonsai as well as gardening tools, and vintage architectural elements, which Quigley has described as \\"a natural history museum merged with a home products store and quirky gardening shop.\\" The store's inventory emphasizes ephemera associated with the natural sciences, both of the animal and plant variety, taxidermy, mounted insects, assorted neo-Victoriana, oddities, and products associated with the steampunk movement. In 1999 the operation relocated from its original San Francisco Stevenson Street location to Valencia Street to the city's Mission District in order to accommodate its growing collections of vintage trophy mount taxidermy as well as fossils and minerals. The store freights a Victorian gentleman/inventor/botanist/biologist aesthetic that Time Out London once described as “Martha Stewart Meets David Lynch.” Quigley opened Paxton Gate's Curiosities for Kids in 2008 and licensed a second operation, Paxton Gate Portland, to owners Andy and Susan Brown of Portland, Oregon. The Portland store achieved a certain amount of television fame when it was featured as \\"The Knot Store\\" in an episode of the second season of the popular IFC television series Portlandia, created by Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein, guest starring Jeff Goldblum. Later, Armisen included Paxton Gate Portland in a travel piece he authored for the UK-based Guardian Newspaper in May 2013. Arimsen would later bring actor Jerry Seinfeld to the store for an episode of Comedians in Cars with Coffee.

RareField  RareField is Paxton Gate's Design/Build arm. Formerly known as Paxton Gate Design/Build, its original focus was on landscape for residential projects unrelated to the aesthetic of the store itself. This eventually led to designing and building the interiors of several noted San Francisco eating destinations including the restaurants Flour + Water and Central Kitchen and the French bakery Le Marais. Originally known as Paxton Gate Design/Build, the name was changed to RareField in 2015. RareField is located in the Paxton Gate Offices on the third floor of 766 Valencia Street, SF, CA 94110  Paxton Gate’s Curiosities for Kids  In December 2008, Paxton Gate's Curiosities for Kids, opened. The 1,500 square foot space featured a life size tree built from wood and vines, vintage Structo fire trucks and books including Roald Dahl's Revolting Recipes and Freaky Flora, Curiosities for Kids was designed for children and their parents with games, toys, puzzles, classic books including Curious George, The Little Red Hen, Where the Side Walks Ends, as well as science kits and other inventory such as Silly Putty, Whoopee Cushions and Sock Monkeys that would be familiar to parents from their own childhoods, but uncommon in today's toy marketplace, with its emphasis on electronics. In a nod to the original store's reputation for taxidermy, Curiosities also features taxidermy made from papier-mâché, a line of mounted plush animal heads and workshops and other events including insect pinning, mask-making, demonstrations and birthday parties.

Biography Goemans was born on 6 June 1925 in Amsterdam. The son of a diplomat, his father forced him to write under a pseudonym to avoid any association between the family and the popular entertainment industry. Under the name Peter Shott he wrote, in 1949, the song \\"Aan de Amsterdamse grachten\\"; Goemans was inspired to write the song in 1949 while walking across the bridge where the Prinsengracht and the Leidsegracht intersect. It wasn't supplied with sheet music and recorded until 1956, when an arrangement was written by pianist Dick Schallies (then a member of the Metropole Orkest) since (Schallies explained) Goemans couldn't write music. Henk Visscher, singer as well as guitar and bass player with Johnny Kraaijkamp, was the first to sing and record the song, In the 1960s Goemans was one of the regular lyricists for Corry Brokken, translating foreign material. One of his tunes, \\"Bach bijvoorbeeld\\", was sung by Shirley Zwerus and produced by Willem Duys used as the opening tune for his weekly radio program. In 1970, Hearts of Soul won the Nationaal Songfestival with the Goemans song \\"Waterman\\"; the song finished seventh at the Eurovision Song Contest 1970. Goemans died on 8 July 2000.

He corresponded with botanists at Harvard, notably James Franklin Collins, Michael Shuck Bebb, Merritt Lyndon Fernald, Walter Deane and others. He has a willow hybrid named for him, Salix x glatfelteri.http://eol.org/pages/585059/overview In 1899, he was awarded the scientific medal, 2nd class, by the Academie Internationale de Geographie Botanique, for his work on willows.Bulletin de la Academie de Geographie Botanique, no. 117-188, September, 1899 In the late 1890s, his interests turned from botany to mycology, having gained interest in mushrooms through the membership of his daughter Lisbeth in the Boston Mycological Club, which was the first mushroom club organized in the United States. His primary correspondents were Curtis Gates Lloyd and Charles Horton Peck, and he met George F. Atkinson in 1903 at the St. Louis World's Fair. His collection of edible and poisonous mushrooms was part of the display of the Missouri Botanical Garden at the Fair.Sixteenth Annual Report of the Director, William Trelease, Missouri Botanical Garden Annual Report , Vol. 1905, (1905), pp. Page 29-30: \\"Some time before the opening of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, the authorities of Mill Hill School, near London,-- at which Henry Shaw was entered as a pupil on March 25, 1815, as I learn from Professor J.

She is the wife of the musician the Edge from the rock group U2. Raised in Los Angeles and schooled in modern dance, Steinberg became a formative member of the dancer-illusionist company MOMIX in 1983. They became known for their visual humour and contorted positions. In 1986, she co-founded the ISO dance company, which embodied an approach they called \\"serious fun\\" and sometimes collaborated with a singing group, and gave performances around the country and abroad. In both companies she did choreography as well as dancing. She staged her own experimental dance solo production and did choreographic work for films and music videos. Starting in the mid-1990s, she branched out into lighting design and film directing as well, with dance usually being the subject matter. She has continued with various projects into the 2010s, often collaborating with the Japanese choreographer and dancer Oguri. Together they are co-founders of the production company Arcane Collective. Steinberg first became involved with U2 when she appeared in the 1987 music video for \\"With or Without You\\". She was then hired as a choreographer, and subsequently as a belly dancer for the song \\"Mysterious Ways\\", during their 1992–1993 Zoo TV Tour. By the end of the tour she was in a relationship with the Edge. The couple has two children together, married in 2002, and live at residences in Ireland, France, and the United States.  Early life and education  Steinberg was born and raised in Los Angeles under affluent circumstances.Jobling, U2, p. 242. Her father, Robert, is a lawyer in Los Angeles. Her mother, a successful interior designer, came from a film industry heritage and grew up on the Universal Studios lot. She has two sisters, Roxanne, older and Eliza, younger. Her family is Jewish. Morleigh was tutored in modern dance and her instructors included Bella Lewitzky. Steinberg attended Beverly Hills High School\\" where she was part of its Advanced Dance Group which gave modern dance performances. At age 16, she spent time at the Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan and when 17, left with her sister for a year of dancing in Paris. She also attended Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, for two weeks. She later said that her training in dance had \\"stressed relationships to objects and to poems.\\"  Early career and work with U2  In 1983, on her way back from Paris, Steinberg began dancing in the studio of Moses Pendleton, who had founded the modern dance company Pilobolus. She had been attracted to Pilobolus growing up: \\"I was taller than most girls my age, and I thought that was a company I could be with because the women were always lifting the men.\\" There she joined up with Daniel Ezralow, Jamey Hampton, and Ashley Roland, and the four created the Connecticut-based, dancer-illusionist company MOMIX. From 1983 to 1986, Steinberg toured nationally with MOMIX. The group became known for their visual humour, contorted positions, and Trompe-l'œil effects. However, the dancers felt financially insecure, because Pendleton owned the MOMIX name, and also felt artistically stagnant. The four split from MOMIX in 1986 and founded the ISO (\\"I'm So Optimistic\\") dance company. With ISO, they set their acro dance moves against the new-wave a cappella singing of The Bobs in combined performances. The dancers labelled their new approach as \\"serious fun\\". Steinberg's first association with U2 came in February 1987.McGee, U2: A Diary, p. 100. The group's lead singer, Bono, was a fan of ISO and she was cast for the music video of their hit \\"With or Without You\\". In it, director Matt Mahurin portrayed Steinberg in an abstract style, swirling in various positions in shots interposed with the band performing. During a Los Angeles stop on the band's subsequent Joshua Tree Tour, Steinberg met The Edge (actual name Dave Evans) in person for the first time during a party at her house. He came and had a conversation with her and her sister. Steinberg did choreographic work for two feature films, Earth Girls Are Easy (1988) and Wild Orchid (1990). She did the choreography for Paula Abdul's 1991–1992 Under My Spell Tour. She additionally did concert or music video choreographic work for David Bowie, Rod Stewart, Sting, and Lenny Kravitz. She also ran her own dance school. By 1990, ISO was performing not just in the US but also abroad. The troupe was regularly reviewed by The New York Times. A 1988 review said that, \\"Unfortunately, many of [the troupe's] effects looked too self-consciously clever.\\" A 1990 review concluded that, \\"It is easy to be optimistic about ISO; its shows are goofy fun. But the apparently casual silliness derives from great theatrical shrewdness.\\" A 1991 review said that, \\"The evening got off to a good, punchy start, then dwindled irretrievably into sophomoric hijinks.\\" A 1993 review stated that, \\"Iso is after laughs and it gets them. But its targets are threadbare just when dance could use some sharp satirists.\\" In one 1990 performance, Steinberg used elastic bands to playfully reshape her arms and legs as noodles, then flew from wires like an angel. By 1992, Steinberg was living in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles. She sometimes toured with the informal company Daniel Ezralow and Friends. A St. Louis Post- Dispatch review of one such show in 1994 described Steinberg's role as that of \\"a gorgeous, aloof woman in a red dress\\". She also performed a solo work, the 1992 experimental show called XRAYD at the La Boca performance space in Los Angeles, which featured original music from Brian Eno and Paul Chavez. The work featured her in a variety of strange poses and settings cued by video and lighting effects. The Los Angeles Times said her composition represented \\"a descent into autism, achieved with frightening integrity. Everything she reveals is without self, the be-all and end-all of madness.\\" Steinberg the belly dancer (left), as seen on the Zoo TV Tour After meeting U2 in 1987, Steinberg stayed in touch with Bono and when the group was putting the Zoo TV Tour together in 1992, the lead singer thought it would be good to have a choreographer to critique his moves on stage. Steinberg worked during the tour's pre-production to show the group how to communicate their ideas all the way to the last rows of a venue.McCormick, U2 by U2, pp. 297–298.Flanagan, U2 at the End of the World, p. 139. Recognizing Bono was not a dancer, she focused on movements he could do, and sought to help him pace himself and not get lost visually in the show's enormous stage set. The group's hit \\"Mysterious Ways\\" had featured a belly dancer in its music video, and the group decided to incorporate one in their on-stage performance of the song. The original dancer left when the tour moved to its outdoor stadium legs. According to Steinberg, having a belly dancer on the tour originated as \\"a bit of a joke\\". Steinberg began by training the dancer, and when that dancer left the tour, a replacement was needed. Bono asked Steinberg if she would like to take over and she agreed, although she had never belly danced before and by her own description did not have the voluptuous body usually associated with the form. In the role of belly dancer, Steinberg engaged in dramatic interaction with Bono, especially upon entrance and exit from the stage.Beeaff, A Grand Madness, pp. 141, 148. At times Bono would sing to the belly dancer's image on the giant video screens around the stage.Beeaff, A Grand Madness, p. 154. During the tour, Steinberg changed the colours of her outfit to match certain occasions, such as wearing orange and black around Halloween.Beeaff, A Grand Madness, pp. 94, 97, 141. Steinberg was originally reluctant to put her own activities on hold to continue on to the \\"Zooropa\\" leg of the tour, but eventually agreed.Flanagan, U2 at the End of the World, pp. 139, 250. Unlike others in the tour entourage, Steinberg exhibited a professional independence from the group and did not wait on their whims.Flanagan, U2 at the End of the World, p. 256. In 1993, while still on tour, Steinberg appeared in U2's Kevin Godley-directed music video for their single \\"Numb\\", first with her feet as part of the video's assault on The Edge and then with her back as she belly danced.Flanagan, U2 at the End of the World, pp. 257–259.  Marriage and family  The Edge had been married to his first wife Aislinn since 1983.Kootnikoff, U2, p. xviii. They had three children together, but had separated in March 1991.Kootnikoff, U2, p. xxii. Morleigh and The Edge developed a friendship during the Zoo TV Tour, and by August–September 1993, towards the tour's end, it was clear to observers and the couple themselves that the friendship developed into a relationship, and Steinberg broke up with her boyfriend of the time.Flanagan, U2 at the End of the World, pp. 353, 357. Following the tour's completion, Steinberg and The Edge discovered they missed each other; she moved to Dublin in 1994, and the relationship became firm. Having grown up around Hollywood, the prospect of being associated with a famous rock star did not faze her. On his part, the relationship with Steinberg improved his frame of mind after a long period of unhappiness. The couple's daughter, Sian Beatrice, was born in Los Angeles in 1997McCormick, U2 by U2, p. 345. and their son, Levi, was born in 1999 in the same city.McCormick, U2 by U2, p. 365. She had kept her home and many of her possessions in Los Angeles even after moving to Dublin; only after she began raising her children in Ireland did Steinberg start feeling that country was her home. Steinberg continued some professional activity with U2, directing one of the music videos made for their 1997 single \\"Staring at the Sun\\". The video featured close-ups of each of the band members set off by an array of lighting effects. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, she was one of the backing singers during the coda of \\"Walk On\\" for the America: A Tribute to Heroes telethon. The couple married on 17 June 2002. They had a small civil service in the Dublin registry office and a few days later at a ceremony on the top of a mountain in the South of France. The Edge said \\"the Dublin ceremony was just a necessary formality\\", the only people present there were his two best men: Bono and antiques dealer Chantal O'Sullivan.Jobling, U2, p. 294. Four days later, their French wedding was held with 200 or more guests at the hilltop village of Èze overlooking the Côte d'Azur followed with a party by the sea. The ceremony was led by Steinberg's father Robert and combined elements of both Christian and Jewish services.McCormick, U2 by U2, p. 395. The couple bought and renovated a €4 million house in Killiney outside Dublin during 2002–2003, where they were living mostly for their children's primary education. Their daughter, Sian had leukaemia at age 7, which required three years of treatment, in Dublin and in California. After discussion with the family, U2 went forward with its 2005–2006 Vertigo Tour, but with changed scheduling, reduced dates, and a long postponement of the final leg, all to enable Edge to get home more often.McCormick, U2 by U2, pp. 419–423. Bono later termed Steinberg a heroine for having to take up more of the parental burden and said that without her, the tour would never have taken place at all. After their daughter was declared free of leukaemia, Steinberg and The Edge learned that she was dyslexic and relocated to New York so that she could attend a special learning centre there. With Bono and his wife Ali Hewson, the couple co-own a 20-room villa in Èze in the Alpes-Maritimes in the South of France, where they often meet with other celebrities. By 2010, Morleigh and Edge altogether had residences in Dublin, New York, the South of France, and Los Angeles. The couple spent an initial five years seeking to gain approval for a large, five-home development atop the Sweetwater Mesa hillside in Malibu, California on land they had bought. Opposed by environmentalists, it was rejected by the California Coastal Commission in 2011, despite the efforts of Robert Steinberg to argue on its behalf. The project was reactivated and the battle over it intensified again during 2014. Finally in 2016 the couple won approval from the commission to proceed based upon a revised design. However the Sierra Club then filed suit against the project.  Subsequent career  Morleigh Steinberg has been working together with Japanese choreographer and dancer Oguri since the early 1990s, documenting Oguri's Butoh-derived style of dance in various environments, including Joshua Tree National Park and Los Angeles. She made her directorial debut in 1994 with the short subject Traveling Light, which featured the interpretive dance of Oguri and her sister Roxanne, who is also a modern dancer and choreographer and married to Oguri.Cheng, In Other Los Angeleses, pp. 260, 286. A review of the film on DVD Talk said that \\"Moreleigh Steinberg's dance-filled daydream about relationships in freefall will be difficult for some to appreciate (the mostly modern dance is very insular and odd), but the brilliant cinematic mood created by the director helps us over the slightly strange nature of it all.\\" (In 2006 the film was included in a DVD release of the Francis Ford Coppola- produced claymation film of William S. Burroughs' The Junky's Christmas.) Despite having no formal training in it, Steinberg also began working as a lighting designer, serving in that role for 1995 and 1997 productions of Oguri works.Cheng, In Other Los Angeleses, pp. 327, 389–390. In 1999, Steinberg was selected for a ten-week National Dance/Media Project fellowship at the University of California, Los Angeles. Steinberg next came up with the idea of showing Oguri moving through two busy Los Angeles intersections. The result is the 11-minute dance film \\"Xing\\", which was screened in 2003 at the Getty Center during Dance Camera West. \\"Nothing was choreographed beforehand. Oguri does not choreograph, he improvises. But the shots are very specific and the direction is very specific. He knows that he has to get from point A to point B, but I do not mind how.\\" Steinberg made her first feature-length documentary, Height of Sky, about Oguri, and it was shown on the Sundance Channel in 2008. Since Steinberg settled in Ireland, she has been involved in a number of projects, including doing the lighting for a Royal Hibernian Academy fringe gallery exhibition in 2001 and for Rex Levitates' dance production Bread & Circus in 2007, which showcases her collaborator Liz Roche. A short dance film she directed, Unsung, which featured Roche's choreography, won a 2008 Dance on the Box award from RTÉ and was shown on that channel as part of the Dublin Dance Festival. Steinberg provided the inspiration behind the dropped-from-on-high steering-wheel microphone that was a striking visual feature of the 2009–2011 U2 360° Tour. She was the artistic director of the 2010s Dance Homage to Irish painter Louis le Brocquy, entitled Cold Dream Colour. The work had its world première in Dublin. Le Brocquy later died, in 2012. The Edge had brought le Brocquy's work to Steinberg's attention, and she became convinced that his paintings could be interpreted through dance. The music for Cold Dream Colour is composed by The Edge in collaboration with Paul Chavez (known for his experimental electronic compositions under the project name FeltLike). Besides sharing in the choreography and lighting design for the work, Steinberg also staged a solo dance as well as a duet with her sister. Oguri also had roles as choreographer and dancer. The work had its US première at REDCAT in Los Angeles in 2012; a review in the Los Angeles Times said that \\"Visceral expressionism and a prodigious visual beauty coalesced ... a striking visual success\\", but that it was less certain whether the nature of le Brocquy's paintings had been conveyed to the less-familiar American audience. Excerpts from Cold Dream Colour were performed at the Guggenheim Museum's Works & Process series for two nights in 2013 in New York, with Irish broadcaster John Kelly moderating a discussion of the work with its creators. The US Cold Dream Colour was presented by Arcane Collective, a production company that Steinberg and Oguri had co-founded in Spring 2011. Steinberg continued to direct and appear in productions of Arcane Collective, including a 2016 performance at New York Live Arts consisting of adaptations of scenes from the Samuel Beckett trilogy. In 2017, Steinberg was featured as the second of two women in the video accompanying performances of the song \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\" on U2's Joshua Tree Tour 2017. She is dressed as a cowgirl, often drawing stage comment from Bono, while an American flag is painted on a wooden shack by the other woman.

Its main technology is based on volume Bragg gratings, which are used as filters either for swept lasers or for global imaging. History As a spin-off of the California Institute of Technology,http://innovation.caltech.edu/startups, CALTECH Office of Technology Transfer, \\"Past/Current Startups\\", retrieved January 2015 the company was founded in 2003 by Sébastien Blais-Ouellette who was working on narrow band imaging tunable filters for the detection of hydroxyl groups in the Earth atmosphere. This is how he developed the main technology of the company, a patented S. Blais-Ouellette; \\"Method and apparatus for a Bragg grating tunable filter\\", US patent 7557990 (B2), issued Jul 7, 2009, http://www.google.com/patents/US7557990S. Blais-Ouellette; E.

The company was first established in the J.-Armand Bombardier Incubator at Université de Montréal where it benefited from a complete infrastructure and proximity to researchers. After 5 years, Photon etc. moved to its actual location at the \\"Campus des technologies de la santé″ in the Rosemont district of Montréal. Photon etc. has 25 employees in Canada and has received several awards and recognition (Québec Entrepreneur of the Year (finalist), CCFC (winner), Fondation Armand-Frappier (winner - prix émergence), Prism Award (finalist) ). In the last ten years, the company has developed numerous collaborations, filed several patents and created spin-off companies in various domains: Photonic Knowledge (mining exploration), Nüvü Cameras (EMCCD cameras) and Optina Diagnostics (retinal imaging). More recently, in June 2015, Photon etc. expanded its expertise in nanotechnology and launched a new division, Photon Nano. Photon Nano provides Raman, fluorescence and plasmonic labels synthesized by top research laboratories. Those labels are mainly employed in multiplexing applications for cellular imaging. Technology Photon etc.'s core technology is a continuously tunable filter based on volume Bragg gratings. It consists of a photo-thermo- refractive glass with a periodically varying index of refraction in which the modulation structure can be orientated to transmit or reflect incident light. In order to select a particular wavelength that will be filtered (diffracted), the angle of the filter is adjusted to meet Bragg condition: : \\\\lambda_B = 2n\\\\Lambda\\\\sin(\\\\theta + \\\\varphi) \\\\,, where is an integer, B is the wavelength that will be diffracted, is the step of the grating, is the angle between the incident beam and the normal of the entrance surface and is the angle between the normal and the grating vector. For transmission gratings, Bragg planes are perpendicular to the entrance surface (=/2) while for reflection gratings, Bragg plans are parallel to the entrance surface (=0). If the beam does not meet the Bragg condition, it passes through the filter, undiffracted. In a Bragg filter, the incoming collimated light is first diffracted by a volume filter and only a small fraction of the spectrum is affected. Then, by using a second parallel filter with the same modulation period, light can be recombined and an image can be reconstructed. Hyperspectral imaging The company commercializes hyperspectral imaging systems based on volume Bragg gratings. This technique combines spectroscopy and imaging: each image is acquired on a narrow band of wavelengths (as small as 0.3 nm). The monochromatic images acquired from a hyperspectral data cube, which contains both the spatial (x- and y-axes) and spectral (z-axis) information of a sample. In this technique, global imaging is used in order to acquire a large area of a sample without damaging it. In global imaging, the whole field of view of the microscope objective is acquired at the same time compared to point-by-point techniques where either the sample or the excitation laser needs to be moved in order to reconstruct a map. When combined to microscopy, darkfield or brightfield illumination can be employed and various experiments can be carried out such as: Tunable filters The volume Bragg grating technology is also used to design tunable bandpass filters for various light sources. This technology combines an out-of-band rejection of <-60 dB and an optical density higher than OD 6 with a tunability over the visible and near infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Tunable lasers The Bragg grating filtering technology can be coupled to a supercontinuum laser in order to generate a tunable laser source. Supercontinuum sources are usually a high-power fibre laser which delivers ultra-broadband radiation and can be used for steady-state or lifetime experiments. This ultra broad radiation is obtained when a laser is directed through a nonlinear medium. From there, a collection of highly nonlinear optical processes (e.g.: four-wave mixing, Raman shifting of the solitons) add up together which create the supercontinuum emission. Coupled with the proper filter it can deliver a quasi-monochromatic output over a spectral range going from 400 nm to nm. This tool can be used in several experiments and fields of research which includes:  Infrared cameras Photon etc. designs and manufactures low noise infrared cameras sensitive from 850 nm to nm. Their HgCdTe (MCT) focal plane array (FPA) were first developed for faint flux measurements and are now used for astronomy, spectroscopy, quality control and sorting. Applications  Photovoltaics  Photovoltaic devices can be characterized by global hyperspectral imaging by electroluminescence (EL) and photoluminescence (PL) mapping. This technique allows the characterization of different aspects of photovoltaic cells : open circuit voltage, transport mechanisms, external quantum efficiency, saturation currents, composition map, uniformity components, crystallographic domains, stress shifts and lifetime measurement for material quality. It has in fact already been employed for the characterization of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) and GaAs solar cells. In their study, researchers from IRDEP (Institute of Research and Development on Photovoltaic Energy) were able to extract maps of the quasi-fermi level splitting and of the external quantum efficiency with the help of photoluminescence and electroluminescence hyperspectral measurements combined with a spectral and photometric absolute calibration method.  Health and Life Science  Since global hyperspectral imaging is a non-invasive technique, it gained popularity in the last few years in the health domain. For example, it has been used for the early diagnosis of retina anomalies (e.g.: age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinal vessel oxygen saturation ), in the biomedical field in addition to neurology and dermatology for the identification and location of certain proteins (e.g.: hemoglobin) or pigments (e.g.: melanin). In life science, this technique is used for darkfield and epifluorescence microscopy. Several studies showed hyperspectral imaging results of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) targeting CD44+ cancer cells and quantum dots (QDs) for the investigation of molecular dynamics in the central nervous system (CNS). Moreover, hyperspectral imaging optimized in the near-infrared is a well-suited tool to study single carbon nanotube photoluminescence in living cells and tissues. In a Scientific Reports paper, Roxbury et al. presents simultaneous imaging of 17 nanotube chiralities, including 12 distinct fluorescent species within living cells. The measurements were performed ex vivo and in vivo.  Semiconductors  After the invention of the transistor in 1947, the research on semiconductor materials took a big step forward. One technique that emerged from this consists of combining Raman spectroscopy with hyperspectral imaging which permits characterization of samples due to Raman diffusion specificity. For example, it is possible to detect stress, strain and impurities in silicon (Si) samples based on frequency, intensity, shape and width variation in the Si phonon band (~520 cm−1).J.D. Caldwell, L. Lombez, A. Delamarre, J.F. Guillemoles, B. Bourgoin, B. Hull, M. Verhaegen, Luminescence Imaging of Extended Defects in SiC via Hyperspectral Imaging. Silicon carbide and related materials 2011, PTS2, Materials Science Forum, 717-720, 403-406, 10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.717-720.403 Generally, it is possible to assess material's crystalline quality, local stress/strain, dopant and impurity levels and surface temperature.  Nanomaterials  Nanomaterials have recently raised a huge interest in the field of material science because of their colossal collection of industrial, biomedical and electronic applications. Global hyperspectral imaging combined with photoluminescence, electroluminescence or Raman spectroscopy offers a way to analyze those emerging materials. It can provide mapping of samples containing quantum dots,Fogel P. et al., \\"Evaluation of unmixing methods for the separation of Quantum Dot sources,\\" Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing, 2009.

It can deliver maps of the uniformity, defects and disorder while providing information on the number and relative orientation of layers, strain, and electronic excitations. It can hence be employed for the characterization of 2D materials such as graphene and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2).  Industrial  Hyperspectral imaging allows extracting information on the composition and the distribution of specific compounds. Those properties make hyperspectral imaging a well-suited technique for the mining industry. Taking advantage of the specific spectral signature of minerals Photonic Knowledge's Core Mapper™ offers instant mineral identification. This technology delivers monochromatic images and fast mineralogy mapping. The wide-field modality renders possible the identification of mineral signatures but also the classification of plants (e.g.: weeds, precision agriculture) and food (e.g.: meat freshness, fruit defects) and can be used for various outdoor applications. Being able to quickly and efficiently detect explosive liquid precursors represents an important asset to identify potential threats. An hyperspectral camera in the SWIR region allows such detection by acquiring rapidly spectrally resolved images. The monochromatic full-frame images obtained permit fast identification of chemical compounds. Detection of sulfur by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) can also be easily achieved with holographic Bragg grating used as filtering elements. Instrument Calibration and Characterization The calibration of measuring instruments (e.g. : photodetector, spectrometer) is essential if researchers want to be able to compare their results with those of different research groups and if we want to maintain high standards. Spectral calibration is often needed and requires a well-known source that can cover a wide part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Tunable laser sources possess all of the above requirements and are hence particularly appropriate for this type of calibration. Before the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) was sent to Gemini South, it was necessary to calibrate its coronagraph. For this matter, a nearly achromatic and collimated source that could cover 0.95-2.4 µm was needed. Photon etc.’s efficient tunable laser source was chosen to test the coronagraph. The tunable source was able to provide an output across the whole GPI wavelength domain.Testing the Gemini Planet Imager coronograph: http://www.photonetc.com/space-astronomy Thin-film filters are necessary elements in optical instrumentation. Band-pass, notch and edge filters now possess challenging specifications that are sometimes strenuous to characterize. Indeed, an optical density (OD) higher than 6 is difficult to identify. This is why a group of researchers from Aix Marseille Université developed a spectrally resolved characterization technique based on a supercontinuum source and a laser line tunable filter. The method is described in detail in the Liukaityte et al. paper from Optics Letter and allowed to study thin-film filters with optical densities from 0 to 12 in a wavelength range between 400 nm and 1000 nm.

The album was self-released on 11 June 2013 through the site PledgeMusic. The album was produced in 2012 in Reykjavík, Iceland by her band-mate Daniel Hunt in collaboration with the Icelandic musician Barði Jóhannsson. Alessandro Cortini co-produced the second song, \\"We Are the Sea\\". Crystal World comprises ten original songs written by Marnie while Ladytron had a break after they recorded, released and promoted their fifth studio album, Gravity the Seducer in 2011. The album is available in these formats: music download, CD, 12\\" vinyl. Background and recording In an interview for The Electricity Club site, Marnie said: \\"I played around with the idea for a couple of years and joked about it for a while. I had a handful of songs and when Ladytron had some time off last year, I began to believe it could be a reality. I thought if I have the opportunity, I'm just going to go for it. So I started writing as much as I could.\\" On 24 May 2012, her Ladytron band-mate Daniel Hunt announced that he would produce Marnie's solo album in Iceland in August 2012. Daniel Hunt, in collaboration with the Icelandic musician Barði Jóhannsson, produced Marnie's album. The album was recorded in Reykjavík, Iceland from August to early October 2012 and then for few days in December 2012. Marnie said on her PledgeMusic account about her debut album: \\"For the past year I've been writing more than ever, and I'm so pleased with the results thus far. The album, as yet untitled, is straight from the heart. I can't put it any other way. It means a lot. It is me, no one else. It is everything around me, my loves, my life, hopes and loss. I wanted to create an electronic album with more of a pop element and pristine vocals. Lyrically, the album is expansive, but the elements do play a part in much of the record, with the sea being particularly dominant and reoccurring. So, with the sea in mind and beautiful landscapes, I decided to fly to Iceland to record in a studio there. The light is so pretty, the air fresh, the sea vast, that I thought it would be the perfect setting to record.\\" Regarding the recording process of her album, Marnie said in an interview with The VPME: \\"I'd say 8 out of the 10 songs were written specifically for a solo record. The others were a little older but I knew I wanted them used for something. I guess after December 2011, I really started to write a lot, until I went to Iceland in August 2012. So that 7-month period was quite productive for me. 9 songs were taken to Iceland and completed. I then wrote the final track 'Gold' at home in Glasgow late last year, flew for one last time to Reykjavík, and recorded it there in December 2012. Having time away from touring really gave me the incentive to write.\\" She also mentioned that the majority of the songs were written over the course of 6–8 months. Promotion and release On 16 September 2012, Marnie started the PledgeMusic campaign in order to fund the making of her solo album. She also posted a short trailer about this project. She achieved 100% of her goal in three days. Helen Marnie offered various items for potential pledgers, like digital download/CD/gatefold vinyl of the album, signed 8x10 studio photos, disposable cameras filled with random pictures chosen by her, market bags customized with her logo, screen printed posters, handwritten lyric sheets, a pair of shoes and a dress that she wore in Ladytron's \\"Tomorrow\\" music video, a blue bikini that she wore in a pool photoshoot, personalized ringtone package, test pressing package, and her 1998 Mini Cooper Sport car. On 16 February 2013, Marnie offered to the pledgers a 1-minute 45 seconds preview of an unfinished version of one of her songs titled \\"The Hunter\\". Marnie shot her first solo music video on 30 April in Glasgow with a group of friends. On 16 May 2013, she announced the cover and the title of the album, Crystal World. On 29 May, Marnie premiered on her official YouTube account the music video for her debut single as solo artist, \\"The Hunter\\". The video was directed by Michael Sherrington, who also directed Ladytron's \\"Mirage\\" video. On 1 June, she shared to the pledgers a 55-second- long sample from a song titled \\"Hearts on Fire\\" and also confirmed the official track listing of the album. The album was initially scheduled to be released in March 2013, but it was delayed multiple times, to 10 May, then 31 May, and then 2 June. The album was released and available for download to pledgers on 11 June 2013 in FLAC and mp3 formats. There were 1517 pledges in total and she achieved a bit over 250% of her initial goal. On 15 June 2013, the album was released as music download on iTunes and Amazon through Cobraside label. In August 2013 the album was issued on CD format by Les Disques Du Crépuscule. Marnie released the James Slater-directed music video of \\"Hearts on Fire\\" on 19 April 2014. Singles \\"The Hunter\\" was released as first single on 29 May 2013 through a music video. On 12 August 2013, \\"The Hunter\\" was released on 7\\" vinyl format (limited edition) on Soft Power Records. The B-side of this disc is \\"The Wind Breezes On\\". There were 200 clear vinyls pressed for pledgers and another 300 classic black vinyls for general release. Marnie released a special single titled \\"The Hunter Remixed\\" through Les Disques du Crépuscule. It was issued in a strictly limited edition of 500 copies on clear 12\\" vinyl to celebrate Record Store Day on 19 April 2014. The single includes the original version of \\"The Hunter\\", two \\"The Hunter\\" remixes (one by Stephen Morris of Joy Division/New Order, and another one by the Scottish electronic band Roman Nose), and a \\"Sugarland\\" remix by Mark Reeder. Reception Crystal World was positively reviewed by the site The Electricity Club: \\"'Crystal World' achieves Marnie's objective 'to create an electronic album with more of a pop element and pristine vocals' but it is more than that. Like Marnie herself, this album is pretty. Vocally and musically expansive, it is like a dreamy arctic escapist fantasy.\\" The music site The VPME rated Crystal World 10 out of 10 and named the album \\"an electro-pop map of the human heart with more empathy, warmth and spirit than a million contrived indie lad rock 'anthems'.\\" The reviewer also added: \\"make no mistake, this is a hugely emotive record which sees Helen step out from behind her mysterious sultry Ladytron persona and reveal herself to be a songwriter of enormous emotional depth and honesty, able to produce songs which are poetic, fragile, heartfelt and often downright heart-breakingly beautiful.\\" Polari Magazine rated the album 5 out of 5, and added: \\"Crystal World is a rich and assured debut by a woman who has crafted and explored electronic music for more than a decade, a body of work which has lent itself to this album’s escapist and dreamy textures.\\" Victoria Segal on eMusic rated the album 4.5 out 5, saying that Crystal World \\"feels less strict, less pristine, as if all the wires and circuitry are slowly starting to melt down.\\" Track listing Personnel *Marnie - vocalist, songwriter *Daniel Hunt - producer on tracks 1-9 *Barði Jóhannsson - producer on track 10, co-producer, recording *Alessandro Cortini - co-producer on track 2 *Dave Schiffman - mixing *Doug van Sloun - mastering (at Focus) *Karl James Pestka - violin/viola on track 10 *Johann Hjorleifsson - additional percussion on tracks 3, 8, 9 *Lisa Devine - photography *Laura Hussey - cover design References External links * Helen Marnie official website * Ladytron official website * Category:2013 debut albums Category:Helen Marnie albums ","title":"Crystal World"},{"id":"39404321","text":"Bernard Leslie Shaw, FRS is an English chemist who has made notable contributions to organometallic chemistry.

The film focuses on the unsustainable working conditions of mine workers in the state of Rajasthan, India. Set in the Bhilwara district of Rajasthan this film captures the exploitation the workers have to go through on a daily basis to work in illegal mines for a ‘dollar a day’. Blending investigative journalism with helplessness and dark humour, the film tells the stories of average sandstone miners victimized by corporate greed and political corruption. It examines how sandstone mining has affected the local communities and also people occupied with this occupation. Despite stone mining’s links to several occupational diseases such as psychoneurosis, silicosis, tuberculosis, asbestosis and asthma, abject poverty keeps driving villagers in many parts of the state to illegal mining. More than 70 men from 60 families have died in the last few years of silicosis caused by inhalation of dust containing free crystalline silica. Their men were all mine workers employed in illegal stone quarries that have mushroomed over the past 10 years across the state thanks to record demand for sandstone, marble and other stones as people across the country built homes, offices and malls. The film is a hitchhiker’s journey through the labyrinthine universe of Democracy, as it exists in its lowest unit level – the Indian village. It showcases that death has lost its sting in parts of Rajasthan. Out there, they call it, not without a tinge of sarcasm, the land of widows. Penury is more horrible than death. They don’t want to see their children cry loud for a piece of bread. They are aware that mining will take their life one day, but poverty will take no time to take their children away from them. This village, Sriji Ka Khedahttp://epaper.timesofindia.com/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&Source;=Page&Skin;=ETNEW&BaseHref;=ETM/2010/09/25&PageLabel;=1&EntityId;=Ar00103&ViewMode;=HTML&GZ;=T is representative of all neighboring villages and perhaps all mining villages in most parts of India. Welcome to rural India. Where all they can do is hope for a better tomorrow, where the only shine is the glistening of the tears in their eyes, where life is cheap and death – even cheaper! The stories of struggle and visions of hope open a door to the complex issue that is threatening the future of mine workers and their families.

Au Départ is considered as one of four greatest French trunk-makers alongside Louis Vuitton, Goyard and Moynat.See Moynat, une modernité hors du temps, Madame Figaro. 14 Dec. 2011  History   The Origins  Au Départ was founded in 1834 upon the advent of railway travel. In 1847, a shop trading under Au Départ selling luggage and travel goods shop opened at 7 boulevard Denain in Paris, opposite the Gare du Nord, a railway station inaugurated the year before on 14 June 1846.  The Expansion  = Maison Bertin Frères = Au Départ sticker \\"Malletier depuis 1834\\" The shop Au Départ located Boulevard de Denain was acquired in 1871 by two brothers, Ernest (born in 1846) and Paul Bertin (born in 1854).Family tree of François Hyppolyte Bertin family, geneanet.org (Retrieved on May 15, 2013) Originally from the village of Daulaincourt in Haute-Marne, they had started by selling haberdashery on the Saint-Quentin market. They established the Maison Bertin Frères in 1871. The boutique on Boulevard de Denain specialised in guns, ammunitions, travel, as well as hunting and fishing goods. Their travel section displayed many different types of trunks (namely postal trunks, rounded trunks, canteen trunks, wicker trunks, flat trunks, wooden trunks covered in a brown canvas, \\"anglaises\\" trunks made out of wicker and covered in leather, automobile trunks, etc.), leather suitcases, handbags and stocked vanity cases.Au Départ catalogs, 1885, 1886, 1887, 1895 The Bertin Frères business flourished and a second shop, trading under Au Départ, was opened in Paris at 29, Avenue de l'Opéra in 1874. The boutique specialised in travel accessories and leather goods produced in the Belleville, Belleville workshops managed by the Bertin brothers. The brothers invented several related techniques which they were to patent, namely a new production technique for trunksINPI, Pattern n°198 250, 15 May 1889 and a new process to render hides and leather products completely waterproof.INPI, Pattern n°238 913, 31 May 1894 = Maisons Bertin Jeune et Bertin Fils = Ernest Bertin, who lived above the Boulevard de Denain boutique, dedicated himself to hunting accessories and established Bertin Fils. Paul Bertin, who for his part lived above the Avenue de l'Opéra boutique, established Bertin Jeune with his sons and continued to specialise in travel goods. The two Maisons Bertin Jeune and Bertin Fils coexisted. Upon Ernest Bertin's death in 1905 the store on boulevard de Denain was sold and the Au Départ shop inside closed circa 1910. On its side, the boutique located on the avenue de l'Opéra continued to prosper.

In order to differentiate its products, Au Départ is to cover some of its products with a \\"damier\\" chequered canvas, offering an alternative to the monogram canvases proposed by the Maisons Louis Vuitton and Goyard.

Partnerships with great Parisian trunk-makers  On July 2, 1932, François Bertin on behalf of Au Départ created a new company, the Coopération Industrielle et Commerciale (\\"CIC\\"), in partnership with the directors of the four other great trunk-makers of the time (Louis Vuitton, Goyard, Moynat, et Aux Etats-Unis) in the face of the economic crisis.

To counter the drop in sales, a merger with the historical competitor on the Avenue de l'Opéra, the trunk-maker Moynat, was envisaged. In 1958, the two companies formally merged.Extrait du Registre du Commerce et des Sociétés de Paris, 10 janvier 1976 The boutique at 29 Avenue de l'Opéra was closed down, and from then on the business trades under the double name \\"Moynat Au Départ\\" at Moynat's historical boutique at No.1 Avenue de l'Opéra.

Background Lord McAlpine alleged that he was defamed by comments implying that he was a paedophile published by Sally Bercow on Twitter, a social networking service. This followed the broadcast on 2 November 2012 of a report by BBC Two's Newsnight which linked an unnamed \\"senior Conservative\\" politician to sex abuse claims. On 4 November 2012, Bercow tweeted \\"Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *innocent face*\\" When the allegations against McAlpine proved to be unfounded, Bercow was one of a number of people that the peer threatened with legal action. The BBC subsequently apologised and paid £185,000 to McAlpine in damages and the ITV television network paid him £125,000 in damages. McAlpine commenced legal actions against users of Twitter who had repeated the claims but users with fewer than 500 followers were allowed to settle the matter by making a donation of £25 to the BBC Children in Need charity. McAlpine donated the libel damages from BBC and ITV to Children in Need and other charities. McAlpine's lawyers said that they would continue to pursue 20 \\"high profile Tweeters\\" (users with more than 500 followers) including Bercow, comedian Alan Davies and writer George Monbiot. Acting on behalf of McAlpine, solicitor Andrew Reid announced: \\"Twitter is not just a closed coffee shop among friends. It goes out to hundreds of thousands of people and you must take responsibility for it. It is not a place where you can gossip and say things with impunity, and we are about to demonstrate that.\\" In November 2012, Monbiot published \\"Lord McAlpine – An Abject Apology\\" on his personal website and apologised for acting \\"in an unprofessional, thoughtless and cruel manner\\". Monbiot also wrote personally to McAlpine and agreed to undertake charity work. Davies apologised publicly and privately to McAlpine in November 2012. In contrast, Bercow \\"consistently denied that her tweets were libellous\\" and in December 2012 she appointed the law firm Carter-Ruck to defend her against the claim. At the time that the tweet was made she had 56,000 followers, described by Sir Edward Garnier QC, for McAlpine, as \\"a bigger readership than many regional newspapers\\". Judgment At a preliminary hearing held on 16 April 2013 it was decided that the trial should be split into two stages. The first stage would decide if the words of the tweet could be considered defamatory. If this was found to be the case a second hearing would be held to determine the level of damages unless both parties were able to reach an agreement. The judgment in the first stage was handed down on 24 May 2013. The Hon. Mr Justice Tugendhat was asked to rule on the meaning of Bercow's tweet, particularly the phrase \\"innocent face\\" which the judge said was intended to be read \\"as a stage direction\\" with readers \\"imagining that they can see [Bercow's] face as she asks the question in the Tweet. The words direct the reader to imagine that the expression on her face is one of innocence, that is an expression which purports to indicate (sincerely, on the Defendant's case, but insincerely or ironically on the Claimant's case) that she does not know the answer to her question.\\" The judge said that there were two different kinds of meaning recognised in law: \\"a natural and ordinary meaning\\" and \\"an innuendo meaning\\". Citing Jones v Skelton,[1963] 1 WLR 1362 Mr Justice Tugendhat explained that a natural and ordinary meaning may be either the literal meaning or a meaning \\"that does not require the support of extrinsic facts passing beyond general knowledge\\". An innuendo meaning, he said, \\"is a meaning which can be implied from the words complained of, but only if the reader also knows other facts (which are not general knowledge). These are generally called extrinsic facts.\\" The judge decided that any reasonable reader would understand both meanings of Bercow's tweet and interpret the \\"innocent face\\" as insincere and ironical: \\"There is no sensible reason for including those words in the tweet if they are to be taken as meaning that the defendant simply wants to know the answer to a factual question.\\" The judge decided that the Tweet meant \\"in its natural and ordinary defamatory meaning, that the Claimant was a paedophile who was guilty of sexually abusing boys living in care\\". With regard to the innuendo of the tweet Mr Justice Tugendhat found that the Tweet carried a meaning \\"to the same effect\\" and found that the tweet was \\"an allegation of guilt. I see no room on these facts for any less serious meaning.\\" As it had already been accepted by Bercow prior to the hearing that McAlpine was innocent of the allegations her tweet was \\"seriously defamatory\\" and indefensible in law. Following judgment both parties reached an agreement and Bercow agreed to pay damages. Bercow was also ordered to apologise in open court to McAlpine, who said that he would travel to London from his home in Italy \\"to hear it personally\\". Reactions Prior to judgment Bercow made two offers to settle out of court. Both were rejected by McAlpine, leading to Joshua Rozenberg, a lawyer and columnist for London's The Guardian newspaper, to opine \\"that the undisclosed, agreed damages were higher than she had hoped.\\" McAlpine's solicitor Andrew Reid said: \\"The apologies previously received from Mrs Bercow did not concede that her tweet was defamatory but clearly she must now accept this fact. Her failure to admit that her tweet was defamatory caused considerable unnecessary pain and suffering to Lord McAlpine and his family over the last six months. The judgment is one of great public interest and provides both a warning to and guidance for people who use social media.\\" Rozenberg noted: \\"The law of defamation is well known to those who write for a living. One hopes Twitter users are beginning to learn what a powerful and potentially dangerous weapon they have at their fingertips. A tweet is more like a broadcast than an email and is subject to the law of libel in the same way.\\" Bercow said: \\"The High Court found that my tweet constituted a serious libel, both in its natural meaning and as an innuendo. To say I am surprised and disappointed by this is an understatement. I will accept the ruling as the end of the matter. I remain sorry for the distress I have caused Lord McAlpine and I repeat my apologies. Today's ruling should be seen as a warning to all social media users.\\" Patrick Strudwick, also writing in The Guardian, noted that on the day of the hearing many Twitter users tweeted: \\"Why is Sally Bercow trending? *libel face*\\", a humorous reference to her defamatory tweet. The case was subsequently cited in the judgement in the 2017 Monroe v Hopkins libel case.[2017] EWHC 433 (QB) (10 March 2017), [2017] EMLR 16, [2017] 4 WLR 68, [2017] WLR(D) 188 See also *English defamation law References Category:English defamation case law Category:2013 in case law Category:Twitter controversies Category:2013 in British law Category:High Court of Justice cases ","title":"McAlpine v Bercow"},{"id":"39404508","text":"Deh-e Qazi (, also Romanized as Deh-e Qāz̤ī) is a village in Heruz Rural District, Kuhsaran District, Ravar County, Kerman Province, Iran.

Forests cover about 50% of the territory of Estonia, or around 2 million hectares, and so make out an important and dominating landscape type in the country. National law and policies recognize that forests are a natural and ecological resource, and the importance of forests is to be considered from an economic, social, ecological and cultural aspect. Overview Scots pine forest in South-Estonia. History Before the advent of agriculture in Estonia, the land area covered by forests was approximately 80%; however, due to human activity it fell to about 34% by 1939, and Estonia has traditionally been a country dominated by agriculture. However, after World War II and the ensuing Soviet occupation of Estonia, large parts of former agricultural land fell into disuse and was reforested. In the 1960s, attempts were made to improve the output of silviculture by e.g. draining swamps. Agricultural reforms during the 1990s have further increased the amount of land with forests growing. Forest types Swamp forest in winter. Despite its relatively small size, Estonia displays a great variety in forest types. Two main types are forests growing on mineral soil (about 70%) and so-called swamp forests (about 30%), growing in the numerous wetland areas of Estonia. The forest types can further be broken down into smaller categories, many with their own ecosystem and unique biotope. In addition, large variations can be found within a single small area of land. The most common tree species are pine, birch and spruce. Forestry management About 70% of Estonian forests are commercially used (circa 1.5 million hectares), with another 30% enjoying some kind of protection (as of 2005). Commercial use Of harvested timber, around 60% is made up of coniferous wood, mainly pine and spruce, and the rest deciduous trees, dominated by birch. The forest- based industry of Estonia encompasses all aspects of the trade; however, the pulp and paper industry remains relatively small. Round wood is exported mainly to Finland and Sweden, while Estonian sawmills also import logs, mainly from Latvia and Russia. Wood pellets is another product which is almost exclusively exported. Wood makes out the second largest source of domestic fuels in Estonia (the largest being oil shale). Wood is commonly used both on an industrial scale by large boilers fed by wood waste and chips, and in the residential sector via traditional firewood-burning stoves. Since 2008, there are also two combined heat and power plants, in Tallinn and Tartu respectively. 40% of the forests of Estonia belong to the state and are governed by the State Forest Management Centre (abbreviated RMK). National policies and legislation is aimed at safeguarding that an economically profitable yet ecologically sustainable silviculture is maintained. However, the State Forest Management Centre has been criticised (2010) for not pursuing a sustainable forest management. Protected forests Oak forests are now very rare in Estonia and they are mostly under protection. Loode oaks in Saaremaa. The proportion of protected forests in Estonia is relatively large, when compared with other similar countries which also pursue commercial forestry on a large scale. The first forests to be placed under protection were given the status of nature reserve in the 1920s. Research Estonia's main research institution dealing with forestry-related research is the Estonian University of Life Sciences in Tartu.

Life and work Timo Kahlen is known for his sound sculptures and site-specific sound art works, installations with steam, wind and light, as well as experimental net art, video and photography. His interdisciplinary and intermedia body of work, often employing ephemeral, elemental materials such as wind and steam, light and shade, sound and vibration, noise and beauty, has been nominated for the German national Sound Art Prize 2006, the Kahnweiler Prize for Sculpture 2001 and the Prize for Young European Photographers 1989, as well as various scholarships in Washington D.C., Berlin, Paris and Guernsey. Kahlen's work is involved with the sculptural and conceptual aspects of immaterial phenomena and processes, and curators as Joanna Littlejohns have emphasized the ephemeral, \\"temporary and changeable nature\\" of his concentrated oeuvre. Kahlen's work has been presented in more than 140 exhibitions and retrospectives of contemporary media art since the mid-1980s, including Sound Art: Sound as a Medium of the Arts (ZKM Center for Arts and Media Technologies, Karlsruhe 2012–2013), the Mediations Biennale (Poland 2012), Tonspur_expanded: The Loudspeaker (Vienna, 2010–11), Noise & Beauty (Berlin 2010), 60 × 60 (New York 2010), Manifesta 7: Scenarios (Italy 2008), Sound Art: German Sound Art Prize 2006 (Marl and Cologne 2006), Wireless Experience (Helsinki 2004), Zeitskulptur: Volumen als Ereignis (Linz 1997) and the solo exhibition Timo Kahlen: Works with Wind (1991), inaugurating the Kunst-Werke in Berlin. His installation at the Aviation Museum in Amberg in 2010 was disrupted when a cleaner mistakenly vacuumed up the two dead hornets he had placed on a loudspeaker: the installation was titled Tanz für Insekten (dance for insects) and the intention was for the dead insects to \\"dance\\" as a result of the vibrations. Rather than kill more hornets, he replaced them with dead houseflies.

Career in psychiatry Levinson has pursued alternative theories and treatments for dyslexia since the 1960s. In 1973 he and Jan Frank published an article in the Journal of Child Psychiatry suggesting dyslexia was caused by a faulty connection between the cerebellum and the other parts of the brain, instead of the cerebrum. By 1974 Levinson's cerebellar and related inner-ear theory that dyslexia has been mentioned in the popular press. His cerebellar-vestibular theory led him to treating children with dyslexia as he children with an inner ear problem, using anti-motion sickness medication. He used the same over-the-counter medication to treat theassociated attention deficit, hyperactivity, impaired concentration and distractibility. He considers that his findings suggested that cerebellar problems cause a scrambling of information, which secondarily confuse higher brain processors. Levinson appeared on television to discuss his treatment in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1985, he observed that 750 out of 1000 dyslexia patients also had problems with balance and coordination. By 1986 Levinson had treated more than 8,000 patients with dyslexia, and reported a success rate of between 75% and 80%. He had also studied more than 20,000 patients in total. One of the additional psychological problems Levinson determined was associated with the same brain disorder is the rise of adult phobias. Levinson's observations led him to believe that up to 90% of people who suffered from phobias also suffered from cerebellar and inner-ear malfunctions, leading the suffered to believe the fear is rational. He published a book entitled Phobia Free in which his findings were outlined. Levinson was interviewed on The Phil Donahue Show in the early 1980s, in addition to many other network shows like Lifestyles with Regis Philbin, and The Today Show, The Morning Show. Levinson used to be a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at New York University Medical Center. Levinson became the director of the Medical Dyslexic and Attention Deficit Disorder Treatment Centre on Long Island. He is now the Clinical and Research Director of the Levinson Medical Center for Learning Disabilities, which has had locations in New York, England, and Hong Kong. In the 1970s Levinson also developed instruments called the 3-D Optical, Auditory and Tactile Scanners, used to gather visual, auditory- phonetic and touch sensory data related to the dyslexic condition. The scanners were used by Levinson to screen and diagnose children and adults for dyslexia. Publishing Levinson has published his research in academic journals including Journal of the American Academy of Child Psychiatry, Perceptual and Motor Skills and Academic Therapy. In 1980 Levinson published the book Dyslexia - a Solution to the Riddle, expanding upon his theories on dyslexia, as well as related ADHD and phobias. In 1984 he then published the book Smart But Feeling Dumb, talking further about the experience of children suffering from the above-mentioned afflictions. In 1991 Levinson published the book The Upside-Down Kids, which followed a hypothetical classroom containing eight children with different learning disabilities. His book Smart But Feeling Dumb was released in a revised second edition format in 2008. Other books by Levinson include Phobia Free (1986), Total Concentration (1990), Turning Around — The Upside Down Kids (1992), A Scientific Watergate — Dyslexia (1994), and the lead chapter in The All in One Guide to ADD and Hyperactivity (2001). Levinson is also the author of the Psychology Today blog Freud's Missing Links. Subjects of his blog postings have included cerebellar theory, childhood bullying, and fraudulent science.

Mamasela was an askari and part of the Vlakplaas counterinsurgency unit under the command of Eugene de Kock. Early life Mamasela was born in Soweto, South Africa on June 2nd, 1953. His mother lived in a domestic suburb and would visit Mamasela and his siblings when she could. Mamasela was the last of six children, all of whom died during the years of Apartheid. The Mamasela children lived with their grandmother in the Tladi location. Their grandmother's home was turned into a shebeen in later years in order to support the family's income. Mamasela attended Western Central Jabavu but left school in Standard 9, the equivalent of Grade 11. Due to the threat of violence in his village, Mamasela started training in karate and became known for his fighting skills. Personal life Mamasela married Nombi Dube shortly after he left school, when she became pregnant with their son Sizwe. The couple later divorced, allegedly due to rumours of Dube's infidelity. Mamasela later remarried and had two sons and a daughter by his second wife. Politics Mamasela became a student activist in his earlier year due to his interest in South African politics. He later was promoted to the position of Secretary-General of the South African Student Movement at his school. The history of how Mamasela came to be an askari at Vlakplaas is contentious. Mamasela claims he joined the African National Congress in Botswana in 1977, after having been recruited by Snuki Zikalala, but was arrested by security police. Mamasela's account follows that he was tortured by the security police until he broke, giving information and agreeing to become an askari for the security force. An alternative account provided by journalist Jacques Pauw states that Mamasela became a police informant in 1979 after he had been arrested for housebreaking and theft. He then infiltrated the ANC in Botswana and underwent intelligence training. After his cover was blown, Mamasela escaped and joined the unit at Vlakplaas. Secret police Mamasela was part of the Vlakplaas police unit run by Apartheid colonel Eugene de Kock in the 1980s. Mamasela publicly confessed to taking part in the abduction and murder of Port Elizabeth activists Sipho Hashe, Qawawuli Godolozi and Champion Galela, known as the Pebco Three, in May 1985. He was also involved in the killing of youth activists, the Mamelodi Ten, in 1986 and Durban human rights lawyer Griffiths Mxenge. In return for providing the then Transvaal Attorney- General with the names of former security police members involved in human rights abuses during Apartheid, he was granted indemnity from prosecution. Mamasela allegedly kept a dossier detailing the killings, torture and abduction that took place at Vlakplaas which he used in a deal with the Attorney-Generall. Despite admitting to killing these and other activists, Mamasela refused to testify before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission or apply for amnesty. Murder charge In 2011, Mamasela was charged with the murder of his landlord, Lali Joseph Nhlapo. After three days on the run, Mamasela handed himself in, and stood trial in 2011. Mamasela claimed to have shot Nhlapo in self-defence, while state witnesses claimed that Nhlapo was unarmed and shot at point-blank range.
