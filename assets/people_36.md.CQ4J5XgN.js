He was the chief negotiator for Jean II of France with the English, in the aftermath of the battle of Poitiers.Jonathan Sumption, The Hundred Years War II (1999), p. 308. Towards the end of his life he lived in Avignon on a livery from Cambrai. He died in there on 5 December 1378. Biography Born in the early years of the 14th century, Gilles Aycelin came from an Auvergnat family with several prominent members in his period. Brother of Pierre Aycelin de Montaigut, and nephew of Gilles I Aycelin de Montaigu, \\"the Elder\\", he was bishop of Lavaur (1357-1360) and then bishop of Th√©rouanne (1356‚Äì1361), bishop of Frascati (Tusculum) (1368-1378) and cardinal-priest with the title of SS. Silvestro e Martino (1361-1368). He attended in 1356 the disastrous Battle of Poitiers and followed King John II of France, \\"the Good\\", in England with the title of chancellor. In May 1358 he was sent to London by King John II to lead the council of his son, John, Duke of Berry, \\"the Magnificent\\", Count of Poitiers. On 24 June 1360 he went Carcassonne to the marriage of Count of Poitiers with Jeanne, daughter of John I, Count of Armagnac, dead in 1388. John II, \\"the Good\\", obtained for him the cardinalate from Pope Innocent VI in 1361. He was then appointed by Pope Urban V as being one of the Commissioners to reform of the University of Paris. Pope Gregory XI commissioned him as an arbitrator in the dispute between Peter IV of Aragon and the Duke Louis I, Duke of Anjou to the Kingdom of Majorca.

The film is set in Northern Ireland during the Troubles and its title comes from Bernard MacLaverty's description of the conflict as \\"the elephant in our living room\\" ‚Äî a reference to the collective denial of the underlying social problems of Northern Ireland. Produced by BBC Northern Ireland, it first screened on BBC2 in 1989. The film was first conceived by Boyle, who was working as a producer for BBC Northern Ireland at the time. The film, which contains very little dialogue, depicts eighteen murders and is partly based on actual events drawn from police reports at the time. It is shot with 16mm film with much of it filmed using a steadicam and features a series of tracking shots, a technique the director used regularly. The grainy 16mm film, together with the lack of dialogue, plot, narrative and music give the film a cold, observational documentary feel. Nothing is learnt about any of the gunmen or victims. Each of the murders is carried out calmly and casually; in one scene the gunman is seen to drive away slowly, even stopping to give way for traffic. Most of the vignettes end with the camera lingering on the motionless body of the victim. As with several of Clarke's films, Elephant received high praise and attracted controversy. After watching the film, Clarke's contemporary David Leland wrote: \\"I remember lying in bed, watching it, thinking, 'Stop, Alan, you can't keep doing this.' And the cumulative effect is that you say, 'It's got to stop. The killing has got to stop.' Instinctively, without an intellectual process, it becomes a gut reaction.\\" The film is a clear influence on Gus Van Sant's 2003 film Elephant, based on the Columbine High School Massacre. Van Sant's film borrowed not only Clarke's title, but also closely mirrors his minimalist style.

Three years later, on 24 May 1988, during another demolition in the vicinity of the first discovery, another, even bigger find was reported (including silver and gold florin coins). Most of this new find disappeared before the site was secured by the authorities. In the following days, as enterprising individuals scoured the municipal landfill where rubble from other recently demolished buildings was deposited, reports of more discoveries started appearing; those include the first reports of jewelry. Archaeologists began to investigate the site, and the government announced a plan to buy back items that had been looted. Later, a criminal investigation was launched, targeting those who still refused to turn back the items they had taken. Although many items were recovered, it is agreed that there are still missing items. Looted items have been recovered intermittently. Report of an award to policemen involved in recovering part of the treasure, 25 April 2005 History Over the following years, archaeologists and historians have speculated about the treasure's origins, while museums and wealthy individuals have competed for pieces of the treasure. It is now agreed that the treasure belonged to the King (later Emperor) Charles IV of the House of Luxembourg. Around 1348, needing funds to support his claim to the title King of the Romans, Charles pawned various items to the Jewish banker Muscho (Moshe, Moj≈ºesz) in ≈öroda (the town of ≈öroda was then part of the Duchy of Wroclaw (Breslau) which in 1335 had passed under reign of Bohemian kings). Skarb ≈öredzki, official pages of the town, last retrieved on 7 July 2009 What is certain is that no one ever reclaimed the treasure, which was left hidden somewhere in the town for hundreds of years. The artifacts Various recovered items have been cataloged, and those that were damaged by the mechanical digger that uncovered them have been restored. Some items were displayed as early as 1985. Since 1995‚Äì1997 most of them have been distributed throughout museums in Lower Silesia. The majority of the items are displayed in local museum of ≈öroda ≈ölƒÖska, although in the past exhibits were held in museums including the Archeologicial Museum in Wroc≈Çaw, National Museum in Wroc≈Çaw (which technically supervises the museum in ≈öroda), National Archeological Museum in Warsaw, as well as abroad, in the Museum of Artistic Craft in Dresden, Germany and in Valladolid, Spain.

His father was a university professor. He grew up dreaming of professional basketball, not sumo. At age 14, he decided to devote himself to sumo after seeing a tournament featuring fellow Mongolians Kyokutenh≈ç and Kyokush≈´zan on TV. He wrote a letter about his desires and had a friend translate it into Japanese. He then mailed the letter to several stables in Japan. Izutsu stable's head was impressed and invited Kakury≈´ to Japan. Kakury≈´'s family had no background in Mongolian wrestling, and he had no experience in wrestling before coming to Japan. Career When Kakury≈´ joined Izutsu stable, he weighed just and his oyakata former sekiwake Sakahoko joked he was better suited to be the stable's tokoyama (hairdresser) than a wrestler. Kakury≈´ made his professional debut at the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament in November 2001, then weighing .

Kakury≈´ first reached sekitori status in November 2005 upon promotion to the j≈´ry≈ç division but fell short with a 5‚Äì10 record, dropping back to makushita. He returned to the second division in March 2006 and reached the top makuuchi division that November, after scoring 9 wins at the rank of j≈´ry≈ç 1 in the previous tournament. He was the eighth Mongolian to make makuuchi after Kyokush≈´zan, Kyokutenh≈ç, Asash≈çry≈´, Asasekiry≈´, Hakuh≈ç, Harumafuji and Tokitenk≈´. He was the first (and to date only) wrestler from the stable to make the top division since the current stablemaster took control in 1994. One of seven wrestlers to be promoted to makuuchi for that tournament, he made his debut halfway up the maegashira ranks at number 8, the highest since Miyabiyama began at maegashira 7 in March 1999. He came through with a solid 8‚Äì7 record. Kakury≈´ in May 2009 After a strong 11‚Äì4 record in January 2008, which earned him his first sansh≈ç for technique, Kakury≈´ was promoted to maegashira 1.

In March 2009 he produced a fine 10‚Äì5 record from the maegashira 1 ranking, defeating three ≈çzeki. He won his last eight matches after standing at 2‚Äì5 on the seventh day. He was awarded his second Technique Prize. Kakury≈´ made his san'yaku debut in the following tournament in May 2009 at the rank of komusubi. In a similar fashion to his previous tournament he recovered from 2‚Äì5 down to win seven of his last eight bouts and was rewarded with another Technique Prize. In July 2009 Kakury≈´ was promoted to sekiwake. He was the first from his stable to do so since Terao in 1989. He was only able to win five bouts in his sekiwake debut and fell back to the maegashira ranks. He responded with a strong 11‚Äì4 score, earning his third Technique prize in four tournaments and fourth overall. He returned to the sekiwake rank for the November tournament and finished with a 7‚Äì8 record that kept him in the san'yaku ranks. Disappointing performances in his next three tournaments saw him slip to maegashira 6, but he responded by winning eleven bouts in July 2010, finishing as joint runner-up and winning his fifth Technique award. He returned to komusubi in September 2010 and moved up to sekiwake in November. On the final day of that tournament, he was defeated by fellow sekiwake Tochi≈çzan to finish 7‚Äì8. Ranked at komusubi in the May 2011 \\"technical examination\\" tournament, Kakury≈´ finished runner-up for the second time with a 12‚Äì3 record, winning his sixth Technique prize. Promoted to sekiwake for the July tournament, he defeated three ≈çzeki and finished 10‚Äì5. In a strong position for possible promotion to ≈çzeki, Kakury≈´ started that next tournament 3‚Äì4. His final record of 9‚Äì6 was insufficient to earn a promotion. In the January 2012 tournament, Kakury≈´ defeated yokozuna Hakuh≈ç for the first time, and was awarded his first Outstanding Performance Prize. It was his first victory over a yokozuna in 27 attempts (previously he had been 0‚Äì20 against Hakuh≈ç and 0‚Äì6 against Asash≈çry≈´). =≈åzeki= In the March 2012 tournament held in Osaka, Kakury≈´ defeated Hakuh≈ç for the second time in a row on Day 9, and entered the final day of the tournament one win ahead of the yokozuna at 13‚Äì1, his only loss thus far being to Kisenosato on Day 8. However, he was defeated by G≈çeid≈ç, and Hakuh≈ç's defeat of Baruto ensured a playoff between the two Mongolians. Hakuh≈ç gained revenge on Kakury≈´ to claim his 22nd tournament title. Although he missed out on his first championship, Kakury≈´ received prizes for Outstanding performance and Technique. Kakury≈´ said that inexperience cost him in his playoff against Hakuh≈ç and that a tournament victory was \\"too soon for me.\\" Kakury≈´'s 33 wins over three tournaments was, however, enough to grant him a promotion to ≈çzeki. The promotion marked the first time there were six active ≈çzeki simultaneously. It took him 62 tournaments from his professional debut to make ≈çzeki, which was the tenth slowest in sumo history, and the slowest of the nine foreigners who have made the rank. =Yokozuna= Yokozuna Kakury≈´ Rikisabur≈ç performing a dohy≈ç-iri (2014) After an unremarkable 2013, in which he scored no better than ten wins in any of the six tournaments, Kakury≈´ surprised many observers with a 14‚Äì1 performance in January 2014, defeating Hakuh≈ç in their regulation match and only losing the title in a playoff against him on the final day. It was the fourth runner-up title of his career. He followed it up with a 14‚Äì1 record in March 2014, defeating both Hakuh≈ç and Harumafuji en route to the Spring Grand Sumo Tournament title. It was his first top division y≈´sh≈ç. Having satisfied the minimum requirement of two consecutive championships or \\"the equivalent\\", the Yokozuna Deliberation Council unanimously recommended his promotion on 24 March, which was confirmed by the Japan Sumo Association on 26 March. Kakury≈´ was the first to achieve the rank since Harumafuji in 2012, the fourth Mongolian to do so, the sixth foreign-born yokozuna, and 71st overall. \\"I am determined to focus all my efforts to train even harder and be certain to give all my strength not to defile the yokozuna name,\\" he remarked. As a yokozuna, he performs the Unry≈´-gata style. His first tournament as a yokozuna ended in disappointment as he gave up an early kinboshi to End≈ç on Day 4 and lost his last three matches to finish on 9‚Äì6. He fared better in subsequent tournaments in 2014, scoring at least 11 wins in each, and was in contention for the November 2014 tournament championship before losing to Hakuh≈ç in the final bout. This was his fifth career runner-up performance. Kakury≈´ was forced to withdraw on the eve of the March 2015 tournament, after suffering a torn rotator cuff in his left shoulder. This was his first absence as a yokozuna and came so late that his opening match had already been drawn up and had to be forfeited. He also sat out the summer Natsu basho in May as the injury had not fully healed, the first time a yokozuna has missed two full tournaments in a row since Musashimaru missed three in 2003. He made a respectable comeback in the July tournament, scoring 12‚Äì3 and being in contention for the championship until his defeat to Hakuh≈ç on the final day. With Harumafuji absent and Hakuh≈ç pulling out on the third day, Kakury≈´ was the only yokozuna for most of the September tournament. He recovered from losses to Yoshikaze on day 2 and My≈çgiry≈´ on day 10 to enter the final day on 12‚Äì2, one win ahead of the ≈çzeki Terunofuji. In the final scheduled match of the tournament, he was beaten by Terunofuji but won the ensuing playoff by uwatedashinage to take his second championship and his first since his promotion to yokozuna. After the playoff he commented; \\"The fact that I have long been away from a title has weighed on me. It was tough... I thought I might lose a title once again, but then I came to think that all I needed to do was to execute my style of sumo... I feel rewarded for continuing to work hard without getting down on myself.\\" Despite his success he received some criticism for using the henka, a side-stepping technique, during the tournament, notably against Kisenosato on the penultimate day. In November he never looked likely to win the tournament but ended with a 9‚Äì6 record after beating Hakuh≈ç on the final day. Kakury≈´ began 2016 with 10‚Äì5 records in January and March, and did slightly better in May with an 11‚Äì4 record. He withdrew from the July 2016 tournament in Nagoya after suffering injuries to his lower back and left ankle. He returned in September and recorded ten wins. In the November tournament he won his first ten matches before losing to Kisenosato on day 11. He rebounded to beat Kotosh≈çgiku and Hakuh≈ç before securing his third y≈´sh≈ç with a win over G≈çeid≈ç on day 14. After rounding off his tournament with a win over Harumafuji on the final day he commented \\"It‚Äôs really pleasing, I‚Äôve been struggling with injuries for the past one, two years and physically and mentally things didn‚Äôt come together, but I didn‚Äôt sulk and it‚Äôs great that things turned out like this. I feel I‚Äôm finally getting to wrestle my way, relaxed. I‚Äôll not forget how I‚Äôm feeling now and keep working.\\" Kakury≈´ versus Hakuh≈ç during a ceremonial tournament at Yasukuni Shrine, April 2017 2017 began disappointingly as Kakury≈´ suffered five defeats in the first ten days, including three kinboshi given up to maegashira ranked wrestlers. Kakury≈´ withdrew after Day 10 from the tournament with an injury to his right leg. He returned with ten wins in the Osaka tournament in March. He pulled out of the May 2017 tournament after three losses in the first four days, citing a left ankle injury. He also withdrew from the following tournament in July on Day 4, this time with an injury to his right foot. His stablemaster Izutsu said that Kakury≈´ would not pull out of a tournament upon his return and would have to retire instead ‚Äì \\"If he can‚Äôt win next time he steps on the dohyo, there will be no option to pull out midway. He would have to take the decision (to retire from the sport) as a man.\\" On September 7, 2017 Izutsu Oyakata confirmed that Kakury≈´ would miss the Aki tournament as he has yet to recover from his right foot injury. In November he was again forced to withdraw shortly before the tournament, this time owing to a lower back problem in addition to his ankle injury. On December 20, 2017 the Sumo Association announced that he was being docked his salary for January 2018 for failing to act when Mongolian wrestler Takanoiwa was injured by Harumafuji at a restaurant and bar in Tottori in October. Fellow yokozuna Hakuh≈ç was docked a month and a half's pay. The chairman of the Yokozuna Deliberation Council said, \\"Hakuho and Kakuryu were not able to stop the incident from happening and being taken too far. Their responsibility should not be taken lightly. They should be given a strong warning.\\" Kakury≈´ made his comeback at the January 2018 tournament. After winning his first ten bouts, he then lost four in a row, but won on the last day to finish in third place with an 11‚Äì4 record. He was the only yokozuna to complete the tournament after Hakuh≈ç and Kisenosato withdrew with injuries. Having felt pain in his left ankle towards the end of the tournament, he underwent surgery in early February to remove loose cartilage. In the March 2018 Tournament, Kakury≈´ was once again the only yokozuna to compete. He won 11 straight days, before suffering defeat in his match against Tochinoshin. Kakury≈´ then won his next two matches, and ensured his tournament championship in his win against G≈çeid≈ç on day 14. On day 15 Kakury≈´ faced Takayasu, the initial ruling was that Kakury≈´ had won, however a judge's conference was called to review the ruling since it had been close. They decided to have a rematch since Kakury≈´'s heel had gone out at the same time that the top of Takayasu's foot touched the ring. In the rematch, Takayasu won. Kakury≈´ finished the tournament with a 13‚Äì2 record, this was his fourth championship. In the May 2018 tournament Kakury≈´ won consecutive championships for the first time, losing only to maegashira Sh≈çh≈çzan and finishing one win ahead of Tochinoshin with a 14‚Äì1 record. However he pulled out of the following tournament in July through injury on Day 6. In September he appeared to be in excellent form and won his first ten bouts but after losing to Tochinoshin on day 11, he failed to win again and ended with a 10‚Äì5 record. He did little training in the run-up to the November 2018 tournament, affected by the right ankle injury that he first suffered in July 2017. He confirmed on November 8 that he would be withdrawing from the tournament. The same injury resulted in him pulling out of the January 2019 tournament on Day 6 with a 2‚Äì3 record. After 10-5 and 11-4 records in the March and May tournaments, Kakury≈´ won his sixth career top division championship in the July tournament with a 14‚Äì1 record. Kakury≈´ clinched the y≈´sh≈ç with a final-day win over fellow yokozuna Hakuh≈ç. In the September 2019 tournament he won his first four matches but lost three in a row to maegashira Asanoyama, Daieish≈ç and Tomokaze and withdrew on Day 8 because of a left knee injury. He moved to the Michinoku stable after the tournament, following the death of his stablemaster Izutsu Oyakata, the former Sakahoko. He withdrew on the morning of the opening day of the Kyushu tournament in November after suffering a back injury in training. He pulled out on Day 5 of the January 2020 tournament with a record of one win against three losses, the third straight tournament he has failed to complete. Kakury≈´ was designated as yokozuna-≈çzeki on the March 2020 banzuke after just one other wrestler remained at the ≈çzeki rank. It was the first time in 38 years that the yokozuna-≈çzeki designation was used. He was a runner-up for the eighth time in this tournament with a 12‚Äì3 record, but pulled out of the next tournament in July on Day 2 with an elbow injury after injuring himself in his opening match. He was absent from the following September tournament as well and his stablemaster indicated that Kakury≈´ would consider retirement if he was not healthy enough to compete in the November 2020 tournament. Fighting style In 2006, at the beginning of his top division career, Kakury≈´ was one of the lightest men in the division at around . He made use of his agility by frequently employing henka (sidestepping) to outwit his opponents. He has steadily put on weight, however, and at the time of his yokozuna promotion was around . He prefers yotsu-sumo, a style which involves grabbing the opponent's mawashi, or belt, and forcing or throwing him to the edge of the ring. His favoured grip is migi-yotsu, with his left hand placed outside and right hand inside his opponent's arms. His three most common winning techniques are yori- kiri, the force out, oshi-dashi, the push out, and hataki-komi, the slap down. He is also fond of shitatenage, the underarm throw. Personal life In January 2015 Kakury≈´ announced his engagement to a fellow Mongolian, Dashnyam Munkhzaya. Their first child, a daughter, was born in May 2015, their second, a boy, in May 2017, and their third, a girl, in April 2020. Their wedding reception was held in October 2017, with fellow yokozuna Hakuh≈ç among the guests.

He then became a merchant, engaged in shipping and commerce with the East and West Indies and South America. He served as a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He was chairman of the commissioners of prisons of Massachusetts, and president of the Boston Board of Trade and of the Commercial Club of Boston. Candler married Lucy Almira Cobb on September 1, 1851 in Boston. Cobb was the daughter of Henry and Augusta Adams Cobb.

He was the first sumo wrestler to reach the top makuuchi division officially representing South Korea. (Several other top wrestlers in the past have hid a Korean or half-Korean background). He joined sumo in 1998, making the top division for the first time in 2003. His highest rank was maegashira 3. In September 2009, he acquired Japanese citizenship. In April 2011 he was ordered to retire by the Japan Sumo Association after an investigation found him guilty of match-fixing.  Early life and sumo background  His father died when he was just three years old and his mother brought the family up alone, working days and nights as a cleaner. He went to Bupyeong High School, as did South Korean footballer Kim Nam-Il, and they remain very close friends. After winning a national Ssireum competition in 1998, he was invited by the stablemaster of the recently opened Kasugayama stable to come to Japan. He saw the opportunity to support his family back in Korea, and took a leave of absence from his university.  Career  He made his professional debut in November 1998. For his first couple of tournaments he fought under the shikona of Kimu, but this was soon changed to Kasuga≈ç, the name adapted from both his stable and his stablemaster's old fighting name of Kasugafuji. Kasuga≈ç reached the j≈´ry≈ç division in July 2002 and the top makuuchi division just three tournaments later in January 2003, after winning the second division championship in November 2002 by defeating Asasekiry≈´ on the last day. On the same day Asash≈çry≈´ won the makuuchi division title, making it the first time that two foreign born wrestlers had won the top two divisions in the same tournament. Kasuga≈ç sent all his prize money of two million yen home to his mother. In his top division debut Kasuga≈ç scored an impressive ten wins and was awarded the Fighting Spirit Prize. He progressed to maegashira 6 but then a series of poor results sent him back down to the j≈´ry≈ç division. In 2004 the Japan Sumo Association organized a tour of Seoul, and even though he had fallen to j≈´ry≈ç Kasuga≈ç was still highly sought after by the Korean sumo fans. After moving between the top two divisions a couple of times he won promotion back to makuuchi in September 2005 and reached his highest rank of maegashira 3 in March 2007. He was forced to withdraw from the May 2008 tournament with only three wins, after suffering a knee injury on the 8th day, which resulted in demotion back to the j≈´ry≈ç division. He also missed out on an exhibition tour of Los Angeles in June. He scored nine wins in the July 2008 tournament, returning him to the top division for September, but he could only turn in a disastrous 2-13 there, and was demoted to j≈´ry≈ç once again. After four tournaments away, he returned to makuuchi for the July 2009 tournament and came through with a winning record. He applied for Japanese citizenship in June 2009 and became a citizen three months later in September. A poor 3-12 score in November 2009 saw him demoted to j≈´ry≈ç again for the January 2010 tournament, but a 9-6 score was enough for an immediate re-promotion to the top division. On this occasion he lasted only one tournament before being demoted again, but he won promotion to makuuchi for the eighth time in September 2010 after another 9-6 in July. In January 2011 he took his second j≈´ry≈ç division championship, more than eight years after his first, with a 12-3 record and a play-off win over Tochinowaka.  Retirement from sumo  After an investigation by the Sumo Association into allegations of bout- rigging prompted by the discovery of text-messages on a mobile phone belonging to former maegashira Kasuganishiki, Kasuga≈ç was one of 23 wrestlers and coaches found guilty of involvement. He was ordered to retire, and submitted his letter of resignation on April 4, 2011. His danpatsu-shiki, or official retirement ceremony was held on May 28, 2011, with guests such as Hiroki Matsukata, Yoo Ji-tae and Choi Hong-man attending. Fighting style Like many wrestlers, Kasuga≈ç was fond of yotsu-sumo or grappling techniques, his most common winning move being yori-kiri or force out. His favourite grip on the mawashi was migi-yotsu, with his left hand outside and right hand inside his opponent's arms. However, he was also adept at throws, his next two most often used techniques being kote-nage, the armlock throw, and uwate-nage, the outer-arm throw.

He made his debut in 1991, reaching the top makuuchi division in 2002. His highest rank was maegashira 5. He retired in 2011 and became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name Takenawa, but admitted involvement in match- fixing after text messages were found on his mobile phone that showed he had arranged the result of bouts with fellow wrestlers the previous year. His testimony was part of the Sumo Association's investigation into the affair which led to 22 other wrestlers being found guilty, most of whom were ordered to retire. Given a two-year suspension, he instead left sumo completely. Career He made his professional debut in March 1991 (the same tournament as Chiyotenzan) and was immediately given the shikona or fighting name of Kasuganishiki, based on the name of his stable, Kasugano. He used the same shikona throughout his career. After eight years in the unsalaried lower divisions, he reached the j≈´ry≈ç division for the first time in July 1999, but could win only two matches. However, he re-established himself as a sekitori in 2001. He had a stroke of good fortune in the May 2002 tournament, when no fewer than three of his scheduled opponents had to withdraw due to injuries, an extremely rare occurrence. Thus only six of his nine wins in that tournament came through actual fights, the rest being fusensho, or default wins. He followed up with a strong 11‚Äì4 record in the next tournament, which earned him promotion to the top makuuchi division for the first time in September 2002. However, he suffered a number of injuries after that, having to sit out the May 2004 tournament completely due to cartilage damage in his right knee, which cost him his place in the top division. On his return in March 2005, he had to withdraw after only four days. He spent 20 tournaments in makuuchi in total, but did not have a kachi-koshi or winning score there after January 2007. He returned to the top division for November 2008, after a year's absence, following a 9‚Äì6 score at j≈´ry≈ç 3 and a high number of vacancies. He had to withdraw due to an injury during the Kyushu tournament and fell to the second division once again. He is known for sociable and good- natured personality, and enjoys fishing as a hobby. He was suspended along with over a dozen other wrestlers from the July 2010 tournament after admitting involvement in illegal betting on baseball. As a result, he fell to the makushita division in September, where he remained until announcing his retirement in January 2011. Retirement from sumo and match-fixing claims Kasuganishiki remained in sumo as a coach at his stable under the name Takenawa Oyakata. However, in February 2011 just a few days after his retirement announcement, news broke that police had discovered text messages on his mobile phone dating from the previous year, that indicated he had arranged the result of several matches with fellow juryo wrestlers in exchange for money. Of the 46 messages under suspicion, 22 were sent by the then- Kasuganishiki and 14 were received by him, and many describe what moves the wrestlers should make and how to make the bouts look convincing. He reportedly admitted his involvement after being questioned by the Sumo Association. Takenawa still received the severance pay awarded to retired sekitori (believed to be in the region of 15 million yen) as the match-fixing scandal did not surface until after he had retired from the ring. In March the Mainichi Daily News reported that Takenawa claimed about 40 other wrestlers were involved in the match-fixing scam, and that he first became exposed to yaocho in January 2006 when a sanyaku wrestler asked him to throw a bout. He refused on that occasion, but later became involved when injuries sent him down to juryo. His stablemaster Kasugano denied the story, while Takenawa himself refused to comment. In April, 23 wrestlers and coaches were found guilty of match-fixing. Although most were ordered to retire, Takenawa because of his admission of wrongdoing was given the lighter penalty of a two-year suspension. However, he indicated his intention to resign. Fighting style Kasuganishiki's favourite techniques are listed on his profile at the Sumo Association as pushing and thrusting, or tsuki/oshi, but his most common winning move in his career was actually yori-kiri, or force out, using the opponent's mawashi or belt. He also regularly used oshi-dashi, the push out, and hataki-komi, the slap down.

He was the youngest son of Trivikrama Panditacharya, one of the direct disciples of Sri Madhva He is the author of Sri Madhva Vijaya, a metrical biography of the rejuvenator of the Dvaita school of philosophy, Sri Madhvacharya. Indologist B. N. K. Sharma writes, \\"Narayana has earned a lasting fame for himself by his great metrical biography of Madhva\\". Works Narayana Panditacharya is credited with more than 20 literary works: * Sri Madhva Vijaya * Sangraha Ramayana * Tattva Manjari, a commentary on Sri Vishnutatvavinirnaya, the best of Dasha Prakaranas by Sri Madhvacharya * Pramanalakshana Tippani * Nayacandrika * Bhavadipa * 'Yamakabharata Tippani, a commentary on Yamakabharata'' * Krishnamritamaharnava Tippani, a commentary on Krishnamritamaharnava * Anu Madhva Vijaya * Madhva Vijaya Bhavaprakasika * Manimanjari * Subhodaya * Parijataharanam * Yoga dipika * Shiva Stuti * Anu Vayustuti * Laghutaratamya Stotra * Narasimha Stuti * Tithitraya Nirnaya * Amsamsinirnaya =Sri Madhva Vijaya= His epic work Madhwavijaya consists of 16 sargas or cantos, and gives extensive insights into the life and philosophy of Madhvacharya. It is the only authentic work available on Sri Madhva, as Narayana Panditacharya was a contemporary of Sri Madhva. He has also written his own commentary on Sumadhvavijaya, in which he explains the real names of the Sanskritised Kannada and Tulu names of persons and places in Sumadhvavijaya. This is called \\"Bhavaprakashika\\". Without this commentary it would be difficult to understand the poem itself. =Sangraha Ramayana= Sangraha Ramayana is a condensed form of Valmiki Ramayana, with more than 3,000 slokas, written in accordance with the Sri Rama's story as told by Sri Madhvacharya in his \\"Sriman Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya\\". Sangraha Ramayana was printed in 1890 AD, has been reprinted (in November 2008) with Kannada translation by Dr. Vyasanakere Prabhanjanacharya. \\"Prameya Nava Malika\\" also known as \\"Anu Madhva Vijaya\\" is a condensed form of Sri Madhvacharya's Biography told in just 32 Slokas. Sri Raghavendra Swami has written a commentary on it in his Purvashrma days. =Other notable works= Manimanjari and Shubodaya are his other kavyas. Manimanjari gives account of the history of Vaishnava Acharyas before the advent of Sri Madhvacharya. It has eight cantos or sargas written in simple Sanskrit poetry. It is, in fact, one of the first Sanskrit poems taught in the traditional Madhva learning circles. In the first two sargas Ramavatara story is narrated briefly, Third and Fourth sargas deal with the Krishnavatara story. The last four sargas deal with the history of Vaishnava Acharyas prior to Sri Madhvacarya and the eighth sarga ends with the advent of Sri Madhvacarya. Sumadhvavijaya is a continuation of this. There are about half a dozen Sanskrit commentaries on this and a couple of them are in print. Shubodaya is an adhyatma kavya where the poet experiments with different meters. Personal life Narayana Pandita's home is still there in Karsargod district of Kerala and is called \\"Kavu Mutt\\". His descendants still live there. The icon of Srivasta Narayana handed over by Sri Madhvacharya to Sri Trivikrama Panditacharya is still worshipped there. There also is a vrindavana there, where he was entombed. This also gives rise to a doubt that he might have been ordained as a sanyasi in his old age.

His highest rank was maegashira 8. Career He joined sumo in March 2000, shortly before his 17th birthday, making him young by the standards of most foreign recruits. He took part in a seven way play-off for the title in the third makushita division in January 2003, but his progress was slowed by a neck injury that forced him to sit out the November 2003 tournament. After a year of steady progress he won promotion to the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division in July 2006. He entered the top makuuchi division in May 2007, producing a 10-5 record at maegashira 14. However he could manage only five wins in the next tournament and was demoted back to the second division after a 3-12 score in September 2007. An 8-7 mark at the rank of j≈´ry≈ç 2 in January 2008 was enough to return him to the top division but he could not manage a winning score and so was demoted once again. In May 2008 he turned in a disappointing 5-10 score at j≈´ry≈ç 5. In July he recovered from a poor 1-6 start to finish 8-7. However a 4-11 mark at j≈´ry≈ç 10 in November 2008 saw him fall back to the unsalaried makushita division for the January 2009 tournament. He withdrew from that tournament with an injury after recording only one win and two losses, and produced another losing score of 3-4 in March 2009. For the rest of his career, he remained firmly stuck in the mid-to-lower makushita ranks, without even coming close to a return to j≈´ry≈ç. Ry≈´≈ç was from the same stable as yokozuna Hakuh≈ç, and as he was the only other wrestler with sekitori experience in the stable, he was Hakuh≈ç's main training partner. After losing sekitori status he also served as the yokozuna's personal attendant or tsukebito. In September 2010 he was rebuked by the Japan Sumo Association for visiting the locker room of Hakuh≈ç's opponent, Aran, prior to the match. Retirement from sumo Ry≈´≈ç retired from sumo in July 2013. His danpatsu-shiki was held on September 1, 2013. He was presented with a specially-made ‚Äúkantosho‚Äù trophy by Hakuh√µ to make up for the fact that he missed out on the Fighting Spirit Award in his top division debut despite ten wins. He has maintained his connection with Hakuh≈ç by working as his personal manager, and marrying the daughter of Hakuh≈ç‚Äôs aunt. Fighting style Unlike most of his Mongolian compatriots, Ry≈´≈ç specialised in pushing rather than throwing techniques and he was noted for his strong tachi-ai, or opening charge at the beginning of matches. Like many pusher-thrusters, however, he was vulnerable to throws by opponents more skilled on the mawashi if he was unable to win in the first few seconds.

Aka Manah is the demon of sensual desire that was sent by Ahriman to seduce the prophet Zoroaster. His eternal opponent is Vohu Manah. Aka Manah is the hypostatic abstraction of accusative akem manah (ak”ôm manah), \\"manah made evil\\". The objectification of this malign influence is the demon Aka/Akem Manah, who appears in later texts as Middle Persian Akoman and New Persian Akvan. In scripture =In the Gathas= The concept of akem manah is already attested in the Gathas, the oldest texts of Zoroastrianism and believed to have been composed by Zoroaster himself. In two of the three instances where the term is used in these ancient texts, akem manah is an attribute of humans. In Yasna 33.4, the poet promises to counter his own \\"disobedience and aka manah\\" through worship. In Yasna 47.5, aka manah is the motivation (the state of mind) that causes deceitful actions. In the third instance where the term appears, Akem Manah is a property of the daevas, entities that in later Zoroastrianism are demons but in the Gathas are gods that are to be rejected. There, in Yasna 32.3, the daevas are identified as the offspring, not of angra mainyu, but of akem manah. Related to, but not entirely equivalent to akem manah, are other terms that express similar ideas. The first is aka mainyu \\"evil spirit\\" or \\"evil instrument,\\" which in the Gathas is contrasted with spenta mainyu \\"bounteous spirit,\\" the instrument through which Ahura Mazda realized (\\"with his thought\\") creation. The other term is angra mainyu \\"destructive spirit,\\" which in Zoroastrian tradition is the epitome of evil, but in the Gathas is the other absolute antitheses of spenta mainyu. Gathic akem manah may also be equated with acishtem manah \\"worst thinking,\\"cf. . which reflects the later Zoroastrian opposition between akem manah and vohu manah, \\"good purpose.\\" In Yasna 32.13, the abode of the wicked is acishtem manah. =In the Younger Avesta= In the Younger Avesta, Akem Manah is unambiguously a demonic entity, an auxiliary of Angra Mainyu. In Yasht 19.46, Aka Manah, Aeshma, Azi Dahaka and Spityura battle Vohu Manah, Asha Vahishta and Atar for the possession of khvarenah. Later in the same hymn (19.96), Aka Manah is predicted to be in battle with Vohu Manah at the final renovation of the world, at which time Aka Manah ‚Äì as all the other daevas also - will be vanquished. In Vendidad 19's account of the temptation of Zoroaster, Aka Manah poses ninety-nine questions to weaken the prophet's conviction in Ahura Mazda. Zoroaster does not succumb to the trick. In tradition and folklore =In the Pahlavi texts= In the Zoroastrian texts of the 9th-12th centuries, Akoman (Middle Persian for Akem Manah) is the second of Ahriman's (MP for Angra Mainyu) creatures (Bundahishn 1.24), devised to counter Ohrmuzd's (Ahura Mazda's) creation of the world. This rank reflects Akem Manah's opposition to Vohu Manah (cf. Bundahishn 30.29), who is the second of the Amesha Spentas. Also reflecting the hierarchy that mirrors the Amesha Spentas and in which each of the \\"bounteous immortals\\" has collaborators (hamkars), Akoman has a special relationship with Anashtih \\"non-peace\\". Akoman is also close to Varun/Varan \\"lust\\" or \\"concupiscence,\\" together with whom (so Denkard 3.33) was created. In the Epistles of Zadspram (14.8), Akoman is first among the demons who try to injure Zoroaster before and at his birth. He was however \\"easily defeated by his own weapon of deceit being turned against him. Vohuman, who had chased him to the spot, schemingly turned back and asked him to enter the house. Akoman thought that as his rival was leaving the place, his own work was finished, and consequently [left as well] without accomplishing anything.\\". The ability to make righteous decisions is blunted by Akoman (Denkard 3.116). He is the cause of evil intent, and a mortal so afflicted searches for \\"gross defects\\" in others while hiding his own (3.255). Denkard 8 attributes the crying of new-born infants to Akoman, reasoning that the demon frightens the children with ghastly images of the final renovation of the world. According to Denkard 9.30.8 (reflecting chapter 7.8 of the Warsht-mansr Nask, a lost Avestan text), Akoman causes a mortal's failure to discriminate between good and evil. He so introduces discord and - as a consequence - physical evil in the world (Denkard 6). He perverts a man's thoughts and makes him miserable.. Among all the demons, Akoman is to be dreaded the most (Denkard 9). =In the Shahnameh= Akvan e Div digs up the ground around the Rostam, Library of Congress, 16th-17th centuries In Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, Akvan is described as having long hair, blue eyes and a head like an elephants with a mouthful of tusks instead of teeth. In one of the tales, the demon traps Rostam while the hero is asleep, and carries him up into the sky. He then asks Rostam whether he would prefer to be thrown upon a mountain, or into the sea. Rostam, aware that the demon's mind is perverse (cf. In the Pahlavi texts above), asks to be thrown upon a mountain, and the demon in response throws him into the sea. Rescuing himself from the waters, Rostam recovers his horse and confronts the demon again, subsequently beheading it. Another story has an oblique reference to a \\"Stone of Akvan\\", suggesting that there were once other legends surrounding Akvan/Akoman that have not however survived..

Bacaloglu, also known as Bakaloglu, Bacaloglu-Densusianu, Bacaloglu- Densu»ôeanu etc. (Francized H√©l√®ne Bacaloglu; December 19, 1878 ‚Äì 1947 or 1949), was a Romanian journalist, literary critic, novelist and fascist militant. Her career in letters produced an introduction to the work of Maurice Maeterlinck (1903), several other critical essays, and two novels. She married and divorced writer Radu D. Rosetti, then Ovid Densusianu, the Symbolist poet and literary theorist. Bacaloglu lived most of her later life in the Kingdom of Italy, where she affiliated with the literary and political circles. Her subsequent work included campaigns for Pan-Latinism and Romanian irredentism. This second career peaked upon the close of World War I, when Bacaloglu became involved with Italian fascism. Introduced to Benito Mussolini and Benedetto Croce, she helped transplant fascism on Romanian soil. Her National Italo-Romanian Cultural and Economic Movement was a minor and heterodox political party, but managed to earn attention with its advocacy of political violence. This classical Romanian fascist movement merged into the more powerful National Romanian Fascio, then reconstructed itself under Bacalogu's own leadership. It survived the troubles of 1923, but was disbanded by government order in 1925, and was entirely eclipsed by the Iron Guard. Shunned by Mussolini, Bacaloglu lived her final decades in relative obscurity, enmeshed in political intrigues. Her fascist ideas were taken up by some in her family, including her brother Sandi and her son Ovid O. Densusianu.

In June 1898, she attempted suicide by shooting herself in the chest, and was saved by an emergency intervention on her right lung.

In Bacaloglu's interpretation, Symbolism and Decadentism were the two sides of a coin: while the Decadents gave voice to the late-19th-century \\"degeneration\\" of the Latin race, the Symbolists epitomized the Latin \\"revival\\", a triumph of mysteries and metaphysics. Straddling these two eras were Maeterlinck's Hothouses, which she was the first to discuss from a Romanian perspective.Mitchievici, p.131‚Äì133, 135 According to literary historian Angelo Mitchievici, Despre simbolizm tackles the literary critic's perspective as a \\"participatory-impressionistic formula, not lacking in refinement\\".Mitchievici, p.132 Bacaloglu's studio photograph and autographed dedication, 1914 In 1906, Bacaloglu also published her psychological novel, √én luptƒÉ (\\"In Combat\\"), followed in 1908 by another novelistic work, DouƒÉ tor»õe (\\"Two Torches\\").Calangiu et al., p.xxi; Onofrei et al., p.243 Her writing was poorly reviewed by the literary chronicler at Via»õa Rom√¢neascƒÉ, who argued that √én luptƒÉ was impossible to read through.P.

She later married a third time, to an Italian.Payne, p.135 In the early 1910s, Bacaloglu was living in Rome, where, in September 1912, she published a monograph about the love affair between Romanian poet Gheorghe Asachi and his Italian muse, Bianca Milesi.Calangiu et al., p.xxi; CƒÉlinescu, p.983; Onofrei et al., p.242‚Äì243 A recipient of the Bene Merenti medal, granted by the Romanian King Carol I,Burcea (2005), p.101 she translated into French the prose work of his consort, Carmen Sylva.\\"Transeuntes literarios\\", in La Gaceta Literaria, Nr. 46/1928, p.4 She also represented Romania at the Castel Sant'Angelo National Exhibit, and, as \\"H√©l√®ne Bacaloglu\\", gave French-language conferences about Di Giacomo. During the period, she came into conflict with Romanian antiquarian Alexandru Tzigara-Samurca»ô. Mandated by the Romanian government, Tzigara replaced Bacaloglu at the National Exhibit's Romanian Committee. He described Bacaloglu as an illegitimate, self-appointed, representative, and noted that the Italian press also mistrusted her abilities.Alexandru Tzigara-Samurca»ô, Memorii. II: 1910‚Äì1918, Grai »ôi Suflet ‚Äì Cultura Na»õionalƒÉ, Bucharest, 1999, p.9. Bacaloglu presented her own version of the events in a protest to the curators, later published as a brochure.\\"Memento\\", in Noua RevistƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ, Nr. 23/1912, p.356; Onofrei et al., p.243 Her conferences on Di Giacomo were received with more sympathy: Alberto Cappelletti gave them a good review in Il Giorno, and E. Console republished them as a fascicle, but all such collaborations ended abruptly when her collaborators became dissatisfied with her character and the quality of her prose.Sallusto, p.174‚Äì175 She still continued to be held in esteem by her Romanian peers and, in 1912, was voted into their Romanian Writers' Society. Shortly after the outbreak of World War I, Bacaloglu turned to political activism and interventionism, campaigning for still-neutral Romania to join the Entente Powers, and supporting the annexation of Romanian-inhabited Transylvania. To this goal, she published in Bucharest the Italian-language essay Per la Grande Rumania (\\"For Greater Romania\\") and the French-language Preuves d'amour. Conf√©rences patriotiques (\\"Proofs of Love. Patriotic Conferences\\"). In Bacaloglu's activity, irredentism blended with the cause of Pan-Latinism. She joined the Pan-Latin association Latina Gens, which welcomed in members of all \\"Latin\\" nations and looked forward to a \\"Latin federation\\" of states.Tomi, p.280‚Äì282 Working for this organization, she became close to Italian General Luigi Cadorna, described by Romanian officials as her \\"protector\\", \\"2a tornata di venerd√¨ 16 giugno 1922. Interrogazioni e interpellanza\\", in Atti Parlamentari. Legislatura XXVI: CXXVII, p.6329 and Foreign Minister Sidney Sonnino. Bacaloglu (back row, marked 5) and the Latina Gens, gathered around Sebasti√£o de Magalh√£es Lima (1) and Jules Destr√©e (2), in July 1916 Her efforts to popularize the Romanian cause among the troops fighting on the northern Italian front were interrupted in October 1917 by the Battle of Caporetto, which Italy lost, forcing Bacaloglu to take refuge in Genoa. She subsequently played a part in creating the \\"Romanian Legion in Italy\\". Grouping Romanians from Transylvania and Italian sympathizers, this military formation fought the Central Powers in Italy. However, Bacalogu and Latina Gens were not invited at the Legion's founding ceremony, held at Cittaducale in June 1918.Tomi, p.281‚Äì282 According to Victor Babe»ô, the Transylvanian doctor and publicist, Elena Bacaloglu was \\"the great propagandist of Romanianism abroad, and especially so in Italy\\".Babe»ô, p.12 The cause of \\"Greater Romania\\" fascinated two of Bacaloglu's three brothers: Victor, the author of patriotic plays,Onofrei et al., p.242 created one of the first all-Romanian newspapers in Bessarabia; George fought with distinction during the war of 1916, fulfilled several diplomatic missions, and was later a Prefect of Bihor County, Transylvania.Babe»ô, p.12‚Äì13 Elena, Constantin and Victor were all correspondents for George Bacaloglu's cultural review, Cele Trei Cri»ôuri, well into the 1930s.Ileana-Stanca Desa, Elena Ioana MƒÉlu»ôanu, Cornelia Lumini»õa Radu, Iliana SulicƒÉ, Publica»õiile periodice rom√¢ne»ôti (ziare, gazete, reviste). Vol. V, 1: Catalog alfabetic 1931‚Äì1935, Editura Academiei, Bucharest, 2009, p.261. =Fascist experiment= After the war, Elena Bacaloglu remained in Italy as a correspondent of Universul, the Bucharest daily.\\"O mare prietenƒÉ...\\", p.95 One of the first Romanians to gain familiarity with the modern far-right movements in Europe, and, historians assess, driven by an \\"enormous ambition\\",Bucur, p.77; Heinen, p.103 she contemplated transplanting Italian fascism into Greater Romania. This project had preoccupied her since the \\"red biennium\\" of 1919‚Äì1920, when she presented a proto-fascist appeal to the Italian nationalist Gabriele d'AnnunzioHeinen, p.103 and wrote articles for Il Popolo d'Italia.\\"O mare prietenƒÉ...\\", p.95‚Äì96 Benito Mussolini, who presided over the Fasci Italiani paramilitaries, also received Bacologlu's letters, but was noticeably skeptical at first. She also addressed Italian journalists Giuseppe Bottai and Piero Bolzon, who agreed to become members of Bacaloglu's Romanian fascist steering committee. At the time, Bacaloglu was also a friend of philosopher and fascist admirer Benedetto Croce, and corresponded with him on a regular basis. Just as she was embarking on this ideological mission, Bacaloglu was drawn into a conflict with the Romanian political establishment. In the Italian Chamber of Deputies, Mussolini's National Fascist Party took up her cause: in August 1920, deputy Luigi Federzoni accused the Romanian state of trying to kidnap and silence Bacaloglu, \\"a person of the highest respectability\\". \\"2a tornata di luned√¨ 2 agosto 1920. Interrogazioni e interpellanza\\", in Atti Parlamentari. Legislatura XXV: LXXIX, p.4672 In 1922, the tribunal of Casale Monferrato heard her complaint against Romania over copyright issues. Bacaloglu again complained that Romanian Siguran»õa agents tried to kidnap her during the Genoa Conference. The same year, fascist deputy Alessandro Dudan took Bacaloglu's side in her conflict with Romanian authorities, noting that the latter were abusing their powers. Bacaloglu and her claims were shunned by successive Romanian Ambassadors, who simply noted that she suffered from a \\"mania for persecution\\". Mussolini himself acknowledged Bacaloglu's admiration. He corresponded with Bacaloglu, sending her point-by-point instructions about \\"Latin expansionism\\" and about economic cooperation against capitalism. These were made public by Bacaloglu in her brochure Movimento nazionale fascista italo-romeno. Creazione e governo (\\"National Italo-Romanian Fascist Movement. Creation and Steering\\"), published in Milan after Mussolini's victorious \\"March on Rome\\".Epure, p.116; Heinen, p.103 Seeking to \\"draw the fascist chief [Mussolini] closer to Romania's political course\\",\\"O mare prietenƒÉ...\\", p.96 Bacaloglu also made visible efforts to prevent a rapprochement between Italy and Romania's rival, Regency Hungary. She denounced Romania's foreign policies in articles she wrote for the Italian newspapers, depicting liberal politicians as lackeys of the French Republic.Epure, p.116 At some point in 1921, with Mussolini's acquiescence, Bacaloglu established an Italo‚ÄìRomanian fascist association, later known as National Italo-Romanian Cultural and Economic Movement (MNFIR).Clark, p.38; Heinen, p.102‚Äì104 Her followers began setting up fascist leagues in Romania‚Äîone of the first such clubs was founded in the Transylvanian regional capital, Cluj.Attila Gid√≥, DouƒÉ decenii. Evreii din Cluj √Æn perioada interbelicƒÉ, Editura Institutului pentru Studierea Problemelor MinoritƒÉ»õilor Na»õionale, Cluj-Napoca, 2014, p.139. The main difference between the Italian and Romanian fascists was their respective stance on the \\"Jewish Question\\": the Italo-Romanian Movement was antisemitic; the original Fasci were not.Francisco Veiga, La m√≠stica del ultranacionalismo: Historia de la Guardia de Hierro, Rumania, 1919‚Äì1941, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Bellaterra, 1989, p.140. The goal was supported by other Constantin Bacaloglu, in his work at Ia»ôi University. Working with the antisemitic opinion leader, A. C. Cuza, he gave endorsement to rioters who called for the expulsion of most Romanian Jewish students, and tolerated fascist symbolism.NastasƒÉ (2011), p.218, 234, 238, 240, 243, 268, 301, 304‚Äì305 However, according to political scientist Emanuela Costantini, the antisemitic agenda of the Movement was comparatively \\"moderate\\"; she highlights instead Bacaloglu's other ideas: \\"an anti-industrialism in the populist mold\\", and a version of nationalism heavily inspired by the Action Fran√ßaise.Constantini, p.20 The Romanian branch of Italian fascism was always minor, and vied for attention with a plethora of paramilitary groups. As suggested by Costantini, it shared their anticommunism and contempt for democracy, but was the only one to be directly inspired by Mussolini.Constantini, p.19 In 1922, MNFIR split, and its more powerful sections, presided upon by Titus Panaitescu Vifor, merged with the National Romanian Fascio (FNR).Clark, p. 38; Heinen, p.103‚Äì104 However, in 1923, Bacaloglu reentered central politics as leader of the reconstructed MNFIR, directly modeled on the Fasci Italiani.Bucur, p.77; Constantini, p.19‚Äì20; Epure, p.115‚Äì116; Heinen, p.102‚Äì104 On December 30 of that year, she founded the propaganda weekly Mi»ôcarea Na»õionalƒÉ FascistƒÉ, of which she was also the \\"political director\\".Marin Petcu (ed.), Istoria jurnalismului din Rom√¢nia √Æn date. Enciclopedie cronologicƒÉ, Polirom, Ia»ôi, 2012, p.1941. Only about a hundred people were persuaded to join,Bucur, p.77; Constantini, p.20; Heinen, p.103 even though, as historian Francisco Veiga notes, many represented the more active strata of Romanian society (soldiers, students). Powerful cells gravitated around the University of Cluj (Transylvania)Constantini, p.20; Heinen, p.103 and Constantin Bacaloglu's own Ia»ôi University.NastasƒÉ (2011), p.40 Women themselves were largely absent: still not granted the vote under the 1923 Constitution, they generally preferred enrollment in specifically feminist organizations, and were never popular with the more significant Romanian fascist parties (including, from 1927, the Iron Guard).Bucur, passim =Antifascist clampdown and disgrace= Throughout its short existence, Bacaloglu's association was very vocal in condemning the Romanian status-quo and the Treaty of Versailles. She believed that the Little Entente, which was partly dedicated to countering Italian irredentism but included Romania, would leave the two countries prey to capitalist and Jewish exploitation.Heinen, p.102‚Äì103 Some reports suggest that the \\"Romanian fascio\\" took it upon itself to threaten enemies of the deposed, but politically ambitious, Crown Prince Carol (who did not in fact approve of the Romanian fascists). Petre »öurlea, \\"Din nou despre pozi»õia Partidului Na»õionalist Democrat fa»õƒÉ de evrei\\", in Vasile Ciobanu, Sorin Radu (eds.), Partide politice »ôi minoritƒÉ»õi na»õionale din Rom√¢nia √Æn secolul XX, Vol. IV, TechnoMedia, Sibiu, 2009, p.139. In October 1923, Nicolae Iorga, a historian who opposed Carol's return, accused the organization of sending him hate mail. The MNFIR became the object of government repression, soon after the antisemitic student Corneliu Zelea Codreanu was arrested on charges of terrorism. Codreanu had attempted to assassinate the staff of AdevƒÉrul, including the Jewish manager Iacob Rosenthal, and, during the interrogations, implicated other fascist alliances. His testimony was disputed by Vestul Rom√¢niei, the pro-fascist newspaper of Timi»ôoara, which claimed: \\"The attempt [...] is not the work of terrorists, as was quickly proclaimed by some of our colleagues, but the mere revenge of one Sandi Bacaloglu who wished to defend the honor of his sister, that had been compromised by one AdevƒÉrul article, wherein it had been claimed that Elena Bacaloglu had been convicted for immodesty by the appellate court of Genoa.\\"Vestul Rom√¢niei, Nr. 32/1923, p.3 Several other theories circulate regarding Codreanu's motivation, but it is known that his group of assassins included an FNR man, Teodosie Popescu, and also that the act was celebrated in the FNR media.Clark, p.56, 60, 203 The news was taken up in another Transylvanian paper, Clujul, which claimed that \\"the lawyer Bacaloglu\\" had \\"taken revenge on his sister's slanderer\\". \\"Martirul Rosenthal\\", in Clujul, Nr. 31/1923 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Also according to Clujul, Vifor, who lived in Rome and was not involved in the Rosenthal incident, remained recognized as the \\"fascist leader\\"‚Äîas FNR president. Meanwhile, George Bacaloglu, interviewed by the press, denied any connection with his sister's movement. \\"Fascismul √Æn Bihor\\", in Vestul Rom√¢niei, Nr. 29/1923, p.2 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) According to historian Armin Heinen, the MNFIR was never a fully fledged party, whereas Vifor's more powerful movement could present a more attractive platform to some of Bacaloglu's disillusioned followers.Heinen, p.103‚Äì105 The FNR was explicitly Nazi as well as corporatist, and as such still had little to do with the Mussolinian program.Payne, p.135‚Äì136 Somewhat larger in numbers, it managed to absorb two other nationalist political clubs, emerging from this fusion with a program supporting dictatorial politics and the expulsion of all foreigners.Constantini, p.20; Heinen, p.104 Sandi Bacaloglu was soon imprisoned, facing charges of attempted assassination and sedition.Vestul Rom√¢niei, Nr. 32/1923, p.4 The court only cleared him of the more serious charges, and fined him 50 Lei.\\"»òtiri\\", in Rena»ôterea. Organul Oficial al Eparhiei Ortodoxe a Vadului, Feleacului, Geoagiului »ôi Clujului, Nr. 26/1924, p.7 Accounts differ as to what became of Elena Bacaloglu's fascist party. She is credited as a founder of the successor National Fascist Movement (MNF), closed down by Romanian Police in 1925.Constantini, p.20; Heinen, p.103; Payne, p.135 However, this mainly Transylvanian party did not have a direct link with the Bacaloglus. Before the police clampdown, the FNR announced in Clujul its goal of destroying \\"the intrigues of foreigners\\", and its motto (\\"The Fascio does not forget!\\"). \\"Mi»ôcarea fa»ôcistilor rom√¢ni. Programul fa»ôcistilor\\", in Clujul, Nr. 6/1924 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) It also informed Transylvanians that Sandi Bacaloglu, recently freed and presenting himself as a Mussolini envoy, was not a fascist, and could not claim to represent any local fascist party. Bacaloglu became a persona non grata and was deported from Italy once Mussolini grew aware of her dissident stance.Burcea (2005), p.101, 106; Constantini, p.20; Heinen, p.103 A Romanian police report of the period suggests that \\"the Fascist Party of Romania\\" intended to join up with Cuza and Codreanu's National-Christian Defense League (LANC) and the Romanian Action, into a \\"National Christian Party\\".NastasƒÉ (2011), p.324‚Äì325 In October 1925, however, Cuza officially announced that the National Romanian Fascio, the Romanian Action, and the Transylvanian Social-Christian Party had voted to dissolve and merge with the League, with the common goal being \\"the elimination of the kikes\\". Sandi Bacaloglu signed his name to the appeal as a Fascio representative, and became a member of the LANC's executive council, on par with Ioan Mo»õa, Ion Zelea Codreanu, Iuliu Ha»õieganu, Valeriu Pop, Iuniu Lecca. A. C. Cuza, \\"Chemare cƒÉtre to»õi rom√¢nii\\", in √énfrƒÉ»õirea Rom√¢neascƒÉ, Nr. 11/1925, p.3‚Äì4, 10 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library). See also Mezarescu, p.47‚Äì48 Afterward, Sandi Bacaloglu ran in the general election of 1926 on the same list as Cuza and Codreanu.\\"200 Anti- Semitic Leaders Are Candidates for Election in Roumania\\", Jewish Telegraphic Agency release, May 12, 1926 1928 manifesto of the National-Christian Defense League, published under the swastika logo. It proclaims: \\"Romanian brethren! The Land of the Romanians faces a great peril. The kikes, with assistance from Judaized Romanians and the political parties, as tools of the kikes, are gambling with the future of the Country and Folk.\\" In 1927, his sister still held claim to being leader of \\"the national fascist movement\\", with temporary headquarters in \\"the Solacoglu House\\", Mo»ôilor.Moldovan, p.42 She also pursued her dispute with the Romanian state. She claimed that the authorities still owed her some 4 million Lei, which she tried to obtain from Interior Affairs Minister Octavian Goga and from Writers' Society president Liviu Rebreanu. In her letters to Rebreanu, she made transparent allusions to the possibility of mutual help but, researcher Andrei Moldovan suggests, was incoherent and needlessly haughty.Moldovan, p.24 =Later years= In 1928, Bacaloglu left Romania on a visit to the Kingdom of Spain, where she continued to campaign for Pan-Latinism and collaborated with La Gaceta Literaria. The latter introduced her as \\"that Central European feminine type, dedicated to journalism, to embassy work, to zigzagging and daring missions.\\" For his part, Vifor had probably put his activity on hold by January 1929, when he was assigned a diplomatic post in Barcelona. \\"C√°mara de Comercio rumanoespa√±ola\\", in La Vanguardia, January 9, 1929, p.8 (hosted by La Hemeroteca de La Vanguardia desde 1881) He later returned to Bucharest as a representative of Balcan Oriente news agency.Burcea (2005), p.102 Also in 1929, the Romanian fascio was revived a third and final time, when a certain Colonel August Stoica tried to use it in his coup against government, variously described as an \\"operatic plot\\" or a \\"shambolic conspiracy\\".Bazil Gruia, \\"Complotul fascist\\", in Chemarea Tinerimei Rom√¢ne, Nr. 21/1929, p.4 The conspirators were rounded up and made subject to a public trial, during which prosecution invoked the M√¢rzescu Law against fascist as well as communist sedition.\\"Procesul fasci»ôtilor\\", in Dreptatea, September 15, 1929, p.2 Bacaloglu herself remained active on the margin of Romanian politics, witnessing from the side as Prince Carol retook his throne with the help of Iuliu Maniu and the National Peasants' Party. She approached the Maniu government and the Foreign Ministry with offers of support and complaints about past persecutions, but these were poorly received. She was eventually allowed to return to Italy in support of the Romanian propaganda effort, protected by the National Peasantist undersecretary, Savel RƒÉdulescu (and, allegedly, by the League of Nations' Nicolae Titulescu), but lost endorsement in a subsequent transfer of power.Burcea (2005), p.101, 106 She continued with her appeals to Rebreanu (who was also being asked to help George Bacaloglu revive Cele Trei Cri»ôuri)Moldovan, p.45‚Äì46 and writer-bureaucrat Eugen Filotti. In 1931, she claimed that a conspiracy, headed by diplomat Filip Lahovary and the leaders of the National Liberal Party, wanted to assassinate her \\"through hunger\\" and prevented her from even talking to people of influence.Moldovan, p.44 Bacaloglu also stated that, in exchange for recognition of financial support, she could obtain Mussolini's endorsement for the National Peasantists, who were in the opposition. Sandi Bacaloglu carried on a LANC activist and then joined the successor National Christian Party (PNC), running in the legislative election of 1937 in Bucharest's Black Sector.Mezarescu, p.327 As a Bucharest PNC leader, he also led street battles with a more minor LANC splinter group, the Fire Swastika.\\"IncƒÉerare √Æntre cuzi»ôti »ôi membri ai grupƒÉrii 'Svastica de foc'\\", in AdevƒÉrul, May 30, 1937, p.5 By then, Elena's son by Densusianu was also entering public life. Educated in Italy and Romania, Ovid Jr trained as a schoolteacher and then became a press officer at the Interior Ministry.NastasƒÉ (2010), p.310 He also had prospects of becoming a writer, and is especially remembered for a 1937 novel, StƒÉp√¢nul (\\"The Master\\").Calangiu et al., p.xxxvi; CƒÉlinescu, p.1032 He adhered to his mother and uncle's fascist ideology: he was a staff writer for the Iron Guard paper Porunca Vremii, translated the political essays of Mussolini and Antonio Beltramelli, and campaigned in support of Italy during the Ethiopian War. In May 1936, he helped Mihail Manoilescu establish the local network of Fascist Action Committees (CAUR).Veronica Turcu»ô, \\"Din raporturile intelectualitƒÉ»õii universitare clujene interbelice cu elita academicƒÉ italianƒÉ: Emil Panaitescu √Æn coresponden»õƒÉ cu Giuseppe Lugli\\", in the Romanian Academy (George Bari»õ Institute of History) Historica Yearbook 2011, p.10 Always a staunch critic of fascism,Perpessicius, \\"Note.

See also Calangiu et al., p.lxxvi A year into World War II, Elena was again living in Rome, but had to return to Romania because, as she put it, \\"fake Latin nationalists\\" wanted her gone. She was issued new papers attesting her move to Bucharest, and was still living there in April 1945.\\"Partea II. Particulare\\", in Monitorul Oficial, April 24, 1945, p.2520 During the same interval, Titus Vifor reactivated his fascism. He was assigned by the Iron Guard's \\"National Legionary State\\" to direct the Romanian Propaganda Office in Rome, together with writers Aron Cotru»ô and VintilƒÉ Horia, Carmen Burcea, \\"L'immagine della Romania sulla stampa del Ventennio (II)\\" , in The Romanian Review of Political Sciences and International Relations, No. 2/2010, p.31 and, in May 1941, became its president. In old age, Bacaloglu witnessed the August 1944 Coup, Soviet occupation, and the transition from fascism to democracy, then to communism. In 1947 she sold the letters she had received from Italian literati to the publicist I. E. Torou»õiu, who passed them on to the Romanian Academy Library. She maintained friendly contacts with the left-leaning writer Gala Galaction, but nevertheless lived to see the effects of political retaliation and recession on the Bacaloglu family: her daughter by Rosetti was sacked from her government job. Bacaloglu died later that year (or, according to some sources, in 1949),Calangiu et al., p.xxxv and was buried in Bellu cemetery. She was survived by Ovid Jr. After the official establishment of Communist Romania, he focused on his work as a philologist, but was still arrested in 1958, and spent six years as a political prisoner. He died in Bucharest, on April 19, 1985.

He was the son of Louis Baillie Reynolds, a stockbroker, and novelist Gertrude Minnie Robins. He studied at Hertford College, Oxford between 1915‚Äì1919, his studies being interrupted by World War I. He served in the Royal Artillery. By 1921, he had become a Pelham student at the British School in Rome. While Rome he wrote books and articles for which he is well remembered (e.g., The Troops Quartered in the Castra Peregrina JRS 13 1923, pages 168‚Äì87; The Vigiles of Imperial Rome, Oxford 1926). Baillie Reynolds extensively researched the remains of ancient Rome's aqueducts. He stayed at Rome until 1923. In 1924, Baillie Reynolds became a lecturer on Ancient history at Aberystwyth University. While at Aberystwyth, he also directed the excavations of Kanovium, the Roman fort at Caerhun, North Wales, over a period of four summers from 1926. He published a series of reports on these excavations in Archaeologia Cambrensis, which were published as a collection in 1938; they are considered a classic study of their type. At this time he also published numerous books and reports on archaeological sites in Britain and beyond. He is best known for his book, \\"The Vigiles of Imperial Rome\\" (1926). In 1934 he became an Inspector of Ancient Monuments, England, and Chief Inspector from 1954 to 1961. As an Inspector, he wrote guide books for some of the many sites under Government care, some of which remained in print for over twenty years (e.g., \\"Chysauster\\" Cornwall, HMSO Guides, London 1960).

History Tarragona has been renowned for its sweet red wines since the times of the ancient Romans, when it was exported to Rome. The area under vines expanded greatly in the nineteenth century to the point that in 1900 over 50% of the province was covered by vineyards. It was badly affected by the outbreak of the phylloxera plague at that time. In 1932 the wines from the area were given a form of legal protection, and in 1945 it acquired DO status. Geography The vineyards are located along the coast and extend inland towards the border with the province of Lleida. There are two official sub-zones: Camp de Tarragona is the largest one containing 70% of the vines and extending around the north and east of Tarragona in a radius of 30 km, at an altitude of abround 200 m above sea level. The second sub-zone, Ribera d‚ÄôEbre, is located to the south and west of Tarragona. The vines here are on small plateaus on the banks of the River Ebro at an altitude of between 100 m to 400 m above sea level. Soils In Camp de Taragona, the soils are dark with a considerable content of lime, while the sub soil is alluvial. In Ribera d‚ÄôEbre the soils are fertile and alluvial in nature, especially if close to the river. Climate The climate is Mediterranean with continental influences in the higher part of the Ebro river valley. Annual rainfall varies between 475 mm in Camp de Tarragona and 650 mm in the Ribera d‚ÄôEbre. The average annual temperature is 16¬∞C (max 35¬∞C in summer, min 3¬∞C in winter). The risk of frost is very slight. Authorised Grape Varieties The authorised grape varieties are: * Red: Ull de llebre, Sumoll, Carinenya, Garnatxa Negra, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir, and Syrah * White: Macabeu, Cartoix√† / Xarel¬∑lo, Parellada, Moscatel de Frontignan, Moscatell d‚ÄôAlejandria, Garnatxa Blanca, Malvas√≠a de Sitges, Subirat Parent / Malvasia, Xarel¬∑lo Vermell, Sumoll Blanc, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, and Vinyater The older vines are planted as low bushes (en vaso) while the newer ones are on trellises (en espaldera). In both cases they are planted at intervals of 1.4 m between vines and 2.8 m between rows (marco real). Wines produced Most wineries in Tarragona DOP now produce and bottle modern reds, whites, and ros√©s. Only a few still produce the traditional wines: *Rancios (rancid) wines are left out in the sun in glass demijohns and are then aged for at least four years in oak barrels *Tarragona Cl√°sico (Classic Tarragona) is made with 100% very ripe Tempranillo grapes, and is fermented until it attains a maximum of 17% alcohol. It is then aged for twelve years in oak containers of up to a maximum capacity of 2,000 litres. Sometimes the solera system is used. *Sweet dessert wine is aged for five to ten years in vats, oak casks or in the bottle.

He made his professional debut in January 2005 and reached the top makuuchi division in March 2007, retiring in July 2020. At one point he was regarded as one of the most promising Japanese rikishi. His highest rank was sekiwake. His best performance came in May 2012 when he tied with Kyokutenh≈ç after fifteen days but was beaten in a play-off. He earned six special prizes for his achievements in tournaments and six gold stars for defeating yokozuna. He made twenty-five appearances in the san'yaku ranks. Early life and sumo background Kageyama was exposed to sumo from a very young age because it was popular in his area and his parents were fans of the sport. His parents arranged for him to join a local sumo club. He did not enjoy sumo at all at first, disliking the fierceness and the constant training that was necessary. He considered quitting many times, but as he continued he eventually came to enjoy and excel at the sport and transferred to Meitoku Gijuku junior high school which was a school in his native K≈çchi prefecture which was known for its strong sumo program. In his third year of junior high he won a national competition and was named the junior high yokozuna. Upon graduation, he transferred to far away Saitama Sakae high school, in the greater Tokyo area to continue his sumo training, as this school was also known for its strong sumo program. The future ≈çzeki G≈çeid≈ç was already a member there, and the two would begin a spirited rivalry that continues to this day in their professional roles. As high school graduation approached he considered university, but eventually chose to enter professional sumo directly from high school. Career Several different heya were interested in recruiting him for professional sumo, but he eventually chose Kasugano stable. He made his ring debut at the March 2005 tournament, under his family name Kageyama. He rose through the divisions quickly, winning the third lowest sandanme division championship in November of that same year. In September 2006 at the age of 19 he became a salaried sekitori wrestler when he entered j≈´ry≈ç, the second highest division, adopting the ring name Tochi≈çzan. He made his debut in the top makuuchi division in March 2007, where he was in contention for the championship until the 14th day. He finished with a strong 11‚Äì4 record and won the Fighting Spirit award. Promoted to maegashira 4 for the May tournament, he faced all the top ranked wrestlers for the first time and faltered with a 6‚Äì9 record, suffering the first tournament in his career where he had more losses than wins (make-koshi). At the July tournament the same year he suffered a dislocated shoulder on the tenth day and was forced to withdraw. Ranked at maegashira 13 in September, he finished the tournament with a disappointing 7‚Äì8 score, losing his last five bouts. He remained at the bottom of the division for the next few tournaments, struggling with lower back pain, but returned to form in March 2008, finishing with 11‚Äì4 and winning the Technique award. He struggled once again in May however, losing his first eight bouts before staging a partial recovery to finish on 5‚Äì10. He was one of seven wrestlers who NHK commentator Shuhei Nagao (the former Mainoumi) in 2008 called the \\"Seven Samurai\\" and identified as \\"holding the key\\" to a Japanese resurgence in sumo, which was dominated by foreigners in the top ranks. (The others were G≈çeid≈ç, Kisenosato, Kotosh≈çgiku, Homash≈ç, Toyonoshima and Toyohibiki). Tochi≈çzan before his first bout in san'yaku in May 2009. After disappointing 6‚Äì9 scores in September and November 2008, he fell to maegashira 12, where he responded by winning his first eight matches in January 2009, finishing on 10‚Äì5. This resulted in promotion to maegashira 2 for the March 2009 tournament. He had a good start to this tournament as well, defeating three ≈çzeki (Koto≈çsh≈´, Harumafuji and Chiyotaikai) and standing at 7‚Äì3 after ten days. He then lost four matches in a row, before securing his kachi-koshi with a win on the final day. This was enough to earn Tochi≈çzan promotion to the san'yaku ranks for the first time for the May 2009 tournament, at the rank of komusubi. When the banzuke for the tournament was released in late April he held a press conference and said he would like to go one win better than his rival from high school sumo days, G≈çeid≈ç, who had just made sekiwake for the first time. They began their professional careers in the same tournament and Tochi≈çzan preceded him into the j≈´ry≈ç and makuuchi divisions, but he had beaten G≈çeid≈ç just once in six meetings, in September 2007. In the end both wrestlers finished on 6‚Äì9, although Tochi≈çzan did beat his rival for the second time in their individual match. Falling back to the maegashira ranks for July, he could only produce a very poor 2‚Äì13 record, with one of his wins coming against G≈çeid≈ç. An 11‚Äì4 score in September 2009 put him back up to maegashira 3 for the November tournament in Kyushu, where he beat two ≈çzeki (Harumafuji and the struggling Chiyotaikai) but fell short with a 5‚Äì10 record. At maegashira 6 in March 2010 he defeated ≈çzeki Kotomitsuki and scored 11‚Äì4, returning to komusubi. A strong 9‚Äì6 record in July, which included defeats of two more ≈çzeki, earned him promotion to sekiwake for the first time for the September 2010 tournament. His sekiwake debut was a success as he scored 11‚Äì4 and was awarded his second Technique prize. However, two losing scores in his next two tournaments saw him fall out of san'yaku, and a disappointing 4‚Äì11 in May 2011 saw him lose further ground. He withdrew from the November tournament on the 11th day after suffering a ligament injury to his right ankle. However he returned with a strong performance in the opening tournament of 2012, posting an 11‚Äì4 record. He would have received his first Fighting Spirit prize since his top division debut had he defeated Gagamaru on the final day, but he failed to do so. In May 2012, he lost the final playoff for the Emperor's Cup, being defeated by fellow maegashira Kyokutenh≈ç after both finished with 12‚Äì3 records. This was the first ever playoff match between two maegashira ranked wrestlers, and his defeat meant he just missed out on becoming the first Japanese born makuuchi division y≈´sh≈ç winner since Tochiazuma in January 2006. He received a share of the Fighting Spirit Award for his efforts. He returned to the sekiwake rank for the next tournament. In September he defeated Hakuh≈ç for the first time in 15 attempts to earn his first gold star or kinboshi, and won the Outstanding Performance Award. Tochi≈çzan was ranked mainly in san'yaku from the beginning of 2013 until March 2016, although he was unable to mount a serious challenge for ≈çzeki promotion. After dropping temporarily to a maegashira position because of injury he picked up his second gold star in November 2014 with a win over Harumafuji. In July 2015 he defeated both yokozuna competing in that tournament, Hakuh≈ç and Kakury≈´, and won the second Outstanding Performance Prize of his career. He maintained his sekiwake rank until March 2016, then fell from san'yaku after scoring only 4‚Äì11 at komusubi in May. He earned the third kinboshi of his career by defeating Kakury≈´ on the third day of the July 2016 tournament. In September 2016 rose back the ranks to komusubi but just barely failed to get a winning record, with a 7‚Äì8, and was demoted from the rank. This has been his last appearance in sanyaku to date. In May 2017 he earned his fourth kinboshi with a defeat of Kisenosato on Day 9. In Nagoya in July, wrestling at maegashira 5, Tochi≈çzan produced one of his best performances for several years. After compiling a respectable 5‚Äì3 record in the first week he won his last seven matches including victories over the ≈çzeki Takayasu and the sekiwake Tamawashi and Mitakeumi to earn a return to komusubi for the next tournament. This was his 14th tournament at komusubi rank, putting him equal third for most komusubi appearances since the beginning of the Sh≈çwa period. He returned to the maegashira ranks after a 6‚Äì9 record in this tournament. He withdrew from the January 2018 tournament on Day 12 with a left shoulder injury. In November 2018 he won his first five matches, including wins over Kisenosato and Takayasu, finishing with an 8‚Äì7 record. He defeated Kisenosato again in January 2019, his sixth kinboshi, in what proved to be Kisenosato's final match before retirement. Retirement from sumo In November 2019 Tochiozan fell to the j≈´ry≈ç division for the first time since 2007. He made an immediate return to the top division after a 10‚Äì5 record, but was demoted to j≈´ry≈ç again after a 3‚Äì12 record at maegashira 10 in March 2020, which proved to be his final performance. Tochiozan announced his retirement in July 2020, shortly before the re-arranged Nagoya tournament in Tokyo was due to begin. He is staying in sumo as an elder and is now known as Kiyomigata Oyakata. He had previously loaned the elder name to former maegashira Bushuyama. Fighting style Tochiozan's most common winning techniques or kimarite were yori-kiri, oshi-dashi, yori-taoshi and oshi-taoshi, meaning he won most often by simply forcing his opponents out and down with a grip on the mawashi or push to the chest. He rarely used throwing moves or slap downs. His preferred mawashi grip was migi-yotsu, with his left arm outside and right arm inside his opponent's arms. Family Tochi≈çzan's marriage was registered in June 2017, although a wedding reception was not immediately scheduled. The couple were said to be expecting their first child in September 2017. The wedding reception was eventually held on 11 February 2019 and was attended by roughly 500 guests, among them was singer Fumiya Fujii who sang his hit True Love.

History Child Rebel Soldier was conceived alongside the song \\"Us Placers\\", which appears on Kanye West's Can't Tell Me Nothing (2007) mixtape, released just prior to his third studio album Graduation (2007).Kanye + Pharrell + Lupe = Child Rebel Soldiers Album? Pitchfork Media. Accessed December 19, 2007. Lupe Fiasco produced the song in an attempt to construct a mashup mixtape containing hip hop remakes of alternative rock singer Thom Yorke's solo album, The Eraser coupled with a few Radiohead songs. He originally wanted Kanye West and English rapper The Streets (Mike Skinner) to appear on the mixtape's first song \\"Us Placers\\", but Skinner failed to respond while West sent the song over to Pharrell Williams after laying down a verse. After finishing the collaboration, the trio decided to form a group, deemed by Pharrell as \\"Child Rebel Soldier\\". Their first song, \\"Us Placers\\", was listed at #43 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007.No byline (December 11, 2007). \\"The 100 Best Songs of 2007\\" Rolling Stone. Retrieved 2007-12-21 In a 2007 interview with Billboard, Fiasco elaborated that the three had hopes to find time to construct a full-length studio album, saying, \\"Now [our labels are] working it out. Whoever is going to pay is going to pay a whole hell of a lot. Everybody is excited, [but] 'Us Placers' is the only record we have\\". On January 29, 2008, it was announced on Kanye West's blog that the three artists would be touring later in the year together. The Glow in the Dark Tour, as it was called, consisted of Kanye West, Rihanna, Lupe Fiasco and Pharrell's funk rock band N.E.R.D. According to a Lupe Fiasco interview with sohh.com, there were plans for a CRS album in 2010. He said the trio of CRS would have three different elements to it: an album, music videos, and a third element he failed to elaborate on (speculation that what he was referring to at this point was the then unannounced \\"Glow in the Dark\\" Tour). The group was featured on the remix to \\"Everyone Nose\\" by N.E.R.D.. They were labeled as Child Rebel Soldier on the song instead of their separate entities. This is the second song where they use their group name. The official video for the \\"Everyone Nose\\" remix version was posted on Kanye West's blog on August 7, 2008. The video, directed by Hype Williams, features CRS and Pusha T of Clipse. Behind them is a green screen showing scenes from various retro video games, including Donkey Kong, Galaga, and Space Invaders. With Lupe Fiasco's upcoming album completed and scheduled to be released by Atlantic Records, Kanye West remains the only member currently working on their own solo LP. Despite this, on January 26 Lupe Fiasco announced that the group had finished 4 songs. The album, which was tentatively titled God Unwilling, has now been shelved according to Lupe Fiasco in an interview with Las Vegas radio station Hot 97.5. In the interview he first spoke about his upcoming album, Lasers, and then shot down the supposedly upcoming Child Rebel Soldier with one word when he was questioned ‚Äì \\"nope\\". Lupe offered no further explanation at the time as to why the album had been placed on indefinite hold. On October 8, 2010 Kanye West released what was thought as a new Child Rebel Soldier track entitled \\"Don't Stop\\" as a part of his \\"GOOD Fridays\\" releases. However, in an interview, Lupe announced that \\"Don't Stop\\" was actually written in 2008. On October 18, 2010 at the L.A. screening for \\"Runaway\\", which was again followed by a rather lengthy Q&A;, the subject of CRS was brought up. Kanye explained that the project is on the table and will follow after the release of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and collaboration album Watch The Throne with Jay-Z. On July 25, 2013, in response to an inquiry on Twitter, Lupe Fiasco announced that Child Rebel Soldier has been canceled.

Biography  Przybylinski was born near South Bend, Indiana to Casimir and Helen (Jaworski) Przybylinski and graduated from Washington High School in 1972. Przybylinski earned his B.S. and M.S. in meteorology at Saint Louis University (SLU) in 1977 and 1981, respectively. He worked as the station scientist at the Indianapolis National Weather Service office until 1991, when he moved to the St. Louis NWSFO as Science and Operations Officer (SOO). During the late 1980s he served as a project leader on the Operational Test and Evaluation of the WSR-88D Doppler radar. He most recently was a principal investigator on the severe straight-line winds component of the COMET Cooperative Project with Saint Louis University as well as involved with the Cooperative Institute for Precipitation Systems (CIPS). He was an organizer of the Bow Echo and Mesoscale Convective Vortex Experiment (BAMEX) of 2003 and a researcher with the Pre-STORM Project of 1985. Przybylinski was a leading expert on quasi-linear convective systems (QLCS), bow echoes, and mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), and convective winds and tornadogenesis associated with these thunderstorm structures. He intensively studied quasi-linear thunderstorms and their associated winds and tornadoes throughout the 1980s, writing a seminal paper in 1995. Subjects in which he made substantial contributions were derechos, mesoscale convective vortices (MCV), rear-inflow jets (RIJ), line echo wave patterns (LEWP), and high-precipitation (HP) supercells. He was also a leading scientist on tornadoes in general and was on the NWS Quick Response Team (QRT), a group of experts who rush to assess damage from particularly damaging tornadoes. Przybylinski actively trained meteorologists, for example, participating heavily in the National Center for Atmospheric Research COMET training (particularly on bow echoes), as well as mentored and collaborated with university students, both graduate and undergraduate. He was dedicated to bridging operational and research meteorology, making significant contributions in bringing research findings to weather warning and forecasting. He published dozens of scientific papers and hundreds of conference presentations. He served on the American Meteorological Society (AMS) Severe Local Storms Committee and as a Councilor of the National Weather Association (NWA). He received the NOAA Distinguished Career Award in 2013, the Charles L. Mitchell Award from the AMS in 2012, the T. Theodore Fujita Research Achievement Award from the NWA in 2003, and the NWA Operational Research Award in 1989. In his spare time, Przybylinski was an avid amateur radio operator, dabbled in storm chasing, and enjoyed gardening. He died of cancer while being treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago.  See also  * Donald W. Burgess * Leslie R.

After he went to Paris in order to begin medical studies, he met Alexandre Laboulb√®ne, who introduced him to entomology. The paradox is that Laboulb√®ne became a famous physician, and Jacquelin left medicine to concentrate on entomology. After minor preliminary works, he conceived together with the miniaturist painter Jules Migneaux (1825-1898) a vast project describing and illustrating all European genera of beetles. There was the Genera des col√©opt√®res d‚ÄôEurope, which started to get published in 1854, one of the most remarkable European book on beetles, due to the quality of its text, and especially to its magnificent illustrations, whose beauty and accuracy were never surpassed. Unfortunately, he died at 34, leaving unfinished his work which was brought to an end by the prolific author L√©on Fairmaire (1820-1906). In addition, he wrote a small volume of Glanures entomologiques (2 parts, 1859-1860), to accommodate some smaller contributions he could not introduce in his great Genera.

In 2018 the population of the municipality was 33,289 (35,180 in the municipal seat) and the total area was 581.4 km¬≤. Ixtl√°n, as it is known to locals, is located 149 kilometers south of the state capital Tepic and is connected to that city and Guadalajara by both rail and highway connections. The important coastal highway Route 15 passes through the city, while a toll road passes to the east. Ixtl√°n has boundaries with the municipalities of La Yesca and Jala in the north; Amatl√°n de Ca√±as and the state of Jalisco in the south, Jalisco in the east and Ahuacatl√°n in the west. The land is mainly mountainous (60%) with some flat lands near the small rivers where the agricultural lands and settlements are located. The climate is hot and sub- humid with rains falling from March to July. The average annual temperature varies between 21 ¬∞C and 25 ¬∞C, with maximum lows of 0 ¬∞C and highs of 48 ¬∞C. The average annual rainfall is around 859.8 mm. The economy is based on services, due to the town's location on the important Mexico-Nogales highway, small industries (brickworks, furniture, pottery), and agriculture. The main crops are maize, sorghum, beans, and green chile. There were about 36,000 head of cattle in 1995. South of the city lies Toriles, the most important archaeological site in northwestern Mexico. Here is found the temple of Quetzalcoatl, from the Toltec culture. The ceramic and gold jewelry extracted here can be seen in the Regional Museum of Ixtl√°n. The R√≠o Grande de Santiago crosses the eastern edge of the municipality but is not to be confused with the larger R√≠o Grande de Santiago of the same name that flows from Jalisco into Nayarit.  Etymology  The name of Ixtl√°n is of N√°huatl origin, composed of the words ‚ÄúItz-tli‚Äù meaning obsidian, and ‚Äútl√°n‚Äù, meaning place where it is found. So the name means \\"place where obsidian is found\\", or \\"place of the obsidian knife.\\"  The Land  Geography The land upon which the city lies sits atop the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and is defined by the volcano El Molcajete, and the hills known as Las Panochas, El Borrego, and Mezquites. The city has two rivers: the R√≠o Grande de Santiago that originates in the Pajaritos Mountains, and the R√≠o Chico which originates in the mountains of Juanacat√°n. The area has multiple seasonal streams, including El Cofrad√≠a, Los Limones, Los Sauces, Arroyo Verde, San Miguel, El Pilare√±o, and 17 springs, the most well known of which is the hot springs called 'Agua Caliente'. Mining is found on the hills known as Los Mezquites, La Higuerita, and La Caste√±ana, with silver, lead, zinc, and opals the primary products. Flora and Fauna In the surrounding Pajaritos Mountains commonly found trees include pine, oak, cypress, and other varieties. At lower elevations mesquite, guam√∫chil, huizaches, and nopal cactus are common, and near the rivers willow and fig trees are common. Indigenous animals include coyotes, deer, jabal√≠ (peccary), badgers, and hares. Birds include the goldfinch, painted urraca, and woodpecker. The municipality counts reserves of exploitable minerals and forests, but they are difficult to access. Cattle is run on approximately 17,419 hectares of land, and 9,061 hectares are devoted to agriculture. Approximately 47% is private property, and 42% belongs to ejidos.  History  Pre-Columbian History ca. 14,000 BCE-1525 CE Humans have inhabited the region since the migrations of the Paleo-Indians, but Native Americans known as Chimalhuacans, a tribe of Nahuatl-Toltec origin, arrived in the region c. 850 C.E. Obsidian artifacts, used for religious ceremonies or weapons, have been found and the volcanic soils and minerals likely added to the desirability of the location for settlement. Existent tribes in the region of Nayarit adopted the influences of the culture and constructed a ceremonial center, known today as Los Toriles, located approximately 1,500 meters from the center of the modern town. The primary god of the prehispanic culture of the settling culture was Quetzalcoatl, or the feathered serpent, personified as a young warrior. In the 12th century C.E. the town was culturally aligned with the Valley of Mexico and was closely related to the settlements of Cacalutan and Ahuacatlan. The ruins known as 'Los Toriles' is the principal archaeological site of the state of Nayarit, and one of the most important archaeological sites in Western Mexico due to its elaborate buildings, numerous burial sites, and clay figures. The principal temple is of circular construction and was dedicated to Eh√©catl, god of the wind. It is a unique construction, approximately 25 meters in diameter. Included in the building complex is a building of two levels that was constructed to avoid floods. The prehispanic population of the region maintained workshops for the manufacturing of obsidian objects, including arrowheads and knives for hunting, which were used in trade. Tripod vases, smooth pottery painted with distinct shades of red, gold, silver, and copper adornments, stone statues of the god Chacmool, and quadrupedal animals. The region still has many unexplored tombs and archaeological sites.  European Conquest 1525-1550 C.E.  Conquistador and explorer Francisco Cort√©s de San Buenaventura first entered the region in 1525, departing from Colima. In Ixtl√°n it is reported that he met with a Spanish adventurer by the name of Esc√°rcena, who had explored the region on his own account. Initial contact was cordial and peaceful according to the first encomendero Mart√≠n Alonso. Nu√±o Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n conquered and destroyed the principal towns of the region in 1532 after having established himself president of the Real Audiencia established in Tepic, to the northwest of Ixtl√°n. The establishment of Tepic as a seat of the province of Nueva Galicia on July 25th, 1532, was part of a wider conquest of the northwestern region of Mexico in the early 16th century. Due to the quality of the workmanship of artisans in Ixtl√°n, its location along established merchant routes, and the richness of its mineral resources, the town acquired regional importance. According to documents, Don Hern√°n Cort√©s stayed in the city when he traveled to Tepic to address complaints against Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n. The conquest of the region by Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n was reported to be unnecessarily brutal and violent, and he was eventually arrested and sent back to Spain for his reported abuses, although the sources of information on his behavior were written primarily by his political enemies, including Hern√°n Cort√©s.  Colonial Era 1550-1810 C.E.  During the colonial era development of agricultural land followed similar patterns to those found in central Mexico, with Europeans introducing the portmanteau biota of Europe and Africa, including sugar cane and cattle. Due to its location along the trade routes between Tepic, which at the time was the capital of Nueva Galicia, San Blas and Guadalajara and Mexico City, the town maintained it size and economy. In the nearby mountainous areas of Mezquites and La Higuerita the Spaniards established mines. According to local history, the first Spaniard in Ixtlan settled in an area known today as 'La Haciendita', and after 1650 CE the original location was changed.  The 19th Century  Francisco Severo Maldonado, a priest from Tepic, fought in the Independence Movement with fellow priest Miguel Hidalgo, and in 1821 signed el Acta de Independencia in Ixtl√°n. In 1825 a municipality was formed as a Department of Ahuacatl√°n, and in 1828 the town was officially named Villa de Ixtl√°n. On October 25th, 1858, after a political pronouncement for the liberals, Ixtl√°n was burned and occupied by the conservative forces of Manuel Lozada, whose followers were left in peace until General Carbo marched against them in 1876, three years after the execution by firing squad of the local caudillo. By virtue of a political realignment and division made by the new Tepic Territory, in 1885 Ixtl√°n was named as a subprefecture.  The 20th Century and Contemporary Times  During the centennial celebration of the declaration of independence, in 1910, the previously named Villa de Ixtl√°n was elevated to the status of a city as a recognition of its growth. In March, 1911, a local leader named Mart√≠n Espinosa publicly declared his loyalty to the Maderistas and started the insurrection against Mexican Federalist forces. After the Mexican Revolution, the Constitution of 1917 was ratified, and Tepic was declared a free and sovereign state of the Republic of Mexico. Ixtl√°n was declared to be Ixtl√°n del R√≠o, one of the state's 17 municipalities in a political reorganization, and the first municipal president was Nicol√°s Castillo Castill√≥n. Between the 1920s and 1930s, Mexico was recovering from the Mexican Revolution, and was also affected by global trends such as World War I, the Russian Revolution, the Great Depression, and industrialization. Mexicans also struggled with one another in the Cristero War, a conflict between the federal government and Catholic groups. In March 1925 the Pacific Railroad was completed, connecting Ixtl√°n del R√≠o with the western, coastal, and central parts of Mexico. In April 1925, for political reasons, Ixtl√°n del R√≠o was declared the capital of Nayarit for ten days under governor Ismael Romero Gallardo. Ixtl√°n was the scene of many skirmishes during the Cristero War, with fighting spilling over from neighboring state Jalisco. The citizens of Ixtl√°n built a statue on top of a hill near the center of town known as Cristo el Rey in the aftermath of that conflict. On June 3rd, 1932 an earthquake damaged the tower of the Catholic Church in Ixtl√°n, the current church is a reconstruction built on the original structure. The political leaders of Ixtl√°n after the Revolution were members of the PRI party, as was common throughout Mexico. This did not change until 1996. Between the 1940s and 1960s Mexico experienced a period of peace, economic growth, wealth redistribution, migration to cities, and modernization. This was reflected in Ixtl√°n with the construction of the Tepic-Guadalajara highway in 1942, which connected roadways in Ixtl√°n with other highways in Mexico. The road largely followed the 'Camino Real' established by the Spaniards on existing trade routes that had been used by the Native Americans. The road was the heart of the commercial district of Ixtl√°n. It is possible that during this era there was a redistribution of agricultural land by the federal government. Between the 1970s and contemporary times Ixtl√°n modernized and was influenced by international trends such as globalization, advances in medicine, mechanization of agriculture, and the development of electronic communication. In 1994 the autopista, a high-speed highway, was constructed according to the Plan de Barrancas. The toll road allowed for modern amenities and increased traffic, but bypassed the center of Ixtl√°n, diminishing the amount of traffic that flowed through the commercial district. In 1996 voters elected the first mayor that was not a member of the PRI party, reflecting national political trends. Starting in the 1960s and 1970s many rural residents of Ixtl√°n and the surrounding towns began to migrate to cities or north to the United States, following a pattern of migration repeated by millions of their compatriots. Ixtl√°n maintains a large expatriate community in the American Southwest today, with many returning during Christmas holidays or as retirees.  Ixtl√°n del R√≠o  Description of the City The center of the municipality is the city of Ixtl√°n del R√≠o with a population of 28,000 inhabitants according to a 2014 estimate, which makes it the most populous city in the central south region. Notable locations within the city include El Cristo Rey, a statue of Jesus on top of a hill located just outside of the town center, the central parish Catholic Church, the central plaza and kiosk and the central market. The city offers financial services, sleeping accommodations, and a variety of commercial activities.  Culture  Religion Most residents follow the Catholic faith, two parish churches are maintained as well as different chapels and religious sites. Other faiths include evangelical Christianity, Seventh Day Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses. Catholic Churches or religious sites: Parroquia de Santiago Ap√≥stol, Templo del Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen, Templo del Sagrario Coraz√≥n, Santuario de la Virgen de Guadalupe, Templo de Nuestra Se√±ora del Perpetuo Socorro, Capilla de Nuestra Se√±ora del Rosario de Talpa, Capilla de Cristo Rey, Cuasi Parroquia de Mexpan San Juan Bautista, Templo de Nuestra Se√±ora de F√°tima, Parroquia de Cristo Rey, Templo de San Felipe de Jes√∫s, Templo de San Andr√©s Festivals and Traditions The regional fair is held between September 7th and 18th and includes agricultural expositions, rodeos, folkloric dancers and musicians, fireworks, and a parade with floats. The feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe is celebrated between December 7th and 15th, and a gathering to climb El Cristo Rey takes place in October. Smaller outlying pueblos also hold fiestas, rodeos, and smaller celebrations on an annual basis. Music and Style The Cora and Huichol still play their traditional music in the region of Ixtlan, but most live outside of the city proper. Popular forms of music in Ixtlan are similar to music from the wider region, and include Mariachi, Banda, Norteno, and Cumbia. The prevalent style of dress is conservative and sourced from large manufacturers. A prevalent style is close to Western wear seen in the Western parts of the United States, with cowboy hats, boots, leather belts, jeans, and pickup trucks. Men commonly wear their hair short, and sport mustaches, women dress conservatively, wear their hair long, and dress according to Western norms, not dissimilar to what would be seen in Mexico City or Guadalajara. Museums The Museum of Anthropology is located in the interior of the municipal presidency. Anthropomorphic figures are displayed there, including warriors, obsidian carvings, and pottery. They largely belong to the Classic Era (300-900 C.E.). La Casona de Ixtl√°n is a cultural space with a small museum that displays found objects from antiquity and an art gallery that displays work from local artists such as Manuel Ben√≠tez. It is an open forum for international artists, and also serves food and wine. Education Ixtlan maintains public and private school systems from preschool up to the university level, with satellite schools from larger institutions. Tourism Four kilometers east of town there is a small water park called La Sidra, it is based on a hot spring with reported curative powers. On a hill overlooking the town there is a statue dedicated to Jesus called El Cristo Rey, with access for automobiles and 544 steps for those wishing to walk. There are a variety of smaller springs, both hot and cold, throughout the municipality. Throughout the municipality private ranches and sites can be found for lodging or recreation. Local artisans produce arts and crafts that are sold throughout the city and in the plaza, they include leather articles, glassware, pottery, and textile based products. The regional gastronomy is based on beef, but includes a fair amount of seafood due to a relative proximity to the coast. Some typical dishes include birria, which is stewed beef or goat meat, carne asada which is grilled beef in a variety of forms, and ceviche which is fish or other seafood marinated in lime juice, served with mixed vegetables. Ixtlan is near to the tequila producing region of Mexico, and the liquor is commonly served.

According to Digambara tradition, the original canonical scriptures of the Jains were totally lost within a few centuries of Nirvana of Mahavira. Therefore the ·π¢a·π≠kha·πÖ·∏çƒÅgama is the most revered Digambara text that has been given the status of ƒÅgama. The importance of the ·π¢a·π≠kha·πÖ·∏çƒÅgama to the Digambaras can be judged by the fact that, the day its DhavalƒÅ commentary was completed, it is commemorated on the ≈ör≈´ta Pa√±cami, a day when all the Jain scriptures are venerated. The ·π¢a·π≠kha·πÖ·∏çƒÅgama, the first ƒÅgama, is also called the \\"Prathama ≈ör≈´ta-Skandha\\", while the Pancha ParamƒÅgama by Kundakunda are referred to as the second ƒÅgama or Dvitiya ≈ör≈´ta- Skandha. Origins It is said to have been based on oral teaching of the Digambara monk, acharya Dharasena (1st Century CE).Legacy of Dharsen, Hira Publications According to the tradition, alarmed at the gradual dwindling of scriptural knowledge, he summoned two monks, Pushpadanta and Bh≈´tabali to a cave, known as Chandra Gupha, or the Moon Cave, his retreat in mount Girnar, Gujarat, and communicated what he remembered out of originally vast extent of sacred Jain writings. He taught them portions of the fifth Anga Viahapannatti (Vyakhya Prajnapti) and of the twelfth Anga Ditthivada (Drstivada). These were subsequently reduced to writing in Sutra form by his pupils. Pushpadanta composed the first 177 Sutras and his colleague Bhutabali wrote the rest, the total being 6000 Sutras. The palm leaf writings of this long work, originally written in Prakrit were deposited sometime in the early centuries of the Common Era in the Digambara holy place of Mudabidri, a temple town in South- West Karnataka. Here, these scriptures were treated with great reverence, but became mere objects of worship. Digambara ƒÅgamas like SatkhandƒÅgama and the KasƒÅyapƒÅhuda were in a state of neglect and were not studied or made available to the community. Revival to the Modern Society In the 20th century, Dr. Hiralal Jain was one of the first few lay scholars who decided to retrieve the ƒÅgamas, and bring to light with systematic editing and proof reading. With the help of his scholar friends like Pandit Nathuram Premi and Jamunaprasada Sub- Judge, he raised the funds to publish the ƒÅgamas, and set out to extricate the ƒÅgamas from Mudabidri, where the original handwritten Prakrit manuscripts had lain for centuries, unstudied. Dr Hiralal Jain, Pt Nathuram Premi and Jamunaprasada sub-judge together managed to convince Seth Sitabray Gulabray, a wealthy land-owner from Vidisha (Bundelkhand, Madhya Pradesh) belonging to the ParavƒÅra community, to donate Rs. 30,000 for the cause of editing and publishing the SatkhandƒÅgama along with its DhavalƒÅ commentary, expertly edited and accompanied by an excellent Hindi translation. This donation enabled Dr Hiralal Jain to work together with Dr. A.N. Upadhye, close friend and a scholar of Prakrit. Dr. Hiralal Jain brought together a team of scholars including, Pt. Phulchandra Shastri, Pt. Kailashchandra Shastri, Pt. Hiralal Shastri and Pt. Balachandra Shastri started the project of revival and study of the Digambara ƒÅgama. These scholars had to face stiff opposition from the monks and the traditional srƒÅvakas who were opposed to the very concept of printing religious scriptures as they felt that printing would undermine the purity of the scripture. In a period of twenty years, the SatkhandƒÅgama, along with its massive DhavalƒÅ and MahƒÅdhavalƒÅ commentaries was edited from the original palm leaf manuscripts and published after very careful proof reading in consultation with senior Jaina scholars like Pt. Nathuram Premi and Pt. Devakinandan Nayak. Subject matter of the Agama and its commentaries The SatkhandƒÅgama, as the name suggests, is a scripture in six parts. pp.3863 The six parts are: # Jiva Sthana (Categories of Living Beings) # Kshudraka Bandha (Minutiae of Bondage) # Bandhasvamitva (Ownership of Bondage) # Vedana (Perception) # Vargana (Divisions of Karmas) # Mahabandha (Great Bondage) SatkhandƒÅgama postulates karma theory, using a number of technical terms defining various concepts and mathematical notions. The first three parts deal with the karma philosophy from the view point of the soul which is the agent of the bondage and the last three section discusses the nature and extent of the karmas. The commentary on the first five parts is known as the DhavalƒÅ. The commentary on the sixth part is known as the MahƒÅdhavalƒÅ. DhavalƒÅ is divided into 16 sections which is as follows: * Volume One, Jivasthana - Categories of Living Beings :*Book 1 : Satprarupana (Teaching on the Entities) Part - 1 :*Book 2: Satprarupana (Teaching on the Entities) Part - 2 :*Book 3: Dravyapramananugama (Teaching on the Entities) :*Book 4: Kshetra - Sparshana - Kalanugama (Location, Touch and Time) :*Book 5: Antara - Bhava - Alpabahuttva (Gap, State, Few or Many) :*Book 6: Culika (Appendix) * Volume Two : Ksudrakabandha - Minutiae of Bondage * Volume Three : Bandhasvamittva - Ownership of Bondage * Volume Four, Vedana - Perception :*Book 1: Krtianuyogdvara (Acts as Doors of Disquisition) :* Book 2: Vedana Kshetra - Vedana Kala - Vedana Dravya (Area, Time and Object of Perception) :*Book 3: Vedana Kshetra - Vedana Kala (Area and Time of Perception) :*Book 4: Vedana Bhava Vidhana (Directive on State of Perception) * Volume Five Vargana - Divisions of Karma :*Book 1: Sparshakarmaprakrti Anuyoga (Examination of the Nature of Karmic Sensation) :*Book 2: Bandhana Anuyoga (Examination of Bondage) :*Book 3: Nibandhanadi Chatura Anuyoga (Four-part Examination of the Fastening of Karmas) :*Book 4: Moksadi Chaturdasha Anuyoga (Fourteen-part Examination of Liberation, etc.) MahƒÅdhavalƒÅ the commentary on sixth section called Mahabandha has seven books. The other Digambara ƒÅgama, the KasƒÅyapƒÅhuda, also has a voluminous commentary. It is called the Jaya DhavalƒÅ. All three commentaries were composed by ƒÅcƒÅrya Virasena and ƒÅcƒÅrya Jinasena (8th century CE). The text and its commentaries preserved on the palm leaf manuscripts run into some 120,000 verses. One interesting fact about the SatkhandƒÅgama is that it is believed that the 5 pada NamokƒÅra Mantra is believed to have been composed by ƒÅcƒÅrya Pushpadanta as the mangalacarana (opening verse, often an invocation to god for the successful completion of the text) to the SatkhandƒÅgama. Before this work, only the 2 pada NamokƒÅra Mantra has been found in inscriptions. Hence, there is reason to believe that ƒÅcƒÅrya Pushpadanta was the first person to compose the 5 pada NamokƒÅra Mantra. The SatkhandƒÅgama is a highly complex work, adumbrating the Jaina karma siddhƒÅnta. Although it is a Digambara work, it is seen as an authoritative work on the Jaina karma theory by all Jains. Hindi and English translations The first five parts of the SatkhandƒÅgama along with the DhavalƒÅ commentary and Hindi translation, running into 16 Volumes, was first published from Vidisha itself, by the family of Shrimant Seth Sitabray Gulabray. But is now published by the Jaina Sanskriti Sanrakshak Sangh in Solapur and distributed by Hindi Granth Karyalay, Mumbai. The MahƒÅdhavalƒÅ commentary and Hindi translation, running into 7 Volumes, is published from New Delhi by Bharatiya J√±anapitha.

During battle, the mission of the sharpshooter was to kill enemy targets of importance (i.e., officers and NCOs) from long range. The first regiment of volunteers began service in late November 1861. During their service, they fought in every Eastern battle up until autumn of 1864. During their tour, the Sharpshooters were noted for efficient service in the battles of Yorktown, Gettysburg, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, Atlanta, Spotsylvania and Petersburg. The 1st and 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters were consolidated on December 31, 1864. Founder Hiram C. Berdan was the founder of the Sharpshooters. Berdan was born in the town of Phelps, New York, on September 6, 1824. Not only was Berdan a military officer in the Civil War and creator of the Sharpshooters regiment, he was also an American mechanical engineer and creative inventor. Some of Berdan's inventions included the Berdan rifle (a repeating rifle) and the Berdan center fire primer, a range finder torpedo boat for evading torpedo nets during and after the Civil War. Berdan also developed the first commercial gold amalgamation machine to separate gold from ore. Berdan was also known for being an amateur champion marksman in the United States. Berdan's interest in rifles and shooting led him to the idea of creating a regiment full of men who all had notable shooting skills: the Sharpshooters. On November 30, 1861, Berdan was named colonel of both the first and second Sharpshooter regiments. After serving for three years, Berdan resigned his position as colonel on November 30, 1864, in order to return to his life as a mechanical engineer and inventor. Berdan died on March 31, 1893, and was buried in the Arlington National Cemetery. Raising the regiment  During the Civil War, regiments were usually composed of companies all from the same state. On the other hand, due to the strict qualifications and special skills in order to become a member of the Sharpshooters, each regiment was assembled of companies from various different Union states. Below is a list of each company in the first regiment, their origin and date of establishment. *Companies \\"A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K\\" *Companies \\"A\\", \\"D\\" and \\"H\\" were organized at New York City, New York in September 1861. *Company \\"B\\" was organized at Albany, New York in September 1861. *Company \\"C\\" in Michigan on August 21, 1861. *Company \\"E\\" in New Hampshire on September 9, 1861. *Company \\"F\\" in Vermont on September 13, 1861 *Company \\"G\\" in Wisconsin on September 23, 1861. *Company \\"I\\" in Michigan on March 4, 1862. *Company \\"K\\" in Michigan on March 30, 1862. Company commanders The first United States Sharpshooter regiment consisted of the following commanding officers (listed by company): *Company A- Captain Casper Trepp, New York *Company B- Captain Stephen Martin, New York *Company C- Captain Benjamin Duesler, Michigan *Company D- Captain George S. Tuckerman, New York *Company E- Captain Amos B. Jones, New Hampshire *Company F- Captain Edmund Weston, Vermont *Company G-Captain Edward Drew, Wisconsin *Company H- Captain George G. Hastings, New York *Company I- Captain A. M. Willet, Michigan *Company K- Captain S. J. Mather, Michigan Selection of recruits Hiram C. Berdan of New York state created the Sharpshooters. Berdan began recruiting men for the first Sharpshooter regiment in 1861. He recruited men from New York City and Albany and from the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, Michigan and Wisconsin. The volunteer recruits had to pass a rifle test in order to qualify to be a member of the Sharpshooters; each man had to be able to place ten shots in a circle of in diameter from away. They were able to choose a rifle and position of their preference for the test. A man eligible to be a Sharpshooter had to possess a keen eye, steady hands and a great deal of training and skill with a rifle. In addition to that, for a man to be a Sharpshooter, it took cool nerves in order to be able to estimate their target carefully, determine the high trajectory needed and to take in consideration the effect that any current wind may have. Weapons The men of the Sharpshooters regiment were armed with various types of rifles, including the Sharps rifle, the Whitworth rifle, sporting arms, and various other custom- made privately owned target weapons. Some of these rifles weighed up to because they contained the first breed of telescope sights. At first, many of the Sharpshooter riflemen used their own weapons, but this began leading to problems when it came to ammunition supply. As a result, Berdan made a request to receive issuance of Sharps rifles to his men. Christian Sharps invented the Sharps rifle in 1848 in Hartford, Connecticut. It was a single shot percussion lock breech loader that could be fired eight to ten times per minute (three times the rate of the Springfield rifle), weighed about , was in length with a barrel and fired cartridges with a .52 caliber conical ball. The Sharps rifle was accurate up to , so the typical Sharpshooter was able to put twenty bullets in a pattern from away. The first Sharps rifle in the regiment was purchased by Private Truman \\"California Joe\\" Head while the regiment was at the camp of instruction outside Washington, D.C. during the winter of 1861-1862. Berdan chose the Sharps rifle mainly because of its fast breech loading and outstanding accuracy from long-range distances. Unfortunately, though, Lieutenant General Winfield Scott denied Berdan's request because he feared the issuance of Sharps rifles would lead to a waste of ammunition. Lt. General Scott insisted that Berdan's men use a standard Springfield rifle. Berdan was not at all satisfied with Scott's ruling, so he took his request for Sharps rifles directly to President Abraham Lincoln. After Lincoln watched Berdan perform a demonstration of the Sharps rifle's extreme speed and accuracy he was so impressed that he ordered them to be immediately issued to both Sharpshooter regiments. Nevertheless, many of the men still continued to use their own rifles, no matter how heavy and bulky they were, probably because that is what they had training and experience with. The sharpshooters were finally issued their Sharps rifles on May 8, 1862. Uniform The green uniform of the sharpshooters The most notable aspect of the Berdan Sharpshooter uniform is the green color, rather than the standard Union blue. They were one of only a few regiments that went outside the typical Potomac Army's uniform. The green uniform gave the sharpshooters the clear advantage of camouflage, but also sometimes was a disadvantage because they were easy to distinguish against the rest of the Union soldiers for Confederate marksmen to spot and target. Sharpshooters were high-priority kills amongst the Confederate army, because they had such high skills and good salvageable equipment. Sharpshooters used more guerrilla warfare battle tactics than the rest of the Union infantry. Along with the green uniform, a soldier was to have no brass on any of their buttons. Their shoes were standard Union issue, but their pants were made of green wool just like the frock coats, with a pair of gaiters. Furthermore, Sharpshooter knapsacks were a Prussian-style fur sack fitted over a wooden frame, as opposed to the usual tarred canvas. However, as the war went on the men were not reissued this clothing and many of the men received standard federal clothing making them harder for rebel troops to notice their elite capabilities. By the Gettysburg campaign most of the men were wearing modified blue uniforms. Total strength and casualties Ten of the regiment's officers and 143 enlisted men were killed in action or mortally wounded and 1 officer and 128 enlisted men died of disease, for a total of 282 casualties.http://www.civilwararchive.com/Unreghst/unusvol.htm The Civil War Archive website after Dyer, Frederick Henry.

Personal jurisdiction in American civil procedure law is premised on the notion that a defendant should not be subject to the decisions of a foreign or out of state court, without having \\"purposely availed\\" himself of the benefits that the forum state has to offer. Generally, the doctrine is grounded on two main principles: courts should protect defendants from the undue burden of facing litigation in an unlimited number of possibly remote jurisdictions (in line with the due process requirements of the Constitution), and courts should prevent states from infringing on the sovereignty of other states by limiting the circumstances under which defendants can be \\"haled\\" into court. In the Internet context, personal jurisdiction cases often involve proprietors of websites or Internet-based services that either advertise or actively promote their businesses nationally, but argue that they do not have sufficient contacts within a particular state to subject them to litigation in that state. With the growth of the Internet, courts have faced the challenge of applying long-standing principles of personal jurisdiction to a borderless communication medium that enables businesses and individuals all over the world to instantaneously interact across state boundaries. This is a rapidly changing area of law without a Supreme Court precedent. There is however, a growing consensus among federal district courts as to how to determine when personal jurisdiction may be asserted in an Internet context.TiTi Nguyen, A Survey of Personal Jurisdiction based on Internet Activity: A Return to Tradition, 19 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 519 (2004). Types of personal jurisdiction Besides facing constitutional limitations on personal jurisdiction, a court must also comply with state long-arm statutes, which enable personal jurisdiction over a party who has committed a tort within the state. This personal jurisdiction is specific to the act, and a party cannot be sued for unrelated activity. In many instances, state long-arm statutes extend personal jurisdiction to the extent allowed by the U.S. Constitution. There are two kinds of personal jurisdiction, general and specific jurisdiction:Cybersell, Inc. v. Cybersell, Inc., 130 F.3d 414 (9th Cir. 1997). =General personal jurisdiction= Following the Supreme Court's decisions in Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown and Daimler AG v. Bauman, a company doing business on the Internet may be sued for any reason in the jurisdiction where it is \\"at home,\\" typically its place of incorporation.https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1929137067016164680&q;=daimler+ag+v.+bauman&hl;=en&as;_sdt=20006 Because general jurisdiction is now quite limited, courts will often look to specific personal jurisdiction to determine whether a company is amenable to suit in a given jurisdiction. =Specific personal jurisdiction= In contrast, specific personal jurisdiction allows a defendant to be sued in a forum only on the basis of the defendant's contacts with the forum. A court can establish specific jurisdiction over a defendant only if he or she has \\"certain minimum contacts\\" which give rise to the action in question in the forum such that the exercise of jurisdiction \\"does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\\"Int'l Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945). Internet cases with an out-of-state defendant will often require the plaintiff to assert specific personal jurisdiction. Where a civil action has been brought based on a defendant's Internet activities, courts have generally declined to assert personal jurisdiction solely on the basis of web advertising. Instead, courts have looked for more active contacts with a forum, such as Internet sales to the forum residents, conducting business in the forum state through numerous contacts, or entering into specific dealings with forum residents.CompuServe, Inc. v. Patterson, 89 F.3d 1257 (6th Cir. 1996). The actual number of visitors to a defendant's website from citizens of the forum state has also sometimes been considered in an analysis of minimum contacts. Standards for personal jurisdiction in Internet cases In evaluating the assertion of personal jurisdiction in cases involving the Internet, courts have applied both traditional tests and standards customized to the online world. =Traditional tests of jurisdiction= Minimum contacts The United States Supreme Court decided in 1945 in the case of International Shoe v. Washington that for a defendant to be hailed into court in a particular jurisdiction it must have at least a minimum level of contact with that state that it could reasonably expect to be sued in the courts of that state. Following International Shoe, courts have generally applied a three-part test in evaluating minimum contacts sufficient for jurisdiction: > (1) The nonresident defendant must do some act or consummate some > transaction with the forum or perform some act by which he purposefully > avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities in the forum, > thereby invoking the benefits and protections[;] (2) the claim must be one > which arises out of or results from the defendant's forum-related > activities[; and] (3) exercise of jurisdiction must be > reasonable.Christopher Wolf, Standards for Internet Jurisdiction, > findlaw.com (1999). The \\"effects\\" or \\"Calder\\" test Courts may also apply the \\"effects\\" test from Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783 (1984), in cases with insufficient interactivity or minimum contacts, but where an action is targeted at a particular forum.Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783 (1984). In Calder, a California resident in the entertainment business sued the National Enquirer, located in Florida, for libel based on an allegedly defamatory article published by the magazine. While the article was written and edited in Florida, the Court found that personal jurisdiction was properly established in California because of the effects of the defendants' conduct in that state. As the article concerned a California resident with a career in California and relied on California sources, the Court found the defendants' \\"intentional, and allegedly tortious, actions were expressly aimed at California.\\" In the Internet context, the effects test can be used to examine the exact nature of a defendant's Internet activities to determine whether its out of state actions were directed at parties or entities within the forum state. This is referred to in the language of Calder v. Jones as \\"purposeful direction,\\" which requires (a) an intentional action, that was (b) expressly aimed at the forum state, with (c) knowledge that the brunt of the injury would be felt in the forum state.Dudnikov v. Chalk & Vermilion, 514 F.3d 1063 (10th Cir. 2008). If a court finds that a defendant's actions meets the standard of purposeful direction, then personal jurisdiction may be asserted based on Internet activities which do not meet the requisite level of interactivity or minimum contacts needed for other tests of personal jurisdiction in Internet cases. =\\"Sliding scale\\" or \\"Zippo\\" test= In Zippo Manufacturing Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc., a federal court held that \\"the likelihood that general jurisdiction can be constitutionally exercised is directly proportionate to the nature and quality of commercial activity that an entity conducts over the Internet. This sliding scale is consistent with well developed general jurisdiction principles.\\"Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc., 952 F. Supp. 1119 (W.D. Pa. 1997). The \\"sliding scale\\" or \\"Zippo\\" test has been generally accepted as the standard in federal courts in deciding personal jurisdiction in Internet cases. Such cases are now primarily decided based on a determination of the website's \\"interactivity\\". Courts have held that the greater the commercial nature and level of interactivity associated with the website, the more likely it is that the website operator has \\"purposefully avail[ed] itself\\" of the forum state's jurisdiction. Interactivity is measured through an examination of the website's features and intended uses. Websites designed to facilitate or conduct business transactions will often be characterized as interactive. In contrast, a passive website that simply makes the information available to the user will be less likely to have a basis for personal jurisdiction. Websites are thus effectively divided into three categories: websites that conduct business over the Internet, websites where users exchange information with the host computers, and websites that do little more than present information. Websites that do business over the Internet will yield a finding of purposeful availment, while websites that simply present information will not. Purposeful availment for the third type is determined by the level of interactivity and its commercial nature. Criticisms of the Zippo test The Zippo test has been cited by many courts as a standard of analysis for personal jurisdiction with regard to the Internet, but it has also undergone criticism. Zippo provides little guidance as to how much interactivity or commercialism is enough to justify purposeful availment. Furthermore, courts have given little direction as to how those factors interact. Additionally, there is no consideration built into the Zippo test for limiting the number of jurisdictions established. Once a website is sufficiently commercial and interactive beyond a threshold set by a court, jurisdiction may be established with every state.\\"No Bad Puns: A different Approach to the Problem of Personal Jurisdiction and the Internet\\" 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1821, 1833 (2003). Cases interpreting personal jurisdiction involving the Internet within the United States =Evolution of the case law= In the early 1990s, courts struggled with how to treat the Internet with regard to jurisdiction. One of the first noteworthy cases arising in this early stage was Inset Systems, Inc. v. Instruction Set. The Inset court likened the company's use of the Internet to a continuous advertisement targeting customers in all states, and established an extraordinarily broad approach for Internet jurisdiction cases. Some early cases followed the Inset approach. For example, the Inset reasoning was cited by the court in Maritz, Inc. v. Cybergold, Inc. The court in Bensusan Restaurant Corp. v. King, however, deviated from Inset, and established its own more tailored standard. Most notably, the court in Bensusan began looking into the nature of the website in question, holding that the website owned by the defendant was passive in nature. This launched a separate line of reasoning with regard to jurisdiction in Internet cases focused on the specific characteristics of the web, and was cited by Hearst v. Goldberger. Within the same year of the Bensusan decision, the Zippo Manufacturing Co. v. Zippo Dot Com opinion created the widely adopted Zippo Test. Cases such as Cybersell, Inc. v. Cybersell, Inc. and Mink v. AAAA Development L.L.C. followed the approach defined by Zippo. However, more recent cases appear to be departing from the Zippo test and relying upon more traditional approaches to personal jurisdiction.Michael A. Geist, Is There a There There? Toward Greater Certainty for Internet Jurisdiction, 16 Berkeley Tech. L. J. 1345 (2001). For example, the courts in Blakey v. Continental Airlines, Dudnikov v. Chalk & Vermilion, and Boschetto v. Hansing utilize the Calder test to establish the \\"minimum contacts\\" required by Int'l Shoe, a rule not tailored specifically toward Internet cases. =Brief summaries of notable cases= Pres-Kap, Inc. v. System One, Direct Access, Inc., 636 So.2d 1351 (Fla. App. 3 Dist. 1994).Pres-Kap, Inc. v. System One, Direct Access, Inc., 636 So.2d 1351 (Fla. App. 3 Dist. 1994). From New York, Pres-Kap leased System One's computerized airline reservation system that ran off of servers located in Miami, Florida. When Pres-Kap ran into problems with the system, it stopped payment and System One sued for breach of contract in Florida. The Florida court held that a contract with an out of state party was not enough to establish minimum contacts for personal jurisdiction. The in-state server location was also not enough to establish this. Otherwise, any users of online services could be brought into court wherever the relevant servers happen to be located, which the court found to be an unreasonable result. Holding: remote usage of server physically located in a forum state is insufficient to establish minimum contacts. CompuServe, Inc. v. Patterson, 89 F.3d 1257 (6th Cir. 1996). Patterson, a shareware programmer and resident of Texas, distributed and marketed his shareware through CompuServe's shareware distribution service. When Patterson accused CompuServe of trademark infringement for allegedly selling substantially similar products of their own, CompuServe filed for a declaratory judgment in an Ohio federal district court asking for a declaration that it had not infringed Patterson's trademarks. Patterson replied with a motion to dismiss, claiming lack of personal jurisdiction. The Sixth Circuit held that Patterson had sufficient contacts to constitute transaction of business in Ohio that would grant an Ohio court personal jurisdiction based on the Ohio long-arm statute. Specifically: 1\\\\. Patterson purposefully and repeatedly dealt with an Ohio company. 2\\\\. Patterson's CompuServe-based software sales, and CompuServe's alleged infringement occurred in Ohio where CompuServe was based. 3\\\\. Patterson's business contract with CompuServe should have given him notice that he might be required to answer lawsuits in Ohio. Holding: selling software through a company's online service is enough to establish minimum contacts in the state where that company is located. Inset Systems, Inc. v. Instruction Set, 937 F.Supp. 161 (D. Conn. 1996).Inset Systems, Inc. v. Instruction Set, 937 F.Supp. 161 (D. Conn. 1996). Here, Inset Systems claimed that Instruction Set's website made an infringing use of Inset's registered trademark. The Connecticut long-arm statute allows for out of state corporations to be sued by residents of Connecticut as long as the out of state corporation has conducted repeated solicitation for business in Connecticut \\"by mail or otherwise.\\" The court held that this standard was met by Instruction Set's Internet presence, which it found to be at least as much of a case of solicitation as advertising through hard copy mailers and catalogs. The court also found there to be sufficient minimum contacts because Instruction Set should have realized that their nationally available phone number and Internet site could reach potential customers in Connecticut. Holding: solicitation by advertising through an Internet website is enough to establish minimum contacts anywhere. However, other courts have distanced themselves from this concept. See, e.g., Cybersell, Zippo. Maritz, Inc. v. Cybergold, Inc., 947 F.Supp. 1328 (E.D. Mo. 1996).Maritz, Inc. v. Cybergold, Inc., 947 F.Supp. 1328 (E.D. Mo. 1996). Maritz brought action against Cybergold, seeking an injunction to enjoin alleged trademark infringement on Cybergold's website. Cybergold filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Missouri's long-arm statute provides for personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant that has transacted any business within the state or has committed a tortious act within the state. At common law in Missouri, a tortious act committed outside with a resultant injury within Missouri was sufficient to permit jurisdiction. See Peabody Holding Co. Inc. v. Costain Group PLC, 808 F.Supp. 1425, 1433‚Äì34 (E.D.Mo. 1992); May Dep't Stores Co. v. Wilansky, 900 F.Supp. 1154, 1159‚Äì60 (E.D.Mo. 1995). Based on this and the following important factors, the court held that it could exercise personal jurisdiction over Cybergold. 1\\\\. nature and quality of contacts with the forum state ‚Äì Cybergold was advertising and soliciting customers 2\\\\. quantity of contacts ‚Äì Cybergold had made numerous contacts 3\\\\. relation of the cause of action to the contacts ‚Äì Maritz's alleged injuries arose from Cybergold's website 4\\\\. interest of the forum state in providing a forum for its residents ‚Äì interest established where a Missouri corporation's trademark is allegedly being infringed 5\\\\. convenience of the parties ‚Äì Cybergold did not show it would be excessively burdened by the forum Holding: similar to Inset (solicitation by advertising through an Internet website is enough to establish minimum contacts anywhere). Bensusan Restaurant Corp. v. King, 126 F.3d 25 (2d Cir. 1997).Bensusan Restaurant Corp. v. King, 126 F.3d 25 (2d Cir. 1997). In this case, Bensusan Restaurant Corp. claimed that King was infringing on Bensusan's registered trademark \\"The Blue Note\\", the name of Bensusan's successful jazz club in New York City, when he created a website for his Missouri club, also called The Blue Note. New York law allows a non-resident who does not transact business in New York to be sued if the non-resident has committed a tortious act within the state of New York. Since King's website was created by a person physically in Missouri, there was no tortious act in New York and the court held that there was no personal jurisdiction over King. New York law also allows jurisdiction over non-residents that have caused an injury in the state even if the tortious act was committed outside. However, this is limited to people who should have reasonably expected the act to have consequences in the state, and who derive substantial revenue from interstate commerce, something the court held was not shown here. Holding: an allegedly trademark-infringing website alone is not sufficient for personal jurisdiction where the website was created by someone physically located in another state. Hearst Corp. v. Goldberger, 96 Civ 3620, 1997 WL 97097, 1997 U.S. Dist. Lexis 2065 (S.D.N.Y. February 26, 1997).Hearst Corp. v. Goldberger, 96 Civ 3620, 1997 WL 97097, 1997 U.S. Dist. Lexis 2065 (S.D.N.Y. February 26, 1997). Hearst Corp., owner of Esquire magazine, brought a trademark infringement action against Goldberger for his \\"esqwire.com\\" website. Goldberger had created the website, but had not yet sold any products or services; the extent of his interaction with NY entities was limited to a few emails. As in Bensusan, the New York long-arm statute allows a non-resident who does not transact business in New York to be sued if the non-resident has committed a tortious act within the state of New York, or if he commits such an act outside of the state with expected harm occurring within the state and he derives substantial revenue from interstate commerce. The court found that his website amounted to nothing more than an advertisement, and even advertisements targeted at New York have been found inadequate for granting jurisdiction under the transaction of business standard. His emails were analogous to letters or phone calls into New York, which are again insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction. As for the tortious act branch of the long-arm statute, he was not physically within the state of New York when he created the website. Finally, the provision concerning tortious acts committed outside of the state was not applicable because Goldberger had not received any revenue from his website. Holding: Same as Bensusan. An allegedly trademark-infringing website alone is not sufficient for personal jurisdiction where the website was created by someone physically located in another state. Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc., 952 F. Supp. 1119 (W.D. Pa. 1997). In Zippo Manufacturing v. Zippo Dot Com, the court considered state and federal trademark infringement and trademark dilution claims. The plaintiff was Zippo Manufacturing, famous for their lighters. The defendant, Zippo Dot Com, operated a web portal and news service out of California. Dot Com offered three levels of service, the upper two of which required registration with the website and a payment of monthly fees. Dot Com had approximately 3,000 subscribers in Pennsylvania at the time the suit was commenced. The Pennsylvania long-arm statute allowed the court to exercise personal jurisdiction for claims arising out of contracts to supply services in the state. The court found that Dot Com had contracts with the 3,000 subscribers and with seven Pennsylvania ISPs. Since Dot Com's website, unlike that in CyberGold, was an active website, garnering money from people in the state where they were being sued, the court held that it could properly exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The court also applied the three part Int'l Shoe test, finding that it could also exercise jurisdiction under that standard. Holding: A passive webpage is insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction, but an interactive site through which a defendant conducts business with forum residents, such as Zippo Dot Com's, is sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction. Cybersell, Inc. v. Cybersell, Inc., 130 F.3d 414 (9th Cir. 1997). Cybersell, Inc. v. Cybersell, Inc. arose out of a claim of trademark infringement. The plaintiff corporation, in Arizona, sued a Florida corporation who was using the plaintiff's registered trademark on its website. The website created by the defendant was for a small company that advertised its website construction services under the name CyberSell. The website had no \\"active\\" parts, and simply offered a number for someone who viewed the webpage to call to get more information about the services offered. They had no toll-free number, only a local Florida number. Furthermore, there was no evidence that they ever advertised in Arizona, or had any contacts with Arizona. The court found that there was no evidence that the defendant's passive webpage purposefully availed itself of Arizona, and that the court could not exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Holding: Same as Zippo. A passive webpage, such as the one operated by defendant here, is not enough to establish personal jurisdiction. Mink v. AAAA Development L.L.C., 190 F.3d 333 (5th Cir. 1999).Mink v. AAAA Development L.L.C., 190 F.3d 333 (5th Cir. 1999). Plaintiff Mink discussed the possibility of marketing a software product he recently submitted a patent application for with a man named Stark. Stark allegedly shared Mink's ideas with the defendants. Mink brought suit in Texas to claim damages against defendants for conspiring to duplicate his software in violation of his patent-pending rights. Mink was a Texas resident, whereas defendants were based in Vermont. To the knowledge of the court, defendants had no dealings with Texas. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas dismissed the case for lack of personal jurisdiction. Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration, alleging that the defendant's website fulfilled the minimum contacts requirement for personal jurisdiction. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the trial court's decision, applying the Zippo test. It held that the defendant's website, which did not accept online orders, was little more than passive advertisement. The court held that without greater interactivity between the website and the residents of Texas, personal jurisdiction would not be appropriate. Holding: Same as Zippo. A passive webpage, such as defendants' here, is not enough to establish personal jurisdiction. Blakey v. Continental Airlines, 751 A.2d 538 (NJ 2000).Blakey v. Continental Airlines, 751 A.2d 538 (NJ 2000). Plaintiff Blakey filed suit against defendants for defamation, sexual harassment, and hostile work environment based on defamatory statements published by defendants on the company's web-forum. The court reversed a dismissal based upon lack of personal jurisdiction granted by the lower court. The court in this case applied the \\"minimum contacts\\" principle set forth by International Shoe and the \\"effects\\" test set forth by Calder. It held that the defendants' statements were published with the knowledge or purpose of causing harm to the plaintiff in the forum state of New Jersey, and that this satisfied the \\"minimum contacts\\" requirement for proper jurisdiction. Holding: Personal jurisdiction for claims regarding a website require application of the Calder test to establish \\"minimum contacts\\" as defined by Int'l Shoe. Twentieth Cent. Fox Film Corp. v. iCraveTV, 53 U.S.P.Q.2d 1831 (W.D. Pa. 2000).Twentieth Cent. Fox Film Corp. v. iCraveTV, 53 U.S.P.Q.2d 1831 (W.D. Pa. 2000). iCraveTV was a Canadian Internet startup that offered real time streaming of television over the Internet. Twentieth Century Fox brought suit against the startup for copyright infringement. Twentieth Century Fox obtained an injunction against iCraveTV from broadcasting within the United States. The United States court asserted jurisdiction over the Canadian company with significant ease, utilizing the United States registrant address attached to the company's website domain name. After issuance of the restraining order, iCraveTV decided to settle the lawsuit and discontinue its streaming service. Holding: The United States has used a foreign company's website domain registration in the U.S. as justification for personal jurisdiction. Yahoo! Inc. v. La Ligue Contre Le Racisme et l'antisemitisme, 433 F.3d 1199 (9th Cir. 2006) (en banc).Yahoo! Inc. v. La Ligue Contre Le Racisme et l'antisemitisme, 433 F.3d 1199 (9th Cir. 2006) (en banc). In Yahoo! Inc. v. La Ligue Contre Le Racisme et l'antisemitisme (LICRA), the Ninth Circuit applied the Calder test to find that a California court could properly establish specific personal jurisdiction in a declaratory judgment action against two French civil rights organizations suing Yahoo! and Yahoo! France over the availability of Nazi content to French users of its services. Under the threat of substantial financial penalty, the French Court ordered Yahoo! in two interim orders to take \\"all necessary measures to dissuade and render impossible\\" access within France to sites displaying Nazi paraphernalia or other anti-Semitic content, and directed Yahoo! France to display an interstitial warning to users in France prior to enabling their access to Yahoo.com.French Court Order (Nov. 20, 2000). While Yahoo! France substantially complied with the orders, Yahoo! resisted the French court's efforts to dictate changes to its US-based services. (Yahoo! later adopted a policy change addressing many of the French complaints, allegedly for independent reasons.) In reviewing Yahoo's claim for declaratory relief, the Court applied a three-part version of the Calder test to determine if the effects of LICRA's action were sufficiently directed at California to establish personal jurisdiction, including whether the defendant: 1. committed an intentional act; 2. expressly aimed at the forum state, and 3. causing harm that the defendant knows is likely to be suffered in the forum state. Focusing on the French Court's orders, the Ninth Circuit found that compliance would require Yahoo! to perform significant acts in California as the servers supporting yahoo.com, which would have to be modified for compliance, were located in that state, thus fulfilling the first two prongs of the test. Although the penalties contained within the orders had not been enforced and the companies were in substantial compliance, the court found that the threat of future enforcement and the \\"very existence\\" of the orders constituted \\"harm\\" under the third requirement of the Calder test. Holding: Personal jurisdiction under the Calder test can be established where a defendant's foreign court orders require modifying data located on servers in the forum state and the threat of financial penalty for not performing the modifications constitutes harm. Note, however, that the court ordered the case dismissed because three of the judges (that believed personal jurisdiction was established) also believed that the case was not yet ripe and three other judges believed the court lacked personal jurisdiction, yielding a majority that favored dismissal, albeit for different reasons. Dudnikov v. Chalk & Vermilion, 514 F.3d 1063 (10th Cir. 2008). The Tenth Circuit overturned a dismissal granted by the District Court of Colorado due to lack of personal jurisdiction in a case involving a copyright dispute over an eBay auction. The Court applied a five-part test that asked: 1\\\\. whether the defendants have committed an intentional action 2\\\\. that the action was expressly aimed at the forum state 3\\\\. that defendants had knowledge that the brunt of the injury would be felt in the forum state 4\\\\. that the plaintiff's injuries arose out of the defendant's forum related activities 5\\\\. and that traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice are not offended. The court decided that there existed specific jurisdiction over the defendants due to their interactions with the plaintiffs via the Internet services operated by eBay. Holding: Personal jurisdiction is established if the criteria of the Calder test are met. Boschetto v. Hansing, 539 F.3d 1011 (9th Cir. 2008).Boschetto v. Hansing, 539 F.3d 1011 (9th Cir. 2008). Plaintiff Boschetto, a resident of California, purchased a vintage car through eBay from defendant car dealership in Wisconsin. Upon receiving the car, plaintiff discovered many problems with the car which were counter to how the defendant described it. After failing to resolve the issue through eBay, plaintiff brought suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The District Court granted a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and the Ninth Circuit affirmed this decision. The court specifically rejected the reasoning of Cybersell, effectively refusing to apply the Zippo test. Instead, the court applied a three-part test for establishing minimum contacts: (1) purposeful direction of activities toward the forum, (2) a claim arising out of or related to defendant's forum related activities, and (3) reasonableness, fair-play, and substantial justice. The court ruled that the lone transaction for the sale of one item did not establish purposeful availment. Holding: The Ninth Circuit departed from the Zippo test and held that specific jurisdiction is found by \\"minimum contact\\" through a three-part test: purposeful direction, a forum related claim, and fairness. Attaway v. Omega, No. 11A01-0712-CV-608 (Ind. Ct. App. March 13, 2009).Attaway v. Omega, No. 11A01-0712-CV-608 (Ind. Ct. App. March 13, 2009). Defendants purchased a used car from plaintiffs through eBay. The auction stated that winners must make their own delivery arrangements. After the completed transaction, defendants filed a claim to rescind payment because they alleged that the car was not as described, and succeeded in doing so through MasterCard. Plaintiffs brought suit for damages, and the defendants moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The motion was denied in the lower court, and the Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. The court noted that this case may be the first case within which an eBay seller sued a buyer for rescission of payment after the item had been picked up in the seller's state. The court applied the minimum contacts rule outlined by Int'l Shoe as well as the purposeful availment principle from Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, which aligns with the Calder test. It also rejected the Zippo test, declaring that eBay controls the interactivity of the website and not the seller. The court cites Boschetto for its similar fact pattern, but distinguishes itself because the transaction in the present case went beyond the single online purchase of Boschetto. Rather, the defendants had notice that their bid would result in an agreement to appear in Indiana to obtain the vehicle, whether in person or by representative. The court thus ruled that this qualified as a purposeful availment of the privileges of the forum state on the part of the defendants, and that jurisdiction was proper. Holding: Personal jurisdiction is established through \\"minimum contacts\\" and purposeful availment by appearing (even through an agent) in the forum state to pick up an item sold through the Internet. Huggins v. Boyd, Georgia Court of Appeals 2010 (304 Ga. App. 563) In this case involving a permanent protective order prohibiting Jonathan Huggins from stalking Karen Boyd, Huggins appealed the trial court's denial of his motion to set aside the order, arguing that the trial court had no personal jurisdiction over him. Because it was undisputed that Huggins (a South Carolina resident) engaged in the stalking conduct (sending e-mails) only outside Georgia, and because it was further undisputed that Huggins engaged in no other conduct (persistent or otherwise) in Georgia, the protective order was reversed.

Alexander McGill (died 1734) was a Scottish mason and architect, who worked in partnership with fellow architect James Smith.

The son of George McGill, a mason in Arbirlot, Angus, he was apprenticed in June 1697 to Alexander Nisbet, a mason in Edinburgh. By 1710 he had been admitted into the mason's lodge, and he is known to have visited London on at least one occasion (in 1717).Colvin, pp.530-531 From 1699 McGill was involved on work at Kellie Castle, Angus, in association with Alexander Edward, and from 1700 with Smith at Yester House in East Lothian. At the House of Nairn, McGill completed William Bruce's design after the latter's death. His own designs include those of Donibristle House in Fife, Blair Drummond (1715‚Äì17), which was demolished in 1870, and a town house for James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose in Glasgow's Drygate (demolished 1855). McGill designed the original Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute for John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, which was later remodelled by William Adam, before burning down, leaving only McGill's pavilions.Colvin, pp.530-531, Fleming, p.331 McGill also designed several churches, including the New Kirk in Dumfries, and Newbattle Parish Church (1727).

Women generally have hips that are wider than the shoulders while the opposite is true for males. Human body shape is a complex phenomenon with sophisticated detail and function. The general shape or figure of a person is defined mainly by the molding of skeletal structures, as well as the distribution of muscles and fat. Skeletal structure grows and changes only up to the point at which a human reaches adulthood and remains essentially the same for the rest of their life. Growth is usually completed between the ages of 13 and 18, at which time the epiphyseal plates of long bones close, allowing no further growth (see Human skeleton). Many aspects of body shape vary with gender and especially female body shape has a complicated cultural history. The science of measuring and assessing body shape is called anthropometry. Physiology During puberty, differentiation of the male and female body occurs for the purposes of reproduction. In adult humans, muscle mass may change due to exercise, and fat distribution may change due to hormone fluctuations. Inherited genes play a large part in the development of body shape. = Facial features = Due to the action of testosterone, males may develop these facial-bone features during puberty: * A more prominent brow bone (bone across the centre of the forehead from around the middle of eyebrow across to the middle of the other) * A heavier jaw. * A larger head size. * More prominent chin. * Larger nose bone. (testosterone thickens the brow and \\"upper bridge of the nose\\") Because females have around 1/4 the amount of testosterone of a male, these features do not develop to the same extent. Hence female faces are generally more similar to those of pre-pubertal children. = Skeletal structure = Skeletal structure frames the overall shape of the body and does not alter much after maturity. Males are, on average, taller, but body shape may be analyzed after normalizing with respect to height.The length of each bone is constant, but the joint angle will change as the bone moves. Female traits Widening of the hip bones occurs as part of the female pubertal process, and estrogens (the predominant sex hormones in females) cause a widening of the pelvis as a part of sexual differentiation. Hence females generally have wider hips, permitting childbirth. Because the female pelvis is flatter, more rounded and proportionally larger, the head of the fetus may pass during childbirth.See Gender differences in Human skeleton and Sexual dimorphism in Hips The sacrum in females is shorter and wider, and also directed more toward the rear (see image).Saukko P, Knight B. Knight's Forensic Pathology, 3rd Ed. Edward Arnold Ltd. 2004. . This sometimes affects their walking style, resulting in hip sway. The upper limb in females have an outward angulation (carrying angle) at elbow level to accommodate the wider pelvis. After puberty, hips are generally wider than shoulders. However, not all females adhere to this stereotypical pattern of secondary sex characteristics. Both male and female hormones are present in the human body, and though only one of them is predominant in an adult, the other hormone has effects on body shape to some extent. Male traits An adult man with pronounced shoulder width and expanded chest, both traits typically associated with male physique Widening of the shoulders occurs as part of the male pubertal process. Expansion of the ribcage is caused by the effects of testosterone during puberty. = Fat distribution, muscles and tissues = The rear view of a naked adult woman with pronounced hip width and large buttocks, both typically associated with female physique Body shape is affected by body fat distribution, which is correlated to current levels of sex hormones. Muscles and fat distribution may change from time to time, unlike bone structure, depending on food habits, exercises and hormone levels.  Fat distribution  Estrogen causes fat to be stored in the buttocks, thighs, and hips in females. When females reach menopause and the estrogen produced by ovaries declines, fat migrates from their buttocks, hips and thighs to their waists. Later fat is stored in the belly similar to men. Thus females generally have relatively narrow waists and large buttocks, and this along with wide hips make for a wider hip section and a lower waist- hip ratio compared to men. Hormonal and genetic factors may produce male-like distribution of fat in women i.e. around the belly instead of buttocks and thighs. Estrogen increases fat storage in the body, which results in more fat stored in the female body. Body fat percentage recommendations are higher for females, as this may serve as an energy reserve for pregnancy. Males have less subcutaneous fat in their faces due to the effects of testosterone; testosterone also reduces fat by aiding fast metabolism. Males generally deposit fat around waists and abdomens (producing an \\"apple shape\\") due to the lack of estrogen.  Muscles  Testosterone helps build and maintain muscles through exercise. On average, men have around 10 times more testosterone than women. Prominent muscles of the body include the latissimus dorsi, trapezius, pectoral muscles (muscles critical for a strong erect posture) as well as biceps and triceps in the arms and quadriceps and hamstrings in the thighs.  Breasts  Females have enlarged breasts due to functional mammary glands, which develop from puberty onward due to the effects of estrogen. Mammary glands do not contain muscle tissue. The shape of female breasts is affected by age, genetic factors, and body weight. = Weight = Being overweight or underweight causes change in the human body's shape as well as posture and walking style. This is measured using Body Mass Index - BMI or waist circumference. Depending on the BMI, a body may be referred to as slim, overweight, or obese. Dieting, in conjunction with exercise, may be used to bring and keep the BMI within a healthy or desired range. A person can calculate BMI, that is body mass index, to check that where you lie in terms of weight and height. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is ideal. Above 24.9 -> obese; Below 18.5 -> underweight The fats and carbohydrates in food constitute the majority of energy used by the body. They are measured cumulatively in the USA and many other places in calories and in kilojoules in some other parts of the world. =Body posture and gait= Body shape has effects on body posture and gait, and has a major role in physical attraction. This is because a body's shape implies an individual's hormone levels during puberty, which implies fertility, and it also indicates current levels of sex hormones. A pleasing shape also implies good health and fitness of the body.  Impact on health  According to the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, those people with a larger waist (apple shaped) have higher health risks than those who carry excess weight on the hips and thighs (pear shaped). People with apple shaped bodies who carry excess weight are at greater risk of high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol. = Fitness and exercise = Different forms of exercises are practiced for the fitness of the body and also for health. It is a common belief that targeted exercise reduces fat in specific parts of the body ‚Äîfor example, that exercising muscles around the belly reduces fat in the belly. This, however, is now proven to be a misconception; these exercises may change body shape by improving muscle tone but any fat reduction is not specific to the locale. Spot reduction exercises are not useful unless you plan proper exercise regime to lose overall calories. But exercising reduces fat throughout the body, and where fat is stored depends on hormones. Liposuction is surgery commonly used in developed societies to remove fat from the body.  Social and cultural ideals  Michelangelo's David, a statue with a V-shaped torso that has been considered physically attractive in many cultures The general body shapes of female and male bodies both have significant social and cultural symbolism. Physical attractiveness is closely associated with traits that are considered typical of either sex. The body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio, and especially waist-to-chest ratio in men have been shown in studies to rank as overall more desirable to women. To be deemed to have an \\"athletic built\\"/build is usually a reference to wide shoulders, a muscular upper body and well-developed upper-arm muscles which are all traits closely associated with masculinity, similarly to other specifics of the male sex, like beards. These traits are seen more sexually attractive to women and also associated with higher intelligence, good leadership qualities and better health.Viren Swami, \\"The Influence of Body Weight and Shape in Determining Female and Male Physical Attractiveness\\" in Marlene V. Kindes (2006, editor), Body Image: New Research. Nova Publishers, New York. ; pp. 36‚Äî51  Terminology  Classifications of female body sizes are mainly based on the circumference of the bust-waist-hip (BWH), as in 36‚Äì24‚Äì36 (inches) respectively. In this case, the waist-hip ratio is 24/36 = 0.67. Many terms or classifications are used to describe body shape types: *V shape: Males tend to have proportionally smaller buttocks, bigger chests and wider shoulders, wider latissimus dorsi and a small waist which makes for a V-shape of the torso. *Hourglass shape: The female body is significantly narrower in the waist both in front view and profile view. The waist is narrower than the chest region due to the breasts, and narrower than the hip region due to the width of the buttocks, which results in an hourglass shape. *Apple: The stomach region is wider than the hip section, mainly in males. *Pear or spoon or bell: The hip section is wider than the upper body, mainly in females. *Rectangle or straight or banana: The hip, waist, and shoulder sections are relatively similar.

As the name indicates (Terra Alta = High Land) the area is in the mountains. It features in a number of Picasso‚Äôs paintings. Traditionally, due to its geographical isolation, this area traditionally only made wine for local consumption and has only recently started to produce modern Mediterranean style wines. Several cooperative wineries were designed and built in the 1920s by C√®sar Martinell, a student of Antoni Gaud√≠, and are notable for their modernist architectural style. History In the times of the ancient Romans, the road from Zaragoza to Tortosa passed through the area, and is probably when grape growing was first introduced. In the Middle Ages, the Knights Templar planted vines, but the geographical distance to markets and to ports meant that a lot of vineyards were converted to olive groves instead. There are extant legal documents on the regulation of the grape and wine industry: Las Costums d‚ÄôOrta dating from 1296 and Las Costums de Miravet from 1319. During the 19th century the vinos rancios (rancid wines) from Terra Alta, such as ‚ÄúAmber Blanc‚Äù attained great fame. However, the area was devastated by the outbreak of the phylloxera bug. The current vineyards were replanted (by grafting onto New World rootstock) between 1920 and 1950, largely by means of the creations of cooperatives. Terra Alta DOP acquired official status in 1972 and there are currently around 6,000 ha covered, with 1,242 grape growers and 62 wineries registered. Geography The main town in the area is Gandesa. To the east the Terra Alta DO borders on Tarragona (DO), while to the west it borders on the province of Teruel. The mountains reach a height of 950 m above sea level, though the vineyards are lower down on the slopes, valleys and plateaus. Climate The climate is mixture of Mediterranean and continental. The summers are long, hot and dry and the winters are very cold. The average annual temperature is 16.5¬∞C (max 35¬∞C in summer, min -5¬∞C in winter). There is a risk of late frosts in spring. Average annual rainfall is about 400 mm. A dry wind, known as el Mestral from the valley of the River Ebro is influential in keeping humidity low and thus protecting the vines from disease. Soils The soils are clayey, with a good lime content, poor in organic material, with a significant proportion of sizable elements which allows for good drainage. Authorised Grape Varieties The authorised grape varieties are: * Red: Garnatxa Negra, Garnatxa Peluda, Sams√≥ / Mazuela / Carignan, Ull de llebre, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Garnatxa Tintorera, Syrah * White: Garnatxa Blanca, Macabeu, Parellada, Sauvignon Blanc, Moscatel de Grano Menudo, Moscatell d‚ÄôAlejandria, Chenin blanc, Pedro Xim√©nez, Chardonnay References External links * DOP Terra Alta Official Website Category:Catalan wine Category:Wine regions of Spain Category:Spanish wine Category:Appellations Category:Wine classification Category:Terra Alta (comarca) ","title":"Terra Alta (DO)"},{"id":"11831912","text":"HMS Euryalus was a armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy around 1900. Badly damaged by multiple accidents while fitting out, she was not completed until 1904. She became flagship of the Australia Station that year and was reduced to reserve upon her return in 1905. Recommissioned in 1906, she became a training ship for the North America and West Indies Station before being placed in reserve with the Third Fleet in 1909. Recommissioned at the start of World War I, Euryalus was assigned to the 7th Cruiser Squadron. She became flagship of the Southern Force defending the eastern end of the English Channel from any German attack, shortly after the war began. She was present at the Battle of Heligoland Bight a few weeks after the war began, but saw no combat. She was transferred to convoy escort duties in the Bay of Biscay in late 1914, before being sent to Egypt in early 1915. Euryalus was then assigned to support British troops during the Gallipoli Campaign by providing naval gunfire. She covered the landing at Cape Helles in April as well as providing fire support during one subsequent British offensive. She became the flagship of the East Indies Station in January 1916, until relieved in July 1917. Later that year she began a conversion into a minelayer at Hong Kong, but this was still incomplete when the war ended. Euryalus returned home in 1919 and was sold for scrap the following year. Design and description Euryalus was designed to displace . The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of .Friedman 2012, pp. 335‚Äì36 She was powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The engines were powered by 30 Belleville boilers. On their sea trials all of the Cressy-class cruisers, except the lead ship, exceeded their designed speed.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 69 She carried a maximum of of coal and her complement ranged from 725Friedman 2012, p. 336 to 760 officers and enlisted men.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 68 Her main armament consisted of two breech-loading (BL) Mk X guns in single gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure. They fired shells to a range of .Friedman 2011, pp. 71‚Äì72 Her secondary armament of twelve BL 6-inch Mk VII guns was arranged in casemates amidships. Eight of these were mounted on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather.Friedman 2012, pp. 243, 260‚Äì61 They had a maximum range of approximately with their shells.Friedman 2011, pp. 80‚Äì81 A dozen quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 12 cwt guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats, eight on casemates on the upper deck and four in the superstructure.Friedman 2012, pp. 243, 336 Euryalus also carried three 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18-inch torpedo tubes. The ship's waterline armour belt had a maximum thickness of and was closed off by transverse bulkheads. The armour of the gun turrets and their barbettes was 6 inches thick while the casemate armour was 5 inches thick. The protective deck armour ranged in thickness from and the conning tower was protected by of armour. Construction and service Launching of HMS Euryalus Euryalus, named after the Greek hero Euryalus, was laid down on 18 July 1899 by Vickers, Sons & Maxim at their Barrow-in-Furness shipyard.Silverstone, p. 230 She was launched 20 May 1901 in front of 30,000 spectators, and christened by Mrs. Douglas Vickers, wife of one of the directors of the company. On 11 June 1901, the south side of the Ramsden dock at Barrow caught fire, and was practically destroyed before the flames could be extinguished. The recently launched Euryalus was laying alongside this wharf, and the fire set ablaze the teak wood sheathing of the cruiser. Considerable damage was done to the ship before she was hauled from the pier into the middle of the dock, and her completion was severely delayed. Towed to Cammell Laird at Birkenhead for repairs, the ship slipped off the blocks supporting her in drydock and was severely damaged. While on sea trials, she collided with the auxiliary vessel Traveller on 27 June 1903 at Devonport. Euryalus was finally completed on 5 January 1904, nearly two years after her sister ships. Upon commissioning she became flagship of the Australia Station before returning home in 1905. Reduced to reserve upon her arrival, she was sent to the North America and West Indies Station in 1906, where she served as a boys' training ship attached to the 4th Cruiser Squadron for the next three years. Euryalus was assigned to the reserve Third Fleet when she returned home in 1909.Friedman, p. 239 At the outbreak of the war in August 1914, she was assigned to the 7th Cruiser Squadron, tasked with patrolling the Broad Fourteens of the North Sea in support of a force of destroyers and submarines based at Harwich, which protected the eastern end of the English Channel from German warships attempting to attack the supply route between England and France.Corbett, vol. I, pp. 171‚Äì72 On 10 August, she became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Arthur Christian, commander of the Southern Force, formed to command all of the forces defending the eastern end of the Channel. During the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August, the ship was in reserve off the Dutch coast, and saw no action.Osborne, pp. 37, 51, 104 On 20 September 1914, Euryalus and her sisters , and were on patrol in the Broad Fourteen. Euryalus had to return to port that morning to recoal. Two days later the three remaining cruisers were sunk by the SM U-9 and Christian was subsequently relieved of his command.Massie, pp. 133‚Äì136 As a result of these losses, she, and her sister , were transferred to the 12th Cruiser Squadron to escort ships between England and Gibraltar in early October.Corbett, vol. I, pp. 202, 330; Friedman 2012, p. 239 Euryalus and Bacchante were transferred to Egypt in late January 1915 to reinforce the defences of the Suez Canal, although the Turkish raid on the Suez Canal had already been repulsed by the time that they arrived in February. Upon arrival Rear-Admiral Richard Peirse, commander of the East Indies Station, hoisted his flag in Euryalus. By this time the preliminary bombardments of the Turkish defences of the Dardanelles had already occurred, and the sisters were transferred north in March as the Turks east of the Canal proved to be reasonably quiet.Corbett, vol. II, pp. 118, 120, 142, 293 Euryalus became the flagship of Rear Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss in April, after he was put in charge of the main landings at Gallipoli. During the landings at Cape Helles on the morning of 25 April, Euryalus transported three companies of the 1st Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers and a platoon of the Royal Naval Division, and then provided fire support to the landing after the soldiers were transferred to their boats for the actual landing on Beach 'W'. She also bombarded Turkish positions during the Second Battle of Krithia on 6 May. A month later, Wemyss hauled down his flag and resumed his original commanding of the Allied base at Mudros. Euryalus received a brief refit at Malta from 30 December 1915 to 20 January 1916 before proceeding to Egypt to reinforce the defences there.Corbett, vol. II, pp. 310, 314, 330‚Äì31, 377; vol. III, pp. 24, 243; Transcript On 15 January 1916 Wemyss, the new Commander-in- Chief, East Indies, hoisted his flag aboard Euryalus. From 3 January 1917 through 24 April, she was refitted at Bombay. On 29 June she bombarded the barracks in the Yemeni town of Hodeida together with the troopship RIM Northbrook of the Royal Indian Marine. Rear Admiral Ernest Gaunt relieved Wemyss as commander-in-chief on 20 July 1917 and transferred his flag to Northbrook on 29 August. In early November, the ship dismounted four 6-inch and four 12-pounder guns at Bombay before proceeding to Hong Kong. She was paid off there on 20 DecemberTranscript to complete her conversion into a minelayer. This was not finished when the war ended, and she returned to Britain to be laid up at the Nore in April 1919.Gardiner & Gray, p. 12 Euryalus was sold for scrap on 1 July 1920 and broken up in Germany beginning in September 1922.

It was broadcast on Italia 1 and in the Italian dub Fran Fine was renamed Francesca Cacace, Italian nanny from Frosinone, a town of Ciociaria, a countryside of Central Italy. Sylvia Fine was renamed \\"Zia Assunta\\" (\\"Aunt Assunta\\"), a relative of Francesca's family offering a shelter to her niece. Yetta Rosenberg was renamed \\"Zia Yetta\\" (\\"Aunt Yetta\\"), Polish, the few bits of her backstory provided altered to hide her Jewish origins. Val Toriello was renamed \\"Lalla Toriello\\". Francesca Cacace was no longer of Jewish heritage, but hailing from a Roman Catholic family, having become a lapsed Catholic (\\"The Kibbutz\\" is, in fact, a pretty unclear episode in the Italian version). Almost every reference to Jewish religion was altered accordingly in the show.

Then there exists a disc of radius b and an analytic function œÜ in this disc, such that f(œÜ(z)) = z for all z in this disc. Here b > 1/72 is an absolute constant.

This theorem is named after Edmund Landau. Valiron's theorem Bloch's theorem was inspired by the following theorem of Georges Valiron: Theorem. If f is a non-constant entire function then there exist discs D of arbitrarily large radius and analytic functions œÜ in D such that f(œÜ(z)) = z for z in D. Bloch's theorem corresponds to Valiron's theorem via the so-called Bloch's Principle.  Bloch's and Landau's constants  The lower bound 1/72 in Bloch's theorem is not the best possible. The number B defined as the supremum of all b for which this theorem holds, is called the Bloch's constant. Bloch's theorem tells us B ‚â• 1/72, but the exact value of B is still unknown.

Gideon bankrolled the Hanovarian-Whig government's suppression of the Jacobite Rising of 1745, subsequently becoming a trusted \\"adviser of the Government,\\" and a supporter of the Jew Bill of 1753. James Picciotto in his Sketches of Anglo-Jewish History (1875) described Gideon as the \\"Rothschild of his day\\" and the \\"pillar of state credit.\\" Background Sampson Gideon was born at London Wall, City of London, second son in five children of Rowland Gideon (n√© Rohiel Abudiente), who traded in the West Indies, and his second wife Esther de Porto (also Jewish), daughter of Domingo (or Abraham) do Porto, a diamond buyer in Madras, India. Sampson Gideon's paternal grandfather Moses Abudiente was a Sephardi born at Lisbon, Portugal, but moved to Gl√ºckstadt at Holstein an area close to Hamburg, where Rowland Gideon was born.Article by Edgar Samuel. The Abudientes (including Rowland and his brother) were active as part of the elite Sephardic slave plantation ruling class in the West Indies, active in the production of sugar cane in first Barbados, Antigua and then Nevis (moving each time to avoid taxation). The Abudientes made their extensive fortune from the sugar cane, worked by Black slaves and the unfree labour of European identured servants on their plantations. After moving to London, England, Rowland Gideon was admitted to the Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers on 17 February 1698 and was likely the first Jewish Freeman of the City of London. He was admitted to the company due to his Barbados trading connections, through the person of Samuel Swynock, one of the Wardens of the Painter-Stainers. Swynock had been close to Antonio Fernandez Carvajal, one of the Sephardic merchants allied to Oliver Cromwell and the Roundheads. Indeed, Carvajal founded the Creechuch Lane Synagogue where Sampson Gideon's parents were married by Haham Aylion on 26 December 1693. Rowland Gideon himself was the Treasurer of Bevis Marks Synagogue in the year that it was founded. Sampson's siblings included an unknown half-brother who died at Nevis in 1684, as well as three sisters; Bara Abudiente, Sara Abudiente and Rahel Abudiente. His brothers-in-law, married to the aforementioned sisters, included; Simson da Costa Athias (investor in both the Royal African Company, which traded in slaves and the Bank of England), Jacob Lobatto and Moses Carriao de Paiba. Finance Gideon began his career at the age of 20 by speculating in coffee houses on lottery tickets, government securities, and the South Sea company. By the 1730s he was dealing in English, Dutch and French securities, as well as marine insurance. During the War of Austrian Succession (1740 to 1748) he broke through the anti-Jewish sentiment in financial circles in the City. He raised money in the Jewish community to help finance the English army, and became a key advisor to the Pelhams and to the Bank of England on matters of high finance. His capital rose from ¬£1,500 in 1719, to ¬£45,000 in 1740, ¬£180,000 in 1750, and ¬£350,000 in 1759. E. N. Williams, \\"'Our Merchants Are Princes': The English Middle Classes in the Eighteenth Century \\" History Today (Aug 1962) 12#8 pp 548‚Äì557 at p. 548. Gideon began business in 1720 with a capital of ¬£1,500 (worth ¬£176,100 in 2019) inherited from his family, which increased so rapidly that in 1729 he was admitted a sworn broker with a capital of ¬£25,000 (worth ¬£3,670,000 in 2019). Gideon was involved in financial activities as a broker, a middle-man in the metal trade with the British East India Company. He was one of a number of contemporary Sephardic financiers in British public life who specialised in metal brokering, along with Abraham Mocatta. The Swedish Hats-government (controlled by pro-Jacobite freemasons) had invited Sephardic Jews in England to join the Swedish East India Company, which also included a number of Scottish diaspora who were members of the Masonic Lodges. The British government thus encouraged pro- Hanoverian freemason Joseph Salvador and Sampson Gideon to entice influential Scots to join the British East India Company to undermine the Swedish-based Jacobite masonry. Charles Edward Stuart. Gideon financially backed up the Whiggish regime against the Jacobites. Sampson Gideon was able to successfully navigate the South Sea Company bubble, which bankrupted so many prominent people in Britain (indeed, James Picciotto in his Sketches of Anglo-Jewish History states that no \\"Hebrew\\" name is to be found on the list of insolvencies).. Gideon offered his services, both private and political, to Robert Walpole and his ruling Whiggish government under the new Hanoverian monarchy. The first major conflict that he helped to financed was the War of Jenkins' Ear, against Spain. The Spanish Inquisition was still active and many of the Sephardi traders in the West Indies consequently viewed the Spanish cause in the conflict as potentially threatening to their trade interests. Gideon's most significant historical act came during the Jacobite rising of 1745 during the War of the Austrian Succession when he provided assistance to the sitting Whig-Hanoverian regime against Charles Edward Stuart (the Young Pretender) and the Jacobites who were attempting to restore the Stuart monarchy, with the help of their Bourbon French allies.. When the Young Pretender landed on the west-coast of Scotland in July 1745, there was panic in London as most of the British Army was engaged on the European Continent at the time.. Consequently, there was a run on the banks (this was especially problematic for the Bank of England). This hit the finances of the Whiggish government hard under the Pelham Ministry. Rumours abounded among the common people that the Duke of Newcastle, the Secretary of State, had fled the country (he was forced to appear publicly outside of Newcastle House). When many were selling, Gideon calmly purchased as many government securities as he could at rock bottom prices and backed up the Bank of England. Gideon advised the government in the issuing of a loan, taking a significant chunk himself. This stabilised the situation and by the time that the Jacobite advance into England had halted before it reached London and the momentum switched as they were now in retreat back to Scotland, Gideon had doubled his wealth. The Whiggish political class under the Pelhams and the Hanoverian monarchy reigined supreme and owed a significant part of their position to Gideon's calm actions and financial activities. Politics Gideon was ambitious and wished to found a dynasty with vast landed estate interests in England (as the Rothschid family would go on to successfully achieve in the next century). However, it was not entirely clear whether Jews could legally own property in England.. Jews had gradually began to resettle in England during the times of Cromwell, having been barred from the country since the Edict of Expulsion at the close of the 13th century. In the previous century, Gideon's fellow Sephardi, Antonio Fernandez Carvajal, had become the first endenizened Jew. However, following the English Reformation, those who did not conform to the Church of England (including English Dissenters and Catholics, as well as Jews) could not hold office, be called to the bar, obtain a naval commission, study for a university degree or vote in elections. There were additional commercial restrictions on endenizened Jews and they had to have the approval of the British Parliament to own real estate. As Sampson Gideon and Joseph Salvador had provided a useful service to the Hanoverian-Whiggish regime against their rivals, they were confident enough to lobby Henry Pelham to introduce the Jewish Naturalisation Act 1753 to Parliament. Jews and Dissenters in British America had already achieved naturalisation with the Plantation Act 1740 (this was not extended to Catholics). Death Gideon died of dropsy at Belvedere House, near Erith, Kent, in October 1762, aged 63, having a gained a fortune recorded as ¬£350,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). He left ¬£1000 to the Sephardi Jewish congregation in London on condition he was buried with honour as a married man in their cemetery in Mile End. (He did not marry a Jew, which under Jewish law precludes recognition as a married man). In 2005, the Bexley Civic Society restored a memorial to Sampson Gideon, located in the grounds of All Saints Church, Belvedere, and produced a plaque bearing a brief history of his life. The plaque reads, \\"This memorial commemorates the life of Sampson Gideon (1699‚Äì1762) sometime owner of Belvedere House, and father of Lord Eardley. A financier of nationwide renown, he is believed to have been a founder of the London Stock Exchange. Such was his reputation that the British Government resorted both to his wealth and advice to underwrite the national debt, and finance the army during the Jacobite Rebellion of 1745 and the Seven Years' War of 1756‚Äì63. Amongst his descendants can be numbered Hugh Childers, Gladstone's Chancellor in his 1880‚Äì1885 ministry and Erskine Childers, Irish patriot and author of 'The Riddle of the Sands'.

It was the custom in the Bentvueghels to initiate new members and give them a nickname (the so-called bentname). Gaspar de Witte was given the nickname Grondel (\\"Gudgeon\\").Gaspar de Witte on Hadrianus. The reason why he was named after this species of fish is not known. Around 1648 he is reported to have spent time in France. When he returned to Antwerp he became \\"winemaster\\" (used to denote the son of a master) in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1650. Gaspar de Witte also operated a small trading business in painting necessities. His engraved portrait by the engraver Richard Collin after a painting by Anton Goubau was published in Cornelis de Bie's 17th century book on Flemish painters called Het Gulden Cabinet. He was the teacher of Cornelis Huysmans and possible also of Adriaen Verdoel.Adriaan Verdoel Biography in: Arnold Houbraken, De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen, 1718 Work =General= Italianate Landscape with Shepherds at a Fountain Gaspar de Witte is remembered for his landscapes and his collaborations with other artists on gallery paintings. =Landscapes= His landscapes are similar to those of his contemporary landscape painters of Brussels. Most of them are not in the Italianate style then popular in Flanders but he often still included some Italian antique relics to respond to the prevalent taste in the local market.Gaspar de Witte, A Landscape with Travellers Stopping to Rest by a River at Sotheby's His landscapes often included pastoral scenes with shepherds, religious scenes or genre scenes such as village fairs or dances. His landscapes often involved collaborations with other painters who painted the staffage. Four collaborations with Anton Goubau on Italianizing landscapes are recorded.Agnes Tieze, Anton Goubau: 1616‚Äì1698, Eisele, 2004, p. 55 In addition to imaginary landscapes he also produced a number of topographical views of country estates. These were often executed in collaboration with other painters who painted the staffage. An example is the View of Schoten Castle, which was a collaborative effort with Gonzales Coques. This composition shows a bird-eye view of Schoten Castle in Schoten painted by de Witte with two woman and a boy painted by Coques in the front right corner. Another example of a collaboration with Coques is the Portrait of Clara Rubens with Her Family, which shows Clara Rubens, the daughter of Peter Paul Rubens, with her family against a background landscape showing Merksem Castle.Jacob en Filips Van Parijs at Merksem.net =Gallery paintings= Interior of an art collector's cabinet with many visitors Gaspar de Witte was a collaborator in a few compositions belonging to the genre of the 'gallery paintings'. The 'gallery paintings' genre is native to Antwerp where Frans Francken the Younger and Jan Brueghel the Elder were the first artists to create paintings of art and curiosity collections in the 1620s.Susan Merriam, SeventeenthCentury Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012 Gallery paintings depict large rooms in which many paintings and other precious items are displayed in elegant surroundings. The earliest works in this genre represented art objects together with other items such as scientific instruments or peculiar natural specimens. The genre became immediately quite popular and was followed by other artists such as Jan Brueghel the Younger, Cornelis de Baellieur, Hans Jordaens, David Teniers the Younger, Gillis van Tilborch, Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg and Hieronymus Janssens. The picture galleries depicted were sometimes real galleries. However, the majority were imaginary galleries, which sometimes included allegorical figures.Marr, Alexander (2010) 'The Flemish 'Pictures of Collections' Genre: An Overview', Intellectual History Review, 20: 1, 5‚Äì25 An example of a gallery painting by Caspar de Witte is the Interior of an art collector's cabinet with many visitors, which is a collaboration with Hieronymus Janssens and Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg.Interior of an art collector's cabinet with many visitors at the Netherlands Institute for Art History The composition depicts an imaginary art gallery with many visitors who are appreciating and discussing some of the artworks in the gallery. This gallery painting represents a later development in the genre initiated by David Teniers the Younger that excluded non-art objects from the gallery. The figures in the gallery painting are portrayed as if they form part of an elite who possess a privileged knowledge, i.e. the ability to appreciate art. The genre of gallery paintings had by that time become a medium to accentuate the notion that the powers of discernment associated with connoisseurship are socially superior to or more desirable than other forms of knowing. The allegorical female figures Nature and Pictura in an art-collection, with representative Antwerp canvasses Gaspar de Witte has been identified recently as the painter likely responsible for an allegorical gallery painting referred to as The allegorical female figures Nature and Pictura in an art-collection, with representative Antwerp canvasses. Rather than representing an actual depiction of a picture gallery with collectors, art dealers or famous painters this composition falls into the allegorical type of gallery painting as it places two allegorical figures in the gallery. The figure of Plenty on the left has beside her three putti bearing a cornucopia, symbolizing her largesse. Seated beside her is a personification of Pictura or Painting who is identified by the palette in her hands. The statues and books on the table and the musical instrument below refer to a wider embodiment of the Arts in general. The allegory was intended to be one of Peace or the effects of Peace since in the lower right hand corner of the gallery are the accoutrements of war, discarded in a pile.A picture gallery with an allegory of peace at Sotheby's The picture can also be regarded as an allegorical representation of the vanitas of worldly pursuits such as war which are transient in comparison to the arts and love, which endure for forever. Gaspar de Witte was one of the collaborators in the gallery painting by Jacob de Formentrou referred to as Cabinet of pictures, currently in the Royal Collection.Jacob de Formentrou (fl.164059), A cabinet of pictures, at the Royal Collection It depicts a room full of pictures populated with human figures who are usually interpreted as representing art connoisseurs. The various pictures that are hung on the walls of the room represent works of leading mid-17th-century artists of Antwerp.Hannelore Magnus, 'Schilders, connoisseurs en hun (Salomons)oordeel, Het Schilderijenkabinet (1659) van Jacob de Formentrou en Erasmus II Quellinus' A cabinet of pictures depicts an imaginary gallery and can be seen as a summing up of the best of what artists in mid 17th-century Antwerp could produce.Nadia Sera Baadj, Monstrous creatures and diverse strange things\\": The Curious Art of Jan van Kessel the Elder (16261679), A dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (History of Art) in The University of Michigan, 2012 It is believed that the pictures included in the composition were painted by each of the relevant artists. Gaspar de Witte is believed to have painted the landscape right of the door, signed G.D.WITTE.Art lovers in a painting cabinet at the Netherlands Institute for Art History The fact that de Witte was selected to participate in this collaborative effort demonstrates the esteem in which he was held by his fellow artists in Antwerp in his time.

Little of her work was published in her lifetime, but some 45 pieces have been ascribed to her. Life Anne was the posthumous younger daughter of Sir Henry Lee, and a member of a wealthy family. Her mother died not long after her birth. She and her sister Eleanor were brought up at Adderbury House, where they lived with the mistress, mother and grandmother of its owner, the poet and libertine John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, who was Anne Wharton's uncle. In 1673 she married Thomas Wharton (1648‚Äì1715). She paid visits to Paris for her health in 1678 and 1680, as she suffered from eye troubles and convulsions, possibly linked to syphilis. Her husband soon neglected her and they had no children. Death Anne Wharton died on 29 October 1685 at Adderbury, Oxfordshire. Her death, in her sister Eleanor's house, was very painful. The poet Robert Gould in an eclogue to the memory of Eleanor, who died in 1691, observes that her own was a peaceful one by comparison: \\"Think how her sister, dear 'Urania' [i. e. Anne], fell, When ev'ry Arte'ry, Fibre, Nerve and Vein Were by Convulsions torn, and fill'd with Pain...\\" Allegations After her death, her brother-in-law, Goodwin Wharton claimed in his autobiography to have had an affair with her, and alleged that she had had three other affairs ‚Äì with Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough before her marriage (ostensibly bribing a servant to let him into the girl's room at night) and with \\"Jack Howe\\" (probably the Whig politician John Grubham Howe, 1657‚Äì1722)Entry in The Concise Dictionary of National Biography (London: Oxford University Press, 1939 [1882]). in the 1680s ‚Äì as well as being \\"lain with long by her uncle, my Lord Rochester.\\" Her letters to her husband from Paris seem devoted, but when he visited her again in Paris, to obtain her signature on some documents to do with her ¬£8000 estate, her ardour seems to have cooled. Works Wharton is remembered today for the verse drama Love's Martyr; or, Witt above Crowns, and for a number of lyrical poems and biblical paraphrases, but all that was published in her lifetime was a heartfelt elegy on Rochester's death, under the pseudonym Urania. This brought appreciative poetic responses from Edmund Waller and Aphra Behn. Behn's was a verse-letter addressed to Anne, included in her 1684 Poems on Several Occasions, in which she took the opportunity of defending herself from a charge of bawdiness brought by the future bishop Gilbert Burnet, who had attended Rochester on his deathbed. Anne may also have prompted Behn to provide a prologue for Rochester's play Valentinian, which was first performed in 1684. A modern critical edition of 34 known works by Anne Wharton was published in 1997, but at least eleven other poems have been discovered in manuscript since then. Her \\"Elegy on the Earl of Rochester\\" appears in the New Oxford Book of Seventeenth-Century Verse (1991) and \\"A Paraphrase on the Last Speech of Dido in Virgil's Aeneis\\" in Seventeenth-Century Poetry: An Annotated Anthology.

Meanwhile, the Ottoman Sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent, took no action at this stage despite the pleas of his vassal.  Aftermath  For the Habsburgs, the victory here would be a very disappointing one. On 10 May 1529, Suleiman the Magnificent launched his own counter-attack negating all of Ferdinand's gains. Of greater disappointment was the fact that many of the recently captured forts surrendered without resistance, greatly speeding up the advance. As a result, Suleiman was able to reach and besiege Vienna.

Case series may be consecutive or non-consecutive, depending on whether all cases presenting to the reporting authors over a period were included, or only a selection. When information on more than three patients is included, the case series is considered to be a systematic investigation designed to contribute to generalizable knowledge (i.e., research), and therefore submission is required to the IRB. Case series usually contain demographic information about the patient(s), for example, age, gender, ethnic origin. etc. Case series have a descriptive study design; unlike studies that employ an analytic design (e.g. cohort studies, case-control studies or randomized controlled trials), case series do not, in themselves, involve hypothesis testing to look for evidence of cause and effect (though case-only analyses are sometimes performed in genetic epidemiology to investigate the association between an exposure and a genotype). Case series are especially vulnerable to selection bias; for example, studies that report on a series of patients with a certain illness and/or a suspected linked exposure draw their patients from a particular population (such as a hospital or clinic) which may not appropriately represent the wider population. Internal validity of case series studies is usually very low, due to the lack of a comparator group exposed to the same array of intervening variables. For example, the effects seen may be wholly or partly due to intervening effects such as the placebo effect, Hawthorne effect, Rosenthal effect, time effects, practice effects or the natural history effect. Calculating the difference in effects between two treatment groups assumed to be exposed to a very similar array of such intervening effects allows the effects of these intervening variables to cancel out. Hence only the presence of a comparator group, which is not a feature of case-series studies, will allow a valid estimate of the true treatment effect.

When it became available, it ignited controversy. Hayward was accused of advancing arguments which gave credence to Holocaust deniers. In 2000, at the request of the New Zealand Jewish Council, the University of Canterbury convened a \\"Working Party\\" which issued a report admonishing the university for inadequately supervising Hayward's work.Joel Hayward Working Party, 2000, ¬ß5, pp. 64-69.

[...] The university's vice chancellor, Daryl Le Grew, apologized to the Jewish community but said the university had no power to revoke the granting of the degree.\\" Hayward has always repudiated the errors in his thesis, saying that they were the result of inadequate scholarly preparation for such a complex topic, but Holocaust deniers initially cited the thesis as evidence of academic support for their positions. In 2000, Holocaust denier David Irving praised Hayward's work as a \\"landmark in the turning of the tide in the favour of historical revisionism\\". Despite these issues, Hayward clearly upholds the sound and accepted scholarly assessment of the Holocaust. In 2010 he described it as \\"one of history‚Äôs vilest crimes ‚Ä¶ involving the organised murder of millions of Jews\\" and in 2011 he similarly wrote: \\"The Holocaust of the Jews in the Second World War, one of history‚Äôs vilest crimes, involved the organised murder of six million Jews by Germans and others who considered themselves Christians or at least members of the Christian value system.\\" Likewise, in his 2012 book, Warfare in the Quran, he criticised \\"the undoubted evils of Nazism\\".Joel Hayward, Warfare in the Quran English Monograph Series ‚Äî Book No. 14.

Growth factor receptors are the first stop in cells where the signaling cascade for cell differentiation and proliferation begins. Growth factors, which are ligands that bind to the receptor are the initial step to activating the growth factor receptors and tells the cell to grow and/or divide. These receptors may use the JAK/STAT, MAP kinase, and PI3 kinase pathways. A majority of growth factor receptors consists of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). There are 3 dominant receptor types that are exclusive to research : the epidermal growth factor receptor, the neurotrophin receptor, and the insulin receptors. All growth factor receptors are membrane bound and composed of 3 general protein domains: extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic. The extracellular domain region is where a ligand may bind, usually with very high specificity. In RTKs, the binding of a ligand to the extracellular ligand binding site leads to the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain. These phosphorylations allow for other intracellular proteins to bind to with the phosphotyrosine-binding domain which results in a series of physiological responses within the cell.  Medical Relevance  Research in today‚Äôs society focus on growth factor receptors in order to pinpoint cancer treatment. Epidermal growth factor receptors are involved heavily with oncogene activity. Once growth factors bind to their receptor, a signal transduction pathway occurs within the cell to ensure the cell is working. However, in cancerous cells, the pathway might never turn on or turn off. Furthermore, in certain cancers, receptors (such as RTKs) are often observed to be overexpressed, which corresponds to the uncontrolled proliferation and differentiation of cells. For this same reason, tyrosine receptors are often a target for cancer therapy.

Dieterle worked with Korngold on several Warner Bros. films, including A Midsummer Night's Dream and Juarez. It was one of the final films Republic made in the two-strip color process known as Trucolor.Republic Pictures documentary Although many details about Wagner's life were accurately portrayed, the film often distorted some facts, apparently for dramatic purposes. One high point was the accurate depiction of the riot at the Paris Opera House for the premiere of the revised version of Tannh√§user. The film depicted King Ludwig II's patronage of Wagner, without going into much detail about the king's controversial personality. The film used a very large cast, opulent sets, and lavish costumes. Since Republic was known primarily for westerns and adventure serials, Magic Fire was one of the rare \\"prestige\\" films to be produced by studio chief Herbert Yates.

It was released in North America on August 21, 2007, and was released as in Japan on August 23, 2007. Gameplay =Battle system= A screenshot of a battle sequence showing the party's Mana and Energy at the top left of the screen, the most recent battle action below that, the party's statistics at the bottom left, and enemy information at the bottom right. The game features a turn-based battle system, and enables the player to select the order in which the characters are to act. The actions that a character can make during battle are \\"Attack\\" (enables the character to physically attack an opponent), \\"Mana\\" (enables the character to perform skills and magic), \\"Guard\\" (allows the character to defend against an opponent's attack), \\"Item\\" (allows the character to use an item in the inventory), and \\"Escape\\" (allows the characters to run away from battle). Magic is performed through attaching jewels called \\"lusces\\" to accessories such as rings and necklaces. The strength and effectiveness of lusces and other skills are improved through repetitive use; the more often skills and lusces are used, the more powerful they become. Characters possessing elemental \\"dragon orbs\\" are also able to use \\"dragon skills\\", which are powerful elemental attacks. Certain dragon skills, when executed in succession, produce additional damaging elemental effects called \\"elemental combos\\". For example, executing the dragon skills \\"Water Swing\\" and \\"Thunder Slash\\" in succession produce the elemental combo \\"Landslide\\". All playable characters also have their own \\"field skills\\", which can be executed in the field when a character is set as party leader. field skills have various effects, such as Euphe's \\"Mana Sea\\" skill, which enables her to heal the party while on the field, and Valen's \\"Dash\\" skill, which enables him to move around the field at a swifter pace. Executing skills and lusces require certain amounts of \\"mana\\", which is accumulated through successfully attacking opponents or guarding against opponent's attacks. Monsters are found roaming the field in the form of flying eyeballs, which trigger battle sequences when the character comes into contact with them. These eyeballs chase after the on- screen character if he/she comes into the eyeballs' view. =Recipes and crafting= Items called \\"recipes\\" enable the player to combine ingredients in order to craft accessories, weapons, or more ingredients. Recipes can be acquired from certain NPCs and from shops. =Dragoneer Mode= The game also features \\"Dragoneer Mode\\", which enables 2-4 players to play in a cooperative fashion via the PSP's wireless LAN function. In this mode, players raid dragon's nests in order to gather loot and treasure. Players do not control a full party by themselves, rather they control one character each. Plot The story centers on the adventures of Valen Kesslar, a young man who is about to graduate from Dragoon Academy. The graduation ceremony involves the appearance of the six elemental dragons, all of whom were originally part of the Holy Dragon Grinlek before he was destroyed by the Black Dragon, Nidhogg. The six elemental dragons keep the balance in the world of Iris. During the ceremony, Nidhogg appears and destroys the royal palace of Granadis, injuring the Water Dragon in the process. The Dragoons are then tasked to investigate Nidhogg and defend the other elemental dragons from him. =Playable characters= Valen Kesslar : A young Dragoon and the lead character of the story. He is idealistic and calm, and often takes things too seriously. He is known as in the Japanese version of the game. : Euphe is a lively female Empath (a type of being that can heal others' wounds by absorbing the injuries into her own body) who encounters Valen right after Nidhogg's assault on Granadis. She falls in love with him at first sight. Euphe is voiced by Stephanie Sheh in English. Mary Murphy : Mary is the young captain of a pirate ship called Mary, which was named after her. Her father died when she was eleven years old, leaving her in the care of the pirate crew. After her ship sinks, she seeks the Water Dragon as she believes that it will be able to save her ship. Her name in the Japanese version of the game is . Mary is voiced by Kaori Mizuhashi in Japanese and Michelle Ruff in English, using typical pirate lingo. Ruslan L'avelith : A guardian of the Earth Dragon who joins Valen in order to protect the holy spirits and Mother Nature from destruction. Ruslan is proud of his elven heritage, and looks down on humans and dragoons. In the Japanese version of the game, Ruslan's last name is . Ruslan is voiced by Yuri Lowenthal in English. =Other characters= : A Dragoon and Valen's childhood friend. Langley is the first born of the Baldwin family, a revered family with a long line of Dragoons in its lineage. Lucien Blaine : A Dragoon consumed by madness and who betrays his duties by killing two dragons and attempting to do the same to the others. Lucien is part of a family that considers financial and political influence to be more important that military influence. In the Japanese version of the game, Lucien's first name is . Nikita Heil : A Dragoon who despises dragons and wishes to destroy their dragon orbs. Nikita is in love with a commoner, which is forbidden by the Dragoons' law. In the Japanese version of the game, Nikita's first name is . Sonia Panova : The current leader of the Dragoons, Sonia was born into a family of Dragoons and is one of the first females to be initiated into the corps. Her leadership abilities are unparalleled and she shares deep bonds with her troops. In the Japanese version of the game, Sonia's last name is . She is voiced by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn in the English version, with a Russian accent. Development The game's 3D look and designs deviate from the usual 2D anime-style games Nippon Ichi Software is known for. The producer of the game for NIS, Sohei Niikawa, has described the game as a \\"noble sort of fantasy\\", which builds up on the basic elements of a fantasy game. Yukihiko Hojo, CEO of Hit Maker, has commented that creating Dragoneer's Aria served as a challenge for the company to create a new kind of RPG and include the various possibilities for a PSP game that they failed to include in their previous work, Blade Dancer. =Character Design= Juno Jeong, the art director for the popular Korean MMORPG Lineage II, did the character designs for Dragoneer's Aria. Niikawa stated that he believes that this would be a big selling point for the game. Jeong commented that he had always wanted to be involved in the production of a console game, and he had not worked as an illustrator for three years before working on this project. He also expressed some regret in not having been able to work with the design team personally because he felt that it is \\"the designer's responsibility to watch over the 3D character as it grows into its final form\\". =Music= Japanese singer Mimika sang the game's theme song entitled . A piano version of Johann Sebastian Bach's \\"Air on the G String\\" is also used as the background music for the game's title screen, and was also used for the game's trailers and official Japanese website. According to Hojo, the reason for selecting \\"Air on the G String\\" was because they believed that it brought out the emotions involved in the characters' relationships. Reception Dragoneer's Aria entered the Japanese weekly sales charts at number six for selling 23,617 units from its release date to the week of August 20 to August 26, 2007. The game has received numerous negative reviews from critics, who mostly complained about the \\"slow\\" gameplay and \\"clich√©d\\" characters and plot. Jeff Haynes of IGN states that the game \\"takes a lot of clich√©d characters and tries to spice up the standard RPG fare with some adjustments to the skill and battle formula\\", while Sam Bishop of TotalPlaystation.com remarks that \\"no one part of the game manages to do anything more than set par for the course\\", and Andrew Fitch of 1UP.com describes the game as \\"mediocre\\".

It includes Lake Elmore and Elmore Mountain, and has day-use facilities for picnicking, hiking, and water-based activities, and a 59-site campground. Some of its facilities were developed in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps; for these, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. The park is open seasonally between Memorial Day and Columbus Day; fees are charged for day use and camping. Features Elmore State Park is located in northern Elmore, a rural community in southern Lamoille County, Vermont. The park covers , set between Lake Elmore and the summit of Elmore Mountain. Its developed area is located at the northern end of the lake, where Beach Road runs west from Vermont Route 12. The campground facilities, located north of the beach include 44 tent/RV sites and 15 lean-tos, two restrooms with hot showers, and a sanitary dump station. The day-use area features a sandy beach, with a CCC-built beach house which includes a community room, a concession stand and cafe, restrooms and boat rentals. The park has easy access to hiking trails on Elmore Mountain, which lead to the observation tower at its summit. History In 1934, the town of Elmore and several of its residents gave the state of Vermont a gift of . This occurred during the Great Depression, and the state set the Civilian Conservation Corps to work transforming the gift of land, along with adjacent federal lands, into a park.

Its stated aim is to find, nurture and then to develop new talent for a world market while remaining independent in the process. Liberation has a sub-label called Liberator Music, which is a distributor for foreign artists and labels such as Childish Gambino, Glassnote Records, BMG Rights Management, and Ipecac Recordings.  History  Following the 1998 sale of Gudinski's Mushroom Records to Festival Records, Liberation Music was formed to continue to satisfy Michael Gudinski's desire to promote and develop Australian Music. Effective September 2008, Liberation is distributed by Universal Music Australia after leaving Warner Music Australia. In September 2017, Liberation Music re-branded as Liberation Records. The Mushroom Groups's newest imprint, Bloodlines, is now home to several artists previously signed to Liberation Music. On 22 August 2013, the Electronic Frontiers Foundation (EFF) filed suit against Liberation Music in the United States District Court for the District of MassachusettsLessig vs Liberation Music. Retrieved 20-13-08-23 for \\"misusing copyright law\\". The complaint related to repeated DMCA takedown requests, targeted at a lecture by Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig which was posted on YouTube. Lessig and the EFF brought the suit under the Fair Use clauses of US copyright law. EFF Intellectual Property Director Corynne McSherry said, \\"There's a long and sorry history of content owners abusing copyright to take down fair uses, but this one is particularly shocking. Based on nothing more than a few clips illustrating Internet creativity, Liberation Music took down an entire lecture by one of the leading experts in the world on copyright and fair use.\\"EFF Press Release.

Life and career Though also a composer, Alessandro Parisotti is better known today as the original editor of a collection of songs known as Arie antiche (Arie antiche: ad una voce per canto e pianoforte, Milan, 1885‚Äì1888). The original collection comprises three volumes of songs or arias published as a primer to study classical singing, but the three volumes have since been reduced to single-volumed extracts known as the 24 Italian Songs and Arias. The original Arie Antiche are still available through Ricordi, Schirmer, and Kalmus. Parisotti collected these antique arias (arie antiche is the Italian) in what was the 19th century vogue for discovering forgotten old or antique music from the classical and baroque eras. The most famous example of this practice of reclaiming forgotten music is Mendelssohn's revival of Bach's St. Matthew Passion in Berlin (1829). The taste for rediscovered music was de rigueur among musicians and audiences of the nineteenth century, with composers lesser than Mendelssohn and Brahms participating as well. Parisotti found forgotten scores and arranged their arias (or duets) for solo singer and piano accompaniment. Parisotti romanticized the pieces by altering word placement, chordal structure and/or adding ornamentation to the vocal line. Others also did this type of editing, including the publications done by Oliver Ditson. These arrangements are still favorites for recital programming today. Notable students include pianist and composer Lucia Contini Anselmi. In his collection, Parisotti attributed the song \\"Se tu m'ami\\" to Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, but owing to the fact that no early manuscripts of this song have been located, scholars now believe that Parisotti composed the piece himself. The text for the song was taken from a collection called \\"Di canzonette e di cantate librue due\\" by Paolo Rolli, published in London in 1727.Glenn Paton, John (1991). \\"26 Italian Songs and Arias: An Authoritative Edition Based on Authentic Sources\\". Alfred Publishing. Many teachers of song believe John Glenn Paton's accompaniments to be too \\"dry,\\" lacking any character at all and continue to use the other arrangements.

Career  In his youth, Genta actively campaigned against several attempts at education reform, fearing that the changes would dilute the influence of Catholic teachings. After the coup d'etat of 4 June 1943, Genta was appointed to head the Universidad del Litoral, and gained notoriety as a defender of reactionary ideas, to the point that the popular FORJA movement and its leader Arturo Jauretche publicly condemned Genta's positions. When Per√≥n was removed from power in 1955, the armed forces were under the influence of liberal ideas as represented by Pedro Eugenio Aramburu and the Alsogaray family. Some conservative circles saw Aramburu's deposing of Eduardo Lonardi as a coup against traditional Catholic values, which led to the establishment a series of right-wing movements, the most notorious of those being Alianza Libertadora Nacionalista (\\"Nationalist Liberation Alliance\\"). In 1958, another education-related fight galvanized the conservative Catholics, and new groups started forming. Most of them saw Genta as their ideological referent, and sought his advice and endorsement. Genta approved of their actions, even those that involved desecration of Jewish cemeteries or physical attacks on Jewish students. As the 1960s brought left-wing guerrilla activity to Argentina, Genta was recognized as one of the ideologues behind ever-more violent far right groups such as Tacuara. Ironically, some of Tacuara's young recruits would later form the core of the (allegedly left-wing Peronist) Montoneros movement. The armed struggle degenerated into the so-called dirty war, which claimed thousands of lives and cast a heavy shadow over Argentine politics well into the 21st century. Genta himself would be the victim of such violence: on October 27, 1974, a People's Revolutionary Army (ERP) guerrilla shot Genta eleven times as he was leaving his home. Genta died immediately. The gunner left the scene in a getaway car followed by two back-up vehicles. Genta was survived by his wife, two children and two grandchildren.  Legacy  For many years, far right activists would congregate at Genta's grave and shout slogans such as Viva la muerte! (Long live death), inspired by Franco's General Mill√°n Astray, commander of the Spanish Legion. Genta's ideas were not confined to the fringes, as they influenced some sections of the military de facto governments, especially the National Reorganization Process (1976‚Äì1983). His staunch anti-communism and his contacts in the armed forces gained him some consideration from United States anti-communist operatives.

History Formed in Athens in 1945 as the Higher Military Command of Attica (; Anot√©ra Stratiotik√≠ De√≠kisi Attik√≠s, ASDA), by 1961 it had evolved from a territorial defence force to a Corps-sized formation, overseeing the Aegean region's four National Guard Commands.

In 1995, the command's headquarters were relocated to the suburb of Karea in Athens, Attica, and by 2005 it had become a major operational formation of the Hellenic Army, consisting of two division and five brigade-strength, mechanized, National Guard Battalion Higher Commands (; An√≥tati De√≠kisi Tagm√°ton Ethnofylak√≠s, ADTE). After a wide-ranging defense review in 2013, the Corps' capabilities were strengthened with the 5th Infantry Brigade reorganized as an air assault brigade to become ASDEN's rapid reaction force.

Yedikule Fortress ( or Yedikule Zindanlarƒ±; meaning \\"Fortress of the Seven Towers\\", or \\"Dungeons of the Seven Towers\\", respectively) is a fortified historic structure located in the Yedikule neighbourhood of Fatih, in Istanbul, Turkey. Built in 1458 on the commission of Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II, the seven-tower complex was created by adding three new towers and fully enclosing a section of the ancient Walls of Constantinople, including the two twin towers that originally constituted the triumphal Golden Gate () built by Roman Emperors Theodosius I and Theodosius II. The fortress came to be known as the home of a formidable royal dungeon that housed notable figures throughout its history, and the associated intrigue captured the public's imagination over the centuries in various legends, stories, and the arts. History After the conquest of Constantinople the Sultan gave priority to official construction projects such as Yedikule and his first seraglio, Saray-i Atik. Yedikule, Fortress of Seven Towers, was erected as the official treasury fort of the Empire around the year 1457 (√ñzg√ºven 1996: 95‚Äì99).Yedikule‚Äôs central role might be understood through its guards rank at the protocol. The chief guard of the Yedikule (dizdar) was in charge of protecting keys and he was among three people in the empire who were allowed to talk with sultan personally (the two others were the grand vizier and sultan‚Äôs official mother).https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00004-014-0206-8#Fn5 Witnesses described the building as one of the palaces of the Sultan. Each tower of the Yedikule functioned as the storage of precious goods, documents, armoury, coins, and golden and silver ingots. Sultan knew well from his ancestors that protection of the fort was one of the high-priority matters of state (Clavijo 1970: 187‚Äì188).Devastation of the Ottoman treasury occurred when Bayezid I was taken captive by Timur‚Äôs army in 1402. Vulnerability of another fort was observed when the Ilkhanate treasury outpost G√∂ksaray was quickly plundered after Timur‚Äôs death in 1405. These cases might have been moral for Mehmed II who planned to safeguard financial sources of the state he fundamentally reorganized.https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00004-014-0206-8#Fn6_source That the structure was built as a fortress points out the existence of a military outpost in charge of defending the official treasury against hostile attacks. The treasury was later transferred to the inner section of the Topkapƒ± Palace in the sixteenth century and thereafter Seven Towers became the prison of prestigious captives. Yedikule was built on the shores of the Marmara Sea, at what was formerly the principal entrance gate to the city. Two towers and two pylons of the former Porta Aurea, the triumphal arch, were inherited from the Byzantine city walls. Three original round towers were added for creating an almost pentagonal plan. When a line is drawn from the midpoint of the former Porta Aurea towards the Ottoman tower in the middle, the axis divides the fortress in two symmetrical parts. A small domed structure, the Conqueror‚Äôs Mosque, appears as the focal point of the fortress courtyard, which also marks the midpoint of the axis of symmetry (Gabriel). Yedikule Fortress was frequently used as a state prison, and ambassadors of states currently at war with the Ottoman Porte were usually imprisoned within its walls. The fortress also housed prisoners who were victims of palace intrigue and infighting, as well as political opponents of the imperial court. Among Yedikule's most notable prisoners was the young Sultan Osman II, who was imprisoned and executed there by the Janissaries in 1622. The last Emperor of Trebizond David Megas Komnenos, Constantin Br√¢ncoveanu of Wallachia with his family, King Simon I of Kartli, and a number of leading Ottoman pashas were also among those executed there. In 1768, the Russian ambassador Aleksei Mikhailovich Obreskov, and the entire Russian embassy's staff was imprisoned here, marking the Ottomans‚Äô declaration of war on Russia. During the Napoleonic Wars, the fortress was the prison of many French prisoners, including the writer and diplomat Francois Pouqueville, who was detained there for more than two years (1799 to 1801) and who gave an extensive description of the fortress in his Voyage en Mor√©e, √† Constantinople, en Albanie, et dans plusieurs autres parties de l'Empire Othoman, pendant les ann√©es 1798, 1799, 1800 et 1801. The last prisoner was held in the Yedikule as late as 1837. Except for the initial 11 and last 4 sentences, all of the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature winner Ivo Andriƒá's novel Prokleta avlija (translated into English as Accursed and/or Damned Yard) happens in Yedikule Prison (link on the Andriƒá Foundation site). A mescit (small mosque) and a fountain were built in the middle of the fort's inner courtyard, which also contained the houses of the garrison, forming a separate city quarter. The houses were torn down in the 19th century, and a girls' school was built in their place.Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism article on the Walls of Constantinople The outer gate was re-opened in 1838, and the fort's towers functioned as gunpowder magazines for a while thereafter, until the whole facility was turned over to become a museum in 1895. An open-air theater has been built in more recent years, and is used for cultural festivals. Like its namesake in Jerusalem, a Muslim cemetery now lies in front of the Golden Gate.

History HSBC Beijing Dongzhimen sub-branch The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation established its Shanghai branch office on 3 April 1865, previous to other upstarts of HSBC, and indeed, as part of the historic English investment of Eastern Asian nations in the 19th century. Apart from the period 1941-1945, during which Japan forced HSBC and other foreign-invested banks to leave the local market, it has had a continuous presence in the city. HSBC was historically housed in one of the largest and most impressive buildings on The Bund, Shanghai's boulevard formerly known as the \\"Wall Street of the Orient\\". In April 1955, HSBC handed over this office to the Communist government, and its activities were continued in rented premises. Its activities were mainly in inward remittances and export bills until the economic reforms of the late 1970s. Chinese authorities had offered to lease HSBC its old headquarters on The Bund in 1995 but the offer was turned down. In 2000, HSBC China moved into HSBC Tower across the river in the Pudong area of Shanghai. In 2010, HSBC China's headquarters moved out of the HSBC Tower and moved into HSBC Building in Shanghai IFC.

Local incorporation The China Banking Regulatory Commission announced on 24 December 2006 its approval for foreign banks to start their preparatory work for setting up local incorporations in mainland China. These foreign banks can launch the RMB retail business of below RMB1 million for Chinese domestic citizens after the inspection and confirmation by the relevant banking regulatory administration authorities. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation was one of nine foreign banks to have applied for the incorporation. On 1 April 2007, the mainland China offices of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation transferred to its subsidiary HSBC Bank (China), and it started operations on 2 April. The registered capital and paid-up capital of HSBC Bank (China) is equivalent to RMB8 billion. However, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation still has a branch in Shanghai, which conducts foreign currency wholesale banking business.

Son of Laurent Grimod de La Reyni√®re, he inherited the family fortune on the death of his father, a fermier g√©n√©ral, in 1793. He was a member of the Soci√©t√© du Caveau. Biography Though his father built a stylish house in Paris with a garden that looked onto the bosquets of the Champs-√âlys√©esIt was generally referred to as the H√¥tel Champs-√âlys√©es. (Desnoiresterres 1877:20). and kept a great table,\\"Grimod de la Reyni√®re faisait la meilleure ch√®re de tout Paris. 'Sa maison' dit Grimm 'est l'auberge le plus distingu√© des hommes de qualit√©'\\" (Desnoiresterres 1877:22); the chef de cuisine was M√©rillon (idem, p 25). the younger Grimod had been born with deformed handsDescriptions point to the congenital deformity known now as Cenani Lenz syndactylism. and was kept out of sight, a circumstance that developed his biting wit and dark sense of humour.Gustave Desnoiresterres, Grimod de la Reyni√®re et son Groupe begins his biography by describing Grimod's \\"affreux moignons\\"; \\"Practically Edible\\": Grimod de la Reyni√®re\\" ; he habitually wore prostheses, covered with gloves. His Manuel des amphitryons (1808) dwells upon the manual dexterity of the host in carving and the role of the hands at the table: (Olga Perla, \\"Stumps and knives\\", 2001). The younger Grimod de La Reyni√®re began his public career on his return from studies in Lausanne by collaborating in the review Journal des th√©√¢tres in 1777‚Äì78, continuing to write reviews of theatre,\\"Between 1780 and 1782 Grimod de La Reyni√®re published extracts from French plays and information the theatrical world of Paris in the Journal helv√©tique published by the Soci√©t√© Typographique de Neuch√¢tel in Switzerland.\\" (Grolier Club ). some of which he published himself, as Le Censeur Dramatique. During his parents' absence he gave grand dinner parties in the H√¥tel Grimod de La Reyni√®re, at one of which his father returned suddenly to find a pig dressed up and presiding at the table. The story made the rounds in Paris, and a breach with the family ensued, which culminated in a lettre de cachet that disinherited him and confined him to an abbey close to Nancy, where at the table of the father abbot he began to learn the art of good eating. He was a correspondent to the scandal chronicle, Correspondence secr√®te, politique et litt√©raire (1790)This is not Grimm's Correspondance litt√©raire, philosophique et critique. relating to Paris during the reign of Louis XVI, and formed a liaison with the actress Ad√®le Feuch√®re, who bore their love child in 1790. Supported with a little money from his family, he had the idea of buying food directly from the producer, and selling it in a store at a set price; to make a living, he opened a shop in Lyon selling groceries, tools and other exotic commodities. When he regained his liberty upon the death of his father in 1792, he returned to Paris and spread the activities of his \\"soci√©t√© Grimod et Cie\\", opening stores in other French cities. He reconciled with his mother, who was saved from the guillotine through his connections, and began a series of mock-funeral dinners.\\"Practically Edible\\": Grimod de la Reyni√®re\\".

Spang, The Invention of the Restaurant: Paris and Modern Gastronomic Culture (Harvard University Press, Harvard Historical Studies 135) 2000. his name is a by-word on a par with Brillat-Savarin and an equally rich source of quotations in French gastronomic literature through the eight volumes of his annual L'Almanach des gourmands, which he edited and published from 1803 to 1812. Gourmand still retained its sense of \\"gluttony\\", one of the Seven Deadly Sins,Jean-Louis Flandrin's chapter \\"Distinction Through Taste\\", in A History of Private Life: Passions of the Renaissance (Belknap Press, Harvard University) 1989:289‚Äì92, \\"Gluttons and Epicures\\" traces the significance of these French terms in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. and Grimod's choice of the word, when \\"friand\\" more usually connoted a connoisseur of fine food and wine, was a conscious one and wholly in character; gourmand and gourmet first achieved their pleasant modern connotations in Grimod's Almanachs, which, among other innovations, were the first restaurant guides. The success of the Almanachs encouraged Grimod and his publishers to bring out the monthly Journal des Gourmandes et des Belles, which appeared for the first time in January 1806. Its editorial board consisted of the friends who met weekly for dinner at the H√¥tel Grimod de La Reyni√®re, those \\"D√Æners du Vaudeville\\", composed of dishes sent round by the premier restaurants of Paris for judgment, and Grimod as host and presiding genius.

Literature and Impact Pascal Ory considers Alexandre Grimod to be \\"one of the founders of the modern French culture,\\" grouping him with the Comte de Saint-Simon and Alexis de Tocqueville. He \\"reestablished order, hierarchy, and distinctions in the realm of good taste\\" through the publication of texts that helped to define the French food scene.Pascal Ory, \\"Gastronomy\\" While others at the time were focused more on art, literature and drama, Grimod opened the door to criticism of food and cookery, inventing the gastronomic guidebook (Almanach des Gourmands), the gastronomic treatise (Manuel des Amphitryons), and the gourmet periodical (Journal des Gourmands et des Belles). There was literature about food and eating before Grimod, but it was concerned only with technical aspects and recipes, while Grimod introduced the idea of food criticism.

NBC referred to him as the \\"Dean of Courtroom Artists\\" since he was the first modern artist to sketch trials for TV news in the 1950s and covered 147 trials for NBC until when he died in the late 1970s. Biography Hershfield was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, one of five children of immigrants Isadore Abraham Hershfield and Ida Alshanetsky from Kiev, Ukraine. While growing up in Chattanooga, TN, he taught himself to draw. In 1922, as its art director, he illustrated virtually the entire \\"Dynamo\\", the Chattanooga High School annual the year he graduated. He left his family to move alone to New York City in the early 1920s, where he studied art at the National Academy of Design and joined the Art Students League. Initially, he supported himself as an employee in the \\"morgue\\", or clippings library of the New York World and worked his way up to staff artist. In 1925, he worked his way to Europe twice on a freighter to hone his drawing and watercolor styles. In 1929, he began writing articles and drawing cartoons and caricatures of famous people appearing in the news for the New York Times. These appeared in the political and theater pages as well as their Sunday Magazine. Since the New York Times and the Chattanooga Times were both owned by Chattanoogan Adolph Ochs, Leo was given the opportunity to work simultaneously on the staff of the Chattanooga Times where he interviewed, wrote and illustrated a column entitled \\"Chattanoogans in Gotham\\". In 1933, he married Mary Emma Hurst of New Bern, North Carolina. She had moved to New York to become a fashion model and was a chorus line member of the \\"Roxyettes\\", the forerunner of \\"the Rockettes\\" performing at the then-Roxy Theater before the show moved to Rockefeller Center. In 1941, Hershfield illustrated his first book for humorist H. Allen Smith titled Lo, the Former Egyptian. Over the next 38 years, he would illustrate the covers and interiors of almost 60 books, including more for H. Allen Smith as well as Vincent Price, Groucho Marx and Richard Armour. In 1942, they moved to Alexandria, Virginia where Leo took the wartime job of Art Director for the Office of War Information in Washington, DC. When the war ended, he became a full-time freelancer, illustrating publications such as Reader's Digest, The Saturday Evening Post (where he illustrated their \\"Letters to the Editor\\" column for 17 years) and Kiplinger's Changing Times, where he contributed art to 390 consecutive issues. He also worked with advertising agencies like Ketchum, MacLeod & Grove illustrating advertisements for their clients. During this time, he also became the \\"artist/correspondent\\" for the controversial PM. He created vivid political cartoons on every monthly cover of The Democratic Digest, the publication of the Democratic National Committee from 1954-1961. Hershfield practiced his creativity in multiple media including pencil, pen and ink, watercolor, block printing, wood carving, metal sculpture and photography. He even designed and built children's toys and wrote and illustrated a children's book. Courtroom illustration In 1954, Hershfield's sketches of Senator Joseph McCarthy accompanied NBC News' coverage of the Army-McCarthy Censure Hearings. Thereafter, he drew courtroom proceedings for NBC at major trials around the country, including the Chicago Seven, the Harrisburg Seven, Jack Ruby, James Earl Ray, Clay Shaw, Arthur Bremer, Benjamin Spock, the Gainesville Eight, Billie Sol Estes and most famously, the court martial of Lt. William Calley convicted in the My Lai Massacre trial. For 25 years, Hershfield's trial watercolors were presented by news reporters like John Cameron Swayze, David Brinkley, Chet Huntley and John Chancellor. The age of courtroom art in the U.S. came to a close in the late 1970s, when the Florida Supreme Court ruled that cameras could be allowed back into the courtroom. After moving to Bradenton, FL in 1958, with his wife and two sons, Hershfield continued to illustrate books and articles for newspapers like the St. Petersburg Times, \\" Tampa Tribune\\" and Sarasota Herald Tribune. He spent his spare time sailing the Manatee River and documenting Florida through watercolors. He was an ardent environmentalist, illustrating articles and creating humorous cartoons in newspapers and magazines in an attempt to save Florida's wetlands from industrial development. WEDU, the local Florida PBS affiliate, interviewed Hershfield and aired a documentary about his career shortly before his death in 1979. In 1980, Washington's Corcoran Gallery held a retrospective exhibition of Hershfield's quarter century of courtroom illustration.

Berlin originally wrote the melody in 1917, under the title \\"Smile and Show Your Dimple\\", as a \\"cheer up\\" song for a girl whose man has gone off to fight in World War I. A recording of \\"Smile and Show Your Dimple\\" by Sam Ash enjoyed modest success in 1918. Berlin resurrected it with modifications and new lyrics for the 1933 revue As Thousands Cheer. The song was introduced by Marilyn Miller and Clifton Webb in the Broadway musical revue As Thousands Cheer (1933), in which musical numbers were strung together on the thematic thread of newspaper headlines. Like many of Berlin's songs, it later appeared in films. It was performed by Don Ameche in Alexander's Ragtime Band (1938) which was loosely based on Irving Berlin's life. Bing Crosby sang it in the film Holiday Inn (1942) which featured an Irving Berlin song about each major holiday. In 1948, it was performed by Judy Garland and Fred Astaire in the musical film Easter Parade, which was constructed around the song. The song was also featured in the Rankin/Bass special The First Easter Rabbit in 1976. Artists who had a hit record with the song include Leo Reisman & Clifton Webb (1933), Bing Crosby (recorded June 1, 1942), Harry James (1942), Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians (1947), and Liberace (1954).

P 104 Early life Castaing was born in Alen√ßon, France, the youngest of the three sons of an inspector- general in the department of Woods and Forests. He went to school in Angers, where he was an outstanding student, winning many prizes. He graduated from the School of Medicine in Paris, becoming a doctor in 1821, by which time he had fathered two children with his mistress, the widow of a judge. He was under financial pressure, which became further exacerbated by a friend's debt of 600 francs, for which he had vouched in 1818 and which became due in 1820. Murders and fraud He befriended two wealthy lawyer brothers, Hippolyte and Auguste Ballet. In October 1822 Hippolyte died from a sudden illness, leaving 260,000 francs to be split between his brother Auguste and their sister. Castaing, who had been treating Hippolyte, and another doctor conducted the autopsy, concluding that he had died of pleurisy aggravated by consumption. On September 18, it was later shown in court, Castaing had purchased 10 grains of acetate of morphia. Two days later on October 7, Auguste cashed 100,000 francs of stocks, which he was later seen giving to Castaing. Auguste would later claim that this was to be used as a bribe to get the family lawyer, Lebret, to destroy a will by Hippolyte that favoured the brothers' sister. On October 10 though, Castaing gave a stockbroker 66,000 francs to invest, then on the 11th he sent his mother 30,000 francs and on the 14th gave his mistress 4,000 francs. On December 1, 1822, Auguste made out a will with Castaing as sole legatee. It was deposited with Castaing's cousin, a notary's clerk on May 29, 1823. That same day, Castaing and Auguste went on holiday to the countryside near Saint Germain and spent the next day back in Paris in Saint-Cloud, where Auguste fell ill. Castaing had that day purchased 36 grains of morphia. The next day, on June 1, Auguste died. The following day Castaing was arrested and a post-mortem was held. Though it deemed Auguste to have died from natural causes, Castaing was not released. Arrest and trial Castaing was taken to Paris, where an investigation commenced that lasted 5 months. For the first three days Castaing feigned insanity but soon gave it up. He was then moved to Versailles prison. His trial commenced before the Paris Assize Court on November 10, 1823, and lasted eight days. He was charged with the murder of Hippolyte Ballet, the destruction of a document containing the final dispositions of Hippolyte's property, and with the murder of Auguste Ballet. The three charges were to be tried simultaneously. The acte d'accusation (indictment) against Castaing consisted of a hundred closely printed pages. Castaing was defended by two advocates: Roussel, a schoolfellow of his, and the famous Pierre-Antoine Berryer, though the latter's speech is not considered one of his most successful ones. According to Irving, Berryer \\"gave personal testimony as to the taste of acetate of morphia. He said that with the help of his own chemist he had put a quarter of a grain of the acetate into a large spoonful of milk, and had found it so insupportably bitter to the taste that he could not keep it in his mouth.\\" Much hinged on the lack of morphia in the bodies of the deceased. In his concluding address, Berryer \\"quoted the words addressed by one of the Kings of France to his judges: \\"When God has not vouchsafed clear proof of a crime, it is a sign that He does not wish that man should determine it, but leaves its judgment to a higher tribunal.\\"' Medical opinions differed as to the nature of the poison used in the murders. The jury took two hours to decide the verdict. They found Castaing innocent of the murder of Hippolyte but guilty of destroying his will and guilty by seven votes to five of the murder of Auguste. Castaing, in a last statement before being sentenced said: > I shall know how to die, though I am the victim of ill-fortune, of fatal > circumstance. I shall go to meet my two friends. I am accused of having > treacherously murdered them. There is a Providence above us! If there is > such a thing as an immortal soul, I shall see Hippolyte and Auguste Ballet > again. This is no empty declamation; I don't ask for human pity. I look to > God's mercy, and shall go joyfully to the scaffold. My conscience is clear. Execution After a failed appeal and a suicide attempt (using poison hidden inside a watch, which was brought to him in prison by a friend) he was executed on December 6, 1823.

It was built in 1775 in a Neo-Classical style by Jean-Beno√Æt-Vincent Barr√© for the fermier g√©n√©ral (tax-farmer) Laurent Grimod de La Reyni√®re (1733‚Äì1793). It used a plot occupied by a store for ancient statues in the royal collection, on which Grimod de La Reyni√®re had obtained a royal concession to construct a building similar to the h√¥tel de Saint-Florentin (which had been constructed in the northeastern corner of the new Place Louis XV, now Place de la Concorde, to plans by Ange-Jacques Gabriel). The layout of the rooms is known from a relief by the architect Johann Christian Kammsetzer, preserved at Cracow. The grand salon and the state rooms gave onto an English garden spread between the south facade and the gardens of the Champs-√âlys√©es. The dining room was located in the west wing, between two courtyards and a small, oval internal garden, with heating. Two fountains were placed in a gallery between the kitchen and the buffet, a gallery reached through a billiards room and an octagonal hall. On the other side of the main courtyard was a picture gallery and a library, which gave onto Rue de la Bonne-Morue. In the interior, Charles-Louis Cl√©risseau and √âtienne de La Vall√©e Poussin executed the first decorative scheme in Europe to be inspired by the new archaeological discoveries at Pompeii and Herculanum. The painted boiseries were sold in 1850 and may be seen in part at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Up until the 19th century, the H√¥tel housed the imperial Cercle, then the Cercle de l'Union artistique - the latter held some exhibitions by the Society of Watercolourists here in 1914. Disfigured by successive additions, it was razed to the ground in 1932 and replaced by a neoclassical pastiche, built between 1931 and 1933 by the architects William Delano and Victor Laloux to house the US embassy.

It was acquired by the United States Navy on 15 June 1942; renamed Weehawken on 18 July 1942; converted to a minelayer by the Bethlehem Steel Co. at Hoboken, New Jersey; designated CM-12; and commissioned on 30 September 1942, Lt. Cmdr. Ralph E. Mills, USNR, in command. World War II North Africa operations On 6 October 1942, USS Weehawken moved to Bayonne, New Jersey, and, two days later, to Tompkinsville, New York. On the 10th, she departed the latter port for the Naval Mine Depot at Yorktown, Virginia. She arrived in Yorktown the following day and began drills and exercises in the lower Chesapeake Bay. The minelayer stood out of the Chesapeake Bay on 5 November, bound for New York, and arrived at Brooklyn, New York, the following day. A week later, she put to sea with Mine Division (MinDiv) 50 and a convoy headed for French Morocco. The minelayer dropped anchor in Casablanca harbor on 1 December. She remained in port until the 27th when she left to lay a defensive minefield off Casablanca. Weehawken returned to port that evening and then repeated the procedure the following day. On New Year's Eve, the Luftwaffe ushered in 1943 by subjecting Casablanca and the ships assembled there to a night of intermittent air raids. Fortunately, Weehawken suffered no damage during those raids and during the encore performed the following evening. Between 6 and 10 January, she made a round-trip voyage to Gibraltar and back to deliver minelaying equipment. Upon her return, the warship remained at Casablanca until 20 January, when she sailed for New York. Return to Stateside She arrived in New York with the convoy on 7 February and sailed the following day for Hampton Roads, Virginia. The ship anchored in the roadstead late on the 9th, unloaded mines at Yorktown, Virginia, on the 10th, and entered the Norfolk Navy Yard on the 11th. Following a seven-week repair period, Weehawken exited the shipyard on St. Patrick's Day 1943 and moored at the Naval Operating Base for almost a week before returning to Yorktown, Virginia, on 23 March to load mines. For the next 11 weeks, Weehawken conducted minelaying drills and gunnery exercises in the lower reaches of the Chesapeake Bay. Throughout that span of time, she returned to Yorktown and Norfolk frequently for liberty, provisions, repairs, and the like. Supporting the invasion of Italy On 9 June, the minelayer weighed anchor and departed Yorktown, Virginia, and headed for New York. There, she joined a convoy bound for Algeria. During the crossing, a German U-boat apparently attacked the convoy on 22 June, for sank rapidly after suffering an explosion. However, Weehawken arrived in Oran safely on U.S. Independence Day 1943. Two days later, she joined a convoy off Oran and set a course for Sicily where she arrived on the 11th, the day following the initial Allied invasion. Throughout that day and most of the next, she laid defensive minefields around the invasion beaches at Gela on the southern coast of the island. On both days, the Luftwaffe appeared and dropped their explosive greetings to the invasion force. Between 2150 and 2345 on the 11th, Weehawkens group underwent a series of heavy attacks; however, the minelayer came through unscathed save for some fragments from a stick of bombs which exploded just off her starboard bow. On the 12th, she continued operations off Gela; and, around 1740 in the afternoon, German planes returned. The ship's war diary recorded these as \\"Stuka's,\\" which indicates that they were probably Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers. After making a great deal of noise, both the US Navy and the German Luftwaffe emerged from that altercation unharmed. Later that evening, Weehawken departed Sicily to return to North Africa. After stops at Bizerte, Tunisia, and Algeria, she returned to Oran on 17 July. Five days later, the minelayer shifted to Mers El K√©bir where she remained until 6 September when she sailed for Bizerte. The ship stayed at the Tunisian port from 8 to 14 September and returned to Mers El K√©bir on the 17th. Assignment to Pacific Theatre operations On 20 April 1944, USS Weehawken received word that MinDiv 50 had been dissolved and that she was to be assigned to the U.S. Pacific Fleet to transport cargo, mines, and equipment to Pacific bases. On the 30th, she completed the availability which she had been undergoing at Norfolk, Virginia, since the 15th and returned to Yorktown, Virginia. She loaded mines and cargo from 7 to 9 May and then cleared Hampton Roads on the 11th. The minelayer entered the Panama Canal on 20 May, reported for duty with the U.S. Pacific Fleet, and joined Service Squadron 6. Completing her transit of the canal in the same day, she continued her voyage up the west coast to San Diego, California, where she arrived on 1 June. Four days later, Weehawken headed west toward Hawaii. After arriving in Pearl Harbor on 14 June, she unloaded her cargo and spent 11 days at Oahu before heading back to the west coast on 25 June. On Independence Day 1944, the warship reached San Francisco, California, and immediately began alterations at the General Engineering & Drydock Co. located at Alameda, California. She completed the modifications ‚Äî which included the removal of mine tracks from the after section of her mine deck ‚Äî on 1 August. After embarking passengers and loading cargo, she departed San Francisco on 8 August and shaped a course for the South Pacific. During the last two days of August, she passed through the Solomon Islands and stopped at Florida Island and Tulagi from 31 August to 5 September to disembark passengers and unload some cargo. She made Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides on 8 September and began unloading the remainder of her cargo. She embarked another group of passengers and got underway on 10 September for Pearl Harbor. After a 12-day voyage, she passed through the anti-submarine nets at Oahu and moored in Pearl Harbor. Central Pacific operations She spent eight days in Hawaii before embarking upon an extended voyage to the Central Pacific during which she visited a number of islands and bases. On 1 and 2 October, she embarked passengers bound for Saipan in the recently won Mariana Islands and, on the latter date, passed Diamond Head and set course for the Central Pacific. Weehawken made a brief overnight stop at Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshall Islands on 13 and 14 October and made Saipan on the 18th. Between 18 and 28 October, she unloaded mines, embarked passengers, and loaded cargo. From 28 October to 1 November, she steamed from Saipan to Kossol Roads ‚Äî in the Palau Islands ‚Äî where she embarked additional passengers and resumed her voyage. On 4 November, she sailed into the lagoon at Ulithi Atoll in the western Carolines. She spent the next two weeks at the atoll. After disembarking her passengers and riding out a typhoon, Weehawken departed Ulithi on the 18th bound for the Marianas. She reached Guam the next day, took on passengers, and departed again by the 21st. Two days later, the minelayer reentered Ulithi. Early in December, she made a round-trip voyage to the Palaus, returning to Ulithi on the 10th. Five days later, the warship put to sea with a convoy bound for Saipan. She arrived in Saipan on the 17th and remained there five days before returning to sea ‚Äî bound via Eniwetok to Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 8 January 1945. Four days after her arrival, Weehawken shifted berths to the navy yard to begin another series of alterations and repairs. On 21 February, the ship stood out of Pearl Harbor once again and headed west. It arrived in Eniwetok on 4 March and, the following day, took leave of the convoy, and departed Eniwetok for Ulithi in company with . The two warships entered the lagoon at Ulithi on the 11th, and Weehawken began duty as a tender for motor minesweepers. Almost a month later on 5 April, the minelayer exited the anchorage at Ulithi in convoy with , , and . The convoy passed Okinawa during the mid-morning hours of 10 April and anchored in Kerama Retto just before 1400. Weehawken immediately began providing logistic support, tender, and other services to the minesweeping units operating in the 10-day-old occupation of Okinawa. For the next three months, she remained anchored in Kerama Retto except for two occasions ‚Äî 4 June and 11 June ‚Äî when she left the anchorage to evade typhoons. In both cases, she resumed her duties in Kerama Retto immediately after the storm passed. Under attack by Japanese aircraft Over that span of time, frequent air alerts called her crew to general quarters as Japanese kamikazes attempted to drive the American Navy from Okinawa. Though her gunners frequently fired on enemy planes and witnessed their spectacular crashes into other ships, Weehawken continued to lead a charmed life. On 28 April, a kamikaze bore in on her; but, at the last minute, anti-aircraft fire from a nearby destroyer persuaded him to seek easier prey. Instead, he crashed into ‚Äî anchored nearby ‚Äî and Weehawken dispatched rescue parties and medical assistance to the mortally wounded hospital evacuation transport. Three days later, she was called upon to render medical assistance again when a suicide plane smashed into minelayer . Her gunners tried unsuccessfully to bring down two other kamikazes, one which struck on 6 May and another which exploded on on 21 June. (In the latter instance, Weehawken rushed fire and rescue parties to the aid of the stricken warship.) On 7 July 1945, Weehawken stood out of the Kerama Retto roadstead and anchored in Buckner Bay. There, she resumed her support duties for the minesweeping forces. Ten days later, she departed Buckner Bay with a mixed force of auxiliaries and motor minesweepers for a brief operation near Unken Ko. She returned to Buckner Bay early in the morning of 22 July and remained there, either anchored or moored near Tsuken Shima, through the end of the war and into September 1945. Damaged by Typhoon Louise - 9‚Äì12 October 1945 On 16 September, a typhoon hit the Okinawa area. Late that evening, Weehawken tried to get underway and to take on the crews of Coast Guard cutters moored nearby. During the operation, she collided with several of the cutters and with buoy tender (WAGL-289). After several additional collisions with the cutters and Woodbine, Weehawken began to drag anchor toward Tsuken Shima at 2330. At 0440 on 17 September, she struck a reef off Tsuken Shima. Fortunately, the typhoon began to subside, and she was towed out of shoal water later that day by . She suffered little damage in that scrape and resumed her duties off Tsuken Shima soon thereafter. Following three weeks of routine operations, Weehawken battled another typhoon. Early in the morning of 9 October, steadily increasing winds forced her to use her engines to relieve the strain on her anchor chains. Through the morning, the winds rose steadily to gale force and, by 1400, reached . Weehawken fought the raging seas; but, at 1522, the chain to the mooring buoy snapped in two. While playing out the port anchor chain to 95 fathoms and making precautionary preparations to abandon ship, the minelayer collided with a net tender broadside to port. The two ships parted with no apparent damage, and Weehawkens crewmen continued their struggle to keep her headed into the wind and relieve the strain on the anchor chain. In spite of their efforts, she continued to drag anchor toward shoal water. At 1550, she collided with , but again escaped without major damage. By 1600, the winds reached ; and Weehawken sailed out of control ‚Äî broadside to the wind ‚Äî and dragged anchor. At 1700, she ran hard aground and took on a list. She immediately flooded compartments below to return to even keel and rested firmly on the bottom. There, she remained through the night battered by wind and sea and with her crew ready to abandon ship at a moment's notice. The following morning, the winds began to slacken and the sea to abate. Between 10 and 12 October, the minelayer unloaded the bulk of her provisions and transferred the majority of her crew to USS Benson (APA-120).A \\"USS Benson (APA-120)\\" is quoted in the Navy report (above) in error as this ship did not exist. Possible candidates and were not in the area at the time. On 16 October, her hull began to break in two, but a skeleton crew remained on board salvaging equipment. On the 31st, a board of inspection and survey convened in Weehawken to look her over and found her hull to be a complete loss. The board recommended that she be decommissioned, stripped, and destroyed. Accordingly, Weehawken was decommissioned on 11 December 1945, and her name was struck from the Navy List on 3 January 1946.

Jean de La Grange (a.k.a. Jean de Lagrange) (c.1325 ‚Äì April 25, 1402) was a French prelate and politician, active during the reigns of Charles V and Charles VI, and an important member of the papal curia at Avignon, at the time of the Western Schism. He was the brother of √âtienne de La Grange, an advisor to the king and president of Parlement. Biography A Benedictine monk, he was successively Prior of √âlancourt, then of Gigny, and ultimately procurator of the Cluniac Order. He became abbot of F√©camp in 1358 and joined the Council of King Charles V after having been in the entourage of Charles the Bad. Within the Council, he was in charge of ecclesiastical affairs but also was involved in financial and fiscal issues. In 1370, the king named him president of the Cour des Aides. He was named bishop of Amiens (1373), then cardinal-bishop with the title of Saint-Marcel (1375). La Grange became a counsellor of Gregory XI (c 1336-78), the French-born pope who ended the period during which the papacy was located in Avignon, France (the so-called Babylonian Captivity) by returning to Rome in 1376. When Gregory died the following year, however, La Grange arrived in Rome too late to take part in the Conclave that elected his successor, Pope Urban VI, an Italian. In protest at the election of a non- French pope, La Grange joined other French Cardinals in re-convening the Conclave in Fondi and elected a rival pope, Clement VII, the first of the so- called Antipopes. He then convinced Charles V to support the new pope. In 1394 he was named cardinal-bishop of Frascati. He was then cast aside by Pope Benedict XIII, successor to Clement VII, who then lost the French support from which his predecessor had benefitted. He then joined the party of those calling for his abdication and organizing the withdrawal of obedience of 1398. Jean de La Grange thus entered into conflict with Louis of Orl√©ans, but died before the end of the process. Jean de La Grange, circa 1375. In his will, he desired to have two gravesites; one to have his flesh, and to be kept in Avignon, and his bones to be put into a casket at the Amiens Cathedral. Two sites are identified as his tomb: a monument in Amiens Cathedral,La Grange is depicted on the Beau Pilier d'Amiens, and his actual tomb in Avignon, which is an early example of a transi or cadaver tomb.

Its lower station at Gohtong Jaya township, located approximately northeast of Kuala Lumpur, comprises a 5-storey station building and a 10-storey car park while its upper station is located at the Maxims Hotel The Genting Skyway is one of the two aerial lines serving Genting Highlands, with the Awana Skyway serving as an alternate route. The monocable gondola lift was officially opened by the fourth Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Dr Mahathir on 21 February 1997. Genting Skyway can carry more than 2,000 people per hour with 8 passengers per gondola. At the maximum speed of 6 metres per second (21.6 km/h), the journey up the mountain peak takes approximately 15 minutes, depending on the weather. The system was designed by Leitner Ropeways. The 2 x 640 kW power of the main drive and the 54 mm diameter solid cable wire is among the most powerful and strongest monocable gondola installation in the world. The system, equipped with high- tech electronic equipment, was built in accordance with stringent Swiss regulations and it has a double safety circuit completely independent. The foundation used for the pylons is of the \\"Hang-dug Caisson\\" type. Each pylon is founded on four Caissons measuring 1.2 metres in diameter, which are socketed down to bedrock. The average depth of the Caissons is about 40 m (135 feet) and each group of four Caissons piles can take a vertical load of 4,000 tonnes against the maximum vertical load of 150 tonnes from the cable car system. The Caissons method is about the safest and strongest foundation in existence, designed specifically for hilly terrain. Each pylon is accessible via rescue tracks on the ground, whilst each gondola is equipped with radio communication equipment from the stations. For safety reasons, Genting Skyway undergoes periodic maintenance. During the maintenance closure, visitors to Resorts World Genting can opt for Awana Skyway.

He returned on April 11 and 12, 2011, to coincide with Wilde's exit and on July 28 and 29, 2011, for his Vicker Man film premiere. He made an appearance during the final episode of the show on January 13, 2012. Storylines Rivera's storyline begins when he appears in the gym of Llanview High School during tryouts for the school musical. Immediately annoyed by Rivera, Langston Wilde challenges him to tryout, which he does, and gets a part. During the prom, English teacher Marcie McBain gets ahead of herself, and announces Rivera and Wilde as king and queen of the dance. After prom night, Rivera and Wilde begin dating one another. A few months into their relationship, Rivera becomes concerned about the constant absence of Wilde's parents. Sensing that something is not right, Dorian Lord hires private investigator Rex Balsom to dig up information on Wilde. Lord learns that Wilde has been orphaned and living on her own for over a year. During a conversation at school, Wilde talks with Manning about her parents' death, and they are overheard by fellow student Britney Jennings. Jennings contacts Social Services, and Wilde is placed in foster care. Starr's mother, Blair Cramer, is prepared to be Wilde's foster mother but she is called out of town; Lord becomes Wilde's guardian instead. Wilde moves into Lord's home and happily continues her relationship with Rivera. After Manning becomes pregnant with Rivera's best friend Cole Thornhart's baby, she decides to have an abortion before her family and Thornhart learns about her pregnancy. At the last moment, Wilde gives Thornhart the address where Manning has gone for the abortion. After convincing Manning to take the time to make the right decision, Thornhart and Manning return to Llanview. With Rivera's help, Thornhart and Manning run off to Virginia Beach. Lord finds Wilde hiding a pregnancy book and suspects that she is pregnant and that Rivera is the father, but after the truth about Manning soon comes out, the misunderstanding is cleared up. Problems arise for Rivera and Wilde when Ray Montez, Wilde's biological uncle, arrives in town. Montez was hired by Clint Buchanan in a scheme to remove Wilde from Lord's guardianship. The purpose of the scheme was to get Lord to sign Buchanan's company, Buchanan Enterprises, back over to him. Montez gains custody of Wilde and prepares to leave the country with her, but his wife Vanessa Montez arrives in town and shoots him. Montez is taken back to prison, allowing Rivera and Wilde to stay together. Lola Montez, Ray's daughter, also arrives in Llanview and tries to develop a bond with Wilde. During a dance at Llanview High, Lola and Rivera kiss, but he confesses to Wilde and they shun Lola, who vows revenge. Rivera and Wilde decide to finally have sex on prom night but because of what happened with Manning and Thornhart, the couple plans ahead. Rivera runs into problems when he tries to buy condoms and the salesperson at the pharmacy is a friend of his mother; he gets Thornhart to buy the condoms for him. Lola tries several times to stop Rivera and Wilde, but their plans to have sex succeed. Rivera's parents, Aurelia and Ernesto Rivera, are introduced on June 12, 2009, on the day that Rivera graduates from Llanview High as valedictorian. He secretly plans to attend medical school. Ray Montez decides to return to Colombia and take Lola with him, which upsets Lord so much that she gets drunk at Rivera and Wilde's graduation. In her inebriated state, she reveals to Rivera's parents that Rivera and Wilde had sex on prom night. She also fires bodyguard Shawn Evans and takes back her estate, La Boulaie, which she had previously signed over to Moe and Noelle Stubbs, and evicts them. As a result, Ernesto, who has an extensive knowledge of Lord's history, believes that she is a bad influence on Rivera and forbids him from seeing Wilde. After refusing to stop seeing Wilde, Ernesto disowns him on July 22, 2009; Wilde promises to be there for him. In 2010, Rivera, Thornhart, Manning, and Wilde move into an apartment together. Rivera and Wilde's relationship is tested when Robert Ford, a sexy new teacher's assistant at Llanview University, attempts to seduce Wilde. Though she initially rebuffs his advances, she soon succumbs and the two embark upon an affair. Through a series of clues, Rivera learns of their affair, and finds Wilde and Ford in an embrace after her senior prom. Rivera then leaves Wilde. Rivera leaves for UCLA (on a scholarship) with a girl named Karen, who had an affair with Ford at the same time that Ford was having an affair with Wilde. Karen went to California with Rivera because she was tired of being the Pizza Girl and wanted a different life. The two leave in July 2010. Rivera returns to Llanview in September 2010. He runs into Wilde and informs her that he is in town because his father is having surgery. He also reveals that he and Karen have begun seeing each other.

Henryk Jasiczek (2 March 1919 ‚Äì 8 December 1976) was a Polish journalist, poet, writer, and activist from the Zaolzie region. He is considered one of the most important Polish writers from Zaolzie after World War II and one of the most popular local Polish poets.Sikora 1993, 25. Jasiczek was born in Kottingbrunn near Vienna, Austria as an extramarital child. He spent his childhood in Oldrzychowice near Trzyniec. Since 1934 he studied horticulture in Trzyniec, where, as later remembered, witnessed the worst forms of labour exploitation of workers. In 1936 defended one apprentice who had been beaten by the supervisor and bashed the supervisor himself.Sikora 2008, 3. In consequence he left and finished horticultural studies in Chrudim, only to work later for a gardener in Hradeƒçno. In 1938 he came back to Zaolzie but wasn't able to find a job. Since March 1939 Jasiczek worked in the T≈ôinec Iron and Steel Works as a worker. During World War II he was engaged in Polish leftist resistance, where he worked in the underground press and distributed illegal press under the pseudonym of Wiktor Raban. After the war he joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and became editor-in-chief of G≈Ços Ludu newspaper. He remained in this position until 1957. Jasiczek graduated from a journalism department of the Charles' University in Prague in 1960. He contributed to Polish children magazines and to Zwrot, a Polish cultural and literary magazine. Jasiczek was also an active member of the Polish Cultural and Educational Union, where he directed its Literary-Artistic Section (SLA) from 1945 to 1968. During the Prague Spring, Jasiczek firmly supported the reformist wing of the Communist Party. His stances and their public manifestations led to his expulsion from public life in May 1970. He was not permitted to publish anymore. Jasiczek spent the last years of his life in seclusion and was forced to work in the printing works as a proofreader with half of the usual salary. He died on 8 December 1976 in a hospital in ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n (Czeski Cieszyn). Communist authorities did not even allow his obituary to be printed. Henryk Jasiczek was exonerated in 1990. Right after World War II his poetry focused on social issues. Eventually Jasiczek concentrated on folk and natural motives of regional nature. His lyric poetry is full of melancholy and appreciation of the natural beauties of his region, mostly the Beskids mountain ranges. Jasiczek's adoration of natural beauties of his region, particularly the Beskids can be seen for example in Nie zdradzƒô (I Will not Betray) poem from Obuszkiem ciosane (Cut with Cudgel) poetry collection.

It is within the TS5 postcode area, and it is part of the Ayresome ward. Whinney Banks is bounded by West Lane and Newport to the north, the A19 dual- carriageway to the west, Linthorpe to the east and Acklam and Beckfield to the south. Whinney Banks Whinney Banks was originally an estate of around 550 dwellings, built mostly in the 1930s and 1940s; it formed part of a wider expanse of social housing on the western boundary of Middlesbrough. Over a number of years the estate became unpopular, until, by the late 1990s, over a third of the properties were void. In 1999 the area became part of the West Middlesbrough Neighbourhood Trust New Deal for Communities area, and became a flagship project for housing renewal. After extensive work with the local community, it was agreed that a fundamental change in the area was required if it was to increase its popularity and dispel perceptions that it was a dangerous area. Work then began on acquiring and demolishing 412 houses in preparation for redevelopment. In 2004, Bellway Homes was appointed to lead the ¬£50 million redevelopment of the site. This involved the construction of 454 new homes for sale and rent. As part of this initiative, the name of the area was changed from Whinney Banks to Acklam Green, to make it sound more appealing. Currently, there are also 40 properties being built on the site of the former St Francis School, which had been shut down on account of low attendance. Also, four houses and 16 bungalows will be for rent, 20 part ownership. There are also plans for a roundabout to be built on Acklam Road at the gateway entrance to Acklam Green - the redevelopment area in central Whinney Banks.

It is believed to have arisen as a hybrid of the native rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) and the cut- leaved whitebeam (Sorbus pseudofennica) which is in turn a rowan/Arran whitebeam (Sorbus arranensis) hybrid.Johnston, Ian (15 June 2007) Trees on Arran 'are a whole new species'. Edinburgh. The Scotsman newspaper Retrieved 18 June 2007. Only two specimens of the Catacol whitebeam are known (Possibly only one is alive), making it the rarest tree not only in Scotland, it is tied rarest in the world with Wood's cycad, both with only one specimen alive. A third was recorded as a sapling but is believed to have been destroyed by deer. A seedling has also been grown in Edinburgh. The latest evaluation by IUCN fails to find one of the 2 trees found, so they state that only 1 tree is left. The discovery followed work in the 1990s by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), Dougarie Estate and Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. The trees were confirmed as a distinct species by DNA testing. Graeme Walker of SNH has said: > \\"These are unique trees which are native to Arran and not found anywhere > else in the world, we knew about the Arran whitebeam and the cut-leaved > Arran whitebeam, which are also crosses between rowan and different species > of whitebeam, but it has been really exciting to discover a completely new > species. It is very complex picture but we think that the Arran whitebeams > are gradually evolving towards a new type of tree which will probably look > very similar to a rowan.\\" Dr. Ashley Robertson of Bristol University, who helped discover the species, said: \\"It is not an evolutionary dead end. It is evolution in action\\". The new species is the third endemic whitebeam found on Arran (after the Arran whitebeam and the cut-leaved whitebeam) and combines the red berries of a rowan with the oval leaves of a whitebeam. The trees are currently within a deer fence which will be extended - delivery of materials by helicopter will be necessary due to the remoteness of the location. The species is named after Glen Catacol where it was found and the only known remaining tree may be over 50 years old.Revealed, the New Species of Tree With Scottish Roots Retrieved 18 June 2007.

Polystannanes are organotin compounds with the formula (R2Sn)n. These polymers have been of intermittent academic interest; they are unusual because heavy elements comprise the backbone. Structurally related but better characterized (and more useful) are the polysilanes (R2Si)n. Schematic representation of a linear polystannane macromolecule. History thumbrightThree common synthesis routes used to prepare polystannanes: (1) polymerization of tin dichlorides by Wurtz or Wurtz-like reactions, (2) electrochemical reactions and (3) catalytic dehydropolymerization of tin dihydrides. . Oligo- or polystannanes were first described by L√∂wig in 1852,C. L√∂wig, Mitt. Naturforsch. Ges. Z√ºrich, 1852, 2, 556. only 2 years after Edward Frankland's report on the isolation of the first organotin compounds.Edward Frankland, Q. J. Chem. Soc., 1850, 2, 263. L√∂wig' route involved treating an Sn/K and Sn/Na alloys with iodoethane, in the presence of quartz sand which was used to control the reaction rate. Products with elemental compositions close to those of oligo(diethylstannane)s or poly(diethylstannane) were obtained. Cahours obtained similar products and attributed the formation of the so-called \\"stannic ethyl\\" to a reaction of the Wurtz type.A. Cahours, Ann. Chem. Pharm. (Liebig‚Äôs Ann.), 1860, 114, 227A. Cahours, Ann. Chim. Phys., S√©r. 3, 1860, 58, 5. Already in 1858, \\"stannic ethyl\\" was formulated as a polymeric compound denoted with the composition n(SnC4H5).A. Strecker, Ann. Chem. Pharm. (Liebig‚Äôs Ann.), 1858, 105, 306. In 1917 Gr√ºttner,G. Gr√ºttner, Ber. Deutsch. Chem. Gesell., 1917, 50, 1808. who reinvestigated results on hexaethyl-distannanes(H5C2)3Sn-Sn(C2H5)3 (reported by Ladenburg in 1870) confirmed the presence of Sn-Sn bonds and predicated for the first time that tin could form chain like compounds.A. Ladenburg, Ber. Deutsch. Chem. Gesell., 1870, 3, 353. In 1943, it was postulated that ‚Äúdiphenyltin‚Äù exists as a type of polymeric material because of its yellow color [8], and indeed a bathochromic shift of the wavelength at maximum absorption with increasing number of Sn atoms was found later in the case of oligo(dibutylstannane)s comprising up to 15 Sn atoms.L. R. Sita, K. W. Terry, K. Shibata, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1995, 117, 8049. The Wurtz reaction is still used for the preparation of poly(dialkylstannane)s. Treatment of dialkyltin dichlorides with sodium lead to polystannanes of high molar mass, however, in low yields and with formation of (cyclic) oligomers. [11-16]. Other efforts to prepare high molar mass polystannanes by electrochemical reactionsM. Okano, N. Matsumoto, M. Arakawa, T. Tsuruta, H. Hamano, Chem. Commun., 1998, 1799. M. Okano, K. Watanabe, Electrochem. Commun., 2000, 2, 471. or by catalytic dehydropolymerization of dialkylstannanes (R2SnH2) were also made [16].T. Imori, T. D. Tilley, J. Chem. Soc., Chem.

Woo, S. J. Song, B. H. Kim, Bull. Korean Chem. Soc., 1998, 19, 1161. Unfortunately, frequently, the polymers prepared by those methods were not isolated and typically contained significant fractions of cyclic oligomers.

Dialkytin dihydrides (R2SnH2) were reported in 2005 to undergo dehydropolymerization in the presence of Wilkinson‚Äôs catalyst. This method afforded polystannanes without detectable amounts of \\"cyclic\\"-byproducts. The polymers were yellow with number average molar masses of 10 to 70 kg/mol and a polydispersity of 2 ‚Äì 3.F. Choffat, P. Smith, W. Caseri, J. Mater. Chem., 2005, 15, 1789. By variation of the catalyst concentration the molar masses of the synthesized polymers could be adjusted. A strong influence of the temperature on the degree of conversion was observed. Determination of the molar mass at different degrees of conversion indicated that polymerization did not proceed according to a statistical condensation mechanism, but, likely, by growth onto the catalyst, e.g. by insertion of SnR2-like units. The poly(dialkylstannane)s were found to be thermotropic and displayed first-order phase transitions from one liquid-crystalline phase into another or directly to the isotropic state, depending on the length of the side groups. More specifically, poly(dibutylstannane) for example showed an endothermic phase transition at ~0 ¬∞C from a rectangular to a pure nematic phase, as determined by X-ray diffraction.F. Choffat, S. K√§ser, P. Wolfer, D. Schmid, R. Mezzenga, P. Smith, W. Caseri, Macromolecules, 2007, 40, 7878. As expected, polystannanes were semi-conductive. Temperature-dependent, time-resolved pulse radiolysis microwave conductivity measurements of poly(dibutylstannane) yielded values of charge-carrier mobilities of 0.1 to 0.03 cm2 V‚àí1 s‚àí1, which are similar to those found for pi-bond-conjugated carbon-based polymers. By partial oxidation of the material with SbF5 conductivities of 0.3 S cm‚àí1 could be monitored.T. Imori, V. Lu, H. Cai, T. D. Tilley, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1995, 117, 9931. The liquid-crystalline characteristics of the poly(dialkylstannane)s permitted facile orientation of these macromolecules, for instance, by mechanical shearing or tensile drawing of blends with poly(ethylene). Poly(dialkylstannane)s with short side groups invariably arranged parallel to the external orientation direction, while the polymers with longer side groups had a tendency to order themselves perpendicular to that axis.

Several complexity classes are typically defined in terms of a polynomial-time nondeterministic Turing machine, where each branch can either accept or reject, and the entire machine accepts or rejects as some function of the branches' conditions. For example, a non-deterministic Turing machine accepts if at least one branch accepts, and rejects only if all branches reject. A co-non-deterministic Turing machine, on the other hand, accepts only if all branches accept, and rejects if any branch rejects. Many classes can be defined in this fashion. We can then formalize this by examining the formal language associated with each acceptance condition. We assume that the tree is ordered, and read the accept/reject strings off the leaves of the computation tree. For example, the nondeterministic machine will accept iff the leaf string is in the language {0, 1}*1{0, 1}*, and will reject iff the leaf string is in the language 0*.

History  =The Sea Toy II= Before founding Lakeland Boating, then called Lakeland Yachting and Motorboating, Vic Schoen was an avid boater. Schoen was then piloting a 36-foot 1925 wooden Burger dubbed Sea Toy II. A great fan of his boat, Schoen also knew that it represented the capital he needed to start a new magazine about boating on the Great Lakes and surrounding environs. In early 1946, Schoen placed an ad in the Chicago Tribune placing Sea Toy II up for sale. Schoen sold the boat to 26-year-old Paul Cullen for $1,300, the necessary seed money to being a new magazine, Lakeland Yachting and Motorboating. =Lakeland Yachting= Vic Schoen started his new magazine, christened Lakeland Yachting and Motorboating, in mid-1946 and based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Under his guidance, Lakeland Yachting was cordial and upbeat on every page, presenting an enthusiast's assurance that boating was pure happiness. In 1957, the name of the magazine was changed from Lakeland Yachting and Motorboating to Lakeland Boating to more accurately depict the nature of the magazine and its emphasis on motor boats. =1963: Mid-America's Freshwater Yachting Magazine= Only five issues of Lakeland Yachting were published in 1963, and after the first issue of 1964 was published, ownership of the magazine was passed from Schoen to Larry Prakken and Dave Kitz. Prakken would be the publisher, Kitz the editor. Along with this change in ownership came the new slogan, \\"Mid-America's Freshwater Yachting Magazine\\" to emphasize its regional orientation. While Schoen had kept things light and breezy, Kitz set forth his new editorial mission: \\"First, to report for you the interesting boating activities of the past, present, and future... and second, to raise its voice to help protect and preserve this delightful boating area from the ravages of deterioration that too often accompany the growth of metropolitan areas.\\" Kitz. Dave: \\"Editorial\\". page 2. Lakeland Boating. January-February 1964. Two specific concerns for Kitz were nature's ecological balance and pollution. After moving their offices to Ann Arbor, Michigan, a subscription cost $4.00 a year for ten issues or 50 cents an issue on the news stand. Editor Dave Kitz was a strident voice for boaters. In his \\"View from the Bridge\\" column he gave boaters a conscience and called out politicians when he felt they were wrong. He was particularly concerned with boat safety. Kitz bought out Prakken in 1972. Subscriptions were now $5.00 a year of 75 cents an issue. Instead of publishing their normal pre-boat show issue in 1975, Kitz instead published his \\"Clean Water\\" issue, calling on the government to stop Reserve Mining's spoiling of Lake Superior while also lauding the City of Detroit for their work cleaning up the Detroit River, then one of the worst cesspools in America. Kitz saw boating not as the culmination of one's life but as a worthwhile hobby, once writing, \\"All too often the boat is misappropriated and, used as a status symbol or an experience with the IRS in mind, it could have anything but a wholesome influence on young people.\\" For fun with the family, he said, boating \\"Is still one of the best ways to do interesting things together.\\" Kitz. Dave: \\"Editorial\\". page 2. Lakeland Boating. December 1976. Kitz moved the offices to Adrian, Michigan, in 1977 and subscriptions were now $8.00 a year or $1.00 an issue. =1980: Peterson Publications= Kitz sold Lakeland Boating to Peterson Publications in 1980. Peterson Publications specializes in niche-market magazines and planned on turning Lakeland Boating, which at this time was considered a small- circulation magazine, into a national giant. Peterson quickly tripled Lakeland Boating's circulation to a high of 60,000. Peterson Publications folded its own Sea magazine into Lakeland Boating, growing the magazine from 40 pages an issue to 130. Kitz, now an associate publisher for the magazine, found his strong editorial voice gone from the magazine now but continued to write his \\"View from the Bridge\\" column until the magazine dropped it upon sale to its current publisher. =1983-present: Walter \\"Bing\\" O'Meara= Walter \\"Bing\\" O'Meara and David Brown purchased Lakeland Boating in 1983. O'Meara learned magazine publishing in the food service and lodging trade journals. After their purchase, subscription prices in 1984 were now $15.94 for ten issues a year of $1.75 an issue. Pleasure boating had been on a downturn since the gasoline crisis] in 1974 when President Jimmy Carter suggested that fuel sales should not take place on weekends. Owing to this, Peterson Publications had found their efforts to go national stymied and had re-focused on the regional aspect of the magazine. Upon O'Meara's purchase of the magazine, however, boating began an upturn in popularity again that would continue for quite some time. O'Meara moved the business office to Highland Park, Illinois and brought original owner Vic Schoen back as a correspondent. In June 1985, O'Meara bought out his partner David Brown and moved the offices to Chicago, Illinois. Offices moved to the Fountain Building in Evanston, Illinois in 1988 and to Printer's Row in Chicago in 2003. The circulation of the magazine as of 2006 was 50,226 copies. Lakeland Boating is a glossy, full-color magazine published eleven times a year.

He made studies of clutch size in nesting birds, compared the life-histories of birds in different latitudes and was a pioneer in the introduction of quantitative approaches to the study of birds. He was also a long time editor of the ornithological journal Ibis. Early life Moreau was born on 29 May 1897 near Norbiton Gate at Kingston upon Thames. His father worked in the stock exchange while his mother's family ran a baker's business in Kingston. The family name was derived from an ancestral French immigrant who had moved to Bayswater as a bookseller. In his autobiographical note published in the Ibis upon his death, he notes that nobody in his family had any academic interests or an interest in natural history. He went to a local preparatory school and became interested in birds through Cherry Kearton's books With Nature and a Camera and Our Bird Friends. He however did not relate to the birdlife around him. His secondary schooling was at the Kingston Grammar School. Around this time he injured his right wrist and had to learn to write with his left hand. His father was hit by the open door of a speeding train and the injury led to a nervous breakdown with periodic episodes of manic-depression. The burden of earning and care of the family now went to Moreau's mother but in 1907 they moved from Kingston to Rowledge on the edge of Alice Holt Forest and then in 1913 to Farnham. In his teens he began exploring the neighbourhood on bicycle and through the books of William Henry Hudson took an interest in observing the local birds. In 1914 he wrote the Executive Class Examination for entrance to the Home Civil Service and made it into the 99th place among 100 available positions although his bad eyesight and poor health made him nearly fail. He received a posting in September 1914 at a war office and his job was to scrutinize applications for separation allowance. A year later he was posted at the Army Audit Office in Aldershot. The clerical work for the next five years was interrupted by rheumatoid arthritis. His family doctor suggested that he needed a \\"complete change\\". He applied for a transfer to the Army Audit Department in Cairo and got one in 1920. Egypt Around this time he was a member of the RSPB through which he met Michael John Nicoll who was the director at the Giza Zoological Gardens. Due to security problems in Egypt, he had to wear military uniform, something he was very uncomfortable with. The work was only from 8 AM to 2 PM after which he would often go to the hot springs at Helwan. His health improved rapidly. Nicoll, a member of the BOU, was a regular contact but the two never made any field excursions together. Moreau however began to make many weekend excursions. A bout of paratyphoid hospitalised him briefly during September 1920 and during this period he observed a number of migrant birds. He later hired a donkey to make weekend trips. There were fears that lone British travellers would be captured by Egyptian nationalists but he found only friendly company and picked up Arabic. In one of his jaunts to a distant wadi he came to meet C. B. Williams, an entomologist at the Egyptian agriculture ministry. Williams became a close friend and he was introduced to scientific ideas and the two made many excursions into the desert. Williams also encouraged Moreau to publish his bird notes in the Ibis journal, with help in preparing the manuscripts. The drafts were typed by Williams' wife. At Alexandria one March, he spotted a lady picking up buttercups among the wheatears and larks that he was observing and found her knowledgeable about birds. After meeting her, Winnie, a couple more times, he married her in June 1924 at Cumberland. The young couple preferred to live at Maadi close to Wadi Digha where they kept a pet raven and conducted experiments to see if the plumage colours of larks were genetically inherited. They had a daughter whom they named Prinia after a small bird, the Graceful Prinia (Prinia gracilis). A Graceful Prinia had built a nest in the ventilator of the bell tent that was the Moreaus' first marital home. (The bird genus name Buphagus was initially suggested as the name for their son David.) Moreau made trips around Africa and wrote on birds as well as letters to the New Statesman. He also wrote some fiction such as The Temple Servant under the pen name of \\"E. R. Morrough\\" as, being a civil servant, he was not allowed to publish books. They travelled around Africa and in 1928 C.B. Williams moved to Amani in Tanganyika as Deputy Directory of a research station there and recommended that Moreau should take up work in the accounts department. Amani The Moreaus moved in March 1928 from the desert to the rainforests of the Usambara Mountains with their children David and Prinia. They often suffered from malaria and dysentery. Here, however he had access to a library and soon became librarian and also took up the editorial role of the East African Agricultural Journal. He did not have access to any books on the birds of the region until Admiral Hubert Lynes gave him a copy of Anton Reichenow's Vogel Afrikas. Still later Arthur Loveridge who employed a part-time native collector Salimu Asmani asked Moreau if Salimu could be employed. Salimu turned out to be a very good observer. The British Museum hardly had bird specimens from this region which was largely German controlled. Through C.B. Williams' efforts, some funds were diverted to help employ Salimu, Charles Abdallah and other African assistants. Through these assistants, Moreau obtained notes on incubation, feeding and collected a mass of data on bird nesting. In 1931 a species of bird that he collected was named after him by W.L. Sclater as Artisornis moreaui. In 1938 Moreau discovered another species of warbler which he named after his wife, initially as another species of Artisornis but later as Scepomycter winifredae. The Moreau's were also among the first Europeans to note the joking relationships or the utani system that connected tribes in East Africa. In 1934 the station was visited by David Lack and in 1939 by W. H. Thorpe and his wife. Thorpe had made the trip to find a giant coccid. In 1936 they moved the children to England for their education, they only saw them again during their next leave in 1939 and then did not see them again until they returned to England after the war. In June 1946 Moreau developed choroiditis which threatened his eyesight. This led to his leaving Africa and retiring to England. He published nearly 80 papers while at Amani but still had work to be done. David Lack offered him a part-time position at the Edward Grey Institute while Thorpe offered him a place in his Cambridge section of Animal Behaviour. He also was invited to the editorship of the ornithological journal, Ibis. He received an honorary Master of Arts degree from the University of Oxford on 15 December 1951. He retired from the editorship of Ibis in 1960 and from the Edward Grey Institute in July 1964. The British Ornithologists' Union awarded him the Godman-Salvin award at their Annual General Meeting on 3 April 1966. Ornithological pioneer Moreau was among the pioneering ornithologists who focused on life-history studies of birds. In 1944 he suggested in a paper in the Ibis that birds, even of the same or very closely related species, laid larger clutches of eggs in the higher latitudes than in the tropics. This was based on his studies of birds in Africa through the collection of large amounts of data often collected by his African assistants. This data and the general trend that was confirmed opened up a very active debate on avian clutch size. Theoretically birds should be laying as many eggs as they can across the world. One idea proposed by Alexander Skutch was that the clutch size had evolved so that the death rate is offset so that bird populations are more or less stable. Another theory proposed by David Lack was that the number of eggs laid was fine tuned by the availability of resources such as food that are available for raising the young successfully. This debate would also lead to more fundamental questions related to the unit of selection and ideas on group selection. Later life After returning from Africa, Moreau settled in \\"the tiny and unregarded Oxfordshire village of Berrick Salome\\".Moreau R E, The Departed Village: Berrick Salome at the Turn of the Century, Oxford: OUP 1968, p. 1. He wrote, \\"in 1965 I realized suddenly that, because Berrick was so small and because we were fortunate in still having several people whose clear recollections reached back to between 1890 and 1910, it might be possible to build up for a period about the turn of the century a picture of more than purely local interest.\\" His study was published Oxford University Press in 1968 as The Departed Village: Berrick Salome at the Turn of the Century. He died at Hereford, England, on 30 May 1970. He is buried, alongside his wife, Winnie, in the churchyard of Sutton St Michael.

One of the problems identifying apples in religion, mythology and folktales is that as late as the 17th century, the word \\"apple\\" was used as a generic term for all (foreign) fruit other than berries, but including nuts. This term may even have extended to plant galls, as they were thought to be of plant origin (see oak apple). For instance, when tomatoes were introduced into Europe, they were called \\"love apples\\". In one Old English work, cucumbers are called eor√æ√¶ppla (lit. \\"earth-apples'), just as in French, Dutch, Hebrew, Afrikaans, Persian and Swiss German as well as several other German dialects, the words for potatoes mean \\"earth-apples\\". In some languages, oranges are called \\"golden apples\\" or \\"Chinese apples\\". Datura is called \\"thorn-apple\\". Ethnobotanical and ethnomycological scholars such as R. Gordon Wasson, Carl Ruck and Clark Heinrich write that the mythological apple is a symbolic substitution for the entheogenic Amanita muscaria (or fly agaric) mushroom. Its association with knowledge is an allusion to the revelatory states described by some shamans and users of psychedelic mushrooms. At times artists would co-opt the apple, as well as other religious symbology, whether for ironic effect or as a stock element of symbolic vocabulary. Thus, secular art as well made use of the apple as symbol of love and sexuality. It is often an attribute associated with Venus who is shown holding it. Mythology and religion Adam and Eve: a classic depiction of the biblical tale showcasing the apple as a symbol of sin. Albrecht D√ºrer, 1507; oil on panel. Though the forbidden fruit in the Book of Genesis is not identified, popular Christian tradition holds that Adam and Eve ate an apple from the forbidden tree in the Garden of Eden. The unnamed fruit of Eden thus became an apple under the influence of the story of the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides. As a result, the apple became a symbol for knowledge, immortality, temptation, the fall of man and sin. The classical Greek word ŒºŒÆŒªŒøŒΩ (mƒìlon), or dialectal Œº·æ∂ŒªŒøŒΩ (mƒÅlon), now a loanword in English as melon, meant tree fruit in general,Entry Œº·øÜŒªŒøŒΩ at Liddell & Scott. but was borrowed into Latin as mƒÅlum, meaning 'apple'. The similarity of this word to Latin mƒÉlum, meaning 'evil', may also have influenced the apple's becoming interpreted as the biblical \\"forbidden fruit\\" in the commonly used Latin translation called \\"Vulgate\\". The larynx in the human throat has been called Adam's apple because of the folk tale that the bulge was caused by the forbidden fruit sticking in the throat of Adam. The apple as symbol of sexual seduction has sometimes been used to imply sexuality between men, possibly in an ironic vein. Francisco de Zurbar√°n - A Virgem da Ma√ß√£, 1660-64 The notion of the apple as a symbol of sin is reflected in artistic renderings of the fall from Eden. When held in Adam's hand, the apple symbolises sin. But, when Christ is portrayed holding an apple, he represents the Second Adam who brings life. This difference reflects the evolution of the symbol in Christianity. In the Old Testament, the apple was significant of the fall of man; in the New Testament, it is an emblem of the redemption from that fall. The apple is represented in pictures of the Madonna and Infant Jesus as another sign of that redemption. In some versions (such as Young's Literal Translation) of the Bible, the Hebrew word for mandrakes dudaim (Genesis 30:14) is translated as \\"love apples\\" (not to be confused with the New World tomatoes). There are several instances in the Old Testament where the apple is used in a more favourable light. The phrase 'the apple of your eye' comes from verses in Deuteronomy 32:10, Psalm 17:8 Proverbs 7:2, and Zechariah 2:8, implying an object or person who is greatly valued. In Proverbs 25:11, the verse states, \\"a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver\\". In the love songs of the Song of Solomon, the apple is used in a sensual context. In these latter instances, the apple is used as a symbol for beauty. The apple appears again in Joel 1:12 in a verse with a sense of profound loss when the apple tree withers. During the Jewish New Year - Rosh Hashanah - it is customary to eat apples dipped in honey to evoke a \\"new year that is good [the apple] and sweet [the honey]\\". =Greek= Atalanta and Hippomenes by Nicolas Colombel The Greek hero Heracles, as a part of his Twelve Labours, was required to travel to the Garden of the Hesperides and pick the golden apples off the Tree of Life growing at its center. Atalanta, also of Greek mythology, raced all her suitors in an attempt to avoid marriage. She outran all but Hippomenes (a.k.a. Melanion, a name possibly derived from melon the Greek word for both \\"apple\\" and fruit in general), who defeated her by cunning, not speed. Hippomenes knew that he could not win in a fair race, so he used three golden apples (gifts of Aphrodite, the goddess of love) to distract Atalanta. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful, winning the race and Atalanta's hand. The Greek goddess of discord, Eris, became disgruntled after she was excluded from the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. In retaliation, she tossed a golden apple inscribed Kallisti ('For the most beautiful one'), into the wedding party. Three goddesses claimed the apple: Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Paris of Troy was appointed to select the recipient. After being bribed by both Hera and Athena, Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Sparta. He awarded the apple to Aphrodite, thus indirectly causing the Trojan War. =Norse= In Norse mythology, the goddess I√∞unn is strongly associated with apples. I√∞unn was abducted by √ûjazi the giant, who used Loki to lure I√∞unn and her apples out of √Åsgar√∞r. After borrowing Freyja's falcon skin, Loki liberated I√∞unn from √ûjazi by transforming her into a nut for the flight back. √ûjazi gave chase in the form of an eagle, whereupon reaching √Åsgar√∞r he was set aflame by a bonfire lit by the √Üsir. =Celtic= The Allantide game Allantide (, meaning first day of winter) is a Cornish festival that was traditionally celebrated on the night of 31 October, as well as the following day time. One of the most important parts of this festival was the giving of Allan apples, large glossy red apples that were highly polished, to family and friends as tokens of good luck. Allan apple markets used to be held throughout West Cornwall in the run up to the feast. and in the town of St Just it surpassed Christmas as a time for giving gifts until the late 20th century. A game was also recorded in which two pieces of wood were nailed together in the shape of a cross. It was then suspended, with 4 lit candles on each arm and Allan apples suspended underneath. The aim being to catch the apples with your mouth without getting molten wax on your face. For unmarried recipients the apples would be placed under their pillows in the hope that they would bring dreams of their future wife or husband.Simon Reed - The Cornish Traditional Year 2009 Legends, folklore, and traditions * In North America a Native American is called an \\"apple\\" (a slur that stands for someone who is \\"red on the outside, white on the inside.\\") primarily by other Native Americans to indicate someone who has lost touch with their cultural identity.

History The band, originally called 'Vent', started to collaborate in December 1994, and received considerable media attention, mostly because of the presence of Hunt, with the result that they were invited to produce a session for Radio 1 before they had recorded anything at all. They first played live at the 1995 Reading Festival, before touring the U.S., and returning for a UK tour supporting Therapy? Duffy left the band shortly before this tour. A full UK headlining tour followed to support the release of their self-titled album, produced by Steve Albini, in 1996.Trouser Press page Retrieved on 2007-06-18 By this time the band had been forced to change their name, because of the threat of legal action by an American band of the same name.

Football career Born in Hammersmith, he attended Bruce Castle School in Tottenham, before training as a schoolteacher. His teaching career took him to Handel College in Southampton. He joined Southampton St. Mary's initially as a left-Winger and played in the Saints' two FA Cup qualifying matches in November as well as friendlies and local cup matches. In 1894 Southampton were founder members of the Southern League. In the inaugural season Ward was asked to take over the role of centre forward. According to Holley & Chalk's \\"Alphabet of the Saints\\" he was \\"a tireless worker at all times\\"; he was joint top-scorer (with Charles Baker and Jack Angus) for the team for the 1894‚Äì95 season with six league goals from only nine appearances, and his goalscoring abilities earned him five Hampshire County caps, two as captain. He also made six FA Cup appearances, scoring six goals, including three in a 14‚Äì0 defeat of Newbury at the Antelope Ground on 13 October 1894; this is still Southampton's biggest victory in a competitive match. Saints reached the First Round proper for the first time, going out 1‚Äì4 to Football League First Division opponents Nottingham Forest, with Ward scoring Saints' consolation goal. Cricket career In 1895 he quit football to concentrate on his cricket career. Ward made his County Championship debut for Hampshire in the first match the team played in the competition during 1895. The team acquitted themselves well, finishing in tenth place, with six wins under their belt, and Ward with three half-centuries, his first coming in the first match of the season, against Somerset. This score of 71 was the highest score of his season, not bettered until he scored his first of two career centuries, against Derbyshire in May 1896. Ward was a frequent participant in the 1896 County Championship season, leading the Hampshire attack, along with former Middlesex player, and future Hampshire captain, Charles Robson, who was also the secretary/manager of Southampton Football Club. Ward bowled frequently for Hampshire in his later seasons, picking up nineteen wickets for the team, including a best bowling analysis of 4‚Äì17 against Sussex in July 1896. Hampshire finished ninth in the 1897 County Championship table, with a negative finishing percentage. Ward died just seventeen days after his final County Cricket match, still in full flow of the 1897 cricket season, at the age of 24, possibly a club record for the shortest amount of time between an individual's final first-class fixture and their death. At first the cause of death was presumed to be sunstroke but it was subsequently diagnosed as typhoid fever. Herbert's brother, Charles Ward, cousin Leonard Ward and uncle Charles Ward were all first-class cricketers.

Anti-Mullerian hormone receptor type 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the AMHR2 gene. Function This gene encodes the receptor for the anti- Mullerian hormone (AMH) which, in addition to testosterone, results in male sex differentiation. AMH and testosterone are produced in the testes by different cells and have different effects. Testosterone promotes the development of male genitalia while the binding of AMH to the encoded receptor prevents the development of the mullerian ducts into uterus and Fallopian tubes. Mutations in this gene are associated with persistent Mullerian duct syndrome type II. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.

He is one of the 21 associated folk-deities of Ayyanar and is hence one among the demi gods or Kaval Deivams of the Tamil heritage. He was believed to come from the Kerala region (Erumeli) as an assistant to Ayyanar (Ayyappan) during the Sangam Age. He was a local hero and then after his passing, the locals eventually worshipped his spirit (a Dravidian practice) and he was elevated as a \\"kaval deivam\\", just like Ayyanar was. Temples and shrines Karuppu Sami temple is mostly found in the outskirts of the Village. Usually, the whole village contributes to the maintenance of the temple. These temples/shrines do not have traditional Gopurams and have large statues of Gods with large eyes, holding weapons like bow and arrow, swords, sickle and other weapons. There could also be statues of 7 Kannimaar goddesses/Saptha Kanniyar (7 virgins) and animals, often a hunting dog, a lion and horse alongside the main idol of Karuppusami. Worship Karuppanar worship is a very ancient ancestral clan- based worship system. Most officiating priests are non-Brahmins and derive from local lineages that had initiated the cult generations ago. The worship pattern is non-Vedic or non-Agamic through folk tales, songs and arts (Villu pattu, Karakattam, Koothu etc.). The local priest might offer flowers or vibuthi (holy ash) to the worshippers and may play the role of an oracle for Shamanism. Various persons within the clan system are identified to play to the role of oracle on annual turn basis. They undertake vradham and maintain chastity and purity during the period. During the festivals, oracles get into trance state (Saami aadudhal) and deliver counselling messages to the group assembled there without bias. Before the oracles deliver counselling messages, oracles stand on top the aruval (aruval Mel vakku). The normal problems addressed are family problems, financial troubles and local community and social issues for resolving within the community group with the agreement of local ancestral god through oracle. Whenever the wishes of the people are granted, they give their offerings to Him based on what they vowed to offer. Karuppu Sami is also worshipped in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Guadeloupe, and Martinique under the name Dee Baba, karuppan, or karuppanar . Offerings of cigarettes, camphor, biscuits, butter, cloves, ghee, and alcohol as well as a sacrifice of a black chicken or goat are made to him here. There are 108 form of Karuppan. Here are the list of 21 Karuppu : * Padinettam Padi Karuppan * Sandana Karuppan * Sangili Karuppan * Ondi Karuppan * Chinna Karuppan * Periya Karuppan * Vettai Karuppan * Nondi Karuppan * Sappani Karuppan * Kottai Karuppan * Veera Karuppan * Masana Karuppan * Kattu Karuppan * Samaya Karuppan * Agayam Karuppan * Ellai Karuppan * Muthu Karuppan * Malai Karuppan * Masi Karuppan * Sonai Karuppan * Maya Karuppan * Ponthupuli Karuppan Annual festivals The village committee would decide on when the annual festival be conducted. The time of the year when this would fall varies with villages and their local customs - each of which will be associated a folk-lore. Generally, the mass convention assembly of a large number of related family members is organized during the spring season for a period of 2 to 3 days. The commencement of the festival will be with that of a hoisting of the flag and tying the \\"Kaappu\\". After this time, villagers cannot go out of the village but can come in from a different village. During this annual gathering, a large number of goats and chicken are sacrificed for Karuppanar. He is also offered Beedis (country made cigarettes) or cigars and Naravam or some form of modern alcohol.

The franchise is built around a series of action-adventure games focused on various incarnations of the eponymous Prince from ancient and medieval Iran. The games have been developed and published by several different companies. The first two games in the series, Prince of Persia and Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame, were published by Broderbund. Prince of Persia 3D, the first to use 3D computer graphics, was developed by Red Orb Entertainment and published by The Learning Company on PC, and developed by Avalanche Software and published by Mattel Interactive on Sega Dreamcast. Ubisoft began developing and publishing the series in 2003 with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. The series has been rebooted twice since its acquisition by Ubisoft, and has been made into a film, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, penned in part by Mechner and released by Walt Disney Pictures in 2010. The franchise also includes Prince of Persia: The Graphic Novel and the Lego line Lego Prince of Persia. The Assassin's Creed video game series is the spiritual successor to Prince of Persia.The series took inspiration from the novel Alamut by the Slovenian writer Vladimir Bartol, while building upon concepts from the Prince of Persia series. Games =Original trilogy= The first game in the series, titled The Prince, was created by Jordan Mechner after the success of Karateka. Drawing from multiple general sources of inspiration, including the One Thousand and One Nights stories, and films like Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Adventures of Robin Hood, the protagonist's character animation was created using a technique called rotoscoping, with Mechner using his brother as the model for the titular prince. The original Prince of Persia, with its more than 20 platform ports, is one of the most ported games in video game history. Despite the success of the game, Mechner enrolled in New York University's film department, producing an award-winning short film during his time there, before returning to design and direct a sequel to the original game. The sequel, Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame, was developed internally at Broderbund with Mechner's supervision. The game, like its predecessor, received critical acclaim and high sales. Broderbund was subsequently purchased by The Learning Company, which was later acquired by US game company Mattel Interactive. In 1999, a new Prince of Persia title, Prince of Persia 3D, was developed and released under Broderbund's Red Orb label. Released for PC only,Prince of Persia Legacy: poplegacy.com and criticized by many users as being buggy, it was a critical and commercial disappointment. The Broderbund/Learning Company's games division, the assets of which included the Prince of Persia franchise, was subsequently sold to Ubisoft. =The Sands of Time series= Mechner, who owned the Prince of Persia intellectual property, was brought in to work with Ubisoft on a reboot of the franchise, titled Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, although he was originally wary after the failure of Prince of Persia 3D. The team they worked with were also working on Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: their aim with the new Prince of Persia was to breathe new life into the action-adventure genre. The Sands of Time was a success. Mechner did not take part in the production of the next game, Warrior Within, and he commented on finding the dark atmosphere and heightened level of violence unappealing. The changes also provoked mixed reactions from critics, but sales were strong and a third game, eventually titled The Two Thrones, went into production. For The Two Thrones, the developers and artists tried to strike a balance between the light, cartoon-like tones of The Sands of Time, and the grittier mediums of Warrior Within. In November 2008, Ubisoft revealed that they were working on a new entry in the franchise, which turned out to be The Forgotten Sands, which filled in some of the narrative gap between The Sands of Time and Warrior Within. The game was released in May 2010, timed to tie in with the film adaptation of the first game in The Sands of Time subseries, also titled The Sands of Time. Trilogy collection The Prince of Persia Trilogy (known as Prince of Persia Trilogy 3D on the remastered collection's title screen) is a collection of The Sands of Time trilogy released on PlayStation 2 and subsequently on PlayStation 3 as part of the Classics HD range. The collection includes The Sands of Time, Warrior Within and The Two Thrones, all previously released on PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows. The games were remastered in high-definition for the PlayStation 3 with 3D and PlayStation Network Trophy support on one Blu-ray Disc. The PlayStation 2 collection was released on October 27, 2006 in Europe, while the remastered collection was released on November 19, 2010 on Blu-ray in PAL regions. The release marks the first Classics HD title to not be published by Sony Computer Entertainment. In North America, the three games were originally released separately as downloadable only titles on the PlayStation Store. The first, The Sands of Time, was released on November 16, 2010 while the other two games followed in December 2010. The Blu-ray version was to be released in North America on March 22, 2011 but the collection ended up being delayed until April 19, 2011. =Spin-offs, remakes and mobile games= The first spin-off of the series was developed alongside and released in the same year as The Two Thrones for the Nintendo DS. Battles of Prince of Persia is a real-time strategy game, set between The Sands of Time and Warrior Within. It received mediocre reviews from critics. In 2006, concept designs surfaced hinting at another entry in the franchise. The game, Prince of Persia, was unveiled in 2008, with Ubisoft marketing it as a reboot of the franchise, with its level and combat design harking back to the original 1989 game. The game came out in December 2008, receiving positive reviews from most video game outlets and decent sales. Alongside the main game, Ubisoft's Casablanca branch developed a direct sequel and spin-off to the reboot for the Nintendo DS, titled Prince of Persia: The Fallen King. The game was released alongside the main game, and received fair reviews. In 2007 Gameloft and Ubisoft released Prince of Persia Classic, an enhanced remake of the original Prince of Persia for Xbox 360 (XBLA), PlayStation 3 (PSN), iOS and Android. The visual style has been upgraded to resemble Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, and the Prince himself has acquired some additional moves, such as the ability to roll, backflip, wall jump and stop time briefly during combat. However, the core gameplay remains the same as the original - defeat Jaffar within one hour, watching out for the many traps and defeating the guards you encounter. There have been a number of Java ME mobile games developed by Gameloft, some based on older PC or console titles with 2D graphics and others loosely based on contemporary games but with 2D graphics and different gameplay due to technology constraints. Gameloft has also developed some ports for both the iPhone and the iPad. The first spin-off by Gameloft was called Prince of Persia:Harem Adventures which was released for JavaME in 2003. Specifically, the company has developed HD remakes of the original Prince of Persia in 2007, and its sequel The Shadow and the Flame in July 2013. Prince of Persia: Escape In 2018, Ubisoft under the banner of its entity Ketchapp released Prince of Persia: Escape, a mobile game for iOS and Android. It is a \\"runner\\" game, made up of different levels, and the player can customize the protagonist with outfits from past games. Reviewing for Pocket Gamer, Cameron Bald calls Prince of Persia: Escape a \\"mundane game crushed under the weight of excessive greed\\". =Future= In 2012, leaked images from a project entitled Osiris were assumed to be the next Prince of Persia title. Jordan Mechner even commented on his Twitter account that the images were not from a Prince of Persia game. A year later, in 2013, Yannis Mallat, CEO of Ubisoft Montreal, said that the franchise was being \\"paused\\", saying that \\"As soon as we have something to show, we will\\". In the following months, Ubisoft confirmed that they were either planning or considering next- gen entries in multiple franchises, including Prince of Persia. A video uploaded by a Ubisoft Montreal artist in 2012 but only discovered in 2020 showed a gameplay trailer for Prince of Persia Redemption which would have been released for Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. According to Jonathan Cooper, a former Ubisoft animator at the time, said the trailer was a mockup of the planned gameplay for the title created by Khai Nguyen, used to pitch the game concept. The game never developed beyond that point, though the work on the pitch trailer was used to prepare a similar trailer for Assassin's Creed III for Ubisoft. Adaptations =Graphic novel= Jordan Mechner finished writing the story for a graphic novel in 2007. The novel was written by A.B. Sina, and illustrated by Alex Puvilland and LeUyen Pham. It was released by First Second Books in autumn 2008. The story follows two Princes, jumping between the 9th and 13th centuries. Although it belongs to the franchise the plot is not related to any of the game continuities or that of the 2010 film. =Prince of Persia: Before the Sandstorm= Before the Sandstorm is a 2010 one-shot comic book that serves as both a direct prequel and sequel to the feature film and explains the motives and backgrounds of some characters. It was published by Disney press and written by Jordan Mechner with illustrations by Todd McFarlane, Nico Henrichon, David Lopez and Bernard Chang. =Lego Prince of Persia= =Film adaptation= Reception =Awards= The success of the Prince of Persia series resulted in Guinness World Records awarding the series 6 world records in the Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008. These records include First Motion-Capture Animation in a Video Game and Highest Rated Platformer on PS2 and Xbox. =Impact and legacy= South Korean singer-songwriter Kim Kwang-Jin released the song \\"Magic Castle\\", with lyrics inspired from the storyline of the original Prince of Persia. In 1992, Russian author Victor Pelevin wrote a book called A Werewolf Problem in Central Russia and Other Stories, in which there is a short story called \\"Prince of Gosplan\\". The story is greatly influenced by the game; the main hero of the story lives in a mixed reality of real world and video games and identifies himself as Prince of Persia. He tries to understand if his life is real or is he just seeing it on a computer display. The feel of the gameplay in Tomb Raider was intended to evoke that of the original Prince of Persia. Translation The Assassin's Creed series originated out of ideas for a sequel for Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Its critical and financial success led Ubisoft to request Ubisoft Montreal to develop a sequel, aiming for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The Ubisoft Montreal team decided on taking the gameplay from The Sands of Time into an open world approach, taking advantage of the improved processing power to render larger spaces and crowds. Narratively, the team wanted to move away from the Prince being someone next in line for the throne but to have to work for it; combined with research into secret societies led them to focus on the Assassins, heavily borrowing from the novel Alamut. They developed a narrative where the player would control an Assassin that served as a bodyguard for a non-playable Prince, leading them to call this game Prince of Persia: Assassin. The \\"Animus\\" device allowed them to explain certain facets of gameplay, such as accounting when the player fails a mission, in the same way they had done in The Sands of Time.

In practice, because individual real estate assets fall victim to market inefficiencies and are hard to accurately price, property derivative contracts are typically written based on a real estate property index. In turn, the real estate property index attempts to aggregate real estate market information to provide a more accurate representation of underlying real estate asset performance. Trading or taking positions in property derivatives is also known as synthetic real estate. Property derivatives usually take the form of a total return swap, forward contract, futures, or can adopt a funded format where the property derivative is embedded into a bond or note structure. Under the total return swap or forward contract the parties will usually take contrary positions on the price movements of a property index. See Exotic derivative. The only index used for writing property derivative contracts in the UK are the various property indices published by the Investment Property Databank (IPD) now owned by MSCI. The IPD Annual Index covers approximately 12,000 directly held UK property investments, market revalued in December 2015 at just under ¬£202 billion equivalent to 49% of the UK investment market. IPD indices have also been used in a number of other countries such as Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Switzerland as the basis for commercial property derivatives. In the United States commercial property utilizes the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF) property index the NPI. There are two main residential real estate indices in the United States which trade - Radar Logic's RPX, and the main index - S&P;/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices (see Case-Shiller index). Uses  Property derivatives provide the investor with the ability to: *Gain or reduce exposure to the property market. *Hedge a current position in the physical assets. *Change the composition of a portfolio quickly, i.e., switch out of Retail property and into Industrial. *Speculate on the property market All of these objectives can be achieved without having to transact in physical property; synthetic real estate. Defining property market performance To create a derivative there needs to be a point of reference for the performance of the market against which the derivative contracts are priced. In the case of property derivatives, this reference is provided by the Investment Property Databank index in the United Kingdom, and NCREIF, S&P;/Case-Shiller and Rexx in the United States. The IPD Index Property Index provide a number of indices which relate to performance of commercial property. There are many indices reflecting sectors and sub- sectors of the commercial property market. To date, much of the interest in property derivatives relates to the UK market and its sub-sectors. Types  There are three main types of property derivative in use in the UK property market: Property Index Notes(PINs), Total Return Swap (TRS), and Forwards which incorporates the IPD Property Index Futures listed on Eurex. In the United States property derivative trading is primarily through forwards and future contracts. Forwards agreements are made generally on the RPX and NCREIF indices. Futures trading is done by the CME Group via Globex utilizing the S&P;/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices. =Property index notes= The PINs are essentially bonds. The cash flows of these bonds are structured in a way that is meant to be similar to a transaction in the physical property. This means that the PIN pays the capital return on redemption of the bond and it pays a quarterly coupon to investors. In this way, the seller of the PIN pays the IPD annual index capital growth at redemption and the income return, paid quarterly (IPD) or monthly (FTSE), to the counter party. This means that the counter party is, therefore, receiving the total return of the UK commercial property market, just as they would with a physical transaction in property. =Total return swaps= A property total return swap is simply an exchange of cash flows. Here, the total return on property, as measured by the change in the relevant IPD or FTSE UK Commercial Property Index, is exchanged for the return on cash. The UK IPD pricing mechanism was simplified on 15 January 2007. Rather than quoting libor +/- a spread, now it‚Äôs a fixed percentage. So take the Dec 2008 contract for example if it has a mid of -11.5%. This means that if you ‚Äòbuy‚Äô the swap, you pay -11.5% (so receive 11.5% due to the -ve sign) to your counterparty and receive the performance of IPD. (Or pay it out if it‚Äôs a negative number.) No quarterly cashflows, simply one annual interest payment versus one annual property payment. =Forwards/futures= A property forward contract is based upon the property returns in any annual period - the expected total return for example is agreed at trade, and on maturity the difference between the realized total return and the traded price is exchanged. Forward agreements are over the counter requiring a counter party to be found. Risk of default of either party must be considered in the trade Mathers, W.(2010) Synthetic Real Estate Investment for the Small Investor, Charleston The CME Group has been trading in real estate futures since mid-2006. All trading is done electronically through the exchange who is the default counter party in all trades. Since February 2009 Eurex, the international derivatives exchange, has listed Property Index Futures. The Future Contract is based upon the IPD UK Annual All Property Index Total Returns - the exchange lists five consecutive annual contracts with pricing based upon a par value of 100 + Expected percentage Total Annual Return in the related calendar year. The contract for the calendar year 2009, which expired in March 2010 (expiry is the last working day in the following March to ensure this is after publication of the IPD data) settled at 103.50, representing a +3.5% annual total return (as published by IPD). Though a nascent market, in 2010 a total of 3,304 contracts traded according to the Eurex website - representing ¬£165m in notional property value. ISDA 2007 property index derivatives definitions On Friday 4 May 2007 the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) released the 2007 Property Index Derivatives Definitions. The definitions set out various market standard definitions which can be used in property derivatives transactions together with a standard form total return swap template and forward transaction template It is hoped that standardised documentation will kick start the market.

ACVRL1 is a receptor in the TGF beta signaling pathway. It is also known as activin receptor-like kinase 1, or ALK1.  Function  This gene encodes a type I cell-surface receptor for the TGF-beta superfamily of ligands. It shares with other type I receptors a high degree of similarity in serine-threonine kinase subdomains, a glycine- and serine-rich region (called the GS domain) preceding the kinase domain, and a short C-terminal tail. The encoded protein, sometimes termed ALK1, shares similar domain structures with other closely related ALK or activin receptor-like kinase proteins that form a subfamily of receptor serine/threonine kinases.

According to one theory, it originates at the confluence of the Black () Przemsza and White (Bia≈Ça) Przemsza, between the cities of Mys≈Çowice and Jaworzno. For about it flows southwards to its Vistula mouth at Czarnuchowice (a district of Bierun). Another theory stipulates that it has the length of 88 kilometers, and begins at the source of the Black Przemsza. It is one of the most polluted rivers of Poland. It carries industrial waste from Upper Silesian and Zag≈Çƒôbie DƒÖbrowskie Coal Basin, and its water is regarded as dead. Furthermore, due to high level of pollution, the Przemsza does not freeze in winter. Among cities located along the Przemsza are DƒÖbrowa G√≥rnicza, Mys≈Çowice, Jaworzno, Che≈Çmek, and Jezor, a district of Sosnowiec. The Przemsza has been used for water transport since mid-18th century. By mid-19th century, it emerged as one of the most important waterways of the region. Special kind of flat-bottomed, large rowboats, called galar, was used for transport of goods along the Przemsza to the Vistula. One galar took up to 70 tons of coal or stone from quarries at Jelen or Dzieckowice. In June 1926, Piast Mine from Lƒôdziny began mass water transport of its coal, using a specially constructed port, located at the village of Chelm Maly. Other mines followed Piast, opening their own loading facilities. By 1937, there were eight such facilities along the Przemsza. Government of the Second Polish Republic had far-reaching plans about the river. A river port at Niwka (a district of Sosnowiec) was to be built, a canal Mys≈Çowice - Spytkowice - Krak√≥w, and a waterway to the Baltic Sea. The outbreak of World War Two terminated these plans Since the 12th century, the river formed eastern border of the Silesian Duchy of Racib√≥rz with Lesser Poland. From 1846 until 1918, on the so-called Three Emperors' Corner, at the confluence of Black and White Przemsza marked the tripoint of Kingdom of Prussia, Austrian Empire and Russian Empire. Nowadays the lower Przemsza forms the border between Silesian Voivodeship in the west and Lesser Poland Voivodeship in the east.  White and Black Przemsza  The White Przemsza is 63.9 kilometers long, and begins in a bog near Wolbrom. It flows towards the southwest, in a wide valley. The Upper White Przemsza has very clean water, which changes in the village of Klucze. Among others, the White Przemsza flows through the B≈Çƒôd√≥w Desert. The Black Przemsza is 64.2 kilometers long, and its source is in Bzow, which is a district of Zawiercie since 1977. In its upper course, the water of the river is very clean, but its quality gets worse in Przeczyce, where a reservoir was built in 1963. Both rivers were named after the color of the water. In the past, the Black Przemsza‚Äôs bed near Bedzin was made of shallow deposits of coal. At the same time the White Przemsza flowed through limestone hills in the area of Olkusz, so its bottom was white.

It is on the B5445 road, to the south west of Chester and on the border with Wales. The civil parish, which included the hamlet of Cuckoo's Nest, was abolished in 2015 to form Poulton and Pulford. According to the 2001 census, the population of the entire parish was 395, increasing to 580 at the 2011 census. History It is believed that the name of the village is either derived from the Welsh words Pwll \\"a pool or marsh\\" and Ffordd \\"a crossing\\", or the Old English words pul and ford with the same meaning. The settlement was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, consisting of seven households across two separate landowners: Hugh FitzOsbern and St Weburgh Abbey, in Chester. Pulford was previously a parish within Broxton Hundred, becoming a civil parish in 1866. The population was recorded over time at 170 in 1801, 204 in 1851, 305 in 1901, 285 in 1951 and increasing to 395 by 2001. Landmarks St Mary's Church Pulford Castle, which no longer stands, was a small Norman motte-and-bailey defensive structure. Today, only the mound of the castle remains, just behind the church of St Mary, on the outskirts of the village. The castle remnants were designated a scheduled monument in 1952. The castle was built at a strategic location, protecting a road at a river crossing. Although no firm date of construction is recorded, it is believed to have been built around 1100. The castle is mentioned as having a garrison stationed at it, during the revolt of Owain Glynd≈µr in 1403. Pulford Parish Church is named after St. Mary and is designated a Grade II* listed building. It was rebuilt in 1884 to a design by the architect John Douglas, the benefactor being Hugh Lupus Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster. Mention of a church on the site can be traced back the 12th century and the first rector is mentioned in ancient records as one Hugo. The church's spire is 120 feet high. In the 1980s a fire completely destroyed the roof of the church tower, which was later restored. The village is home to a large hotel, the Grosvenor Pulford Hotel. Grosvenor is the family name of the Duke of Westminster whose seat is at nearby Eaton Hall.

It consists of a layer of strips of soft aluminum, with a polyethylene closed-cell foam coating. The SAM Splint was invented by Dr. Sam Scheinberg who, as a trauma surgeon during the Vietnam War, found that field medics generally ignored the splint they were issued by the Army. He developed the idea while playing with a foil chewing gum wrapper. The device is often found in First Aid Kits, Emergency Medical Technician \\"jump kits,\\" ambulances, and other similar settings. Generally supplied in a roll or as a flat strip up to long and wide, it can be unrolled or unfolded and formed to the shape of the injured person's body. Once folded into a curve, it becomes quite rigid and capable of immobilizing a number of different wounds, including the leg, forearm or humerus. Folded properly, it can also be used to stabilize the cervical spine. It can be easily cut with any scissors or shears, to make smaller devices such as finger splints. The SAM Splint is radiolucent meaning it does not interfere with X-Rays. They are used on board the International Space Station as a light weight compact splint, for this reason the acronym SAM is often said to refer to ‚ÄúSpace Aviation Medicine‚Äù. After use, the SAM Splint can be cleaned, rerolled, and reused. Additional sizes include length, length, by finger splint, and extra large width by length.

The community, located less than one half-mile from George Bush Intercontinental Airport, has about 80% of its territory in the City of Houston and the rest in an unincorporated area.Zuniga, Jo Ann. \\"Divided Bordersville unified over annexation.\\" Houston Chronicle. Monday September 21, 1998. A13 MetFront. History Bordersville was established in an unincorporated section of Harris County, Texas in 1927 after the closing of a sawmill in the nearby city of Humble. African-Americans formerly employed at the mill were forced to leave. A man named Edgar Borders opened a mill close in proximity to the closed sawmill and employed some of the former Humble sawmill workers. Borders created wooden shacks to house workers. In 1940, Bordersville contained 100 residents. Bordersville, served by the Aldine Independent School District, was five miles from the closest public schools. Bordersville was around thirty- five miles from Ben Taub Hospital, grocery stores, and libraries. Borders closed the mill in 1941. During the same year, he rented and sold the land within Bordersville to its residents. Borders died in 1963. Most Bordersville citizens did not own their land. No individuals forced the Bordersville residents out of their homes. Throughout the 1960s, A. W. Jones and other residents founded a civic club which became the Bordersville Neighborhood Council. Many citizens became members of the Houston Junior Chambers of Commerce. Some citizens created a water well, and others painted area houses. The City of Houston annexed about 80% of Bordersville in 1965.Sallee, Rad. \\"Future arrives at Bordersville/31 years after annexation, poor area gets city's attention.\\" Houston Chronicle. Sunday December 29, 1996. A37. During that year, the basic housing and the lack of paved streets, running water, and sewers convinced some Houstonians that Bordersville had the most severe poverty in the city limits. Residents paid city taxes and did not receive city utilities. Jerry Wood, executive assistant in the Planning and Development Department of the City of Houston, said in a 1998 Houston Chronicle article that the city followed easily tracked survey lines when it adopted the annexation plan of 1965 and that it did not intentionally exclude any part of Bordersville. The city of Houston stated that Bordersville was \\"the worst pocket of poverty in the city.\\"\\"Bordersville . Lone Star College‚ÄìKingwood. Retrieved on November 5, 2008. The Three H Service Center, referring to Houston, Humble, and Harris County, opened in 1974. The center, serving people living within a twenty-mile radius, opened partly due to a $196,000 United States dollar grant from the United States Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration. Architect John Zemanek designed the facility, consisting of nine low-rise buildings. The Three H Service Center received funding from Houston and federal agencies and local churches. With a volunteer staff, the center established various services, including day care, tutoring, a health clinic, public bathing facilities for homeless, a senior citizen center, literacy classes, youth and elderly employment, and summer recreational activities.\\"Boyer, Teri.

Residents earned annual incomes averaging to between $2,500 and $3,500 United States dollars. Fire trucks of the Houston Fire Department delivered water for bathing, cooking, and drinking on a twice-weekly basis during 1975. Water service lines opened in 1981. In the 1980s, the Three H Service Center collaborated in an organization of funding to install sink, bathtub, and toilet facilities in Bordersville residences. In 1985, 700 citizens lived in 120 residences in Bordersville. By 1985 cooking and heating fires had ruined many of the original Bordersville homes. Maps in the 1980s revealed four churches in the Bordersville area. During the same year, most residents cooked food on wood stoves and with outdoor appliances. The community lacked public transportation access; this increased unemployment. Social Security was the main source of income for the community, which had a disproportionate population of very young and very elderly residents. In 1985 some residents still used outhouses and some residents did not have bathtubs, sinks, and toilets in their residences.Fisher, Robert. \\"Urban Policy in Houston, Texas.\\" Urban Studies, 1989. 150. Retrieved on February 24, 2010. In 1996 Thomas Phillips, a retired longshoreman and Bordersville resident, joined with representatives of Kingwood and sued the City of Houston in a federal court, arguing that the city could not legally annex areas if it did not provide certain services to some of its existing areas, including Bordersville. In 1998 Phillips advocated for the annexation of Humble Heights, an area around Carver Avenue, Dunbar Avenue, and Granger Street, into Houston; if the residents are annexed they would use the city sewer system instead of septic tanks.

Early life John Drury Stith was born in Kirkham in Lancashire, England in 1625. Stith ancestors were likely from the Kirkham area. Colonial America Stith, the first person in colony of Virginia with that surname, received a land grant in 1652 with Samuel Eale for 500 acres in Charles City County, Virginia, where he settled. He also received 500 acres of land in 1663. He was a merchant, an attorney, and a justice of the peace, and served in the militia as a lieutenant (1656), a captain (1676), and a major (1680). In 1676, he participated with Nathaniel Bacon during Bacon's Rebellion. Stith was a supporter of Sir William Berkeley. In 1691, Stith was the high sheriff of Charles City County. Marriage and children In 1657, Stith married Jane Mosby, the widow of Thomas Gregory and Joseph Parsons, and had five children according to his will: * John Stith married Mary Randolph, the daughter of William Randolph, and had three children: William, John, and Mary. * Drury Stith married Susannah Bathurst and had at least two children.

The album title is in Turkish and means \\"Italian (man) found out to be a Greek spy\\". This phrase appeared in a Turkish newspaper after Massimo Rana, an Italian photographer, who was believed to be a spy, was arrested in 1991 by the Turkish-Cypriot police. It is considered one of the band's finest works by audiences and reviewers alike.  Songs  As with other albums by the band, ƒ∞talyan, rum casusu √ßikti features a number of samples, quotes and references to other people's songs and genres, as well as the band's usual mix of serious and comedy-oriented lyrics. *\\"Rum casusu\\" features a sample of Ferruccio Amendola dubbing Sylvester Stallone in Rocky V and telling a joke. *The backing track to \\"Servi della gleba?\\" is \\"Pilentse Pee\\", the opening track on the 1975 album Le Myst√®re des Voix Bulgares by the same-named Bulgarian female choir who are also featured on \\"Pipppero\\". The question mark in the title is a possible reference to \\"In the Flesh?\\" by Pink Floyd. *\\"Servi della gleba\\" (in English \\"Servants of the glebe\\"), an ironical song about eternally rejected male wannabe-romancers (represented by the two of spades, an Italian symbol for a rejection), quotes the drum groove from \\"Rosanna\\" by Toto, and one line from singer-songwriter Stefano Rosso's deliberately controversial 1977 hit \\"Una storia disonesta/Anche se fosse peggio\\". *\\"Uomini col borsello\\" (literally, \\"Men with purses\\"), whose lyrics, according to the band's website, are based on an Iberian legend from the 17th century, is a song about sexual frustration, depicting men and women as being respectively equipped with locked purses and purse keys. The Chieftains and Riccardo Fogli, in the main role of a lonesome man, guest on the track. It includes references to \\"Toffee\\" by Vasco Rossi, \\"Let It Be\\" by The Beatles, Fogli's own fake Italian-English recitation in his original recording of \\"Piccola Katy\\" (1968) as a member of Pooh and, in the second half of the solo, \\"I Want It All\\" by Queen. *\\"Il vitello dai piedi di balsa\\" (\\"The balsa wood- footed lamb\\") quotes Paul McCartney's piano intro from The Beatles' \\"Golden Slumbers\\", two piano notes from \\"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\\" by Queen, \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" by Procol Harum and a short pedal steel guitar passage from Pink Floyd's \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\". Lyrically, the song is a twisted fairytale with dark overtones, featuring four lambs with feet of different materials, balsa wood, cobalt, sponge and tuna, happily living \\"in the small wood of [Elio's] fantasy\\". The titular lamb meets his cobalt-footed counterpart (played by guest Enrico Ruggeri) and makes himself guilty of spreading false rumours about the latter's true identity. As a result of this, he gets his feet amputated and he is forced to listen to an excerpt from a Sri Lankan traditional song, featured on the band's previous maxi single The Los Sri Lanka Parakramabahu Brothers Featuring Elio e le Storie Tese. At the end, he meets an openly gay teddy bear, who sodomizes him. *\\"Cartoni animati giapponesi\\" (in English \\"Japanese manga animated cartoons\\") is about pornography and porn in general, used, again, as a way to disguise a young man's insecurities about sex. The titular animated cartoons are alluded to only in a short verse in the middle of the song, through comically mispronounced titles by the band's guest keyboardist Vittorio Cosma. A sample from Marco Masini is also featured; the singer's voice was electronically edited so he appears to sing the word \\"sperm\\". The song's mildly explicit lyrics are not included in the booklet, which instead features a lengthy and partly jocular explanation for the missing lyrics. *\\"Cinquecento\\", sung by guitarist Davide Civaschi (as Ces√†reo), is a parody of a song produced by Gino Paoli for a Fiat Cinquecento advertisement, while at the same time poking fun at corruption practices in Italian politics. *\\"Supergiovane\\" (in English \\"Superyoung\\") is about an imaginary superhero, played by guest vocalist Luca Mangoni, who acts as a spokesman for the younger generation, but whose speech mannerisms, all derived from very outdated 1970s youth culture slang, actually identify him as middle-aged or downright old: in an oddly reversed version of the Nadsat language from Anthony Burgess's 1962 novel A Clockwork Orange, the book's protagonist seems timelessly young, while \\"Supergiovane\\" sounds timelessly and hopelessly old. He is derided by an older man (played by Diego Abatantuono) because of this. A very complex prog rock song with several time signature changes, \\"Supergiovane\\" does not feature any external musical references or samples, apart from a brief allusion to Maurice Ravel's Bol√©ro. *\\"Essere donna oggi\\" (in English \\"Being a woman today\\") is about a woman's pains over menstruation, which lead her to a selfish attitude and to ignore her partner (played by Elio). All of this is seen from the latter's perspective, creating an ironical clash. The lyrics allude to Loretta Goggi, to her 1981 hit \\"Maledetta Primavera\\", whose lyrics use spring as a mildly erotic metaphor for a woman's sexual disillusionment) and to her very early acting performance in the 1969 Middle Ages-themed TV series La freccia nera, where she mostly appeared in a male disguise. The final guitar solo in the song, although apparently modelled on Frank Zappa's \\"Any Downers?\\", was actually a one-take improvisation by guitarist Ces√†reo. *With its title parodying the late 1970s American sitcom Mork & Mindy, \\"Pork & Cindy\\" is the bitterly funny story of a failed romance between a woman and a man, which is doomed from the very start as she is a prostitute and he is her pimp. The song includes a short recap of John Bonham's drum solo in Led Zeppelin's \\"Moby Dick\\", and its melody is very similar to \\"C'√®\\" by Stadio. *\\"Pipppero\\" is a parody of an instructional dance song from Bulgaria that also aims at emphasising the cultural richness of the country. It is freely based on the female choir from Le Myst√®re des Voix Bulgares's song \\"Dilmano Dilbero\\" (in Bulgarian \\"–î–∏–ª–º–∞–Ω–æ, –î–∏–ª–±–µ—Ä–æ\\", translated as \\"My beautiful Dilmano\\"), which uses banana pepper (\\"pipero\\" in Bulgarian) as a metaphor for sex, and is featured on the choir's fourth album, entitled Volume 4. While listening to the album, Elio misinterpreted the song's recurring chant as \\"Pi√π umano, pi√π vero\\" (\\"More human, more truthful\\"), and built the entire lyric from that. Lyrically, the song features references to Bulgarian secret agents in connection with Pope John Paul II assassination attempt and, in the ending, a long list of disco classics from the 1970s. On a musical level, the song features the bassline from \\"Piranha\\", the B-side from Afric Simone's 1975 disco hit \\"Ramaya\\", which is also briefly sampled. Other featured samples include \\"A ba-ba-ba\\" from The Beach Boys' 1965 rendition of \\"Barbara Ann\\" and the drum machine beat from \\"The Power\\" by Snap!, while the main melody sung by Elio is very similar to the recurring riff in The Beatles' \\"I Feel Fine\\". During live performances, drummer Christian Meyer, by playing live drums over the drum machine rhythm, occasionally turned the song's groove into something similar, again, to Toto's \\"Rosanna\\". Furthermore, during the first live performances the song was followed by a medley of very short excerpts from all of the 1970s songs mentioned in the lyrics. According to later testimonies by fans, the band quickly stopped performing the medley when they realized that their mostly young audience did not understand any of the musical references. *\\"Il vitello dai piedi di balsa (reprise)\\" continues and finishes the dark fairytale in track 6. After his encounter with the gay bear, the balsa-footed lamb is fully outed as being gay himself, and happily accepts his orientation. *\\"Urna\\" (English: \\"Urn\\") is about death. Specifically, the song is about the singer's bluntly stated desire to be cremated and placed in an urn as soon as he dies. This is, however, offset by Elio's thrash metal arrangement, a complete change from the jazz fusion setting originally intended for the song by its main composer, bassist Nicola Fasani (a.k.a. Faso). In a later interview, Fasani stated that he hated the metal arrangement with a passion, referring to the released version as \\"pure shit\\". The original recording, with Fasani's preferred arrangement, was featured in the band's 1998 compilation Peerla. *\\"Arrivederci\\" is a short parody of the slow ballads typically used as end credits tunes for 1970s Italian variety shows such as Domenica in and features the band saying goodbye to the audience. *Taking its cue from an old Italian stereotypical joke about an Italian, a Frenchman and an Englishman having to deal with a fake ghost, \\"La vendetta del fantasma Formaggino\\" (English: \\"The revenge of the Mini-Cheese Ghost\\") spins a tale of an unnamed narrator getting lost in \\"Jokeland\\", where all popular jokes are set, meeting the three characters from the joke and involving them in another similar and stereotypical joke. Later on, he decides to take revenge on the Italian character in the original joke by getting himself involved in the joke and masquerading as the ghost. The Italian man is about to defeat the narrator again in the same way as the joke, but the latter is chastised for changing the original ending by the Supreme God of Jokes (played by Diego Abatantuono in his second guest appearance on the album), who incinerates him by blowing a rapsberry. The song features six very different sections in different tempos and a long series of musical/lyrical quotations: \\"Come te non c'√® nessuno\\" by Rita Pavone, \\"Andavo a cento all'ora\\" and \\"Un mondo d'amore\\" by Gianni Morandi, a bass guitar exercise by Jaco Pastorius, \\"Nessuno mai\\" by Marcella Bella, a sample from \\"Sei bellissima\\" by Loredana Bert√®, seven notes from the Italian National Anthem \\"Fratelli d'Italia\\", two full verses and the chorus from \\"This Jesus Must Die\\" from Jesus Christ Superstar and, finally, a slightly distorted and imprecise quote from the Neapolitan song \\"I' te vurria vas√†\\". *Following about one minute of silence after the conclusion of the last track, the album ends with a ghost track: an extremely sped-up (about 6.5x) and electronically reversed version of \\"Introservi\\", a ballad-like intro to \\"Servi della gleba\\". This song would later be re-recorded by the band for their 1997 compilation Del meglio del nostro meglio Vol. 1.

In the film, three spies masquerade themselves as a cow in order to spy on a military installation, but the film itself shows a real cow wearing wellies on its legs; the album, instead, features a plainly fake legless cow, made out of cardboard, with a pair of real human feet and legs emerging from it. The limbs were originally meant to be Elio's, but Koban refused to use them as they were very hairy; his choice went instead to Giancarlo Bozzo, founder and co-owner of Milan's stand-up comedy club Zelig, where the band had its debut. Later on, Bozzo's feet were digitally replaced with Faso's.

He was a faculty member at the Stanford University School of Medicine. Early life Born in Detroit and raised in Manhattan, Osborn was the son of Major General Frederick Osborn, a military officer who helped to develop the G.I. Bill. He was a descendant of John Jay and Cornelius Vanderbilt. He earned a biology degree from Princeton University and then graduated from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Osborn entered the U.S. Army as a medical officer during World War II. Before he left for the army, he had submitted a paper for publication based on a study he had conducted with dogs, showing that the dogs could survive deep hypothermia. Osborn received a letter from eminent cardiac surgeon Alfred Blalock asking for some revisions on his paper, but by this time Osborn was lying in a tent in the Philippines during a downpour, so he could not complete work on the paper. After two years with the U.S. Army, he completed a residency at New York University School of Medicine, where he developed an interest in understanding blood oxygenation. Career In 1954, Osborn moved westward to work at Stanford University Medical School; one source described him as \\"[s]eeking refuge from the blueblood New York aristocracy into which he was born.\\" In California, Osborn collaborated with cardiac surgeon Frank Gerbode on the development of a heart-lung bypass machine that would allow open-heart surgery. Gerbode and Osborn's first open-heart surgery using CPB (a repair of a ventricular septal defect) was completed in 1956. In 1958, when physicians were still skeptical of open-heart surgery and CPB, Osborn and Gerbode arranged to have a heart surgery televised before a Bay Area audience of 1.2 million people. The patient, an eight-year-old boy known only as Tommy, had been born with a hole in his heart. Osborn became a specialist in intensive care medicine, and he became interested in the postoperative care of cardiac surgery patient. He was a member of the Society of Critical Care Medicine when the group was founded. The Osborn wave, a unique finding on the EKG tracings of hypothermic patients, is named for him. Personal life In 1944, Osborn married his first wife, Anne, who died in 2004. The couple enjoyed sailing a 36-foot brigantine out of the San Francisco Yacht Club. They were the parents of seven children, including John Jay Osborn Jr., an author and lawyer. After Anne's death, Osborn married his second wife, Sheret. Osborn died in 2014 after he fell and broke his hip.

Family Francis Willoughby was the younger son of Sir Henry Willoughby (slain 27 August 1549 during Kett's Rebellion) of Wollaton, Nottinghamshire, and Anne Grey (d.1548),De Lisle states that she predeceased her husband by 18 months. the daughter of Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset, by Margaret Wotton. He had an elder brother, Thomas (d.1559) and a sister, Margaret, who married Sir Matthew Arundell (c. 1533 ‚Äì 24 December 1598) of Wardour Castle.; ; Career Portrait of Elizabeth Littleton, Lady Willoughby by George Gower (1573) Francis Willoughby's father, Sir Henry Willoughby, had inherited Wollaton and other properties including 'lucrative coal pits' at the death of his uncle, Sir John Willoughby, on 10 January 1549. However, only a few months later, on 27 August 1549, Sir Henry Willoughby was slain on Mousehold Heath in the suppression of Kett's rebellion. Francis's elder brother, Thomas (d.1559), then aged eight, became the ward of their mother's brother, Henry Grey, 3rd Marquess of Dorset, and came to live with Dorset and his wife, Frances Brandon, at Bradgate House, while Francis, then aged two, and his sister, Margaret, were put in the care of Dorset's half-brother, George Medley, the son of Dorset's mother, Margaret Wotton, by her first husband, William Medley. Dorset's ill-fated attempt to place his eldest daughter, Lady Jane Grey, on the throne eventually cost Lady Jane, Dorset, and Dorset's brother, Lord Thomas Grey, their heads, and brought other family members under suspicion. George Medley was arrested, and imprisoned in the Tower for a time, and when he was released in May 1554 was unable any longer to care for Francis and Margaret. Dorset's widow, Frances Brandon, arranged for Francis to be sent to school, and took Margaret under her care. Their elder brother, Thomas, became the ward of Sir William Paget, and was married to Paget's daughter, Dorothy.; ; . In August 1559 Thomas Willoughby died from 'overheating' while out hunting, leaving no issue, and Francis inherited the family estates. At the age of seventeen, Francis married Elizabeth Littleton of Frankley, Worcestershire. This proved to be a turbulent marriage, and produced only daughters.An Account of an Elizabethan Family: The Willoughbys of Wollaton by Cassandra Willoughby (1670‚Äî1735). Edited by Jo Ann Hoeppner Moran Cruz; Volume 55 - December 2018, Royal Historical Society Camden Fifth Series. Accessed August 2020. Willoughby developed coal mines on his estate at Wollaton in the 1560s and 1570s. This enabled him to maintain a lordly lifestyle, maintaining a number of gentleman retainers. He employed Robert Smythson, who had previously worked at Longleat to build him a mansion, Wollaton Hall. By 1580, when his heir died aged six, he was separated from his wife. She offered to try for another heir, they remained separated and the queen arranged for her to have an allowance of ¬£200 per year. He then decided to make his distant relative Percival Willoughby of Bore Place in Kent his principal heir, if he had no son, through marriage to his eldest daughter Bridget. This marriage took place in 1583, and several manors including Wollaton and Middleton, Warwickshire were settled on them in default of male issue. Willoughby entered into a number of speculative ventures, including growing and processing woad at Wollaton, and a plantation in Ireland. In these he worked with the projector, Robert Payne. These took capital, as did his ironworks, at Middleton, Oakamoor (Staffordshire), and Codnor. The latter was his in consequence of the debts of Sir John Zouche. These were profitable, but Willoughby was unable to pay his debts as well as providing dowries for his other daughters. He accordingly handed them over in 1595 to Percival, who took responsibility for ¬£3000 of the debts. This was followed by the death of his wife, with whom he had been reconciled. Willoughby immediately married a widow, but died only fifteen months later, leaving his widow expecting another child, who turned out to be another daughter. Percival thus inherited the estate, but encumbered with many debts.

Plot  There are two sets of campers on California's Sierra Madre Mountain. One group is the Blue Legion, a gun-happy squad of teenaged boys under the command of tyrannical survivalist Jake Cannon (Mark Rolston). The other bunch, Survival Quest, is a sort of backpacking self-help group led by humane mountain man Hank Chambers (Lance Henriksen). The beneficiaries of Hank's wisdom include smart-aleck Joey (Paul Provenza), fragile divorcee Cheryl (Catherine Keener), and alienated convict Gray (Dermot Mulroney). Through various exercises and object lessons beneath the sheltering pines, firm-but- gentle Hank teaches this crew to work together. Meanwhile, Jake has made harassment of the Survival Questers part of his curriculum. When a viciously ill-mannered Blue Legion member named Raider (Steve Antin) ends up shooting Hank, this breach of discipline annoys Jake to no end. While Jake was harassing the Survival Questers, Jake actually wanted no one to get shot. Jake starts beating Raider up, and Raider responds by stabbing Jake and blaming it on the Survival Questers. Now led by Raider, the Blue Legion aims to kill the rival campers. Cheryl is now in charge of the Survival Quest gang, because they think Hank is dead. They hang together and race over the river and through the woods to get to the nearest airstrip. There, Gray tricks Raider into getting close to a flammable fuel tank, then Gray uses a shotgun to blast the tank, causing an explosion that kills Raider. As the smoke from this rises on the breeze, an airplane appears. On board is Hank, who managed to overcome his wound and signal for help after he tried to help Jake, who has died.

The property is located in Logan Canyon, Utah. Pine Glenn Cove is the largest private retreat in Cache National Forest and Logan Canyon, and the only one with a swimming pool. It has a long, rich history. Started by a wealthy businessman in the early 1910s, it was later expanded by his descendants. It was most famously owned by the Catholic Church in the later half of the 20th century and used as a spiritual retreat for nuns. Much folklore surrounds the camp, citing tales of pregnant nuns, infanticide, satanic worship, and hell- hounds. The camp made it on national headlines in October 1997 when 2 different groups of teenagers (one group of 8 and one group of 30 later in the night) were herded into the empty swimming pool, tied up, and harassed by three shotgun wielding watchmen. Hatch's Camp was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 27, 2006. The camp is privately owned and in a restoration process to be opened up to the public at a future date. St. Ann's Retreat is allegedly haunted and it was featured on an episode of Travel Channel's Ghost Adventures. History The site was originally developed in 1910 by Hezekiah Eastman Hatch (1855-1928), a prominent Logan, Utah businessman who built the first cabin there between 1915 and 1918. He built the cabin for his wife Georgia Thatcher Hatch, who enjoyed the cabin in her later years. After her death in 1919, their son Lorenzo Boyd Hatch took over the camp. His brother-in-law Floyd B. Odlum and he expanded the camp. They were self-made millionaires, owners and investors of many prominent businesses. They expanded the site and eventually the summer camp became a summer retreat, not only for the Hatches and Odlums, but for numerous friends and family. The Retreat and its owners hosted many famous people from Hollywood movie stars to government leaders and business heads. Guests included those with local ties as well as business associates, socialites, and other elites the Hatches and the Odlums knew through their ties to New York City and Hollywood. In the 1950s, the camp was donated to the Roman Catholic Diocese by the Hatch family. It was originally offered to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and then Utah State University, but neither of them were interested in the property. It was renamed St. Ann's retreat by the Church, and it was used as a vacation spot for nuns from Sisters of the Holy Cross and the Benedictines in Salt Lake City. In the 1980s, it became a youth summer camp for the Boys' Club of Weber and Salt Lake Central City Community Center. It was sold for private ownership in the 1993. Hatch's Camp was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 27, 2006.  Location  The camp is located 8.3 miles up Logan Canyon, Cache County, Utah, 10 miles from the city of Logan. The land is on the grounds of Cache National Forest.  Amenities  The vacation compound includes 21 buildings and structures, including two main lodges, six smaller cabins, a playhouse, a pool house and generator house, along with a fireplace, fire pit, fountain, bridge and swimming pool. At one time, it also was home to a small theater with an adjoining ticket booth. There was originally a horse stable, but it was demolished. Pine Glenn Cove is one of the largest private camps in Logan Canyon and the only one with a swimming pool. Folklore Much folklore surrounds the camp, often citing that the retreat is haunted. While there is no record to support the claims, legend says nuns were sent there after becoming pregnant by monks or priests and would drown their babies in the swimming pool where you couldn't hear them cry. A more specific legend included a nun who drowned her baby to keep it a secret and then committed suicide. Children's voices and an apparition of a woman dressed in black have reportedly been observed. Other subjects of legend include satanic worship and hell-hounds. \\"Legend-tripping\\", which involves traveling to a supernatural location in order to determine whether the stories are true, has caused many young people to enter the camp at night. On October 10, 1997, a group of 8 teenagers illegally entered the camp and were surprised by three armed watchmen. The watchmen herded them into the lodge, handcuffed them, and tied their necks together with ropes. The teenagers were released when police arrived. Later that night, however, a larger group of 30 teenagers, unaware of what had happened earlier, trespassed into the camp and were greeted by the same watchmen. They were all forced into the empty swimming pool, had their necks bound by ropes and their hands zip tied. The men told them that if they moved and tightened the ropes, an explosive would trigger and they would be killed. Again, police came and released the teenagers. In both instances, the men called the sheriffs themselves. The police regarded the men as local heroes, which caused a large amount of backlash and initiated a debate about trespassing, the role of law enforcement, and moral values. Eventually, the men were charged with six counts of aggravated assault. The trespassing charges against the teens were dropped, because since the land was technically owned by the Forest Service, the teens were not trespassing. A collection of folkloric stories and first-hand accounts are available at L. Tom Perry Special Collections Library at the Harold B. Lee Library at Brigham Young University. Ownership The land is owned by the Forest Service who rents the camp to private owner Matt Nielsen. The retreat is not open to the public. Nielsen has been working to restore the camp so that it can be opened up to the public in the future. An opening date is undetermined. Due to the folklore surrounding the camp, vandalizing and trespassing have been problems and Nielsen had security cameras installed in order to prevent individuals from further damaging the work-in-progress property. There is a Facebook page with pictures of trespassers asking if anyone can identify them.  Media  St. Ann's Retreat was featured as episode nine of season twelve of Travel Channel's Ghost Adventures hosted by Zak Bagans.

It is assigned to Twenty- Second Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command, stationed at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado. The wing's mission is tactical airlift and airdrop. The wing also has the specialized mission of Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System, as well as an aeromedical evacuation mission, which was added in April 2008. It is assigned to Air Force Reserve Command, headquartered at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia. If it is called to active duty, the wing would become part of Air Mobility Command at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. History =Corollary unit and Korean War mobilization= The May 1949 Air Force Reserve program called for a new type of unit, the Corollary unit, which was a reserve unit integrated with an active duty unit. The plan called for corollary units at 107 locations and was viewed as the best method to train reservists by mixing them with an existing regular unit to perform duties alongside the regular unit.Cantwell, p. 73 The wing was activated at McChord Air Force Base, Washington in June as the 302d Troop Carrier Wing and conducted airlift training as a reserve corollary unit of the 62d Troop Carrier Wing until May 1950, when McChord transferred to Air Defense Command (ADC) and then the wing became a corollary of the 325th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, the new host wing at McChord.Mueller, p. 391 In August 1950, Continental Air Command (ConAC) transferred control of corollary units to the commands training the units and the wing was reassigned to ADC's Western Air Defense Force. The wing, along with all reserve corollary units was mobilized for the Korean war.Cantwell, p. 87 The 302d was mobilized on 1 June 1951. Its personnel were used as fillers for other units,Cantwell, p. 97 and it was inactivated a week later. =Troop carrier operations= The wing was again activated in June 1952 at Clinton County Air Force Base, Ohio, when it replaced the 910th Reserve Training Wing and absorbed the 910th's personnel. The reserve mobilization for the Korean war had left the reserves without aircraft, and the unit did not receive aircraft until July 1952.Cantwell, p. 139 Once it began to receive Curtiss C-46 Commandos, it trained as a reserve troop carrier wing. The 302d began flying airlift operations in the mid-1950s. In the summer of 1956, the wing participated in Operation Sixteen Ton during its two weeks of active duty training. Sixteen Ton was performed entirely by reserve troop carrier units and moved United States Coast Guard equipment From Naval Air Station New York / Floyd Bennett Field to Isla Grande Airport in Puerto Rico and San Salvador in the Bahamas. After the success of this operation, the wing began to use inactive duty training periods for Operation Swift Lift, transporting high priority cargo for the Air Force and Operation Ready Swap, transporting aircraft engines between Air Materiel Command's depots.Cantwell, pp. 149‚Äì150 Training for the wing was supervised by the active duty 2252d Air Reserve Flying Center. In 1958, the 2252d Center was inactivated and some of its personnel were absorbed by the wing. In place of active duty support for reserve units, ConAC adopted the Air Reserve Technician program, in which a cadre of the unit consisted of full-time personnel who were simultaneously civilian employees of the Air Force and also held military rank as members of the reserves.Cantwell, p. 163 In April 1959, the wing reorganized under the Dual Deputy system. Its 302d Troop Carrier Group was inactivated and the 355th and 356th Troop Carrier Squadrons were assigned directly to the wing. =Dispersed squadrons= Starting in late 1955, ConAC began to disperse some of its reserve flying squadrons to separate bases in order to improve recruiting and avoid public objection to entire wings of aircraft being stationed near large population centers under what was called the Detached Squadron Concept.Cantwell, p. 156 Although the wing's 355th and 356th Troop Carrier Squadrons remained with the wing headquarters at Clinton County, when a third squadron, the 357th Troop Carrier Squadron, was activated in 1961 and assigned to the wing, it was stationed at Bates Field, Alabama.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 440‚Äì441Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 442‚Äì443 =Activation of groups under the wing= Although the dispersal of flying units was not a problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing a single flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult. This weakness was demonstrated in the partial mobilization of reserve units during the Berlin Crisis of 1961 To resolve this, at the start of 1962, ConAC determined to reorganize its reserve wings by establishing groups with support elements for each of its troop carrier squadrons. This reorganization would facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed. However, as this plan was entering its implementation phase, another partial mobilization, which included the 302d Wing, occurred for the Cuban Missile Crisis. The formation of troop carrier groups was delayed until February 1963 for wings that had been mobilized.Cantwell, pp. 189‚Äì191 The 906th and 907th Troop Carrier Group at Clinton County, and the 908th Troop Carrier Group at Bates Field were all assigned to the wing on 11 February. =Airlift operations= By the mid-1960s, wing aircraft and crews performed worldwide airlift missions and participated in numerous tactical exercises. MAFFS system From April 1968 to March 1973 the wing provided AC-119 gunship training for pilots, navigators, flight engineers, and mechanics of USAF active units and personnel from Jordan, Morocco, Ethiopia, and South Vietnam. The wing assumed a rotational airlift task in support of USAF Southern Command from April 1973 through January 1976. Also in April 1973, the wing assumed an aerial spraying mission with UC-123 aircraft, which frequently took wing crews to Central America, the Caribbean, the Azores, North Africa, islands of the Pacific, and to many U.S. points for insect-spraying missions. Beginning in April 1985, the wing trained to airlift and airdrop troops, equipment, and supplies in a tactical theater. It took part in training and mobility exercises within the United States and to Britain and Panama. It practiced for aeromedical evacuation missions. During the late 1980s and 1990s, the wing transported fire fighters and their equipment and supplies to fight wildfires in western states, delivered relief supplies to hurricane victims, and participated in other humanitarian airlifts and various global contingency operations. The 302d was most recently activated in support of U.S. Central Command operations in Southwest Asia in 2005‚Äì2006. In the summer of 2008, two C-130 aircraft and aircrews deployed to Southwest Asia. Other units within the 302d have also deployed, including the 302d Security Forces Squadron, which deployed Airmen in the summer of 2008. Later in the spring of 2009, members of the 302d Civil Engineer Squadron deployed as well. Both units were deployed to Kirkuk Regional Air Base, Iraq. In October 2009, the 52d Airlift Squadron stood up as an Active-Associate unit under the 302d Operations Group. The unit, a regular Air Force squadron consisting of Active-Duty Airmen, is assigned to the 19th Airlift Wing at Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas. Personnel are integrated with reserve members to fly and maintain the wing's assigned aircraft. =Fire Fighting Mission= The 302d also provides training, crews, and aircraft in cooperation with the US Forest Service to operate Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System- equipped C-130s to combat wildfires. Two of the unit's C-130H3 are on standby with the Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System installed and have another two empty C-130H3 aircraft are in reserve. It is the only reserve unit that maintains this capability. C-130 preparing to leave on a deployment C-130 at Sather Air Base, Iraq =Notable incidents= On 13 May 1995, aircraft 62-1838, callsign \\"Sumit 38\\", with six people aboard, caught fire approximately 45 miles east of Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, after ferrying firefighters to Gowen Field. The number two engine incorrectly signaled an under temperature reading, causing the flight engineer to enrich the fuel mixture to that engine, leading to an actual over temperature situation. The engine caught fire, and after two attempts by one of the flight crew to quench the fire, the engine reignited causing SUMIT38 to fall 26,000 feet to the ground, killing its six crew members. The six crew members of SUMIT38 were: Lieutenant Colonel Robert \\"Bob\\" Buckout, Aircraft Commander First Lieutenant Lance Dougherty, Pilot Captain Geoff Boyd, Navigator Chief Master Sergeant Jimmie Vail, Flight Engineer Master Sergeant Jay Kemp, Loadmaster Staff Sergeant Michael Lynn Scheideman, Loadmaster A memorial at Peterson AFB, Colorado, was dedicated to the crew on the 10th anniversary of the crash in May 2005.

The fairy tale's plot describes Kolobok's repetitive meetings with various animals (rabbit, wolf, and bear) who intend to eat it, but Kolobok cunningly escapes. With each animal Kolobok sings a song in which he explains, \\"I got away from Grandmother, I got away from Grandfather, and I will certainly get away from you.\\" The fox manages to catch and eat Kolobok through distracting him by praising his singing. The fairy tale in the Czech language is named O Kobl√≠≈ækovi, where Kobl√≠≈æek is the main character. His name comes from Kobliha, which is the same doughnut as the Polish sweet pƒÖczki or Croatian, Bosnian and Serbian Krafne. In the Slovak language, the story is called O Pamp√∫chovi (About Doughnut), Ako i≈°iel Pamp√∫ch na vandrovku (How Doughnut went to wander), or the equivalent using the diminutive Pamp√∫≈°ik. Pamp√∫ch is the Slovak word for the same type of Slavic doughnut. In the German regions a very similar fairy tale was recorded in 1854 by Carl and Theodor Colshorn. In the book M√§rchen und Sagen aus Hannover the Low German story \\"Dicke fette Pannekauken, blief stahn, eck will di fr√§ten!\\" has an identical plot, however at the end the \\"Pannkauken\\" (pancake) will meet hungry orphan children and so it lets itself be eaten. The name of the tale was later shortened to Low German \\"De dicke fette Pannkoken\\" and Standard German \\"Der dicke fette Pfannkuchen\\", which both can be translated to \\"The thick fat pancake\\". In the books the pancake is often depicted with little feet contrary to pictures in other variants of the fairy tale. The end of the German tale differs from the Ukrainian. Instead of being eaten by one of the animals, the pancake gives himself to two poor children who have nothing else to eat. In Norway a similar story was recorded in the 1840s by Peter Christen Asbj√∏rnsen and published in the fairy tale book \\"Norske Folkeeventyr\\" as the story of the \\"Pannekaken\\". In this case the mother of seven children is baking pancakes when one suddenly comes alive. The pancake rolls off (\\"trillet og trillet\\") and out of the house. After the pancake encounters several animals, a sly pig manages to win the pancake's confidence and get close enough to eat it.

It primarily inhibits bone morphogenesis and is implicated in disorders of increased bone formation and several cancers.  Structure  Gremlin1, previously known as Drm, is a highly conserved 20.7-kDa, 184 amino acid glycoprotein part of the DAN family and is a cysteine knot-secreted protein. Gremlin1 was first identified in differential screening as a transcriptional down-regulated gene in v-mos-transformed rat embryonic fibroblasts.  Function  Gremlin1 (Grem1) is known for its antagonistic interaction with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in the TGF beta signaling pathway. Grem1 inhibits predominantly BMP2 and BMP4 in limb buds and functions as part of a self- regulatory feedback signaling system, which is essential for normal limb bud development and digit formation. Inhibition of BMPs by Grem1 in limb buds allows the transcriptional up-regulation of the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) 4 and 8 and sonic hedgehog (SHH) ligands, which are part of the signaling system that controls progression of limb bud development. Grem1 regulation of BMP4 in mice embryos is also essential for kidney and lung branching morphogenesis.  Clinical significance  = Cancer = Data from microarrays of cancer and non-cancer tissues suggest that grem1 and other BMP antagonists are important in the survival of cancer stroma and proliferation in some cancers. Grem1 expression is found in many cancers and is thought to play important roles in uterine cervix, lung, ovary, kidney, breast, colon, pancreas, and sarcoma carcinomas. More specifically, the Grem1 binding site (between residues 1 to 67) interacts with the binding protein YWHAH, (whose binding site for Grem1 is between residues 61-80) and is seen as a potential therapeutic and diagnostic target against human cancers. Grem1 also plays a BMP-dependent role in angiogenesis on endothelium of human lung tissue, which implies a role for Grem1 in the development of cancer. = Bone = Deletion of Grem1 in mice after birth increased bone formation and increased trabecular bone volume, whereas overexpression causes inhibition of bone formation and osteopenia. Conditional deletion of one copy of Grem1 does not produce an abnormal phenotype and deletion of both copies causes only a small difference in phenotype in one-month-old male mice, but this difference cannot be observed after 3 months of age. Grem1 plays an important role in bone development and a lesser known function later in adulthood. Overexpression of Grem1 decreases osteoblast differentiation or the inhibition of bone formation and the ability for bone remodeling. In addition, overexpression of Grem1 in the mouse limb bud inhibits BMP signaling which can lead to digit loss as well as polydactyly.Jacqueline L. Norrie, Jordan P. Lewandowski, Cortney M. Bouldin, Smita Amarnath, Qiang Li, Martha S. Vokes, Lauren I.R. Ehrlich, Brian D. Harfe, Steven A. Vokes. Dynamics of BMP signaling in limb bud mesenchyme and polydactyly (2014) Developmental Biology Volume 393, Issue 2, Pages 270‚Äì281 Overexpression of grem1 in stromal and osteoblastic cells in addition to the inhibition of BMP, grem 1 inhibits activation of Wnt/Œ≤-catenin signaling activity. The interaction between Grem1 and the Wnt signaling pathway is not fully understood.  Transcriptional regulation  Cis- regulatory modules (CRMs) regulate when and where Grem1 is transcribed. It has been reported that a CRM acts as both a silencer and activator for Grem1 transcription in the mouse limb bud.Li, Q., Lewandowski, J. P., Powell, M. B., Norrie, J. L., Cho, S. H. and Vokes, S. a (2014). A Gli silencer is required for robust repression of gremlin in the vertebrate limb bud. Development 141, 1906‚Äì14 There are additional CRMs that regulate Grem1 transcription.Zuniga, A., Laurent, F., Lopez-Rios, J., Klasen, C., Matt, N. and Zeller, R. (2012).

Saint Peter's moved to its current location at 254 Easton Avenue in New Brunswick in 1929 as a 125-bed facility. In 1959, a three-wing 349-bed addition was constructed. In 1976, a five-story tower containing the emergency department, radiology department, operating and recovery suite, and a 40-bed nursing unit was completed. In 1991 The Women and Children's Pavilion was added. In 1999 the Center for Ambulatory Resources (CARES) building was constructed. New Telemetry, Maternity and Oncology units were completed in 2008. In late 2019 it was announced that the leaders of RWJBarnabas Health and the leaders of Saint Peter's Healthcare System signed a letter of intent to explore a merger. The preliminary plan calls for significant investments in Saint Peter‚Äôs by RWJBarnabas Health to help expand the outpatient services currently provided by Saint Peter‚Äôs. Saint Peter‚Äôs would remain a Catholic hospital and continue its sponsorship by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Metuchen. According to administrations from both hospitals, the two parties have been in discussions for awhile and believe they could both benefit from the merger. The merger would also strengthen education services provided at the two already Rutgers affiliated hospitals. On September 10, 2020 it was announced that the health systems had signed a definitive agreement that the two systems would merge. The merger would create the largest academic medical center in the state. After the signing of the agreement, the potential partnership began a period of review by state and federal regulatory agencies.

Cerberus is a signaling molecule which contributes to the formation of the head, heart and left and right asymmetry of internal organs. This gene varies slightly from species to species but its overall functions seem to be similar. Cerberus is secreted by the anterior visceral endoderm and blocks the action of BMP, Nodal and Wnt, secreted by the primitive node, which allows for the formation of a head region. This is accomplished by inhibiting the formation of mesoderm in this region. Xenopus Cerberus causes a protein to be secreted that is able to induce the formation of an ectopic head. Knockdown experiments have helped to explain Cerberus‚Äôs role in both the formation of the head and left and right symmetry. These experiments have shown that Cerberus helps to keep Nodal from crossing to the right side of the developing embryo, allowing left and right asymmetry to form. This is why misexpression of Cerberus can cause the heart to fold in the opposite direction during development. When Cerberus is ‚Äúknocked down‚Äù and BMP and Wnt are up regulated the head does not form. Other experiments using mice that this gene has been ‚Äúknocked out‚Äù showed no head defects, which suggest that it is the combination of the up regulation of BMP and Wnt along with the absence of Cerberus that causes this defect. For the heart, Cerberus is one of several factors that inhibits Nodal to initiate cardiomyogenic differentiation The Cerberus gene family produces many different signal proteins that are antagonistically involved in establishing anterior-posterior patterning and left-right patterning in vertebrate embryos.  Function  Cerberus is an inhibitor in the TGF beta signaling pathway secreted during the gastrulation phase of embryogenesis. Cerberus (Cer) is a gene that encodes a cytokine (a secreted signaling protein) important for induction and formation of the heart and head in vertebrates. The Cerberus gene encodes a polypeptide that is 270 amino acids in length and is expressed in the anterior domain of a gastrula in the endoderm layer. Cerberus also plays a large role as an inhibitory molecule, which is important for proper head induction. Cerberus inhibits the proteins bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), Xnr1, and Xwnt8. This gene encodes a cytokine member of the cystine knot superfamily, characterized by nine conserved cysteines and a cysteine knot region. The cerberus-related cytokines, together with Dan and DRM / Gremlin, represent a group of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonists that can bind directly to BMPs and inhibit their activity. In human embryonic development, Cerberus and the protein coded by GREM3 inhibit NODAL in the Wnt signaling pathway during the formation of the germ layers. Specifically, Cerberus and GREM3 act as antagonists to Nodal in the anterior region of the developing embryo, blocking its expression and halting the progression of the primitive node. Orthologs of the gene that codes Cerberus (CER1) are conserved in other non-rodent mammals, indicating that Cerberus has similar functions in other vertebrates. A gene knockdown experiment was conducted in Xenopus, where the amount of Cerberus expressed was decreased by inhibiting translation. The proteins that Cerberus inhibits (BMP4, Xnr1, Xwnt8) concentrations were increased also. It was also shown that just the decrease of Cerberus translation alone was not enough to inhibit the formation of head structures. While the increase of just BMP4, Xnr1, Xwnt8 led to defects in the formation of the head. The increase of BMP4, Xnr1, Xwnt8 and the decrease of Cerberus together blocked the formation of the head. This gene knockdown experiment showed the necessity of Cerberus‚Äô inhibitory functions in the formation of head structures. It quite possibly may be that although Cerberus is necessary for the induction of a head, its inhibitory actions may play a more significant role in ensuring the head is developed properly. Overexpression or overabundance of Cerberus is associated with the development of ectopic heads. These additional head-like structures may contain varying characteristics of a normal head (eye or eyes, brain, notochord) depending on the ratio of overabundant Cerberus to other proteins associated with anterior development that Cerberus inhibits (Wnt, Nodal, and BMP). If only Nodal is blocked, a single head will still form but with abnormalities such as cyclopia. If both Nodal and BMP or Wnt and BMP are sufficiently inhibited, ectopic, abnormal head-like structures will form. Inhibition of all three proteins by Cerberus is required for the development of complete, ectopic heads.  Location  It is expressed in the anterior endoderm but can vary dorsally and ventrally between species. For example, in amphibians Cerberus is expressed in the anterior dorsal endoderm and in mice it is expressed in the anterior visceral endoderm.  Anterior-posterior patterning  Anterior-posterior patterning by Cerberus is accomplished by acting as an antagonist to nodal, bmp, and wnt signaling molecules in the anterior region of the vertebrate embryo during gastrulation. Knock down experiments in which Cerberus was partially repressed show a decreased formation of the head structures. In experiments where Cerberus was decreased and wnt, bmp and nodal signals were increased, embryos completely lacked head structures and develop only trunk structures. These experiments suggest that a balance of these signaling molecules is required for proper development of the anterior and posterior regions.  Left-right asymmetry  Cerberus is also involved in establishing left-right asymmetry that is critical to the normal physiology of a vertebrate. By blocking nodal in the right side of the embryo, concentrations of nodal remain high only in the left side of the embryo and the nodal cascade cannot be activated in the right side. Because left-right asymmetry is so vital, Cerberus works along with the nodal cilia that push left-determining signal molecules to the left side of the embryo to ensure that the left-right axis is correctly established. Misexpression experiments show that lack of Cerberus expression on the right side can result in situs inversus and cardiovascular malformations.  Heart development  Cerberus plays a vital role in heart development and differentiation of cardiac mesoderm through activation of Nodal signaling molecule. Nodal and Wnt activity is antagonized in the endoderm which results in diffusible signals from Cerberus. More specifically, Nodal inhibits certain cells from joining cardiogenesis while simultaneously activating cells. The cells that respond to Nodal produce Cerberus in the underlying endoderm which causes heart development in adjacent cells. Knockdown experiments of Cerberus reduced endogenous cardiomyogenesis and ectopic heart induction. Block of Nodal leads to induction of cardiogenic genes through chromatin remodeling. The heart is developed asymmetrically using the left-right patterning induced by Cerberus which creates a higher concentration of signaling molecules on the left side. Experiments that inhibited Cerberus led to a loss of left-right polarity of the heart, which was shown by bilateral expression of left side-specific genes. During mammalian heart induction, a mammalian homologue, Cer1, is associated with the coordinated suppression of the TGFbeta superfamily members Nodal and BMP. This induces Brahma-associated factor 60c (Baf60c), one of three Baf60 variants (a, b, and c) that are mutually exclusively assembled into the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex. Blocking Nodal and BMP also induces lineage-specific transcription factors Gata4 and Tbx5, which interact with Baf60c. Collectively, these proteins redirect SWI/SNF to activate the cardiac program of gene expression. Targeted inactivation of another homologue, Cerberus like-2 (Cerl2), in the mouse leads to left ventricular cardiac hyperplasia and systolic dysfunction.

H. Lawrence, in association with Myron T. Herrick, James Parmelee, and Webb Hayes, son of U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes, in Cleveland, Ohio.Eveready Battery Company Records Collection at the Rutherford B. Hayes Presidential Center In 1890, National Carbon merged with Thomson- Houston, Standard Carbon, and Faraday Carbon.  History  In 1894 the company began marketing Leclanch√© wet cells. At the same time, E. M. Jewett, was working in the company's Lakewood plant on the west side of Cleveland, under the direction of George Little. Jewett became interested in dry cells and, in his free time, conducted experiments in the laboratory. He developed a paper-lined, 1.5 volt cylindrical dry cell which he showed to Lawrence, who gave Jewett and Little a green light to begin manufacturing commercial dry cells. The trademark \\"Columbia\\" was proposed by Nelson C. Cotabish, a sales manager at NCC. In 1896 the company marketed the very first battery intended for widespread consumer use: the sealed, six-inch, 1.5 volt Columbia. NCC was the first company to successfully manufacture and distribute sealed dry cell batteries on a large scale. The company introduced the first D cell battery in 1898. The existing National Carbon Company grew significantly in 1899. The firm \\"incorporated under New Jersey laws January 16, 1899 as a consolidation of the following companies engaged in the manufacture of lighting carbons, carbon brushes for generators and motors, carbon batteries, carbon diaphragms and back plates for telephones, carbons for electrolytic purposes and kindred products. * American Carbon Co Noblesville Ind * Brush Carbon Works Cleveland Ohio * Faraday Carbon Co Jeannette, Pennsylvania * Globe Carbon Co Ravana Ohio * National Carbon Co Cleveland Ohio * Partridge Carbon Co Sandusky Ohio * Phoenix Carbon & Mfg Co St. Louis Mo * Solar Carbon & Mfg Co Pittsburgh * The Standard Carbon Co Cleveland Ohio * Thomson Houston Carbon Co Fremont, Ohio * The Washington Carbon Co Pittsburgh Moody, John, The Truth about the Trusts: A Description and Analysis of the American Trust Movement, Moody Publishing Company, 1904 p. 261 The Chicago Banker, Volume 1, Page 188.Chicago Banker Company 1899 The company supplied approximately 75% of the US carbon market in the world.\\"Big Carbon Firms Combine: Three-fourths of this Industry in the World Included\\" New York Times, January 10, 1899 In 1906, National Carbon Company, which had been supplying Conrad Hubert's American Electrical Novelty & Manufacturing Company (maker of Ever Ready flashlights and batteries) with materials for batteries, bought half interest in the company for $200,000. The name was changed to The American Ever Ready Company and the trademark was shortened to one word - Eveready. In 1914, The American Ever Ready Company became part of National Carbon Company now forming a manufacturer making both batteries and lighting products. In 1917, Union Carbide acquired National Carbon Company. From 1917 until 1921 Eveready used the trademark \\"DAYLO\\" for their flashlights and on their batteries. The American Chemical Society designated the development of the Columbia dry cell battery as a National Historic Chemical Landmark on September 27, 2005. The commemorative plaques at Energizer in Cleveland and at Energizer headquarters in St. Louis read: In 1896 the National Carbon Company (corporate predecessor of Energizer) developed the six-inch, 1.5 volt Columbia battery, the first sealed dry cell successfully manufactured for the mass market. The Columbia, a carbon-zinc battery with an acidic electrolyte, was a significant improvement over previous batteries, meeting consumer demand for a maintenance-free, durable, no-spill, inexpensive electrochemical power source. Finding immediate use in the rapidly expanding telephone and automobile industries, the Columbia launched the modern battery industry by serving as the basis for all dry cells for the next sixty years. In 1940 company supplied carbon for the role as nuclear graphite in nuclear fission experiments led by Enrico Fermi. Legacy Over the years, the company has had many names: the Boulton Carbon Company, the National Carbon Company, the Carbon Products Division of Union Carbide, the UCAR Carbon Company, UCAR International, and is now known as GrafTech International. A division spun off in 2017, NeoGraf Solutions, LLC, retains the original National Carbon factory in Lakewood, Ohio. Notable offspring from the company include KEMET Laboratories (capacitor technologies), Cytec Industries', Engineered Materials group (carbon fiber products), Energizer Holdings (batteries), and National Specialty Products (carbon and graphite specialty products).

It was first published in 1921, so it is in the public domain.Bates, p. 126. See also Librivox and the Poetry web site. Interpretation This poem is central to Harold Bloom's reading of Stevens's Harmonium, as marking the poet's progress over the perspectivism of \\"The Snow Man\\" and the pessimism of \\"The Man whose Pharynx was bad\\". The reader who masters these poems and their interrelationships has, according to Bloom, \\"reached the center of Stevens's poetic and human anxieties and of his resources for meeting those anxieties\\". \\"Hoon\\" points the way towards Stevens's future development as a poet, in his view.Axelrod, p. 86 \\"Hoon\\" is easily understood as a philosophical poem, lending itself to interpretation as an exercise in the philosophy of solipsism or subjective idealism such as Fichte's. It can also be read as a statement of a psychological theory like Freud's that hypothesizes an unconscious mental domain that influences conscious mental life. Bordering on such interpretations but neutral among them is the idea that the poem is about the poet's experience of self- discovery through imaginative construction of himself. The poet's creativity in this regard is perhaps extreme, but it makes his self more his self, hence he finds himself \\"more truly and more strange\\". A key to the interpretation of the poem is identification of the addressee, \\"you\\", with Nietzsche and Schopenhauer being more likely candidates than either Fichte or Freud. Milton J. Bates remarks that the regal figure of Hoon is the figure least qualified by irony among the early protagonists of Harmonium. > Without a visit to Hoon in his palaz, one will not appreciate how Stevens's > poems of the thirties, though they are not intimately autobiographical, > might nevertheless be said to contain and discourse of himself alone.Bates, > p. 126 He adds that the pure poet \\"bathes his nominal subject in the imaginative effulgence [that] Stevens called the 'poetry of the subject'\\".Bates, p. 153 The pure poet is distinguished from the local poet who defines himself as the intelligence of his soil, in that the former applies himself to what Stevens called \\"the idea of pure poetry: imagination, extended beyond local consciousness,...an idea to be held in common by South, West, North and East.\\"Quoted from Stevens's letters by Bates, p. 154 (See \\"The Comedian as the Letter C\\" regarding the topic of local poetry. See also the main Harmonium essay, especially the section \\"Locality\\".) Although this poem was written before \\"Comedian\\", Bates is proposing that Stevens \\"found Hoon's course more congenial than Crispin's\\" as his poetic project matured in the thirties. It was not until he took up his genealogical study in the early forties that, according to Bates, Stevens resumed the connection with his native region that had been severed by his move to New York.Bates, p. 154 (See the main Wallace Stevens essay for biographical details.)

Biography Tamaoka joined the Toryumon system as a wrestler, but dropped out of the dojo for unknown reasons. He then became a referee. In May 2006, he joined heel unit Muscle Outlaw'z to act as their own personal referee. He used fast counts and allowed rule breaking to give them an advantage. He also would simply refuse to count for MO'z opponents, and occasionally go so far as to attack them. A particular trick of his was to throw \\"protein\\" in the opponents' faces. Come September 2007, Tamaoka's relationship with the MO'z began to disintegrate after he cost the MO'z several matches with misaimed protein attacks. He was challenged to a banishment match by Gamma on September 22. The MO'z surprisingly aided Tamaoka against Gamma, causing Gamma's brief departure from the federation. However, Gamma returned to Dragon Gate and MO'z a month later, and Tamaoka was mobbed and kicked out of the unit upon doing so. After his exile from MO'z, Tamaoka briefly had an active schedule as a wrestler, but he stopped wrestling abruptly and returned to refereeing. As of May 2008, his profile was placed under the regular referee section on the Official Dragon Gate website . He continues to referee, but no longer plays a role or shows a distinct personality. On March 20, 2009, Tamaoka won the Open the Owarai Gate Championship from \\"Hollywood\\" Stalker Ichikawa. The title match was actually between Stalker and Masaaki Mochizuki, but Tamaoka won more fan support than either of them, so he became champion. He then vacated the title immediately afterwards since he wasn't a full-time wrestler. On April 5, 2011, Dragon Gate announced that they had fired Tamaoka, when it was learned that the night before he had been arrested for public drug use in a Kobe area restroom. The drug in question has been identified for now as simply a stimulant. The company had initially announced that he had been in violation of his contract when they announced his firing and the real reason had not been revealed until April 22 when the story received some mainstream press. As of that date, he was still in police custody.

The poly(A) tail is located on the 3' end of mRNA and is 200-250 nucleotides long. The binding protein is also involved in mRNA precursors by helping polyadenylate polymerase add the poly(A) nucleotide tail to the pre-mRNA before translation. The nuclear isoform selectively binds to around 50 nucleotides and stimulates the activity of polyadenylate polymerase by increasing its affinity towards RNA. Poly(A)-binding protein is also present during stages of mRNA metabolism including nonsense-mediated decay and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. The poly(A)-binding protein may also protect the tail from degradation and regulate mRNA production. Without these two proteins in-tandem, then the poly(A) tail would not be added and the RNA would degrade quickly. Structure RRM 1 and 2 connected by a short linker showing binding to the polyadenylate RNA. Cytosolic poly-A binding protein (PABPC) is made up of four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal region known as the PABC domain. RRM is the most common motifs for RNA recognition and is usually made up of 90-100 amino acids. Previous solution NMR and X-ray crystallography studies have shown that RRMs are globular domains, each composed of 4 anti- parallel Œ≤ sheets that are backed by 2 Œ±-helices. The central two Œ≤-strands, connected by a short linker, of each RRM forms a trough-like surface that‚Äôs thought to be responsible for binding to the poly(A) oligonucleotides. The polyadenylate RNA adopts an extended conformation running the length of the molecular trough. Adenine recognition is primarily mediated by contacts with conserved residues found in the RNP motifs of the two RRMs. In vitro studies have shown the binding affinities to be on the order of 2-7nM, while affinity for poly(U), poly(G), and poly(C) were reportedly lower or undetectable in comparison. This shows that the poly(A)-binding protein is specific to poly(A) oligonucleotides and not others. Since the two central Œ≤-strands are used for poly(A) oligonucleotide binding, the other face of the protein is free for protein-protein interactions. The PABC domain is approximately 75 amino acids and consists of 4 or 5 Œ±-helices depending on the organism ‚Äì human PABCs have 5, while yeast has been observed to have 4. This domain does not contact RNA, and instead, it recognizes 15 residues sequences that are a part of the PABP interaction motif (PAM-2) found on such proteins as eukaryotic translation termination factor (eRF3) and PABP interacting proteins 1 and 2 (PAIP 1, PAIP2). The structure of human poly(A)-binding protein found in the nucleus (PABPN1) has yet to be well determined but it has been shown to contain a single RRM domain and an arginine rich carboxy terminal domain. They are thought to be structurally and functionally different from poly-A binding proteins found in the cytosol. Expression and binding The expression of mammalian poly(A)-binding protein is regulated at the translational level by a feed-back mechanism: the mRNA encoding PABP contains in its 5' UTR an A-rich sequence which binds poly(A)-binding protein. This leads to autoregulatory repression of translation of PABP. The cytosolic isoform of eukaryotic poly(A)-binding protein binds to the initiation factor eIF4G via its C-terminal domain. eIF4G is a component of the eIF4F complex, containing eIF4E, another initiation factor bound to the 5' cap on the 5' end of mRNA. This binding forms the characteristic loop structure of eukaryotic protein synthesis. Poly(A)-binding proteins in the cytosol compete for the eIF4G binding sites. This interaction enhances both the affinity of eIF4E for the cap structure and PABP1 for poly(A), effectively locking proteins onto both ends of the mRNA. As a result, this association may in part underlie the ability of PABP1 to promote small ribosomal (40S) subunit recruitment, which is aided by the interaction between eIF4G and eIF3. Poly(A)-binding protein has also been shown to interact with a termination factor (eRF3). The eRF3/PABP1 interaction may promote recycling of terminating ribosomes from the 3' to 5' end, facilitating multiple rounds of initiation on an mRNA. Alternatively, it may link translation to mRNA decay, as eRF3 appears to interfere with the ability of PABP1 to multimerise/form on poly(A), potentially leading to PABP1 dissociation, deadenylation and, ultimately, turnover. Rotavirus NSP3 Cellular vs rotavirus translation Rotavirus RNA- binding protein NSP3 interacts with eIF4GI and evicts the poly(A) binding protein from eIF4F. NSP3A by taking the place of PABP on eIF4GI, is responsible for the shut-off of cellular protein synthesis. Rotavirus mRNAs terminate a 3‚Äô GACC motif that is recognized by the viral protein NSP3. This is the location where NSP3 competes with poly(A)-binding protein for eIF4G binding. Once rotavirus infection occurs viral GACC-tailed mRNAs are translated while the poly(A)-tailed mRNA is severely impaired. In infected cells, there have been high magnitudes of both translation induction (GACC- tailed mRNA) and reduction (poly(A)-tailed mRNA) both dependent on the rotavirus strain. These data suggest that NSP3 is a translational surrogate of the PABP-poly(A) complex; therefore, it cannot by itself be responsible for inhibiting the translation of host poly(A)-tailed mRNAs upon rotavirus infection. PABP-C1 evicted from eIF4G by NSP3 accumulates in the nucleus of rotavirus-infected cells. This eviction process requires rotavirus NSP3, eIF4G, and RoXaN. To better understand the interaction, modeling of the NSP3-RoXaN complex, demonstrates mutations in NSP3 interrupt this complex without compromising NSP3 interaction with eIF4G. The nuclear localization of PABP-C1 is dependent on the capacity of NSP3 to interact with eIF4G and also requires the interaction of NSP3 with a specific region in RoXaN, the leucine- and aspartic acid-rich (LD) domain. RoXaN is identified as a cellular partner of NSP3 involved in the nucleocytoplasmic localization of PABP-C1. Associated diseases =OPMD= Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a genetic condition that occurs in adulthood often after the age of 40. This disorder usually leads to weaker facial muscles oftentimes showing as progressive eyelid drooping, swallowing difficulties, and proximal limb muscle weakness such as weak leg and hip muscles. People with this disorder are often hindered to the point that they have to use a cane in order to walk. OPMD has been reported in approximately 29 countries and the number affected varies widely by specific population. The disease can be inherited as an autosomal dominant or recessive trait. =Mutations= Mutations of poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) can cause OPMD (oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy). What makes the PABPN1 protein so different than all other genes with disease causing expanded polyalanine tracts, is that it is not a transcription factor. Instead, PABPN1 is involved in the polyadenylation of mRNA precursors. Mutations in PABPN1 that cause this disorder, result when the protein has an extended polyalanine tract (12-17 alanines long vs. the expected amount of 10). The extra alanines cause PABPN1 to aggregate and form clumps within muscles because they are not able to be broken down. These clumps are believed to disrupt the normal function of muscle cells which eventually lead to cell death. This progressive loss of muscle cells most likely causes the weakness in muscles seen in patients with OPMD. It is still not known why this disorder only affects certain muscles like the upper leg and hip. In recent studies on OPMD in Drosophila, it has been shown that the degeneration of muscles within those who are affected may not solely be due to the expanded polyalanine tract. It may actually be due to the RNA-binding domain and its function in binding. =Studies= As of November 2015, there has been a lot of effort devoted to research of OPMD and how one might treat it. Myoblast Transplantation has been suggested and is in fact in clinical trials in France. This is done by taking myoblasts from a normal muscle cell and putting them into pharyngeal muscles and allowing them to develop to help form new muscle cells. There has also been testing of compounds, either existing or developed, to see if they might combat OPMD and its symptoms. Trehalose is a special form of sugar that has shown reduced aggregate formation and delayed pathology in the mouse model of OPMD. Doxycycline also played a similar role in delaying toxicity of OPMD in mouse models most likely due to stopping aggregate formation and reduced apoptosis. Many other compounds and methods are currently being researched and showing some success in clinical trials leading to optimism in curing this disease.

It is a non-destructive technique in which picosecond acoustic pulses penetrate into thin films or nanostructures to reveal internal features such as film thickness as well as cracks, delaminations and voids. It can also be used to probe liquids. The technique is also referred to as picosecond laser ultrasonics or laser picosecond acoustics. Introduction Generation and detection of picosecond strain pulses in an opaque thin film with ultrashort optical pulses. In this example the optical probe pulse arrives at the film surface at the same time as the returning strain pulse. In general, measurements are made by varying the arrival time of the optical probe pulse. Thermal expansion of the surface is omitted. For example, in the case of an aluminium film the strain pulse will have a typical frequency and bandwidth both ~ 100 GHz, a duration of ~ 10 ps, a wavelength of ~100 nm, and a strain amplitude of ~ 10‚àí4 when using optical pulses of duration ~ 100 fs and energy ~ 1 nJ focused to a ~ 50 Œºm spot on the sample surface. When an ultrashort light pulse, known as the pump pulse, is focused onto a thin opaque film on a substrate, the optical absorption results in a thermal expansion that launches an elastic strain pulse. This strain pulse mainly consists of longitudinal acoustic phonons that propagate directly into the film as a coherent pulse. After acoustic reflection from the film-substrate interface, the strain pulse returns to the film surface, where it can be detected by a delayed optical probe pulse through optical reflectance or (for films that are thin enough) transmittance changes. This time-resolved method for generation and photoelastic detection of coherent picosecond acoustic phonon pulses was proposed by Christian Thomsen and coworkers in a collaboration between Brown University and Bell Laboratories in 1984. Initial development took place in Humphrey Maris‚Äôs group at Brown University and elsewhere in the late 1980s. In the early 1990s the method was extended in scope at Nippon Steel Corp. by direct sensing of the picosecond surface vibrations of the film caused by the returning strain pulses, resulting in improved detection sensitivity in many cases. Advances after the year 2000 include the generation of picosecond acoustic solitons by the use of millimeter propagation distances and the generation of picosecond shear waves by the use of anisotropic materials or small (~1 Œºm) optical spot sizes. Acoustic frequencies up to the terahertz range in solids and up to ~ 10 GHz in liquids have been reported. Apart from thermal expansion, generation through the deformation potential or through piezoelectricity is possible. Picosecond ultrasonics is currently used as a thin film metrology technique for probing films of sub-micrometer thicknesses with nanometer resolution in depth, that sees widespread use in the semiconductor processing industry. Generation and detection =Generation= The absorption of an incident optical pump pulse sets up a local thermal stress near the surface of the sample. This stress launches an elastic strain pulse that propagates into the sample. The exact depth for the stress generation depends, in particular, on the material involved and the optical pump wavelength. In metals and semiconductors, for example, ultrashort-timescale thermal and carrier diffusion tends to increase the depth that is initially heated within the first ~1 ps. Acoustic pulses are generated with a temporal duration approximately equal to the acoustic transit time across this initially heated depth, in general greater than the optical absorption depth. For example, the optical absorption depths in Al and GaAs are ~10 nm for blue light, but the electron diffusion depths are ~50 and 100 nm, respectively. The diffusion depth determines the spatial extent of the strain pulse in the through- thickness direction. The main generation mechanism for metals is thermal expansion, whereas for semiconductors it is often the deformation potential mechanism. In piezoelectric materials the inverse piezoelectric effect, arising from the production of internal electric fields induced by charge separation, may dominate. When the optical spot diameter D, for example D~10 ¬µm, at the surface of an elastically isotropic and flat sample is much greater than the initially heated depth, one can approximate the acoustic field propagating into the solid by a one-dimensional problem, provided that one does not work with strain propagation depths that are too large (~D¬≤/Œõ=Rayleigh length, where Œõ is the acoustic wavelength). In this configuration‚Äîthe one originally proposed for picosecond ultrasonics‚Äîonly longitudinal acoustic strain pulses need to be considered. The strain pulse forms a pancake-like region of longitudinal strain that propagates directly into the solid away from the surface. For small spot sizes approaching the optical diffraction limit, for example D~1 ¬µm, it may be necessary to consider the three-dimensional nature of the problem. In this case acoustic mode- conversion at surfaces and interfaces and acoustic diffractionPicosecond Ultrasonics play an important role, resulting in the involvement of both shear and longitudinal polarizations. The strain pulse separates into different polarization components and spreads out laterally (for distances >D¬≤/Œõ) as it propagates down into the sample, resulting in a more complicated, three- dimensional strain distribution. The use of both shear and longitudinal pulses is advantageous for measuring elastic constants or sound velocities. Shear waves may also be generated by the use of elastically anisotropic solids cut at oblique angles to the crystal axes. This allows shear or quasi-shear waves to be generated with a large amplitude in the through-thickness direction. It is also possible to generate strain pulses whose shape does not vary on propagation. These so-called acoustic solitons have been demonstrated at low temperatures over propagation distances of a few millimeters. They result from a delicate balance between acoustic dispersion and nonlinear effects. =Detection= Strain pulses returning to the surface from buried interfaces or other sub-surface acoustically inhomogeneous regions are detected as a series of echoes. For example, strain pulses propagating back and forth through a thin film produce a decaying series of echoes, from which one may derive, in particular, the film thickness, the ultrasonic attenuation or the ultrasonic dispersion. The original detection mechanism used in picosecond ultrasonics is based on the photoelastic effect. The refractive index and extinction coefficient near the surface of the solid are perturbed by the returning strain pulses (within the optical absorption depth of the probe light), resulting in changes in the optical reflectance or transmission. The measured temporal echo shape results from a spatial integral involving both the probe light optical absorption profile and the strain pulse spatial profile (see below). Detection involving the surface displacement is also possible if the optical phase is variation is recorded. In this case the echo shape when measured through the optical phase variation is proportional to a spatial integral of the strain distribution (see below). Surface displacement detection has been demonstrated with ultrafast optical beam deflection and with interferometry.B. Perrin, B. Bonello, J. C. Jeannet, and E. Romatet, \\"Interferometric Detection of Hypersound Waves in Modulated Structures\\", Prog. Nat. Sci. Suppl. 6, S444 (1996). For a homogeneous isotropic sample in vacuum with normal optical incidence, the optical amplitude reflectance (r) modulation can be expressed asV. E. Gusev, Acust. Acta. Acust. 82, S37 (1996).] :\\\\frac {\\\\delta r}{r} = \\\\frac{4ik\\\\tilde n}{1-{\\\\tilde n}^2}\\\\frac{d\\\\tilde n}{d\\\\eta}\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\eta(z,t)e^{2i\\\\tilde nkz}dz+2iku(t) where \\\\tilde n =n+i\\\\kappa (n the refractive index and Œ∫ the extinction coefficient) is the complex refractive index for the probe light in the sample, k is the wave number of the probe light in vacuum, Œ∑(z, t) is the spatiotemporal longitudinal strain variation, d\\\\tilde n/d\\\\eta is the photoelastic constant, z is the depth in the sample, t is the time and u is the surface displacement of the sample (in the +z direction): u(t)= -\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\eta(z,t)dz To obtain the variation in optical reflectivity for intensity R one uses \\\\delta R/R=2\\\\rm{Re}(\\\\it{\\\\delta r/r}), whereas to obtain the variation in optical phase one uses \\\\delta \\\\it{\\\\phi}=\\\\rm{Im}(\\\\it{\\\\delta r/r}). The theory of optical detection in multilayer samples, including both interface motion and the photoelastic effect, is now well-developed. The control of the polarization state and angle of incidence of the probe light has been shown to be useful for detecting shear acoustic waves. Applications and future challenges Picosecond ultrasonics has been applied successfully to analyze a variety of materials, both solid and liquid. It is increasingly being applied to nanostructures, including sub-micrometre films, multilayers, quantum wells, semiconductor heterostructures and nano-cavities. It is also applied to probe the mechanical properties of a single biological cell.

She was assigned to several different cruiser squadrons in home waters upon completion, sometimes as flagship, until 1911 when she became the flagship of the Australia Station. Upon her return home, she was assigned to the 6th Cruiser Squadron of the 2nd Fleet and became the squadron's flagship when the fleet was incorporated into the Grand Fleet upon the outbreak of the First World War. She remained with the Grand Fleet until refitted in late 1915, when she was transferred to the North America and West Indies Station for convoy escort duties. In 1916 she participated in the unsuccessful search for the German commerce raider . In late 1917 Drake was torpedoed by a German submarine off Northern Ireland and sank in shallow water with the loss of eighteen lives. The wreck was partly salvaged, beginning in 1920; a fishing trawler collided with the remainder of the wreck in 1962 and sank the next day. The wrecks of the two ships were demolished during the 1970s, but their remnants remain a popular dive site. Since June 2017, Drakes wreck has been a scheduled historic monument. Diving is still permitted but avoid contact with the wreck and do not remove anything from it. Design and description The Drake-class ships were designed as faster and larger versions of the preceding with a slightly more powerful armament. They displaced , over more than the earlier ships.Friedman 2012, pp. 243‚Äì52, 336 The Drakes had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . They were powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of using steam provided by 43 Belleville boilers. On her sea trials, Drake reached a speed of .Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 69 She carried a maximum of of coal and her complement consisted of 900 officers and ratings.Friedman 2012, p. 336 The main armament of the Drake class consisted of two breech-loading (BL) 9.2-inch (234 mm) Mk X guns in single turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure. Her secondary armament of sixteen BL 6-inch (152 mm) Mk VII guns was arranged in casemates amidships. Eight of these were mounted on the lower deck and were only usable in calm weather.Friedman 2012, pp. 243, 260‚Äì61 A dozen quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder (76 mm) 12-cwt guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats. Two additional 12-pounder 8-cwt guns could be dismounted for service ashore.Friedman 2012, pp. 250, 336 The ships also carried three 3-pounder (47 mm) Hotchkiss guns and two submerged 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes. By February 1916, all of the lower casemates for her six- inch guns had been plated over and six of them had been remounted on the upper deck so they could be used in heavy weather. Several twelve-pounders had to be removed to make room for the six-inch guns.Friedman 2012, p. 247 The ship's waterline armour belt had a maximum thickness of 6 inches and was closed off by transverse bulkheads. The armour of the gun turrets and their barbettes was 6 inches thick while that of the casemates was 5 inches thick. The protective deck armour ranged in thickness from and the conning tower was protected by of armour. Construction and service HMS Drake, named after the Elizabethan adventurer Sir Francis Drake,Silverstone, p. 225 was laid down at Pembroke Dock on 24 April 1899, and launched on 5 March 1901, when she was christened by Mrs. Lort Phillips, wife of local landowner F. Lort Phillips, of Lawrenny. Based at Portsmouth for her gun, torpedo and circle trials in late 1902, there was also trials with a new type of propeller. She was completed on 13 January 1903 and assigned to the Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet,Friedman 2012, p. 244 under the command of the future First Sea Lord, Captain Francis Bridgeman.Ross, p. 116 John Jellicoe, also a future First Sea Lord and commander of the Grand Fleet, was her next captain in 1903‚Äì04.Heathcote, p. 129 In 1907 the ship was commanded by Captain Arthur Hayes-Sadler and serving as the flagship of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron under the command of Rear Admiral Charles Henry Adair.Navy List 1908 The following year, Drake became the flagship of 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet (attending the Hudson‚ÄìFulton Celebration during this time) and then was assigned to the 5th Cruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet of the Channel Fleet from 1910‚Äì11. She served as the flagship of the Australia Station from 1911‚Äì13 before returning home and joined the 6th Cruiser Squadron of the 2nd Fleet in reserve. That fleet was merged into the Grand Fleet upon mobilization in mid-1914 and Drake became flagship of Rear Admiral William Grant, commander of the squadron. The squadron was briefly deployed at the beginning of the war to blockade the northern exit from the North Sea.Goldrick, p. 25 In October 1914, under the command of Aubrey Smith, the ship was used to carry Russian bullion worth eight million pounds to Britain; on arrival, Drake lay thirty miles off Archangel, and the gold was brought to her at night.P. S. King, ed., The Russian Economist, vol. 1 (1920), p. 347: \\"The first shipment of gold from Russia to England, called for by the agreement between the British and Russian governments, and amounting to ¬£8,000,000 sterling, took place in October 1914. The secrecy of this shipment was guarded by all possible precautions. The cruiser Drake and the military transport Mantois, upon reaching Archangel, were kept in the open sea at a distance of thirty miles from the land, and the gold was transhipped during the night from lighters.\\" The ship was refitted in October 1915Transcript and then transferred to the North America and West Indies Station for convoy escort duties. She participated in the unsuccessful search in the West Indies for the German commerce raider in December 1916.Newbolt, Vol. IV, pp. 181, 184 Drake was torpedoed by the German submarine , commanded by Kapit√§nleutnant Otto Rohrbeck, on 2 October 1917 after her Convoy HH24 had dispersed for its several destinations. The ship was about off Rathlin Island at the tip of Northern Ireland when she was hit. The torpedo struck the No. 2 Boiler Room and caused two of her engine rooms and the boiler room to flood, killing 18 crewmen. These gave her a list and knocked out her steam-powered steering. Her captain decided to steam for Church Bay on Rathlin Island and accidentally collided with the merchant ship before she dropped anchor. The collision did not damage Drake much, but Mendip Range was forced to beach herself lest she sink. Drakes crew was taken off before she capsized later that afternoon.Aspinall, pp. 554‚Äì59; Newbolt, Vol. V, p. 162; Wessex Archaeology, p. 18 Her wreck at in Church Bay is a favourite site for divers because the wreck is only at a depth between and generally has good visibility. Salvage of the wreck began in 1920 and continued for several years. On the night of 3 November 1962, the steam trawler Ella Hewett struck the wreck and subsequently sank almost atop Drake. Ammunition and ordnance was salvaged during the 1970s and the wrecks were demolished with depth charges to reduce the chance of any other ships coming to grief on the wrecks. In 1978, the remaining fuel oil was salvaged to reduce pollution from leaking oil.Wessex Archaeology, pp. 3, 9‚Äì10 Notes Footnotes  Bibliography       Further reading *Wilson, Ian (2011) HMS Drake: Rathlin Island Shipwreck.

In the foreground the tomb of Cansignorio Mastino II and that of Mastino II behind. Cangrande I, now replaced by a copy The Scaliger Tombs (Italian: Arche scaligere) is a group of five Gothic funerary monuments in Verona, Italy, celebrating the Scaliger family, who ruled in Verona from the 13th to the late 14th century. The tombs are located in a court outside the church of Santa Maria Antica, separated from the street by a wall with iron grilles. Built in Gothic style, they are a series of tombs, mostly freestanding open tabernacle-like structures rising high above the ground, with a sarcophagus surmounted by an elaborate baldachin, topped by a statue of the deceased, mounted and wearing armour. According to the French historian Georges Duby, they are one of the most outstanding examples of Gothic art. Description The tombs are placed within an enclosure of wrought iron grilles decorated with a stair motif, referring to the name of the della Scala family, meaning \\"of the stairs\\" in Italian. The stone pillars of the enclosure have statues of saints. The tombs are those of the following notable members of the Scaliger dynasty: *Cangrande I. This was the first tomb built, in the 14th century, according to the will of the deceased, the most famous Scaliger ruler of the city. The designer was the architect of the church of Sant'Anastasia, who planned it in the shape of a Gothic tabernacle, supported by richly harnessed dogs (Cangrande meaning \\"Big dog\\" in Italian). Unlike the later tabernacles, it is built out from the church wall, over a doorway, rather than being free-standing. On the sarcophagus lies a recumbent effigy statue of the lord, characterized by an unusual smile. The sarcophagus is decorated on each side by high reliefs with religious themes and low reliefs with military themes. On the summit of the baldachin is an equestrian statue of Cangrande, now replaced by a copy (the original is in the museum of Castelvecchio). *Mastino II. Begun in 1345, this tomb was modified during its construction. It was originally painted and gilt, and is enclosed by a railing with four statues of the Virtues at the corners. The faces of the funerary urn are decorated by religious motifs; on the sepulchre cover lies again the deceased's statue, guarded by two angels. The baldachin has religious themes sculpted on the pediment, and is also surmounted by an equestrian statue of Mastino II. *Cansignorio. Dating from 1375, and the most richly decorated. It was designed by Bonino da Campione, and has sculptures portraying warrior saints, Gospel figures, the Virtues and the Apostles, and a large equestrian statue of Cansignorio. *Alberto II. Unlike the others, it has no baldachin but only a sarcophagus, though richly decorated. It dates from 1301. *Giovanni. This monument is built into the wall of the church. It was finished in 1359 by Andriolo de' Santi, and until 1400 it was located in the church of San Fermo Maggiore, before being moved to join the others. The tomb of Cansignorio della Scala has been copied in the Brunswick Monument (1879) in Geneva, Switzerland. Gallery Verona 046.JPGMastino II's tomb on the left, Cangrande I's to the right.

Tub boats are small boats used to transport coal and other minerals, sometimes working singly, sometimes in long trains. A tub boat lift () lifts the boat out of the water. Most other types of boat lift such as locks or inclined planes are designed to move the boat afloat in some kind of water-filled tank, and, apart from maximum dimensions, are not restricted in the type of craft transported. Tub boat lifts and tub boats are designed to work together as a system. A given lift will only be able to lift boats designed for the lift. Operation Tub boat lifts consisted of a moveable hoist travelling on four toothed wheels engaging with two toothed wooden rails, one mounted on each supporting wall. The hoist possessed two drums around which the lifting cables were wound. The lifting ropes passed through pulley blocks before being attached to lifting eyes on the boats to make the lift easier. Four men would wind the hoist when lifting a full 2.5 to 3 tonne tub boat until it was high enough to pass over the dam of the upper canal. Examples Kahnhebehaus Gro√üvoigtsberg The remains of two tub boat lifts can still be seen, in the same region of Germany. * The Halsbr√ºcke tub boat lift (also known as Rothenfurther Kahnhebehaus), was built in 1788/89 on the Freiberger Mulde. The remains of the Halsbr√ºcke lift and the connecting section of the upper canal were restored in 1988. The tub boats used in this case were 8.5m long and 1.6m wide and when first used carried 2.5 tonnes, upgraded to 3 tonnes later in the canal and lift's working life. This lift worked until 1868. * The Gro√üvoigtsberg tub boat lift (also known as Christbescherunger Kahnhebehaus), in the neighbourhood of Freiberg, Saxony, was built in 1791 to overcome the difference in elevation between the Mulde and the Christbescherung mine canal. This canal was not completed, it is therefore possible that this lift was never used. The engineer in charge of the construction of both of these lifts was the Freiberg Kunstmeister Mechanicus Johann Friedrich Mende (1743‚Äì1798). * A third tub boat lift was planned near Kleinvoigtsberg but was never built.

This copy, printed and painted in 1789, is currently held by the Library of Congress. \\"The Shepherd\\" is a poem from William Blake's Songs of Innocence (1789). This collection of songs was published individually four times before it was combined with the Songs of Experience for 12 editions which created the joint collection Songs of Innocence and of Experience (1794). Blake produced all of the illuminated printings himself beginning in 1789. Each publication of the songs has the plates in a different order, and sixteen other plates were published posthumously. Ralph Vaughan Williams set the poem to music in his 1958 song cycle Ten Blake Songs. Poem Critical analysis This poem is one of the three pastoral poems in Songs of Innocence, the other two being The Lamb and Spring.Gardner [15-21] This poem is written from the Piper's perspective. This can be seen in the repetition of the word 'sweet' in the first line which the Piper uses in the other poems of his narration.Leader [75-79] This repetition may also be read as a subtle irony about the Shepherd's lack of agency as he follows his herd rather than leading them through the fields.Blake [144-145] The Little Boy Full of Joy that is depicted in Spring, grows into the shepherd of The Lamb, and then completes his journey through life as The Shepherd in this poem. In the first stanza, The Shepherd is full of joy which mirrors the innocent nature of this collection of poems. In the second stanza, The Shepherd is presented as a caring and protective force over his herd. This can be seen in his listening for the call and reply of the ewe and lamb in the second stanza. Readers from Blake's time would have found it odd that The Shepherd was following his herd.Glen [3-5] Blake allows the voice of the poem to speak for itself rather than revealing a firm interpretation. The Shepherd's relationship to his flock is further explored in the final lines of the poem. When he is present, the herd remains calm and peaceful. There are also religious connotations in this poem. The image of The Shepherd as Christ is initially found in another Song, \\"The Little Black Boy\\". Psalm 23 depicts God as a shepherd of mankind, and the capitalization of the word 'Shepherd' in the first and last lines furthers the idea that the Shepherd is a symbol of God. In the bible, a shepherd's presence is representative of guidance. In this poem, the Shepherd can be viewed as the spiritual guide or a savior of the herd, rejoicing in their numbers. Jesus is also referred to in the bible as the Lamb of God. Since the poem depicts The Shepherd as following his herd, the reader may view both the sheep and The Shepherd as protectors of each other. The Shepherd watches over his herd with delight as God watches over his people. Reversed, Jesus - represented as a lamb - does not lead mankind - The Shepherd - astray. Illustration The Shepherd in the illustration is standing underneath a vine-wrapped tree surrounded by his herd of sheep. In many of the Songs of Innocence, Blake uses vegetation to show the security of innocence that is secure and unthreatened.Larrissy Ch 1 This dove underneath the poem mimics the dove found on the introduction plate. Typically a symbol of peace, the dove enables the reader to absorb the peaceful setting that is typical of a pastoral poem. Depending on the version, the sun appears to either be rising or setting. The rising sun gives the impression of new beginnings that is consistent with innocence while the setting sun encourages the reader to view the poem as the end of a journey through innocence and onto experience.

Baseball career Jefferson displayed impressive speed and agility and was selected by the New York Mets organization in the first round (20th pick overall) of the free agent draft on June 6, 1983.Stan Jefferson - Ultimate Met Database After playing in the minors for three years, Jefferson played in 14 games for the Mets during the last month of the 1986 season before he was sent to the San Diego Padres in the nine-player Kevin McReynolds-Kevin Mitchell deal at the end of the year. Though he became a regular in the Padres outfield in 1987, he clashed with manager Larry Bowa in May and spent much of the first half on the disabled list. Jefferson stole 33 bases and batted .230 that year. In 1988 Jefferson performed poorly, batting .144 over 111 at bats. At the end of the season he was traded with Jimmy Jones and Lance McCullers to the New York Yankees for Jack Clark and Pat Clements. He logged 12 at-bats with the Yankees before being traded to the Orioles in July 1989. For the next year and a half, he played intermittently for the Orioles, Indians and Reds. Jefferson‚Äôs career ended in 1991 after suffering a career ending injury to his Achilles‚Äô tendon. Jefferson later became a coach for the Pioneer League Butte Copper Kings. When the player's strike threatened the season, Jefferson became a much-maligned replacement player for his original team, sharing the outfield with fellow ex-Met Herm Winningham. NYPD career In 1997, with his baseball career over, Jefferson joined the New York City Police Department. He was on duty during the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and worked at Ground Zero after the collapse of the World Trade Center. He suffered health problems as a result of his time at Ground Zero, and retired from the NYPD in 2004. Personal life Jefferson lives in Florida. He has two grown daughters who live in Virginia. During the peak of his career Jefferson shied away from the spotlight and preferred a private, low key profile. In 2016, in an interview on SNY, he reflected on his baseball career and his career as an NYPD officer, addressing his experience during the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. In 2018, Jefferson was recognized for his athletic and heroic contributions by Bethune-Cookman University and was inducted into their Hall of Fame alongside other accomplished alumni.

The Mermentau River () is a river in southern Louisiana in the United States. It enters the Gulf of Mexico between Calcasieu Lake and Vermilion Bay on the Chenier Coastal Plain. The Mermentau River supplies freshwater for the Mermentau Basin. The Chenier Basin is located between the Mermentau Basin and the Gulf of Mexico, and is unique in that it no longer contains any true estuarine Gulf habitat, although historically the basin served as a productive estuarine nursery ground. Freshwater inflow is from the Catfish Point control structure. Presently, several large freshwater lakes (Grand Lake, White Lake) and confined wetlands dominate the region. These habitats are confined within the mainland and isolated from the influence of saltwater by a series of water control structures or locks. A significant percentage of the basin lands are publicly owned as Federal refuges and State wildlife management areas. Pirate Jean Laffite is rumored to have sailed into the area during the 19th century, possibly stashing gold treasure. Early in the 20th century W. Scott Heywood of Jennings began operating barges on the river to carry oil, which he discovered in 1901, to the railroad. In 1932, Heywood was elected to the Louisiana State Senate from a large district encompassing much of southwestern Louisiana. Landmarks The Mermentau River contains the infamous \\"Negro Island\\" (also known as \\"Skull Island\\") situated near the tiny village of Grand Chenier in extreme southeastern Cameron Parish. In March 1867, John W. Sweeney, Jr., found \\"countless skulls, skeletons, and leg bones, each of the latter still shackled by a rusting leg iron to the skeleton lying beside it.\\" Since the Civil War had recently ended, slave captains knew that if a slave ship were caught with Africans aboard, the slaver captain would be tried for violating the 1820 U.S. Law on Slave Trade, the penalty of which was a charge of piracy and death by hanging. Without a doubt the shackled and starving Africans on Skull Island died quickly. Researchers believe this human cargo could possibly be the missing slaves from the topsail hermaphrodite schooner Huntress. This schooner was the last slave ship which left the Congo region of Africa in March 1865 with a capacity of 200 slaves.

It belongs to the genus Scytalopus, a genus of tapaculos. Taxonomy The species was often known as the Andean tapaculo in the past and included a number of subspecies distributed along the Andes. These are now treated as species in their own right, leaving the Magellanic tapaculo with no subspecies although birds in the north of its range are larger and darker and may deserve subspecies status. Description It is a wren-like bird, 10 to 12 cm in length. The bill is slender and black while the legs are pinkish and fairly long. The tail is short and held erect. The plumage is dark-grey with a chestnut tinge to the flanks, undertail and wings. Some birds have a silvery-white patch on the crown. Juvenile birds are brown with dark barring and usually lack white on the crown. The song is loud, staccato and repetitive. Distribution and habitat Its range extends northwards from Tierra del Fuego as far as Valpara√≠so Region in Chile and San Juan Province in Argentina. Charles Darwin collected a specimen in the Falkland Islands in 1833 or 1834 but there have been no definite records there since. It inhabits dense vegetation near ground-level in forest and woodland where it forages for insects. It often occurs near water and is commonly associated with stands of Chusquea bamboo. Behaviour It is terrestrial and prefers to run rather than fly. =Breeding= The domed nest is made of moss, lichens and root-fibres. Two or three white eggs are laid.

History The construction of Fort Carroll beginning in 1847 set a large new hazard to navigation immediately adjacent to the ship channel, and a keeper's house with a light tower on it was constructed in 1854. At the time, the light keeper was the only resident of the artificial island. The fort was never completed as envisioned, but nonetheless changes to the fortifications brought about a number of changes to the light. The tower was moved to the southwest corner of the fort in 1875, and a new keeper's house was built in 1888. The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War prompted a project to upgrade the fort's guns to (then) modern naval weapons, and this displaced the light to a new location on the northwest corner. In 1900 the tower was moved again to a more central location on the western wall. This tower, a short square wooden structure with a fog bell, survives to this day. The fort was strategically obsolete almost before construction began, and the army finally abandoned the fort in 1921, one year after the light was automated. The federal government retained the property, however, and the coast guard used it for a pistol range and for temporary quarters for seamen whose ships were being fumigated. By this time the light had been discontinued. Various schemes for reuse ensued, and eventually in 1958 the property was sold to Benjamin Eisenberg, a Baltimore lawyer who intended to build a casino there. Jurisdictional issues nixed this, and the property has never been put to commercial use, though at one point a large number of peach trees were planted. In its neglect the fort has become a seabird refuge, by default. The light remains perched on the fortress walls, but in extreme disrepair.

Ozone Action Days, alternately called an \\"Ozone Alert\\" or a \\"Clean Air Alert\\", primarily center in the midwestern portion of the United States; particularly in well-urbanized areas such as Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, and Indianapolis. Surface ozone vs. the ozone layer Although the ozone found at the Earth's surface is the same chemical species as that found in the ozone layer, they have very different sources, atmospheric chemistry, and affect human health differently as well. The ozone layer protects people from the sun's most damaging ultraviolet rays. Because the ozone layer is located high in the atmosphere, people are not directly exposed to it. Ground-level ozone, however, is a health hazard because people breathe it. It is formed through a complex set of chemical reactions involving hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and sunlight on calm summer days where the weather may also be warm and humid. High levels of ground ozone affect the breathing process and aggravate asthma in chronic sufferers. The young, elderly, and those with lung diseases are especially susceptible. Ozone is most likely to exceed safety limits from May through October when seasonal heat and sunlight are at their highest However, similar conditions can occur at other times of the year in specific urbanized areas; namely the Los Angeles area, which is well known for smog formation. Sources of ground ozone A major cause of the conditions is due to pollutants in the air released by heavy industry (manufacturing plants, refineries, coal-fired power plants). Therefore, Ozone Action Days occur most frequently in the Midwestern United States. In recent years, many sites have taken steps to help reduce the amount of pollutants they discharge. Secondary sources include automotive emissions (leaky auto exhaust systems, excessive engine idling) and liberal use of household chemicals or sprays. Surface Ozone Limits In 2008, the EPA created ‚Äúnon-attainment areas‚Äù for ozone in which ozone levels shall not exceed the federal standard of 75 parts per billion averaged over the course of three years. The EPA put the revised ozone standard into effect on October 1, 2015.Salley, Mark. \\"EPA Lowers Federal Ozone Standard; Colorado, Other States Face More Difficult Compliance.\\" Home. Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment, 2016. Web. 15 Oct. 2016. This means that high altitude cities will have a more difficult time meeting the new federal standards. This is due to higher ozone concentrations (Denver-metro area) moving to areas of lower ozone concentrations (rural, mountain areas). For example, the high altitude state of Colorado is working on reducing the overall amount of ozone throughout the state. The Denver Metropolitan and North Front Range areas specifically have violated the national ozone standards in the last several years. All other counties in Colorado are in compliance with the 75 ppb standard set by the EPA in 2015. Denver is currently the 8th most polluted area due to ozone in the United States.Finley, Bruce. \\"Denver Ranks 8th Most- polluted Due to Ozone Contamination of Air.\\" The Denver Post. The Denver Post, 22 Apr. 2016. Web. 25 Oct. 2016. In 2015, Denver was ranked the 13th most- polluted city in the United States. Experts cite coal mining, population growth, and the oil and gas industries as potential reasons for the Denver metro area becoming more polluted. Occupational Safety and Ozone In order to ensure safe ozone levels in an occupational setting, federal regulations are in place in order to enforce workplace exposure limits for all working men and women. These measures are not implemented as a response to Ozone Action Days but rather they are in place in order to reduce the levels of ozone and contribute to the overall reduction of ground ozone in the environment. =OSHA= Congress created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in response to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. To address the issue of ozone in the work environment, OSHA set a legal airborne permissible exposure limit of 0.1 parts per million (ppm) averaged over an 8-hour work shift. =NIOSH= The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) also provides thorough information to ensure a safe working environment by conducting research and making recommendations for the prevention of work-related disease and injury.(www.cdc.gov/niosh) They recommend an airborne exposure limit for ozone of 0.1ppm, which should not be exceeded at any time. =ACGIH= The American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) is a member-based organization of industrial hygienists and individuals in the occupational and environmental health and safety industry. They recommend an airborne exposure limit of 0.05ppm for heavy work, 0.08ppm for moderate work, and 0.1ppm for light work. If work is done for less than two hours the ACGIH recommends an exposure airborne limit of 0.20pmm averaged over an 8-hour work shift. It is important to note that engineering controls are the most effective way of reducing airborne exposure of ozone (unless the exposure is the result of chemical use, in which exposure can possibly be reduced by substituting a less hazardous chemical). These controls include proper ventilation systems, proper respirators and protective clothing. Public Health and Ground Ozone =Surface Ozone as Asthma Trigger= Millions suffer from asthma and it is one of the most common long term illnesses of children. It causes wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. If symptoms get worse, they may end up getting hospitalized. Asthma exacerbations can be triggered by many factors such as tobacco smoke, dust mites, air pollution, pets, and mold. Surface ozone is also one of them. Surface ozone is one of the most common air pollutants and causes airway irritation. It can also reduce lung function. Studies show that areas with higher ozone levels have higher doses of asthma medications and increased emergency room visits, Lin, Shao, et al. \\"Chronic exposure to ambient ozone and asthma hospital admissions among children.\\" Environmental Health Perspectives116.12 (2008): 1725.(Shao et al., 2008) =Differences in Health Risk After Ozone Exposure= There are differences between groups in both the magnitude of exposure to ozone as well as the ultimate health effects from the exposure. A study of 98 communities found that community characteristics changed the health impacts of ozone exposure. A greater effect of ozone was associated with higher unemployment, increased African American populations, increased public transportation use and use of central air conditioning.Bell, Michelle L., and Francesca Dominici. \\"Effect modification by community characteristics on the short-term effects of ozone exposure and mortality in 98 US communities.\\" American journal of epidemiology 167.8 (2008): 986-997. This could be due to increased exposure in these communities or other underlying health disparities that are exacerbated by the exposure to ozone. This differential effect of ozone on health holds true for asthma and ozone exposure as well. In a longitudinal, prospective study, men who were exposed to a 27 parts per billion increase were found to have a 2-fold increase in asthma diagnosis. Although this trend was not found for women, the size of this ozone effect was not diminished when the researchers considered other air pollutants such as (PM10, SO4, NO2, and SO2).McDonnell, William F., et al. \\"Long-term ambient ozone concentration and the incidence of asthma in nonsmoking adults: the AHSMOG Study.\\"Environmental Research 80.2 (1999): 110-121. Additionally, it was found that after ozone levels equaled or exceeded 0.11 ppm, there was a 37% increase in hospital visits for asthma for African American families in low income areas.White, Mary C., et al. \\"Exacerbations of childhood asthma and ozone pollution in Atlanta.\\"Environmental Research 65.1 (1994): 56-68. These gender, socioeconomic status and race differences need to be investigated further and solidify ozone exposure as a public health problem to be solved in the coming years. = Legalities of States Exceeding EPA Ozone Limits = Colorado is working on reducing the overall amount of ozone throughout the state. The Denver Metropolitan and North Front Range areas specifically have violated the national ozone standards in the last several years. All other counties in Colorado are in compliance with the 75 ppb standard set by the EPA in 2015. Denver is currently the 8th most polluted area due to ozone in the United States (Finley, 2016). In 2015, Denver was ranked the 13th most-polluted city in the United States. Experts cite coal mining, population growth, and the oil and gas industries as potential reasons for the Denver metro area becoming more polluted. In 2008, the EPA created ‚Äúnonattainment areas‚Äù for ozone in which ozone levels shall not exceed the federal standard of 75 parts per billion averaged over the course of three years. The EPA put the revised ozone standard into effect on October 1, 2015 (Salley, 2015). This means that high altitude cities will have a more difficult time meeting the new federal standards. This is due to higher ozone concentrations (Denver-metro area) moving to areas of lower ozone concentrations (rural, mountain areas). Notification State, county, and even local governments can announce Ozone Action Days as much as a day in advance through the monitoring of approaching weather conditions and the air quality index (AQI). The AQI is divided into six levels: the higher the number (on a 0-300 scale), the more severe the ozone threat. AQI of greater than 101 is considered dangerous for people with asthma, and asthma sufferers can take necessary precautions to avoid attacks. An AQI above 150 is considered unhealthy for all populations. They may check the AirNow EPA current air quality index for the most up to date information. What can be done Heavy industries make up a high percentage of pollutants causing ground ozone. Without drastically altering or eliminating industrial production in an area altogether, air quality improvements are very slight, though noticeable. Non-industrial pollutants, while not thought of to be a major pollutant group, can be more controlled with more positive change occurring. Protection on High Ground Level Ozone Days Reducing exposure to ground level ozone on days with an AQI greater than 100 cab be achieved by avoiding prolonged exertion outdoors and avoiding heavy exertion outdoors.https://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqi_brochure.index Long term ozone action plan Possible long term solutions to reduce ground level ozone concentrations include Use alternative-fuel vehicles, such as natural gas and hybrid electric, including the possibility of some communities even expanded its line of buses, garbage trucks and even company vehicles, such as UPS trucks, to use alternative fuels.

The members of this genus are known as \\"rose chafers\\", not to be confused with the European \\"rose chafer\\", Cetonia aurata. M. subspinosus occurs from Eastern Canada to Colorado and is considered a pest of many crops and flowers. It is given its common name of rose chafer because it eats the leaves of roses, although it also feeds on many other plants.  Identification  The rose chafer has a yellowish-tan coloured body that is about in length, with wings that do not completely cover the abdomen. The beetle has six long, spiny, reddish-brown legs that gradually become darker towards the end of the appendage. It has two short lamellate antennae that end in a club of flat plates and it has chewing mouthparts. Rose chafers are covered in dull yellow hairs which give the body its characteristic colour, however with age and with normal activity the hairs are worn off the head and thorax revealing a black colour. It is thus possible to distinguish between older and younger beetles, as older beetles will have fewer hairs and thus be darker in colour. Females tend to lose more hairs, especially on the thorax due to the mating process, and can also appear darker in colour. Females also tend to be more robust than the male. The eggs of the rose chafer are about 1 mm in length and are oval, white and shiny. The larvae are white C-shaped grubs that when mature develop a brown head capsule and three distinct pairs of legs. The pupae are yellowish-brown in colour and are about 15 mm in length. Natural history =Life cycle= As a member of the order Coleoptera, the rose chafer undergoes complete metamorphosis during its development. In late May, white-bodied larvae, about long, pupate after having overwintered deep in the soil. Once they have emerged from their pupal case, adults live for 3‚Äì6 weeks, during which time they will feed on plant material and mate. Their eggs are laid in sandy soils, deep, and hatch in 1‚Äì3 weeks. This new generation of larvae will feed on the roots of grasses, weeds, and some ornamental garden plants during the rest of the summer, before they burrow deep in the soil to overwinter; these larvae will emerge as adults in the following year. =Behaviour= After adult rose chafers emerge in late May to mid-June, they aggregate on leaves, buds, flowers, and fruit, in order to feed and mate. By chewing on plant tissues, the rose chafer induces the release of volatile compounds from the plant. Using their antennae, rose chafers can detect the plant compounds in the air and orient themselves in the direction of the feeding conspecific, leading to an aggregation of the beetles. Male rose chafers also orient themselves preferentially toward virgin females as opposed to mated females, though it is unknown whether they are detecting pheromones released by virgin females, or the release of plant volatiles induced by the feeding virgin females.  Damage  The adult beetle feeds on the foliage, flowers, and fruit of many plants including grapes, apples, peaches, chestnuts, roses, and other garden flowers and fruits. On roses it skeletonizes the leaves, which can be rather bothersome for avid gardeners. Rose chafers are also a problem for vineyards as they eat the grapes at bloom as well as skeletonize the leaves. They also tend to appear suddenly and in swarms, and vines with over 100 rose chafers per plant have been observed. This huge amount of damage can result in almost total loss of photosynthetically active leaf area as well as reducing or prohibiting pollination. The larvae also cause damage as they feed on the roots of the plants, which can limit growth. =Management= Small number of beetles (2-3 per plant) can be mechanically removed (hand picking, hand held vacuum). A number of insecticides are also effective for large scale infestations.Rose chafers University of Minnesota Extension, accessed 2018 References External links *Rose Chafers *Insect Pests of Roses *Insects Attacking Flower Clusters and Berries *Insects and Related Pests of Shrubs *Rose Chafer images on \\"BugGuide.net\\" Category:Melolonthinae Category:Beetles of North America Category:Agricultural pest insects Category:Insect pests of ornamental plants Category:Beetles described in 1775 ","title":"Macrodactylus subspinosus"},{"id":"11835501","text":"Nathaniel Willis may refer to: * Nathaniel Willis (1755‚Äì1831), American newspaperman in Boston, Virginia and Ohio * Nathaniel Willis (1780‚Äì1870), American editor and publisher in Boston and Maine * Nathaniel Parker Willis (1806‚Äì1867), American author, poet and editor ","title":"Nathaniel Willis"},{"id":"11835533","text":"David Weissman is an American screenwriter and director, most known for his comedies. He frequently collaborates with David Diamond.https://deadline.com/tag/david-diamond-david-weissman/ Diamond and Weissman met in high school, at Akiba Hebrew Academy (now Jack M. Barrack Hebrew Academy). They graduated in 1983. His film credits include Dream a Little Dream 2 (his only produced project not co-written with Diamond), The Family Man, Old Dogs, When in Rome, Evolution and the television film Minutemen. Career The duo sold their first spec script, The Whiz Kid, to 20th Century Fox in 1994. Their first produced project came in 2000, The Family Man starring Nicolas Cage and Tea Leoni. Cage's production company, Saturn Films, helped produce the film. The Family Man opened at #3 at the North American box office making $15.1 million in its opening weekend, behind What Women Want and Cast Away, which opened at the top spot. Diamond and Weissman next wrote the sci-fi comedy Evolution, helmed by Ivan Reitman. Evolution was based on a story by Don Jakoby, who turned it into a screenplay along with Diamond and Weissman. The film was originally written as a serious horror science fiction film, until director Reitman re-wrote much of the script. A short-lived animated series, Alienators: Evolution Continues, loosely based on the film, was broadcast months after the film was released. In 2005, they partnered with Wedding Crashers producer Andrew Panay on Old Dogs and When In Rome. In 2019, the duo will publish a screenwriting manual, Bulletproof: Writing Scripts That Don't Get Shot Down. The book draws from their extensive film experience.

Note that there are many different interpretations on boundaries and existence of certain neighbourhoods, as neighbourhood is not an administrative category, but unofficial geographical notion. Centar Independence square National Museum of Montenegro Historically known as Nova Varo≈° (\\"New Town\\"), this neighbourhood roughly corresponds to the traditional city centre of Podgorica. It is bounded by Ivana Crnojeviƒáa Boulevard to the north, Svetog Petra Cetinjskog Boulevard to the south, Stanka Dragojeviƒáa Boulevard to the west, and Ribnica River to the east. It is the administrative, as well as socio- cultural heart of the city. Parliament of Montenegro, Central Bank of Montenegro, Montenegrin National Theatre and Podgorica City Assembly are located within this part of town. It is also home to most of Podgorica's caf√©s, nightclubs and retail establishments. Hercegovaƒçka Street and Slobode Street, the city's main promenades, are completely within the city centre. The Square of the Republic, traditionally considered the heart of Podgorica, is positioned at the centre of this neighbourhood. Architecturally, the neighbourhood is a mix of typical Montenegrin interwar housing, and SFRY-era high-rises which filled in vacant lots that remained after the World War II devastation. The city centre saw heavy investments in recent years, in order to make it a presentable city centre for a state capital. Preko Moraƒçe Moscow Street Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ The neighbourhood's name, Preko Moraƒçe, literally translates to \\"Across the Moraƒça River\\", which refers to its location, across the river, relative to the city centre. The majority of the neighbourhood was built right after World War II, incorporating basic residential buildings typical for post-World War II FPR Yugoslavia (mostly 5-6 story multiple-entrance wide pavilions in addition to a few single-entrance buildings up to 10 stories). Originally, it housed the families of Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) personnel and other state officials, although this has changed in recent years, as many original owners sold their apartments. Ever since its early construction, the neighbourhood has locally gained the reputation as a desirable place for living, sought after for its comparatively well-executed urbanistic plan with wide streets and extensive greenery. Although the residential buildings incorporate uninventive and basic designs, they are built in a solid way, so as to cope with aging very well. Svetog Petra Cetinjskog Boulevard in this part of town is favourite promenade of Podgorica citizens, and is lined with numerous cafes and restaurants. This part of town is also home to the various Government ministries and agencies and Moraƒça Sports Center. =Kru≈°evac and Vectra area= 250px Kru≈°evac settlement is an extension of Preko Moraƒçe neighbourhood. It extends to the southwest of the Boulevard of the Revolution, and is home to Clinical centre of Montenegro, RTCG building, National Security Agency of Montenegro and Kru≈°evac Park (also known as Park Petroviƒáa), arguably the most beautiful and spacious public park in Podgorica. Vectra area got its name after the company that built the first building in this part of Preko Moraƒçe. The area is located around the Roman Square (colloquially known as Vectra square). It is bound by Svetog Petra Cetinjskog Boulevard on the north, Moskovska Street on the east, Revolucije Boulevard on the south, and D≈æord≈æa Va≈°ingtona Boulevard on the west. It is the location of headquarters Montenegrin telecommunication carriers, numerous banks, two luxury hotels and vast number of exclusive cafes, restaurants and boutiques. St. Peter of Cetinje Square and Cetinjski Put boulevard extend to the west from the neighbourhood, and are home to Altas Capital Center and Delta City shopping mall. This neighbourhood is sometimes referred to as the New Podgorica centre and boasts some of the highest real- estate prices in Podgorica. Blok 5, Blok 6, and Blok 9 George Washington Boulevard Buildings at Blok 5 and 6 Residential blocks 5, 6 and 9 are the only neighbourhoods that kept the Blok designation as their common name, in contrast to other newer parts of town, that got other nicknames. Blocks 5, 6 and 9 are bounded by St. Peter of Cetinje Boulevard on the south, George Washington Boulevard on the east, Dalmatinska Street on the north, and blend with Tolo≈°i neighbourhood on the west. The Blocks are relatively new, as construction started in 1980s. They consist of high-rise residential buildings, up to 16 stories high. Many consider Blocks the most family- friendly parts of town, as they have vast pedestrian-only spaces, many playgrounds, sports fields and greenery. They also incorporate wide streets, and relatively enough parking spaces, a rarity in today's Podgorica. Tolo≈°i Tolo≈°i is the westernmost part of Podgorica, and an extension of Blok 5-6 area. A low-rise residential neighbourhood, it is mostly located between Dalmatinska and SKOJ-a streets. Before its development began, it was a physically detached suburb of Podgorica with mostly rural features. This neglect from the urban planning point of view resulted in poor infrastructure, a problem evident even today as it's still rare to find a street in Tolo≈°i that has features such as sidewalks or drainage system. Momi≈°iƒái Momi≈°iƒái Momi≈°iƒái neighbourhood curves around the foot of Malo Brdo (\\"Little Hill\\"), and also up its southeastern slopes. It consists mostly of lowrise private family houses, except in its southern tip, which is home to University of Montenegro's Faculty of Economics and Faculty of Law buildings, Podgorica Basic Court, and various residential highrises. Gornja Gorica and Donja Gorica right Gornja Gorica and Donja Gorica are named after the hill that separates them. However, There are two hills named Gorica in Podgorica: one overlooking the very city center, and one 4 km to the east, on the southeastern outskirts of the city. For easier orientation, they will be referred to as Central Gorica Hill, and East Gorica Hill in the text below. Gornja Gorica (\\"Upper Gorica\\") is neighbourhood located to the north of Cetinjski Road, and east of East Gorica Hill. It is a residential neighbourhood, except for the strip surrounding Cetinjski Road, which is packed with commercial facilities, such as Delta City Montenegro. Donja Gorica (\\"Lower Gorica\\") is neighbourhood which strethces along the road towards Cetinje, south of East Gorica Hill. It can be considered a suburb, due to its physical detachment from the rest of the city. It consists mostly of lowrise residential developments, except the part by the highway, which has a number of stores and warehouses. As with Tolo≈°i, the residential part of those neighbourhoods developed in a spontaneous and informal way, resulting in winding and narrow streets between the private housing. Pod Goricom Pod Goricom is urban neighbourhood that is located on the southeastern slopes of Central Gorica Hill, and is an extension to the city centre. It is known as exclusive residential neighbourhood, especially the section designated Gorica C. It is a residence of choice for majority of politicians and Montenegrin nouveau riche, as well as Podgorica City Stadium (Pod Goricom Stadium). Zagoriƒç Zagoriƒç, Masline, and Zlatica residential areas Zagoriƒç is the part of town located north of Central Gorica Hill. Its name is derived from the expression Iza Gorice (\\"Behind Gorica\\"). It is entirely lowrise residential area. Zlatica and Masline Zlatica and Masline are entirely residential neighbourhoods in northeast Podgorica. Zlatica stretches along the motorway towards Kola≈°in, while Masline are south to the Zlatica, and north of Ribnica River. Masline is home to the biggest army camp within Municipality of Podgorica. ll characteristics that apply to Tolo≈°i and Gorica's can be found in Zlatica and Masline, especially lack of urban planning in some areas. Konik Konik is a residential neighbourhood, almost entirely lowrise, in Podgorica's eastern part. Its most distinctive feature is that it is home to Podgorica's Romani minority, and has an image of underdeveloped part of town. However, construction boom in late 2000s (decade) has benefited Konik, as its proximity to city center has made it attractive for development. Konik is home to only Catholic church in Podgorica. Ribnica river Vrela Ribnice Vrela Ribnice, or Vrela Ribniƒçka is an extension of Konik to the south-east. This easternmost Podgorica neighbourhood is home to a large Roma population, as well as to refugees and displaced persons from Yugoslav wars. In contrast to most other Podgorica lowrise residential neighbourhoods, Vrela Ribniƒçka has been built according to strict grid plan. However, infrastructure of the area is still underdeveloped. On its southeastern tip, it features a refugee camp, mostly settled by displaced persons from Yugoslav wars, city landfills and many garbage processing facilities. Draƒç and Stara Varo≈° Stara Varo≈° Draƒç and Stara Varo≈° (\\"Old Town\\") are parts of town located south-east to the confluence of Ribnica and Moraƒça rivers. Stara Varo≈°'s boundaries are Moraƒça and Ribnica rivers, Kralja Nikole street, and Crnogorskih Serdara boulevard. Draƒç is bounded by Belgrade - Bar railway, Oktobarske Revolucije street, Pete Proleterske Boulevard and Bratstva - Jedinstva street. They formed one compact neighbourhood before World War II, but since then they were split with highrise apartment blocks, built during SFRY. They are a historical core of the city, and are the last remnants of Ottoman architecture in Podgorica. Stara Varo≈° is home to Podgorica's two mosques and Turkish clock tower. Both neighbourhoods are mostly residential, and incorporate narrow and curvy streets, typical for old Turkish town. Unlike Ba≈°ƒçar≈°ija and similar examples, Ottoman heritage of Podgorica has not been preserved well, and old Ottoman housing is mixed with newer developments throughout the neighbourhoods. Thus, touristic potential diminished, and economic activity in the area has plummeted, with development of newer neighbourhoods. Because of this, Draƒç and Stara Varo≈° remain neglected residential areas, despite their central location and historical significance. Zabjelo left Zabjelo is a large neighbourhood in southern Podgorica. It is located to the south of Ljuboviƒá hill, Bracana Bracanoviƒáa street and west of 4th July street. It is the southernmost neighbourhood of Podgorica, and largest one by area. It is uncertain whether the smaller neighbourhoods such as Pobre≈æje and Zelenika could be considered a part of Zabjelo. Official stance of Zabjelo locals is - that they are, when speaking to people from other parts of the city, trying to emphasize how big is their neighbourhood. But, when speaking with inhabitants from Pobre≈æje and Zelenika - true Zabjelo local would strongly deny any links. Zabjelo is known by its characteristic subculture. Zabjelo's residents are known for their casual and laid-back lifestyle, and particularly for their strong native identity and appreciation for their neighbourhood as well as humorous critical attitude towards other fancy parts of the town. Zabjelo has no distinctive landmarks, the infrastructure is poor, yet, it is mostly loved by its residents. A locally famous organization called \\"The Republic of Zabjelo\\" has existed since 12 September 1991, and among its \\"demands\\" is the secession of Zabjelo from the Republic of Montenegro, which was a provocative response to the breakup of the former Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia. Most of the people from this organization were affiliated with the first urban initiatives in Podgorica - such as radio Antena M and Omladinski grafiti magazine. Zabjelo was originally a hard-core workers' suburb, but after the 1990s and construction boom in Podgorica it saw strong urban development. Now it is dominated by residential buildings for mid-income families. However, unlike Blok 5 and Preko Moraƒçe, Zabjelo has pockets of lowrise residential areas. In the same way - the local way of life changed, and from raw and hostile neighbourhood turns into the generally calm and easy-going part of the city. Stari Aerodrom ≈†piro Mugo≈°a Airport Stari Aerodrom (\\"Old Airport\\") is a neighbourhood located between the Konik neighbourhood, Belgrade‚ÄìBar railway and the road towards Tuzi. It is relatively new part of town, and hence an entirely planned one. It consists of mixed highrise buildings and lowrise private dwellings, and boasts wide streets and good infrastructure. It now witnesses a construction boom as it has abundance of empty spaces for development, and is relatively well connected with the city centre. The neighbourhood houses the Albanian and Polish embassies to Montenegro, as well as the Coca-Cola bottling plant, owned by Coca-Cola HBC. Tu≈°ki put Tu≈°ki put is a neighbourhood located east of 4th July street and south of Bracana Bracanoviƒáa street. The latter street extends towards town of Tuzi, hence the name Tu≈°ki put, which means Road of Tuzi. Tu≈°ki put is a mixed commercial- residential neighbourhood, and was the location of the largest open marketplace in Podgorica. The marketplace has relocated to a section of Mall of Montenegro, but informal market still exists. The residential area is composed of basic residential buildings typical of SFRY-era, and has traditionally boasted the image of underdeveloped and low income part of town. Next to Mall of Montenegro is Hotel Ramada and one small neighbourhood called Baston.

He began his official career as a librarian, then became part of the management of the Imperial Theatres, and lastly served as director of the Moscow Armory Museum. In the 1810s and 20s he published a series of comedies. His best known work, the historical novel Yury Miloslavsky, was published in 1829 and became the first Russian best-seller. His historical novels, including Yury Miloslavsky, were open imitations of Sir Walter Scott, and were immensely popular. Zagoskin attempted to Russify his characters and provided authentic descriptive detail; his \\"contribution lies in his innovative of language to create an illusion of antiquity. The dramatist in him shows through in the preponderance of dialogue over description or exposition, and in the use of colloquial speech, and the oral speech of the common people.\\" Sergey Aksakov described the extraordinary impact of Yury Miloslavsky: > We did not yet have a popular writer in the accurate and full sense of the > word . . . our distance from the people and their low literacy being direct > and readily apparent obstacles. [...] But Zagoskin more than anyone else can > be called a popular writer. In addition to other classes, he has been read > and is read by all merchant peasants able to read. . . .

In 1831 Frederick Chamier was engaged to edit the translated transcript of Zagoskin's novel Dmitrich Miloslawsky (actually his first novel - \\"Yuri Miloslavsky, or the Russians in 1612\\") to be issued in England as The Young Muscovite; or, The Poles in Russia, apparently dating from 1824. The translation had been provided from Moscow by a Russian lady of rank and her two daughters. The books publication was ceaselessly reported as imminent for publication throughout 1831 and early 1834. It was intended to publish in three parts, however it would not appear on London bookshelves till March of 1834 and when it did, it was found, to have been extensively adapted to acclaim by Charmier.

It is the primary grape of the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) wines of Cortese dell'Alto Monferrato and Colli Tortonesi as well as the Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wine of Cortese di Gavi. Significant plantings of Cortese can also be found in the Lombardy region of Oltrep√≤ Pavese and in the DOC white blends of the Veneto wine region of Bianco di Custoza. Cortese has a long history in Italian viticulture with written documentation naming the grape among the plantings in a Piedmontese vineyard as early as 1659. The grape's moderate acidity and light flavors has made it a favorite for the restaurants in nearby Genoa as a wine pairing with the local seafood caught off the Ligurian coast. History The village and vineyards of Gavi in the Alessandria province where Cortese has a long history of cultivation. One of the earliest documentation of the Cortese grape dates back to a 1659 report to the Marchesa Doria from the estate manager of the family's villa in Montaldeo that states that all the vineyards were planted with Cortese and Vermentino. In 1870, the ampelographers P.P. DeMaria and Carlo Leardi noted that the Cortese was being widely cultivated in the Alessandria province of Piedmont where it was prized for its hardiness to grape diseases and ability to produce large crop yields as well as it high quality wine. Wine regions Today Cortese is most widely associated with the DOCG wine Cortese di Gavi produced in the Gavi region of Alessandria. There are significant plantings of the grape throughout southeastern Piedmont including the DOC wine producing areas of Colli Tortonesi and Cortese dell'Alto Monferrato located a few miles to the west of Gavi and of Monferrato Casalese Cortese which extends to the Basso Monferrato north of the Tanaro. Despite the proximity to Gavi, Cortese experiences a significantly difficult time of the grapes fully ripening in Tortona and Monferrato. Piemonte Cortese DOC can be made in the Province of Cuneo to the west, and Alessandria and Asti. Outside of Piedmont the grape can be found in significant quantities in the Oltrep√≤ Pavese, part of the Province of Pavia in Lombardy which borders the Province of Alessandria. Further east, Garda Cortese DOC is produced in the hills near Lake Garda (provinces of Brescia and Mantova in Lombardy, and the province of Verona in the Veneto). The grape may also be used as part of the blend for the Bianco di Custoza DOC, also near Lake Garda in the Province of Verona. As of 2000, there were of Cortese planted throughout Italy. Wines Wines made from Cortese (particularly those from the DOCG Gavi) have long been favored by restaurants in the southern neighboring port of Genoa as a wine pairing with the local seafood caught off the Ligurian coast. The wine's moderate acidity and light, crisp flavors pair well with the delicate flavors of some fish. Cortese wines tend to be medium bodied with notes of limes and greengage. In vintages that are particularly cool, the wines can be aggressively acidic and lean, but winemaking techniques such as malolactic fermentation and oak barrel fermentation can temper that. Synonyms Cortese is also known under the synonyms Bianca Fernanda, Corteis, Cortese Bianca, Cortese Bianco, Cortese d'Asti, Cortese dell'Astigliano, Courteis, Cortesi, Courteisa, Fernanda Bianca, and Raverusto.Vitis International Variety Catalogue link References Category:White wine grape varieties Category:Wine grapes of Piedmont ","title":"Cortese"},{"id":"11835762","text":"The 1992 Hopman Cup was the fourth edition to the Hopman Cup tennis event.

He was a noted bibliophile, epigraphist, collector, and patron of art. Born to a patrician family, Pietro received his education at the humanist boarding school of Gasparino Barzazzi.Mary Bergstein (2002), \\"Donatello's \\"Gattamelata\\" and Its Humanist Audience,\\" Renaissance Quarterly, 55(3), 857. Promoted by Biagio Pelacani, he eventually received an arts degree from the University of Padua.John Monfasani (1993), \\"Aristotelians, Platonists, and the Missing Ockhamists: Philosophical Liberty in Pre-Reformation Italy,\\" Renaissance Quarterly, 46(2), 267. He was a Thomist. As a humanist he kept a correspondence with Poggio Bracciolini.In a 1424 letter to Pietro, Poggio explains that the Epicureans are dissolute, the Stoics severe, and only the Peripatetics should be preferred, quoted in Iiro Kajanto (1989), \\"A Humanist Credo: Poggio Bracciolinin on the Meaning of Studia, Humanitas, and Virtus,\\" Arctos: Acta Philologica Fennica, (23), 92. After the death of Franciscus Zabarella, papatu dignissimus iudicatus (\\"adjudged worthy of the papacy\\"), in late September 1417 at the Council of Constance, Pietro was one of those attending who, along with Barzazzi and Pierpaolo Vergerio, composed a eulogy for the cardinal.Thomas E. Morrissey (1984), \\"The Call for Unity at the Council of Constance: Sermons and Addresses of Cardinal Zabarella, 1415-1417,\\" Church History, 53(3), 307. The eulogy is published under the title Oratio in exequiis Domini Francisci Zabarellae (\\"Oration on the death of Lord Francis Zabarella\\"). Pietro and Giovanni Berardi, Archbishop of Taranto, were co- presidents of the Council of Basel appointed by Pope Eugene IV. He and Berardi protested the Council after the eighteenth session (26 June 1434) re-affirmed the Haec sancta and the twenty-first session (9 June 1435) abolished the annates. On 11 August 1435 the Council officially reprimanded them, requesting that they lose their objections.Joachim W. Stieber (1978), Pope Eugenius IV, the Council of Basel and the Secular and Ecclesiastical Authorities in the Empire: The Conflict Over Supreme Authority and Power in the Church (BRILL), 36 n51. Pietro later toured southern Germany in 1437. He attended the Council of Florence in 1438-39 and 1442. Image from the Notitia manuscript commissioned by Pietro in 1436 For Pietro Donato, the year 1436 was an auspicious for manuscript-commissioning. First, there is an illuminated Latin Gospel book, now manuscript 180 in the Pierpont Morgan Library, that was created for Donato in Padua in 1436. The chief illuminator was Johannes de Monterchio, while the frontispiece was by Peronet Lamy.Maestro di Pietro Donato: Gospel Lectionary. Second, Pietro commissioned an illustrated copy of the Notitia Dignitatum in 1436; it now resides as MS Canon. Misc. 378 in the Bodleian Library.Bodleian Library: Classical & Medieval Manuscripts. The largest single purchase of manuscripts (over two thousand) by the Bodleian was that of the greater part of the collection of the Venetian former Jesuit Matteo Luigi Canonici (1727-c.1806) in 1817. Canonici's manuscripts included the Notitia originally created for Pietro. The manuscript of the Notitia which Pietro had copied was one he had found in Speyer, the Codex Spirensis earlier that year attending the council at Basel; its discovery influenced the Roma instaurata of Flavius Blondus.Gustina Scaglia (1964), \\"The Origin of an Archaeological Plan of Rome by Alessandro Strozzi,\\" Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, 27, 142-43, 153. The work of Frontinus on the aqueducts of Rome and Vitruvius's De architectura were preserved in very poor manuscripts until Giovanni Giocondo edited them in the 1430s, for presentation to Pietro.Jill Kraye (1996), The Cambridge Companion to Renaissance Humanism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), 37. As an epigraphist, Pietro compiled ancient inscriptions and collected many ancient artefacts.Scaglia, 142. The Codex Hamilton, MS 254 in the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, was such an epigraphic collectanea. It was compiled, at least in part (folios 81-90), by Ciriaco d'Ancona, and based on one of his three visits to Athens (1436, 1437-8, and 1444). With the aid of a scribe and a draughtsman, Ciriaco created a portfolio of sketches of several ancient Greek ruins, most notably the Parthenon, for Pietro.Vincent J. Burno (1996), The Parthenon: Illustrations, Introductory Essay, History, Archeological Analysis, Criticism (New York: W. W. Norton & Company), 114-23, does not claim to know when Ciriaco's portfolio was presented to Pietro. Bergstein, 857, dates it to 1437. For Pietro's collectanea and friendship with Ciriaco, see Theodor Mommsen (1883), \\"√úber die Berliner Excerptenhandschrift des Petrus Donatus,\\" Jahrbuch der k√∂niglich preussischen Kunstsammlungen, 4, 78. Pietro possessed an exemplary copy of the Chronicon of Eusebius in Jerome's translation. He also owned 358 manuscripts of Thomas Aquinas, including the Prima pars and the Prima secundae.Jocelyn N. Hillgarth (1991), \\"Who Read Thomas Aquinas?\\" The √âtienne Gilson Lectures on Thomas Aquinas, James P. Reilly, ed. (PIMS), 64 n77. The chief work on Pietro's library is Paolo Sambin (1959), \\"Ricerche per la storia della cultura nel secolo XV: la biblioteca di Pietro Donato (1380-1447),\\" Bolletino del Museo Civico di Padova, 48, 53-98. Ciriaco's sketch of the Parthenon in the Codex Hamilton It has been suggested that Pietro, among other Paduan humanists, like Ciriaco, Francesco Barbaro, Jacopo Zeno, Palla Strozzi, and Leon Battista Alberti, may have influenced the classicism of the work of Donatello--especially his equestrian monument to Gattamelata--during his Paduan years (1444-53), when he had a studio near the Santo.Bergstein, 35: \\"it is possible that informal meetings pertinent the classical elements in Donatello's Paduan work took place [at Donatello's studio near the Santo].\\" Pietro had work done on the episcopal palace during his tenure. In 1437 he contracted one Giovanni da Ulma to redecorate the chapel of San Massimo there.Ian Holgate (2003), \\"Giovanni d'Alemagna, Antonio Vivarini and the Early History of the Ovetari Chapel,\\" Artibus et Historiae, 24(47), 24. In 1937 Erice Rigone, who discovered the contract of 25 February 1437, argued that \\"Giovanni da Ulma\\" was the same person as Giovanni d'Alemagna (\\"John of Germany\\"), partner of Antonio Vivarini. In 1437, he argued, Giovanni was new to Italy and his birth city of Ulm (Ulma) was still well-known. Indeed, Pietro had returned to Italy that year with a retinue of Germans, whose names are recorded with specific reference to their cities. Pietro may have inquired about a cycle of frescoes executed by Giovanni for the Venetian Giovanni Cornaro: this work is referenced in the contract of 1437. In 1444 Pietro commissioned Giovanni da Firenze to make the current font for the baptistry; Giovanni also repaved the interior and redid the tombs.Howard Saalman (1987), \\"Carrara Burials in the Baptistery of Padua,\\" The Art Bulletin, 69(3), 384, and see figures 9 and 10. In 1445 he completely rebuilt the bishop's residence in a sumptuous manner.Jacob Burckhardt; James C. Palmes, ed.

The Palazzo del Podest√† is a long building, with a large hall on the upper floor. The lower floor is a double open arcade, the so-called Voltone del Podest√†, through which pass two lanes of shops. In 1453 Aristotile Fioravanti replaced the bell and reconstructed the original Gothic fa√ßade in the Renaissance style by order of Giovanni II Bentivoglio. In the Voltone, in 1525, were placed the terracotta statues of the city's protectors, Sts. Petronius, Proculus, Dominic and Francis, all by Alfonso Lombardi. In the 16th-18th centuries the Palazzo was used as theatre. In the 20th century it was frescoed by Adolfo de Carolis.

Quill pen and ink bottle. A nib is the part of a quill, dip pen, fountain pen, or stylus which comes into contact with the writing surface in order to deposit ink. Different types of nibs vary in their purpose, shape and size, as well as the material from which they are made. History =Quill= The quill replaced the reed pen across Europe by the Early Middle Ages and remained the main writing tool of the West for nearly a thousand years until the 17th century. Quills are fashioned by cutting a nib into the end of a feather obtained from a fairly large bird, such as a goose, traditionally from its left wing. A quill has the advantage of being more durable and more flexible than a reed pen, and it can also retain ink in the hollow shaft of the feather, known as the calamus, allowing more writing time between ink dippings. The quill was in common use until the early 19th century and the advent of the metal nib. For business purposes, the quill was fairly quickly overtaken; however, it remains popular for personal use and for artistic work.\\"The Quill Pen\\" on Colonial Williamsbourgh\\"A Brief History of Writing Instruments\\" by Mary Bellis on About.com\\"History 101: Pens and Ink\\", Daily Kos, 16 Nov 2013 =Metal= Metal nib by Perry & Co.. Metal nibs have their origins as far back as ancient Egypt and were made of metals like copper and bronze. However, the quality of writing that could be achieved with these pens was inferior to that of reed pens. Metallic nibs were made up through the 18th-century as one-off, craftsman-made luxury items. In the early 1800s, Wise in Britain, and Peregrine Williamson in the United States were the first recorded makers of steel pens as their primary occupation. It was not until the 1820s, when John Mitchell, Josiah Mason and others set up a factory in Birmingham, England to manufacture steel nibs, that their popularity took off. The metal nib retains a sharp point or edge much longer than the quill, which wears out more quickly and requires much skill to sharpen. Metal nibs are also easily manufactured to have different properties for different purposes. Also, they can now be attached to and removed from holders, allowing one to switch between nibs with relative ease.  Nib types  broad nib. Pointed nib, flexed and unflexed Pen nibs come in a variety of different shapes and sizes for different purposes but can be split into two main types: broad nibs and pointed nibs. =Broad nib= The broad nib, also called broad- edge or chisel-edge, is the older of the two nib types. It is rigid and has a flat edge. The pen is usually held at a constant angle to the horizontal; different scripts require different nib angles. Thick and thin strokes are created by varying the direction of the stroke. Many writing styles have developed over the centuries with the broad nib, including the medieval Uncial, Blackletter and Carolingian minuscule scripts (and their variants), the Italic Hand of the Renaissance, and more recently Edward Johnston's Foundational Hand, developed in the early 20th century. =Pointed nib= The pointed nib is flexible and comes to a sharp point rather than a broad edge. Thick and thin strokes are achieved by varying the amount of pressure on the nib. Thick lines are created on downstrokes by pushing down on the nib, causing the nib tines to splay and allowing more ink to flow through the widened slit onto the writing surface. Lighter pressure produces less flexing of the tines, creating thinner strokes. The finest hairline strokes are created on the upstrokes and sideways strokes. Due to the shape of the pointed nib, thick lines can only be produced on downstrokes. If too much pressure is applied to the pen on an upstroke, the nib tines are likely to dig into the paper. Pointed nibs originated in the 17th century and were initially created by hand from quills in a similar fashion to broad-edge nibs. Towards the end of the Industrial Revolution in the early 19th century, high demand for nibs coupled with steel manufacturing processes eventually led to the mass production of the steel nib. Pointed nibs also led to the development of newer styles of penmanship such as the English Round Hand and Copperplate scripts during the 17th and 18th centuries, as well as the Spencerian script in the 19th century. Pointed pens are also used by artists and drafters for sketching, mapping and technical drawing. Although any pointed nib can be used for drawing, there are nibs available that resemble writing nibs but are specially designed for pen drawing. =Stub nib= A stub nib usually lies somewhere between a broad and a pointed nib. The stub nib comes to a flat point, like a broad nib, and pulling the pen down will create a wider line than a line drawn across, again, like a broad nib. The main differences are in matters of degree. In a stub nib, the nib is generally smaller than in a broad nib, though there are some very broad nibs that would be considered a stub nib. In a stub nib, the corners are more rounded than in a sharp broad nib used for decorative writing. This is because stub nibs on steel pens were invented as a reaction to the sharp and scratchy nature of the early pointed steel pens, and are intended to be for rapid and easy writing.The American Stationer, 12 February 1889, p.331 Many of the early steel stub nibs were marketed to professions who had a need to write large amounts of text rapidly, without caring if the text was finely written or not. Names such as Judge's Quill, or Probate Pen or Lawyer's Pen all point to the legal profession as a major type of customer. You also had other professions like Chancellors or Congressional which imply people who needed to write a lot, and to write it quickly and easily. One finds stub nibs most often today on fountain pens. These are usually measured in millimeters. (common sizes range from .9mm up to 1.1 or 1.5mm, though one can find others outside of this range) On fountain pens, the difference between a broad nib and a stub nib can get even murkier with all of the variations ranging from what's often called an Italic nib, which tends to have sharper corners like a traditional broad dip nib, to a Cursive Italic or some such variation with more rounded corners to facilitate smooth and continuous writing. A stub nib can be a good choice if one hopes to achieve modulation in line (thick and thin) you can get with a flexible nib, but if they also want the smoother and easier action of a monoline (non- flexible) nib. To write with a stub nib, just as you do with a broad nib, you try and hold it at a consistent angle to the line of writing. For italic writing, that can be 45¬∞. For general cursive, traditionally with a stub dip pen, they would hold the pen at 0¬∞, or parallel to the line of writing. The best advice is to experiment and see which angle seems more pleasing with your style of writing. One modern example of someone using a stub nib for rapid, and most certainly, extensive writing was the author Shelby Foote, the historian of the American Civil War. In an interview with the Paris Review he reveals that he wrote the entire transcript of his 3000+ page history of the Civil War with an Esterbrook #313 Probate Pen, a rather broad stub dip pen. Fountain pen nibs Detail of a Visconti stainless steel fountain pen nib and feed Tip of a fountain pen nib According to Mathur et al., \\"the modern fountain pen nib may be traced back to the original gold nib which had a tiny fragment of ruby attached to form the wear-point.\\" Following the discovery of the platinum group of metals which include ruthenium, osmium and iridium, \\"a small quantity of iridium was isolated and used on the iridium-tipped gold dip pen nibs of the 1830s\\". Today, nibs are usually made of stainless steel or gold alloys, with the most popular gold content being 14 carat (58‚Öì%) and 18 carat (75%). Titanium is a less common metal used for making nibs. Gold is considered the optimum metal for its flexibility and its resistance to corrosion, although gold's corrosion resistance is less of an issue than in the past because of better stainless steel alloys and less corrosive inks. =Nib plating= Further gold plating provides favorable wettability, which is the ability of a solid surface to reduce the surface tension of a liquid in contact with it such that it spreads over the surface. =Nib tipping= Gold and most steel and titanium nibs are tipped with a hard, wear-resistant alloy that typically includes metals from the platinum group. These metals share qualities of extreme hardness and corrosion resistance. The tipping material is often called \\"iridium\\", but there are few if any, nib or pen manufacturers that used tipping alloys containing iridium metal since the mid-1950s. The metals osmium, rhenium, ruthenium and tungsten are used instead, generally as an alloy, shaped into tiny pellets which are soldered or welded onto a nib tip prior to cutting the nib slit and grinding the tip into its final shape. Untipped steel and titanium points will wear more rapidly due to abrasion by the paper. =Capillary action= The nib usually has a tapering slit cut down its centre, to convey the ink down the nib by capillary action, as well as a breather hole of varying shape. The breather hole allows air into the feed, and back up to the sac. The breather hole also acts as a stress relieving point, preventing the nib from cracking longitudinally from the end of the slit as a result of repeated flexing during use. Adding distance between the breather hole and the nib tip adds elasticity or flexibility to the nib. The whole nib narrows to a point where the ink is transferred to the paper. Broad calligraphy pens may have several slits in the nib to increase ink flow and help distribute it evenly across the broad point. Nibs divided into three \\"tines\\" are commonly known as music nibs. This is because their line, which can be varied from broad to fine, is suited for writing musical scores. =Types of nib= Although the most common nibs end in a round point of various sizes (extra fine, fine, medium, broad), various other nib shapes are available. Examples of this are oblique, reverse oblique, stub, italic and 360-degree nibs. Broader nibs are used for less precise emphasis, with the benefit of a greater level of ink shading and/or sheen on less absorbent paper. Finer nibs (e.g. EF and F) may be used for intricate corrections and alterations, at the expense of shading and sheen. Oblique, reverse oblique, stub and italic nibs may be used for calligraphic purposes or for general handwritten compositions. The line width of a particular nib may vary based on its country of origin; Japanese nibs are often thinner in general. =Nib flexibility= Flexibility is given to nibs in several ways. First, thickness of the nib metal changes flex. When the nib alloy has been pressed thick it will result in a hard nib, while thinly pressed nibs are more flexible. Nibs can be pressed so that they are thinner at the tip and thicker at the feed to mitigate stiffness or to give a more controlled flex. Second, the curve of the nib determines in part how stiff the nib will be. Nibs pressed into more deeply convex curves, or into three or five faceted curves, will be stiffer than flatter nibs. Third, the \\"breather hole\\" size, shape, and position alter the stiffness. Heart-shaped holes will improve flex as they widen, while round, small holes stiffen the pen. Fourth, the length of the tines determines how far they can spread under pressure, shorter tines make a stiffer nib. Fifth, the alloy used can affect stiffness: as mentioned before, gold is considered superior for its flex compared to steel. Moreover, purer gold (18k and 21k) is softer than most lower gold concentration (14k) alloys. Mabie Todd Swan flexible 14k nib. Fountain pens dating from the first half of the 20th century are more likely to have flexible nibs, suited to the favored handwriting styles of the period (e.g. Copperplate script and Spencerian script). By the 1940s, writing preferences had shifted towards stiffer nibs that could withstand the greater pressure required for writing through carbon paper to create duplicate documents. Furthermore, competition between the major pen brands such as Parker and Waterman, and the introduction of lifetime guarantees, meant that flexible nibs could no longer be supported profitably. In countries where this rivalry was not present to the same degree, for example the UK and Germany, flexible nibs are more common. Nowadays, stiff nibs are the norm as people exchange between fountain pens and other writing modes. These more closely emulate the ballpoint pens modern users are experienced with. Despite being rigid and firm, the idea that steel nibs write \\"horribly\\" is a misconception. More flexible nibs can be easily damaged by ballpoint users who write with excessive pressure. Ideally, a fountain pen's nib glides across the paper using the ink as a lubricant and requires no pressure. Good quality nibs that have been used appropriately are long lasting, often lasting longer than the lifetime of the original owner. Many vintage pens with decades-old nibs can still be used today. Hero Pen The Integral Nib of a Parker 50 (Falcon) =Different nib styles= Other styles of fountain pen nibs include hooded (e.g. Parker 51, Parker 61, 2007 Parker 100 and Hero 329), inlaid (e.g. Sheaffer Targa or Sheaffer P.F.M) or integral Nib (Parker T-1 and Falcon, Pilot Myu 701), which may also be ground to have different writing characteristics. Users are often cautioned not to lend or borrow fountain pens as the nib \\"wears in\\" at an angle unique to each individual person. A different user is likely to find that a worn-in nib does not write satisfactorily in their hand and, furthermore, creates a second wear surface, ruining the nib for the original user. This, however, is not a point of concern in pens with modern, durable tipping material, as these pens take many years to develop any significant wear.

In 1993, he made the then-largest private donation to a public park when he promised $17 million if the Conservancy and the municipality did the same. He was also a trustee of the Morgan Library and Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Thomas Jefferson Foundation. He was chairman emeritus of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think-tank, and the Club for Growth, a conservative political action committee, to which his ex-wife Virginia James continues to be a major donor. In 2005, Gilder and Lewis Lehrman received the National Humanities Medal for their work promoting the study of American history. He then set up a PhD. program at the American Museum of Natural History in his own name, the Richard Gilder Graduate School at AMNH.

During World War II, Zag√≥rski published texts in the Sztuka i Nar√≥d underground magazine. The Zag√≥rski couple with their three children resided in Bielany, suburb of Warsaw. During the German occupation of Poland they harboured eighteen (18) people of Jewish descent between 1942 and the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. Among them was the poet Tadeusz Holender and Mrs. Kott given the documents of Maria's sister-in-law. Another fugitive, thirteen-year-old boy Janek Wilk, was introduced to neighbors as Maria's nephew. Danuta Grossfeld also spent some months in their home as well as the Tenenbaums (three persons), who found refuge there after fleeing the Ghetto. Their father-in-law, Mr. Kitel came all stained by blood of his wife shot during that escape. People started to talk that the Zagorskis harbor Jews. As a precaution, they placed the boy and Tadeusz Holender with a female friend. Jerzy and Maria returned to Warsaw in 1945 and found their home ruined.

Early life She was born Beatrice Bertha BenjaminChinen, Nate, \\"Sathima Bea Benjamin, Jazz Singer and Activist, Dies at 76\\", The New York Times, 29 August 2013. in Claremont, Cape Town, South Africa;\\"Sathima Bea Benjamin\\", South African History Online. her father, Edward Benjamin, was from the island of St. Helena off the coast of West Africa, and her mother, Evelyn Henry, had roots in Mauritius and the Philippines. As an adolescent, she first performed popular music in talent contests at the local cinema (bioscope) during the intermission. By the 1950s she was singing at various nightclubs, community dances and social events, performing with notable Cape Town pianists Tony Schilder and Henry February, among others. She built her repertoire watching British and American movies and transcribing lyrics from songs heard on the radio, where she discovered Nat King Cole, Billie Holiday, Doris Day, Ella Fitzgerald. These musicians would come to influence her singing style, notably in terms of light phrasing and clear diction. At the age of 21, she joined Arthur Klugman's travelling show Coloured Jazz and Variety on a tour of South Africa. When the production failed, she found herself stranded in Mozambique, where she met South African saxophonist Kippie Moeketsi. In 1959, she returned to Cape Town's now thriving jazz scene, where she met pianist Dollar Brand (later known as Abdullah Ibrahim), whom she would marry in 1965. In that same year she recorded what would have been the first jazz LP in South Africa's history. Entitled My Songs for You, with accompaniment by Ibrahim's trio, the recording of mostly standards was never released. Sharpeville Massacre and Europe In the aftermath of South Africa's Sharpeville Massacre of 1960, Benjamin and Ibrahim left South Africa for Europe. The couple, along with Ibrahim's trio of bassist Johnny Gertze and drummer Makhaya Ntshoko, settled in Zurich, Switzerland, and worked throughout Germany and Scandinavia, meeting and occasionally working with American jazz players, including Don Byas, Dexter Gordon, Kenny Drew, Ben Webster, Bud Powell, John Coltrane, and Thelonious Monk. The artist who would have the greatest impact on Benjamin's life, however, was Duke Ellington. Duke Ellington Benjamin met Ellington while he was in Zurich in 1963. Standing in the wings during most of his band's performance, once the concert ended she insisted that Duke hear her husband's trio at the Club Africana, where Ibrahim's band had a standing engagement. Duke obliged, but insisted that Benjamin sing for him. Following this encounter, Ellington arranged for the couple to fly to Paris and record separate albums for Frank Sinatra‚Äôs Reprise label, for whom Ellington functioned as Artists and Repertoire representative. Ibrahim‚Äôs record, Duke Ellington Presents The Dollar Brand Trio, was released the following year and subsequently helped him build a following in Europe and the United States. Benjamin‚Äôs recording, however, remained unreleased and was presumed to be lost until its release in 1996 by Enja Records, under the title A Morning in Paris. The session's engineer, Gerhard Lerner, had surreptitiously made a second copy.\\"Sathima Bea Benjamin\\", Two Hundred and Ten, 1 February 2013. She maintained her musical relationship with Ellington. In 1965, he arranged to have her perform with his band in the U.S. at the Newport Jazz Festival (when she sang the Ellington ballad \\"Solitude\\"), and at one point asked her to join his band permanently. Due to her recent marriage to Ibrahim that same year, Benjamin declined the offer. South Africa, America, and Ekapa Throughout the 1960s, Benjamin and Ibrahim moved back and forth between Europe and New York City, as Ibrahim worked to establish his career. Benjamin spent much of the period as a manager and agent for her husband while raising their son, Tsakwe. The year 1976 marked a turning point for Benjamin. She and Ibrahim returned to South Africa to live; she gave birth to her daughter, Tsidi (now the underground hip-hop artist Jean Grae); and recorded African Songbird, an album of original compositions, for South Africa's Gallo Records. Shortly after Tsidi's birth, the family relocated to New York city in 1977, to the famed Hotel Chelsea. In 1979, Benjamin started the record label Ekapa to produce and distribute her and Ibrahim's music. Between 1979 and 2002, she released eight of her albums on Ekapa, including Sathima Sings Ellington, Dedications, Memories and Dreams, Windsong, Lovelight, Southern Touch, Cape Town Love, and Musical Echoes. Dedications was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1982. Benjamin's collaborators on these albums have included saxophonist Carlos Ward, pianists Stephen Scott, Kenny Barron, Larry Willis and Onaje Allan Gumbs, bassist Buster Williams and drummers Billy Higgins and Ben Riley. For the most part, Benjamin has used American musicians for her U.S. recordings and South African musicians when in Cape Town. Her 2002 recording, Musical Echoes, featured American pianist Stephen Scott with two South Africans, bassist Basil Moses and drummer Lulu Gontsana. Later career In 2000, Danish second-hand bookdealer and fan of South African jazz Lars Rasmussen published a collection of essays and a discography of Benjamin's music in Sathima Bea Benjamin: Embracing Jazz (Copenhagen, 2000). It contains two compact discs of Sathima's music: Cape Town Love and an Embracing Jazz compilation with photographs. In October 2004, South African president Thabo Mbeki gave her the Order of Ikhamanga Silver Award for \\"excellent contribution as a jazz artist\\" and for her contribution \\"to the struggle against apartheid.\\"\\"Presentation of National Honours\\", 29 October 2004. In March 2005, the art group Pen and Brush, Inc. presented her with a Certificate of Achievement for her work as a performer, musician, composer, and \\"activist in the struggle for human rights in South Africa\\". Benjamin was profiled in the March 2006 issue of JazzTimes.Kelley, Robin D. G., Sathima Bea Benjamin: The Echo Returns, JazzTimes, 1 March 2006. Her album SongSpirit, was released on 17 October 2006 in celebration of her 70th birthday. A compilation record, it includes tracks from her earlier albums, plus a previously unreleased duet with Abdullah Ibrahim from 1973. In 2007, Benjamin began reissuing her back catalogue for download. Cape Town Love, released 19 June, began the process, while A Morning in Paris was reissued in October 2007 to mark her 71st birthday. It was released for download on 16 October, and reissued on CD on 22 January 2008. In December 2008 she performed at the Apollo Theater at the closing of the concert Bricktop at the Apollo, hosted by film director Jordan Walker-Pearlman. She sang \\"Someone to Watch Over Me\\". In 2010, she was the subject of the documentary Sathima's Windsong, directed by author and professor Daniel Yon. In 2011 Duke University Press published Musical Echoes: South African Women Thinking in Jazz, which was written by Benjamin and Carol Muller, a South African ethnomusicologist, over the course of twenty years. She returned to Cape Town in 2011, where she continued to work as a vocalist.

It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Corpus Christi. Background John Paul II High School is located in Corpus Christi on the Texas Gulf Coast, and within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Corpus Christi. The high school began its inaugural year on August 1, 2006, with only one class of freshmen. Each year a new grade level was added until the school had a four year high school, spanning grades nine through twelve. The creation of John Paul II High School was the vision and inspiration of Bishop Edmond Carmody. As a Catholic school, its purposes are to provide a unique environment in which students can experience the presence of the Holy Spirit. Its focus is on the individual person's spiritual, moral, intellectual, social, cultural and physical development. The school graduated its first class of seniors in 2010; it is named in honor of Pope John Paul II. The mascot is the Centurion. On May 1, 2011, it changed its name to Blessed John Paul II High School, in honor of John Paul II's beatification. It later changed its name again, to St. John Paul II High School, in honor of John Paul's canonization. Mascot The centurion was a Roman officer commanding a century or a company, the strength of which varied between fifty and one hundred men. The centurion was the most important and most respected officer in the Roman Army. He was a leader who rose from the common ranks to high authority, selected for his excellence and example. This type of character and virtue in this man is what John Paul II High School seeks to teach and instill in its students, both in the academic and athletic endeavors. The mascot is based on the logo of the Cologne Centurions, with the red color changed to gold. Academics The school has a college preparatory education which requires four years of English, science, math, social Studies, and Catholic theology, as well as requiring several other non-core credits, those being in computer technology, communication applications, fine arts, physical education, and keyboarding or reading classes if it is deemed necessary for the student. There are also a certain number of elective credits required for graduation. Athletics, Clubs, & Extracurriculars Athletics include: football, boys and girls basketball, soccer, volleyball, baseball, softball, golf, tennis, swimming, track & field, dance/drill team and cheerleading. The varsity baseball team has won the TAPPS 4A State Championship 2 years in a row, 2010 & 2011. The school also competes in \\"Challenge!\\", a televised academic contest/tournament hosted by the local PBS station. The Centurions typically make a strong showing each year, and won the competition outright in 2011 and 2012. Clubs at the school include Voices that Care (a public service club), Health Careers Club, Centurions for Life (a pro-life activism club), Student Council, and Pan American Student Forum, as well as three honor societies: Sociedad Honoraria Hispanica (Spanish honor society), National English Honor Society, and National Honor Society.

Harvey considered Cunningham a dear friend of his, and he thought that Cunningham's untimely death was caused in part by his worries about the city's problems.\\"City Pays Tribute to Cunningham\\". The New York Times. May 8, 1934. p. 23. In 1935, the Board of Aldermen voted in favor of renaming Hillside Park in honor of Cunningham. In June 1936, a memorial to Cunningham was erected in park in the following month. The memorial was a flagpole set in bronze with an inscribed stone base. Major Cunningham's seven-year-old son, John Arthur Cunningham, unveiled the plaque at a ceremony.\\"Cunningham Park: History\\". New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.

In 1940, New York City bought a piece of land in order to connect discontinuous segments of Francis Lewis Boulevard and to expand Cunningham Park. A granite and bronze memorial to Major Cunningham was created by sculptor Emil Siebern and installed next to the Cunningham memorial flagpole in 1942. Bike trails The Long Island Motor Parkway provides a bike path through Cunningham Park, west to Kissena Park and east to Alley Pond Park, part of the Brooklyn-Queens Greenway. Mountain biking trails run throughout northern areas of the park which include two major sections connected by an overpass that runs across the Clearview Expressway. Trails are signed by level and range from beginner to expert.http://www.bikekinetix.com/t_ny/ny_county/cunningham-north-woods.php References External links *Cunningham Park, New York City Department of Parks and Recreation *Partnership for Parks: Cunningham Park Category:Parks in Queens, New York Category:Urban public parks Category:Bayside, Queens Category:Fresh Meadows, Queens ","title":"Cunningham Park"},{"id":"11836609","text":"Color Struck is a play by Zora Neale Hurston. It was originally published in 1926 in Fire!! magazine. Color Struck won second prize in the contest for best play. Color Struck was not staged during the Harlem Renaissance. Plot summary Color Struck opens on a train in 1900, with members of the black community from Jacksonville, Florida going to a cakewalk competition in St. Augustine. Hurston specifies that the first scene takes place \\"inside a 'Jim Crow' railway coach.\\" With much bustle, John and Emmaline arrive at the train just on time. Emmaline made John take the last coach, because she felt he was flirting with Effie, a lighter-skinned black woman. The play's title focuses on colorism, the idea that people in the black community were judged based on the hue of their skin. Emma is terrified that John will leave her for a lighter-skinned woman, and is very jealous; Emma says, \\"I loves you so hard, John, and jealous love is the only kind I got.\\" At the dance hall, everyone eats their picnic lunches, and Effie offers John a piece of pie. He accepts, though he knows it will upset Emma. Emma refuses to dance the cakewalk with him, even though they are favoured to win the competition. John instead dances the cakewalk with Effie, and they win the prize. Twenty years pass, and we rejoin Emma in \\"a one-room shack in an alley.\\" Her daughter, who we later learn is named Lou Lillian, is in bed, feverishly ill. John knocks on the door, and tells her he missed her. He had been married, but his wife died, and he has come to marry Emma now. Emma is thrilled, but wary. John looks forward to raising Lou Lillian as his own, and having a family. Lou Lillian is very sick, and John sends Emma for a doctor. Emma will not go to a \\"colored doctor,\\" and eventually goes to bring the white doctor. As she is about to leave, she comes back and sees John ministering to Lou Lillian. Emma assumes that John is only being nice to Lou Lillian because she is half-white. In a rage, Emma attacks John. John leaves, and the doctor arrives. The doctor is too late, and Emma's daughter is dead. The doctor remonstrates Emma for not having come earlier, an hour would have made all the difference. As the doctor leaves, Emma is left on stage in a rocking chair, staring at the door, \\"A dry sob now and then.\\" Read Color Struck. Character List Man; John; Emmaline; Wesley; Emmaline's Daughter; Effie; Doctor; Railway Conductor; Dance Master; Dinky; Ada; Joe Clarke; Woman; Another Man; Girl; Lizz; Clark; Master. Additional Character Info. Main characters Emmaline (Emma) is a color- obsessed and paranoid Black woman (dark-skin). John is a light-brown-skinned man who is deeply in love with Emma.(not a mulatto) Effie is a mulatto woman who Emma is jealous of. Themes and Motifs Colorism Throughout the play Emma is overly and self-destructively preoccupied with skin color. Emma is plagued by colorism‚Äîintra-racial racism‚Äîwhich causes her to be jealous of light-skinned Black people and despise her own Blackness. John: \\"(kisses her). Emma, what makes you always picking a fuss with me over some yaller girl. What makes you so jealous, nohow? I don‚Äôt do nothing.\\" Scene I Insecurities/Self- destruction Emma is constantly worried that John will leave her for a light- skinned woman. Her insecurities have adverse effects including, losing John for twenty years and allowing her mulatto daughter to die. John: \\"‚Ä¶ So this the woman I‚Äôve been wearing over my heart like rose for twenty years! She so despises her own that she can‚Äôt believe any one else could love it‚Ä¶. Twenty years! Twenty years of adoration, hunger, of worship! (On the verge tears he‚Ä¶exits quietly‚Ä¶).\\" Scene IV Hate/Anger/Animosity Emma displays anger towards John any time a light-skinned woman is in their midst. Emma: \\"Oh-them yaller wenches! How I hate em! They gets everything they wants.\\" II Distorted Vision/Blindness Emma is unable to see situations as they really are; she constantly accuses John of being more interested in light-skinned women and fails to see his sincere love for her. Also, when the doctor comes to the home in scene IV, Emma reveals she is unable to see well. John: \\"Ah don‚Äôt make you! You makes yo‚Äôself mad, den blame it on me. Ah keep on tellin‚Äô you Ah don‚Äôt love nobody but you. Ah knows heaps uh half-white girls Ah could get ef Ah wanted to But (he squeezes her hand again) Ah jus‚Äô wants you! You know what they say! De darker de berry, de sweeter de taste!\\" II Additional Quotes John: \\"It was Emmaline nearly made us get left. She says I wuz smiling at Effie on the street car and she had to get off and wait for another.\\"Scene I John: \\"I wuzn‚Äôt. I never gits a chance tuh smile at nobdoy- you won‚Äôt let me.\\" Scene I Emma: \\"Jes the same every time you sees a yaller face, you takes a chance.\\" Scene I Emma: \\"‚Ä¶.Everything she do is pretty to you.\\" Scene I Emma: \\"‚Ä¶.I can‚Äôt help mahself from being jealous. I loves you so hard, John, and jealous love is the only kind I got.\\" Scene I Analysis, Critiques, and Literature on the Play According to Martha Gilman Bower, Emma is an exemplar case of the \\"damaging consequences of an obsession with skin tone among Blacks.\\" The consequences of being \\"color struck\\" that one sees throughout the play is escalating anger, low self-esteem, paranoia, and schizophrenia. Bower also points out, Emma does not show animosity towards segregation, but rather is angered by the intra-race hierarchy. Because of Emma‚Äôs \\"psychotic obsession with color\\", she is unable to truly be happy, love, overcome oppression, and consequently is \\"the only miserable character.\\" Such obsession is self- destructive, distorts vision, and has the possibility of ruining opportunities.Bower, Martha Gilman. Color Struck Under the Gaze: Ethnicity and the Pathology of Being in the Plays of Johnson, Hurston, Childress, Hansberry, and Kennedy. Westport: Prager Publisher, 2003. (39-46) According to Michael North, \\"‚ÄôColor struck‚Äô is a term for [Emma‚Äôs] obsession but also for the retreat it causes.\\" Yet, the term \\"color struck\\" was popularized by Hurston in at a party after the 1925 Opportunity awards dinner when she comes in and \\"[triumphantly cries], ‚ÄòCalaaaah struuuck.\\" North interprets such triumph that Hurston imbues in the cry as what she intended to do with the play. North also points out the historical background of the cakewalk, highlighting its minstrelsy origins; he writes \\"the cakewalk [is] a clich√© of black life.\\"North, Michael. The Dialect of Modernism: Race, Language, and Twentieth- Century Literature. New York: Oxford University Press, 1994. (175-178) Faedra Chatard Carpenter offers an insightful analysis of \\"Color Struck\\" in the article, \\"Addressing the ‚ÄòComplex‚Äô-ities of Skin Color: Intra-Racism in the Plays of Hurston, Kennedy, and Orlandersmith. She writes: > The topical significance of Color Struck is in how it challenges assumptions > associated with color-consciousness. Rather than staging the color-complex > as a unilateral dynamic in which lightskinned blacks reject and separate > themselves from their darker brethren (the narrative of the \\"uppity\\" light- > skinned black), Hurston dramatizes the fact that color prejudice takes many > forms. In effect, the dramatic twist Hurston portrays is twofold: both John > and Emma are \\"color struck,\\" albeit in opposing and unpredictable ways. Emma > is drawn to light skin (notably, after her relationship with John fails, she > presumably has a sexual relationship/encounter with a white man, resulting > in the birth of a \\"very white girl\\"), while John exhibits color- > consciousness in his preference for dark-skinned women (after the breakup, > he consciously seeks out a darker-skinned wife that \\"was jus‚Äô as much\\" like > Emma as possible) (348).Faedra Chatard Carpenter. \\"Addressing \\"The > Complex\\"-ities of Skin Color: Intra-Racism and the Plays of Hurston, > Kennedy, and Orlandersmith.\\" Theatre Topics 19.1 (2009): 15-27.

It is located 20 km south of the Adelaide city centre in the north of the City of Onkaparinga. The suburb is named after John Reynell, a pioneering South Australian winemaker. Reynell sold some farmland to create the town of Reynella which is the present location of the suburb Old Reynella. The Reynell name goes back to the very beginning of the wine industry in South Australia, when John Reynell planted some of the first vines in the infant colony in the area that was later to bear his name. This pioneer of the grape was born in 1809 of a Devonshire farming family. Shortly after his arrival in 1838 John Reynell established his property, situated 20 kilometres south of Adelaide and 5 kilometres east of Gulf St Vincent - the gateway to the McLaren Vale wine region. The Reynella Winery is claimed to be the only winery in Australia that can use the name of a town as its registered brand because the winery was in existence before the town was established. The Old Reynella area is the historical centre of the district and the original home of Reynella Primary School, before it was moved to its current site in Carew Fields in 1990. Old Reynella is also the historical home of the Hardy Wine Company. Edge Church is located in Old Reynella at the former site of the Reynella Markets (closed down in 1995). History =Hurtle Vale= Photograph of Rupert Reynell's room With the arrival of Governor Hindmarsh on on 28 December 1836, the new private colony of South Australia was proclaimed. The state government was established through the formation of a private company in England known as the South Australia Company. Its Surveyor-General, Colonel William Light, was charged with the surveying of the land into allotments ready for sale to the new settlers to South Australia. One of his team was John McLaren, who was responsible for surveying Sections B, C and D to the south of Adelaide.T.N. Phillips, Reynella 1876-1976, 1976 South Australian Universities Joint Store (URRSA) This task was completed in 1839 and the first survey maps were printed in 1840. On 16 June 1837, the Colonial Commissioner Sir James Hurtle Fisher, John Morphett, Colonel William Light, and a party of marines set off from Glenelg intending to travel overland to Encounter Bay to visit whalers who were employees of the South Australian Company. Colonel Light's diary records: \\"At 4.00pm the party arrived at a beautiful valley, where they encamped for the night, the country and soil together adapted for grazing or agriculture; the whole distance was not more than ten or eleven miles (18 km) from Glenelg.\\" This area was named Hurtle Vale after the Colonial Commissioner. A later survey map drawn by John Mclaren in 1857 shows the area covered some 107 x allotments, stretching from the hills in the east towards the coast in the west with the Field River running through the centre of the valley. The name Hurtle Vale was never officially registered as a geographical name although widely used in the community for some time. Today the suburbs of Happy Valley, O'Halloran Hill, Trott Park, Sheidow Park, Reynella and parts of Hallett Cove, Morphett Vale and Woodcroft can be found within the old definition of Hurtle Vale. =Town establishment= Reynell homestead, 1896 On 12 March 1839, Section 524 was granted to Thomas Lucas who immediately rented it to John Reynell until the Indenture for Sale was drawn up on 26 August 1839, when John agreed to pay Thomas and Catherine Lucas ¬£80 for the section. In 1839, John Reynell claimed he was the first settler to enclose an entire section. A little later he had to cut the fences to allow for the alignment of a proposed road for the passage of a regular mail run to Encounter Bay which was established by the end of 1839.Reynell, Lenore John Reynell of Reynella : a South Australian pioneer, Adelaide: M. Hopton, 1988 =Vineyards= In 1841, Reynell began the planting of his vineyard with cuttings from Van Diemen's Land, which was recorded as South Australia's first commercial vineyard.Old Reynella - European History and Heritage =Subdivision and notice of sale= By 1854 there was a demand for land for housing in the area and in February of that year, John Reynell drew up a Notice of Sale for a portion of his Reynella Farm for the establishment of the township of Reynella. Selections of paragraphs from that notice are as follows: \\"Sale by Auction of the Township of Reynella, to be sold on the land of Wednesday, 12 April 1854 by order and for account of John Reynella Esq. We have received instructions to submit to public competition this promising Township.....\\" \\"The township consists of about of land divided into allotments varying from one quarter to two acres with the Great South Road dividing it equally from North to South...\\" \\"A fine steam mill of four storeys is already erected in the town ship and a handsome hotel is in rapid progress and will be open by winter.\\" \\"The auction will be held at the mill, and in the grounds luncheon will be prepared where required facilities will be afforded in the way of payment.\\" \\"Further conditions at time of sale. Title indisputable. Plans may be seen at Hay's Tapley's Hill, The Emu, [these are early hotels in the district] and also at the Blacksmith's shop on the ground.\\" By 1866 the town had the steam flour mill, hotel, post office, store, school and chapel. However, by the end of the Nineteenth Century as many farmers had moved to the Norther agricultural lands, Reynella was said to be \\"a village of the past, as several ruined houses along the road remain to testify.\\" =Twentieth century= The town flourished around the farming and wine making that had been pioneered and by the mid twentieth century tourism had begun to join wine, fruit production and farming to underpin the local economy. Around 1920, the artist Gladys Reynell‚Äîgranddaughter of John Reynell‚Äîestablished her own pottery studio at Reynella. She thus became one of Australia's earliest studio potters. She ran the pottery at first single-handedly but sometime in the 1920s hired George Samuel Osborne, an ex-serviceman and gardener, as her assistant. They developed a close relationship and eventually married, moving their pottery operation away from Reynella to Ballarat in Victoria state.Ioannou, Noris. \\"Gladys Reynell (1881-1956)\\". Australian Dictionary of Biography. South Road was bypassed in the later half of the century and since 1960 the spread of suburbs south from Adelaide has transformed much of the agricultural land into housing. Vineyards can still be seen in the surrounds of Accolade Wines, originally the Reynell Winery, later known as Hardy's Winery in Old Reynella. =Historical sites= Crown Inn Hotel, South Road, Old Reynella circa 1910 Crown Inn Hotel In 1853, twelve months before the town land sales took place, John Reynell sold of land on the north side of Panalatinga Creek on what was known as the Great South Road, to a Mr Robert Hay for the purpose of building a hotel. The hotel, now known as the Crown Inn Hotel, has had a continual licence since that time. Over the years it has had several variations of the original name. In 1855 it was known as the Crown Inn, then in 1856 it became the Crown Hotel, in 1886 the Reynella Hotel and in 1887 the Crown Inn. Cellar No.1 As part of John Reynell's expanding interest in winemaking, Cellar No. 1, known as the Old Cave, was developed. This is Australia's oldest working cellar and is registered with the National Trust. In 1845, the cellar was dug by hand into limestone subsoil with nothing but a shovel. The walls were made of local blue gum beams and sugar gum saplings and the roof of tree trunks from the nearby scrub covered with a thick layer of straw and clay. Although now covered by manicured lawn, the cellar is still in practical use. Reynella Grist Mill Southern Grist Mill The abundance of grain in the area saw the building of a four-storey steam-driven flourmill, known as the Southern Grist Mill. Although the exact date it was erected is not known, records show that it was operation prior to the sale of land for the hotel on 22 August 1853. In the early days of the colony, the registration of the use of land often took some time. It is recorded that on 15 August 1853, the mill property, lot number 81 on the town plan, was sold to a consortium of gentlemen and farmers of the district, namely Robert Montgomery, Charles Smith, John Reynell, Henry Douglas, William Sherriff, Ignatius Sullivan and James Bain, operating as the Southern Grist Mill Company. On 10 January 1855 the mill was sold to George Pool, a miller. In the late 1850s John Cain, became the mill manager for George Pool. On 15 August 1857 John Cain was killed in a horrific accident at the mill, being dragged into the machinery. George Pool operated the mill until his death on 18 June 1864. The mill operations then passed to his wife. Sometime circa 1865 the mill was destroyed by fire - according to local mythology, under mysterious circumstances. The mill was located where the current shopping mall now stands, approximately opposite Mill Street. Changing Station Situated on the northern side of the flourmill, these buildings were originally used as a blacksmith that operated before the hotel was built in 1853. Evidence would suggest that the first documented Certificate of Title found is for Robert Eglinton, Reynella Blacksmith, dated 17 January 1867. These buildings included stables, livery and ostlers rooms and later a cottage. It was also natural for such businesses to be the place where travellers, going to and from Adelaide, changed horses. And so it developed into a changing station for the Cobb & Co coaches that operated between Adelaide and Willunga. An addition to the front of the cottage acted as a ticket office for this service. Operation as a changing station ceased in February 1915 with the introduction of train services from Willunga to Adelaide. Old Distillery, now St Francis Winery Carew Reynell, son of Walter Reynell, had a great interest in the study of viticulture and by the age of 19 his father gave him most of the responsibility for managing the winery. He greatly expanded and developed the business, building a distillery, enhancing the firm's reputation for brandy making. Reynella Brandy became Australia's leading brandy. Coast to Vines rail trail in Old Reynella, facing south =Railway services= The official opening of the Adelaide - Willunga railway was on Wednesday 20 January 1915, although there would have been construction and work trains operating on the line well before this date. Both freight and passenger trains operated on the line. The last passenger service ran on 19 May 1957. A goods train ran twice a week until 1963 and, following falling demand, the rail service finally closed in May 1969. The dismantling of the line commenced in May 1972. Some 43,000 sleepers were removed between Willunga and Hallett Cove. The high embankment that carried the line over the Panalatinga Creek was also removed during this time. Transport information Old Reynella is primary serviced by buses on the Adelaide Metro network. It is home to the Old Reynella Bus Interchange with connections to the Noarlunga Centre Interchange, the city and Westfield Marion. It is serviced primarily by South Road, Panalatinga Road and the Panalatinga Road exit of the Southern Expressway. The Coast to Vines rail trail passes through Old Reynella. Sport The Reynella Community Centre is located on Oval Road, and is home to local sporting clubs such as the Reynella Football Club (Australian Rules Football), as well as the Reynella cricket, tennis, air rifle, lawn bowls, and dart clubs, among others. The Reynella Neighbourhood Centre is on Old South Road and is a hub for many activities for the youngest to the oldest members of the community. It is run by the City of Onkaparinga.

It is licensed to Winterset, Iowa, with studios located on 335th Street in Waukee.Pulse1017.com/contact-us It is one of only a few independent stations in the Des Moines metropolitan area radio market. The transmitter is off Quail Ridge Lane in Winterset.Radio-Locator.com/KPUL In Ames, the station can also be heard on 25 watt translator station K238AN at 95.5 MHz. History =KBBM= The FCC issued a construction permit for station KTDG on May 7, 1990. The station was not put on the air though until June 1, 1992 as KBBM. The station had no locally produced content. It used 24-hour news feeds from CNN Headline News and CNNfn, positioning itself as \\"Des Moines Business Station.\\" The format was never a ratings winner and was only heard for a little over a year before KBBM was sold. =Q99.5 KZZQ= In March 1993 the station was purchased by Positive Impact Media Inc., a non profit group. The station's initial purpose was to rebroadcast the programming of a Christian contemporary music (CCM) station in the Quad Cities. But within a few months KBBM found itself in need of its own programming due to the failure of the Quad Cities station. The station switched its format to Christian CHR and rebranded itself as Q99.5 KZZQ, or \\"The Q\\". It were the first station to bring Christian CHR to Des Moines, and was successful in attracting listeners and receiving support through donations and advertising throughout the first decade. In 2004, KZZQ had competition for the first time as the University of Northwestern ‚Äì St. Paul purchased two local stations, KNWI Life 107.1 and KNWM Life 96.1. It programmed the stations with Christian AC. Although they also suffer from weak signals, together Life 107.1 and Life 96.1 cover much of the market. This was something KZZQ struggles to do with its lower power (6,000 watts) and a transmitter located southwest of Des Moines. Due to increased competition from Life 107 and other stations entering the market, and staff turnover, listenership continued to decline and it became apparent a change was required. =Pulse 99.5 KPUL= After several days of stunting in February 2008, the station was re-branded KPUL \\"Pulse 99.5.\\" The new format became an experimental mix of CCM and CHR‚ÄìPop in an effort to reach more people through a hybrid format. The new format proved to be a more aggressive change than listeners in the area were ready for. After a few months under the new format, Pulse 99.5 re-adjusted its format to a mix of Christian CHR, Rock, and positive mainstream hits. =Pulse 101.7= On October 6, 2010, the station announced an \\"upgrade\\" involving changing its frequency to 101.7 FM and a rebranding to Pulse 101.7.\\"Your Pulse Upgrade\\", retrieved October 13, 2010. These upgrades involved other area radio stations (KTIA-FM and IPR).http://whotv.com/2015/04/13/iowa-radio-stations-moving-on-the-dial/ The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the changes in the Fall of 2014. The target date for the move to 101.7 FM was March 31, 2015, and after a delay due to weather, the tower upgrades were made on April 14, 2015.

The petition for detachment began circulating in December 2006, after Northgate residents helped defeat a bond issue for the district that November. Northgate Forest's primary complaints were that the district's SAT and TAKS scores had been declining consistently in recent years, that the district was spending money inefficiently, and that taxes were too high. Residents cited a section of the Texas Education Code that allows a given area to secede from the school district they are zoned to if another district will agree to absorb them.

Between 24 May and 11 November 1942, Spence commanded Allied forces during their guerrilla campaign in Timor. Spence, who had been a journalist and had served in the Militia before the war, volunteered for overseas duty with the Second Australian Imperial Force on 25 June 1940, at Miowera, Queensland. A major, he was originally posted to the 2/26th Battalion, but was posted away from the unit to the commandos before the battalion embarked on its ill-fated deployment to Singapore. He was later appointed commander of the 2/2nd Independent Company, a commando unit, and went with it as part of Sparrow Force to Dutch Timor in 1941. The 2/2nd and Dutch forces were despatched to occupy Portuguese Timor in December 1941, when it was anticipated that Japanese forces would invade. Spence and his men enjoyed good relations with most of the local population, and prepared for a prolonged guerrilla campaign. Timor campaign Even though the Japanese had the element of surprise, when they invaded on 19 February 1942, the Allied garrison began an orderly retreat, covered by an 18-strong Australian section stationed at Dili airfield. The section managed to kill an estimated 200 Japanese in the first hours of the battle. Another section was less fortunate, driving by chance into a Japanese roadblock. Although they surrendered, it is believed that all but one were massacred. Spence and his men succeeded in evading the Japanese in the mountains of Timor. The 2/2nd commenced raids on the Japanese. Allied forces were scattered in various areas of Timor, but were able to use the local telephone system to communicate among themselves and to gather intelligence on Japanese movements. However, they could not contact the outside world, due to a lack of functioning radio equipment. This situation would not be rectified until 18 April after signallers from the company managed to build a wireless transmitter and were subsequently able to contact Darwin. The Japanese commander, Colonel Sadashichi Doi, sent the Australian honorary consul in Dili, David Ross (who was also the local Qantas agent), to find the commandos and pass on a demand to surrender.Wigmore 1957, p. 493. Spence is reputed to have responded incredulously, stating that the company was still a formed unit and would continue to fight. Ross then gave the commandos information on the disposition of Japanese forces and also provided a note in Portuguese, stating that anyone supplying them would be later reimbursed by the Australian government. On 8 March 1942, Spence was reunited with his immediate commander, Brigadier William Veale, who had retreated on foot from West Timor.Wigmore 1957, p. 492. When Veale was evacuated in May, Spence was appointed an acting lieutenant colonel, and became Allied commander. Doi sent Ross with another message, complimenting Sparrow Force on its campaign, and again asking that it surrender. The Japanese commander said that he realised it would take a force 10 times that of the Allies to win, that he was receiving reinforcements, and would eventually assemble the necessary units. This time Ross did not return to Dili, and he was evacuated to Australia on 16 July. During August, Japanese forces began to burn and/or bomb villages believed to have assisted the Allies, with huge civilian casualties. The commander of the Japanese 48th Division, Lieutenant General Yuitsu Tsuchihashi arrived, to assume control of operations on Timor. Strong Japanese columns moved south -- two from Dili and one from Manatuto on the north-east coast. Another moved eastward from Netherlands Timor to attack Dutch positions in the central south of the island. The offensive ended on 19 August, having secured the central town of Maubisse and the southern port of Beco. In late August, matters were complicated when a rebellion against the Portuguese broke among the indigenous population, and a parallel conflict began. The Japanese were also recruiting significant numbers of Timorese civilians, who provided intelligence on Allied movements. During September the main body of the Japanese 48th Division began arriving to take over the campaign. The Australians also sent reinforcements, in the form of the 450-strong 2/4th Independent Company--to be known as Lancer Force--on 23 September. By October, the Japanese had succeeded in recruiting significant numbers of Timorese civilians, who suffered severe casualties when used in frontal assaults against the Allies. The Portuguese were also being pressured to assist the Japanese, and at least 26 Portuguese civilians were killed in the first six months of the occupation, including local officials and a Catholic priest. On 1 November, the Allied high command approved the issuing of weapons to Portuguese officials, a policy which had previously been carried out on an informal basis. At around the same time, the Japanese ordered all Portuguese civilians to move to a \\"neutral zone\\" by 15 November. Those who failed to comply were to be considered accomplices of the Allies. This succeeded only in encouraging the Portuguese to cooperate with the Allies, whom they lobbied to evacuate some women and children. Spence was evacuated to Australia on 11 November, handing over command to Major Bernard Callinan. He was later re-united with the 2/2nd Independent Company, and remained with them until later in the war when he became the commanding officer of the 2/12th Commando Squadron and then later the 2/9th Cavalry Commando Regiment in 1944‚Äì45.Wigmore 1957, p. 469. Spence was discharged from the army on 28 February 1945. He died in Brisbane on 10 July 1983, aged 77.

Though long demolished, a replica stands near its original site. History Lazaretto Point, directly opposite from Fort McHenry, acquired its name from a smallpox quarantine hospital which once occupied the point. By the time that John Donahoo began construction of a brick tower light in 1831, the hospital was gone; the name was destined to live on in local naval lore, however, as in 1863 a depot was established around the tower for the construction and resupply of lighthouses throughout the bay. Many screw-pile lighthouses were prefabricated at the depot in preparation for erection at their final sites. Iron was for a time mined at the point, and industrial sites sprung up around it, leading to years of complaints about the visibility of the light. A fourth order Fresnel lens installed in 1852 provided some improvement, as did a change from red to white aspect in 1870. In 1914 the light was electrified, and the fourth order lens replaced with a 3¬Ω order. In spite of this the light became increasingly obscure, and the old tower was torn down in 1926, replaced by a taller steel skeleton tower. This tower survived until 1954. By this time the depot had diminished in importance, and it was shut down entirely in 1958, to be replaced by a Rukert Marine Terminal berth. A replica of the original tower was constructed in 1985 by the Rukert Terminal Corporation in honor of Norman Rukert, Sr., who had entertained the idea of constructing such a replica before his death. The new tower was constructed from blueprints of the original found in the National Archives. Though it sports a small white light, it is not an active aid to navigation. In 1986, John Coulter, President of Rukert Terminals, proposed to his wife Fiona at the top of the Lazaretto Lighthouse. Though a comprehensive compilation of lighthouse keepers for this light does not appear to be in existence, the US Federal Census, Reports to the Department of the Interior, the Annual Report of the Commissioner of Lighthouses to the Secretary of Commerce, and the Official Register of the US. Department of the Interior each provide a snapshot of who tended the light from year to year. William B. Shaw, a veteran of the War of 1812 and father of eleven, tended the lighthouse at its construction in 1831. Based on records from this era, Shaw and his family survived the fire that destroyed the keepers' quarters at Lazaretto in 1836. In 1841, the Hartford Times reports that Shaw was apparently written a letter by Thomas Ewing, Secretary of the Treasury, relieving him from his duties at this light. However, Shaw seems to have remained in service to the light despite his dismissal as the last record of his service at Lazaretto is dated 1853. An inspection reports that despite poor conditions at the lighthouse itself, Shaw was meticulous in his duties and kept a journal voluntarily. The whereabouts of his journal are presently unknown. The keepers records leap ahead from 1853 to 1861, wherein one Samuel Scott ‚Äò1‚Äô is listed as the keeper. The next records jump to 1879, where the Census and the Dept of the Interior indicate that David Kilgoar (77 years old in 1880) and William S. Martin (58 years old in 1880) ‚Äò2‚Äô tended the light, the latter remaining in service to the light until 1892. Both men lived near the lighthouse in Canton or Baltimore. In addition to Martin, Joseph D. Bruff ‚Äò3‚Äô is listed as a keeper in 1885 and Charles S. Green ‚Äò10‚Äô also appears as a keeper in 1889. Martin's son, John A. Martin, is listed in the 1880 census as a lighthouse employee. By 1911, William H. Davis Jr. ‚Äò7‚Äô is listed as the keeper. The 1920 Census of Davis tending the light is the last record of keepers at this light thus far. According to the 1920 census, Davis raised at least 5 children while keeping this light. The family is once again listed as living at the lighthouse as opposed to in town near the light. Several references have been made to Davis's service to this light. Davis is cited in 1913 for saving the Lazaretto Lighthouse Depot from a fire that engulfed the Lazaretto Lighthouse tower. Despite attempts to find further records about this fire, none have been discovered thus far. Several years later, Davis and Henry C. Wingate, a watchman, received a commendation from the Secretary of the Lighthouse Service for their attempts to save a drowning man near Lazaretto in 1916.

The most significant witnesses are the Three Witnesses and the Eight Witnesses, all of whom allowed their names to be used on two separate statements included with the Book of Mormon. Each of the witnesses never denied what they saw. Three Witnesses The Three Witnesses were a group of three early leaders of the Latter Day Saint movement who wrote in a statement of 1829 that an angel had shown them the golden plates from which Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon and that they had heard God's voice testifying that the book had been translated by the power of God. The Three Witnesses were Oliver Cowdery, Martin Harris, and David Whitmer, whose joint testimony, in conjunction with a separate statement by Eight Witnesses, has been printed with every edition of the Book of Mormon since its first publication in 1830. All three witnesses eventually broke with Smith and were excommunicated from the church.\\"All three witnesses eventually quarreled with Joseph and left his church. At their going he heaped abuse upon them, but none ever denied the reality of his vision, and Cowdery and Harris eventually were rebaptized. Joseph had no fear in vilifying them; he neither expected nor received reprisals. For he had conjured up a vision they would never forget.\\" In 1838, Joseph Smith called Cowdery, Harris, and Whitmer \\"too mean to mention; and we had liked to have forgotten them.\\"B. H. Roberts, ed. History of the Church (Salt Lake City: Deseret News, 1905), 3: 232. Oliver Cowdery temporarily became a member of the Methodist Church, while Martin Harris adopted some Shaker beliefs. After the death of Joseph Smith, Harris and Cowdery sought rebaptism in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Whitmer founded the Church of Christ (Whitmerite). Eight Witnesses The Eight Witnesses were the second of the two groups of \\"special witnesses\\" to the Book of Mormon's golden plates. They were all members of the Whitmer or Smith families: Christian Whitmer, Jacob Whitmer, Peter Whitmer, Jr., John Whitmer, Hiram Page, Joseph Smith, Sr., Hyrum Smith, and Samuel Harrison Smith. Joseph Smith Sr. was Joseph's father, and Hyrum and Samuel H. Smith were his brothers. Christian, Jacob, Peter Jr. and John were David Whitmer's brothers, and Hiram Page was his brother-in- law.Richard Lyman Bushman, Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005), 79: \\"Critics pointed out how many of the witnesses were members of the Smith and Whitmer families, implying that they signed out of loyalty or from a self-serving motive....The witnesses were no substitute for making the plates accessible to anyone for examination, but the testimonies showed Joseph‚Äîand God‚Äîanswering doubters with concrete evidence, a concession to the needs of post-Enlightenment Christians.\\" Unlike the Three Witnesses, the Eight testified that they both saw and handled the plates. Another difference is that the Eight testified they were shown the plates by Joseph Smith rather than by an angel as had the Three. Christian Whitmer died in 1835 and his brother Peter Whitmer, Jr. died the following year. In 1838, the surviving Whitmers became estranged from Joseph Smith during a leadership struggle in Far West, Missouri, and all three were excommunicated with other dissenters,Bushman, 337,339, 350‚Äì51. On June 17, Sidney Rigdon \\"preached a vitriolic sermon based on the theme of salt losing its savor and being cast out and trodden underfoot....Soon after the sermon, eighty-three prominent members in Far West, many of them probably Danites by then, signed an ultimatum demanding the departure of the offenders....Fearing for their property and perhaps their lives, the dissenters fled.\\" (355‚Äì51) In 1847, David, John, and Jacob Whitmer and Hiram Page were baptized into the newly formed Church of Christ founded by William E. M'Lellin. In 1831, Joseph Smith received a revelation from God that John Whitmer should \\"write and keep a regular history\\" of the church (D&C; 47). Whitmer did eventually write such a history, but one which concluded with a detailed description of what Whitmer considered the mistreatment that he and his family had received in Caldwell County. See Bruce N. Westerngren, From Historian to Dissident: The Book of John Whitmer (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1995). never to rejoin The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. None of the Eight Witnesses is known to have denied his testimony of the authenticity of the Book of Mormon or the golden plates. Another witness Mary Musselman Whitmer (1778‚Äì1856), the mother of five Witnesses who took care of the household in Fayette, New York, where much of the translation occurred, said that an angel showed her the plates and thus made her more content to continue her daily labors.\\"David Whitmer Interview with Edward Stevenson, 9 February 1888,\\"in Dan Vogel, Early Mormon Documents (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2003), 5: 160‚Äì61; John C. Whitmer Interview with Andrew Jenson and Edward Stevenson, 11 October 1888,\\" in EMD 5: 260‚Äì62. John Whitmer said that his grandmother always referred to the supernatural visitor as \\"Brother Nephi.\\" Joseph Smith made no mention of this visitation in his journal. Responses =Criticism= Critics of the Latter Day Saint movement‚Äîfrom late nineteenth-century clergymen to Mark Twain to modern agnostics, evangelical Christians, and even some unorthodox (\\"Big Tent\\") Mormons‚Äîargue that the testimonies of the witnesses cannot be taken at face value. * According to Grant H. Palmer, the Book of Mormon witnesses had a \\"nineteenth-century magical mindset\\" rather than \\"a rationalist perspective.\\" They believed in what was called \\"second sight. Traditionally, this included the ability to see spirits and their dwelling places within the local hills and elsewhere.\\"Grant H. Palmer, An Insider's View of Mormon Origins (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 2002), 175. Palmer devotes an entire chapter to the magical mindset of the Book of Mormon Witnesses. A number of the witnesses possessed and used seer stones; Oliver Cowdery was a rodsman.D. Michael Quinn, Early Mormonism and the Magic World View (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1998), rev. ed., 239-40. As Tufts University professor John L. Brooke has observed, many of the earliest Mormons were \\"very much attuned to the supernatural powers of witchcraft.\\"John L. Brooke, The Refiner's Fire: The Making of Mormon Cosmology, 1644‚Äì1844 (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1994), 77. \\"Far removed from our own modern empiricism, the world view of the witnesses is difficult for us to grasp,\\" and thus it is less impressive that \\"three signatories to the Book of Mormon saw and heard an angel.\\"Palmer, 194-95. * All the witnesses were family, close friends, or financial backers of Joseph Smith. Cowdery, Page, and the five Whitmers were related by marriage.Palmer, 179. Mark Twain later joked, \\"I could not feel more satisfied and at rest if the entire Whitmer family had testified.\\"Quoted in Fawn Brodie, No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1986), second ed., 79. * Although Harris continued to testify to the truth of the Book of Mormon even when he was estranged from the church, at least during the early years of the movement, he \\"seems to have repeatedly admitted the internal, subjective nature of his visionary experience.\\"Vogel, Early Mormon Documents, 2: 255.

Appleton and Co., 1867), 71 in EMD, 3: 122. John H. Gilbert, the typesetter for most of the book, said that he had asked Harris, \\"Martin, did you see those plates with your naked eyes?\\" According to Gilbert, Harris \\"looked down for an instant, raised his eyes up, and said, 'No, I saw them with a spiritual eye.\\" John H. Gilbert, \\"Memorandum,\\" 8 September 1892, in EMD, 2: 548. Two other Palmyra residents said that Harris told them that he had seen the plates with \\"the eye of faith\\" or \\"spiritual eyes.\\" Martin Harris interviews with John A. Clark, 1827 & 1828 in EMD, 2: 270; Jesse Townsend to Phineas Stiles, 24 December 1833, in EMD, 3: 22.

He is also a former executive director of the American Library Association, served as president of IFLA, served as Dean of the School of Library Service at Columbia University, and was university librarian at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. He has also authored and edited several major reference works, and has won many awards over the course of his career. Education Wedgeworth completed an A.B. at Wabash College, Crawfordsville, Indiana in 1959 and an M.S. in Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois in 1961. Wedgeworth joined the doctoral program in library services at Rutgers University, but left in 1972 to become the executive director of the American Library Association. In 2012, Wedgeworth returned to Rutgers, and defended and received his PhD. After graduation, he worked in several libraries in Kansas City and St. Louis. Career Robert Wedgeworth served as University Librarian, Professor of Library Administration and Professor of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UI) from November 1993 until August 20, 1999 when he retired from the University. The UI Library is the largest public university research library in the world and the third largest of all public and private university research libraries in North America after Harvard and Yale. Prior to that Wedgeworth had been Dean of the School of Library Service, Columbia University from 1985-1992 and Executive Director of the American Library Association (ALA) from 1972-1985. In 1962, the American Library Association selected Wedgeworth as one of 75 librarians to serve as staff for ‚ÄúLibrary 21,‚Äù a library of the future exhibit at the Seattle World‚Äôs Fair. This experience and additional data processing training at IBM led to his appointment as Assistant Chief Acquisitions Librarian at Brown University in July 1966, with a special assignment to introduce library automation to the Brown Libraries. From 1966 to 1969, he managed all domestic and foreign acquisitions of library materials at Brown while developing an automated acquisitions and fund accounting system. As a Council on Library Resources, Inc. Fellow he toured all of Western Europe studying the book trade during the summer of 1969. Wedgeworth moved to the Graduate School of Library Service, Rutgers-The State University of New Jersey in the fall of 1969 to do advanced studies in librarianship and teach in the graduate program. He left Rutgers to become Executive Director of the American Library Association (ALA) in August 1972. =Literacy campaigns= Assuming the leadership of ALA during a turbulent period of internal strife, he led the effort to democratize the Association and gave it new visibility and credibility nationally and internationally. Under his leadership the Association grew from 28,000 members to over 40,000. He developed a new Headquarters building in a joint venture that more than doubled the value of its property and produced a windfall profit of more than $10 million by 2003. With the demise of the National Book Committee, Wedgeworth negotiated with the publishing industry to bring the National Library Week program to the ALA. It quickly became a nationally visible marketing tool and the third major revenue source for the Association. His interest in reading and literacy led to his involvement in the creation of the Friends of Libraries USA and to his initiative to organize the Coalition on Literacy in 1979. He then persuaded the Advertising Council to launch the first nationwide ad campaign promoting adult literacy. =Copyright campaigns= In 1975, President Gerald R. Ford appointed Wedgeworth to the National Commission on New Uses of Copyrighted works (CONTU) where he was influential in the resolution of library photocopying issues that were key components of the Copyright Revision Law of 1978. From 1985 until 1992, he served as Dean of the School of Library Service, Columbia University. At Illinois, Wedgeworth reorganized the library faculty and transformed a 1970s university library, technologically, into a 1990s university library. Under his leadership, Illinois launched a National Science Foundation sponsored digital library research program, expanded its Mortenson Center training program for foreign librarians and launched the web- based Kolb-Proust Research Archive to international acclaim. The UI Library also raised over $18 million in new endowments during his tenure, a record for a public university. =ProLiteracy Worldwide= Wedgeworth became President of ProLiteracy Worldwide in August 2002 when Laubach Literacy International (LLI) and Literacy Volunteers of America, Inc. (LVA) merged. ProLiteracy Worldwide is the largest non-governmental literacy training organization in the world, and publishes basic and advanced literacy training materials and provides literacy training through its affiliates across the U.S. and partner organizations in over 60 developing countries of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. Wedgewood retired as President and CEO of ProLiteracy in 2007. =International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions= After six years on the Executive Board of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), he was elected President in 1991 and re-elected in 1995 to serve until 1997. He is only the second American to be elected IFLA President and the only one to be elected to serve a second term. During his tenure as IFLA President he led the Association to become the dominant international library and information service organization in the world, expanding its membership to over 140 countries. He led the transformation of IFLA by introducing a global communications system (IFLANET) through the technical support of SilverPlatter and the National Library of Canada. From 1993 in Barcelona to 1997 in Copenhagen, he presided over IFLA conferences that attracted record-breaking attendance to its programs and exhibits. =Board memberships= Currently, he serves as a member of the National Commission on Adult Literacy, he is a life member of the American Library Association, a life member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a member of the Board of Trustees of Wabash College, the Board of Trustees of the Newberry Library and a member of the Grolier Society. Previously he has served on many boards and advisory committees including advisory committees to the Princeton, Miami, Stanford and Harvard University Libraries. He recently completely twelve years as a public member of the Accrediting Council for Journalism and Mass Communication and six years as an editorial adviser to the World Book Encyclopedia. Writing and reference works In his almost 40 years as a librarian, library educator and association executive, Wedgewood created and edited two major reference works, ALA YEARBOOK, 1976-1985 and the WORLD ENCYCLOPEDIA OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES, 3d edition 1993. In addition, he has written and lectured widely on international librarianship, international book trade, and copyright and information policy and information technology. He has also conducted special studies of librarianship and the book trade in Western Europe, Latin America and South Africa. His publication, STARVATION OF YOUNG BLACK MINDS: THE EFFECTS OF THE BOOK BOYCOTTS IN SOUTH AFRICA, New York, 1989 written jointly with Lisa Drew raised serious questions about curbing the free flow of information during the struggle to combat apartheid. More recently, he produced a study of library development in South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe for the Carnegie Corporation of New York in 1998. Honors and awards For his achievements Wedgeworth has received many honors and awards including five honorary doctorates, most recently from the College of William & Mary in 1988. In 1991, he was honored as the Most Distinguished Alumnus of the University of Illinois, Graduate School of Library and Information Science and in 1996 he received the Medal of Honor from the International Council of Archives for his international activities. From the American Library Association, he has received three of its highest honors, the Lippincott and Melvil Dewey awards for professional leadership and the Humphry/OCLC/Forest Press Award for achievements in international librarianship. In 2011, he presented the Jean E. Coleman Library Outreach Lecture: \\"Literacy in Libraries: Challenges and Opportunities.\\" Family He and his wife, Chung-Kyun (C.K.), who is also a retired librarian, have one daughter who is an editor with the Los Angeles Times.

Taxonomy Leptodoras is a monophyletic genus based on the single unique characteristic: presence of an infranuchal scute. This scute is the first in a series of well-developed midlateral scutes characteristic of most doradids. It is one of the most derived genera within the clade of fimbriate-barbel doradids. The most closely related genus to Leptodoras is Anduzedoras. This genus includes eleven species, making it the largest doradid genus. There has been taxonomic confusion due to similarities of some species with each other and members of other genera. Misunderstood distributions and identities of some species added to this confusion. Most species were described from small geographic areas without information on their potential distributions. Also, specimens have been rare in museums until recently. An assessment in 2005 diagnosed Leptodoras and its seven species while describing three new species.  Species  There are currently 12 recognized species in this genus: * Leptodoras acipenserinus (G√ºnther, 1868) * Leptodoras cataniai Sabaj P√©rez, 2005 * Leptodoras copei (Fern√°ndez-Y√©pez, 1968) * Leptodoras hasemani (Steindachner, 1915) * Leptodoras juruensis Boulenger, 1898 * Leptodoras linnelli C. H. Eigenmann, 1912 * Leptodoras marki Birindelli & Sousa, 2010 * Leptodoras myersi J. E. B√∂hlke, 1970 * Leptodoras nelsoni Sabaj P√©rez, 2005 * Leptodoras oyakawai Birindelli, Sousa & Sabaj P√©rez, 2008 * Leptodoras praelongus (G. S. Myers & S. H. Weitzman, 1956) * Leptodoras rogersae Sabaj P√©rez, 2005 Distribution Leptodoras species are distributed in large, predominantly lowland rivers east of the Andes throughout the northern half of South America. Species are distributed throughout lowlands in the Orinoco, Amazon, and Tocantins basins and several coastal river systems that enter the Atlantic between the mouths of the Orinoco and Amazon. Leptodoras is not known from west-Andean drainages or Atlantic-slope drainages south of the Tocantins. Description Leptodoras is easily recognized by its long conical snout and well-developed oral hood formed by the membranous union of maxillary barbels, paired jaw barbels on the chin, and lip structures. It has fimbriate barbels. Ecology Most species of Leptodoras are truly benthic and typically inhabit the deep swift-flowing waters of large rivers. Many species of Leptodoras migrate at dusk into shallow waters near shore to forage over beaches and shoals of sand or silt. Other species, such as L. juruensis and L. myersi, appear more restricted to deep channel habitats. Leptodoras species are not known from elevations exceeding 500 metres (1600 ft) above sea level and most records are from below 200 m (660 ft). The oral hood found in Leptodoras species presumably facilitates the detection and suction-feeding of shallowly buried invertebrates. Stomach contents typically include chironomid larvae, sand, and detritus.

This species grows to a length of SL and weights up to . This species is a minor component of local commercial fisheries. Has lateral thorns that can damage a potential predator or handler. It feeds by shifting through sand and detecting eatable parts with the taste receptors in the roof and floor of its mouth.  Ecology  O. niger occurs over mud in streams and lakes. It is known from temperatures ranging from 24-29.8 ¬∞C (75-85.6 ¬∞F), pH range of 5-9, and an alkalinity range of 42-142\\\\. It is known to form schools. This species feeds on detritus, chironomid and ephemeropteran larvae, and crustaceans. In the aquarium O. niger is a popular aquarium fish species. In the hobby, it goes by many names, including black talking catfish, razorback catfish, mother of snails catfish, ripsaw catfish, and black doradid. This species grows to a large size and are often bought by unsuspecting aquarists when small. They will rapidly outgrow smaller tanks, so the aquarium should be as large as possible. O. niger is especially light shy and should be provided with sheltered areas to hide. Although these fish are peaceful, very small tankmates are still at risk of being eaten. This species readily accepts prepared foods. O. niger has not been bred under aquarium conditions.

Development The concept of a flying car is a vehicle that has the capacity to drive on public roads and also to fly. In this way a single vehicle is able to use both air and ground infrastructures - essentially providing an aircraft that has door to door capabilities. The Skyblazer development team proposes the use of a single turbofan engine to provide thrust in the air and to generate electricity to power electric motors for ground travel. In \\"car mode\\", the wings fold completely into the body of the vehicle, which will fit into a single car garage and regular parking space. In \\"aircraft mode\\" the vehicle will have STOL capabilities and be able to use almost any public use airfield. It has cruise speed of 300 mph and a range of 830 miles. As of June 2007 the skyblazer team has completed wind tunnel, stability and control testing and flown a 1/6 scale model. The Skyblazer concept falls into the category of an \\"Integrated\\" vehicle, which is one of the two viable flying car concepts. An \\"Integrated\\" vehicle retains all the components needed for both modes of travel at all times. The other type of flying car is a \\"Modular\\" vehicle, where some part of the vehicle is left behind during a transition between modes - usually the wings are left at the airfield while the car part is driven on the road to complete the journey.

The method is normally used to help protect the rights and interests of victims of a crime, or also to protect a defendant from possible malicious prosecution. This method is used in countries such as Australia and Malaysia. Essentially, the lawyer must familiarize himself with the case at hand and understand the legal implication of every action or omission vis a vis his clients' interests. In other countries like Kenya, the lawyer watching brief has to work hand in hand with the prosecutor to ensure that the Police file is availed in court at the hearing and witnesses bonded to attend court. Whereas he is not strictly performing the duty of the police, the advocate watching brief plays a crucial role in ensuring that the evidence presented to court is sufficient to secure a conviction for the offender thus preventing his client from civil suits for malicious prosecution arising from an acquittal. To familiarize oneself with the matter, it is absolutely necessary that the lawyer obtains all witness statements and documents to be relied on and peruses them carefully. Should there be a loophole in the evidence, he should raise it with the prosecution for redress. To achieve this, it is imperative that the lawyer develops a cordial relationship with the prosecutor so that the information flowing to him (prosecutor) will appear as persuasive suggestions as opposed to orders which are more often likely to be ignored since the lawyer has no control over the prosecutor in his line of duty. Further, in Kenya, apart from introducing himself, the lawyer watching brief has no right of audience before the court and so the prosecutor becomes his mouthpiece. In other words, being retained to watch brief should never be one passive, boring duty but one that should interest every lawyer interested in criminal jurisprudence. It is actually calling to account every party in the trial without being heard-working behind the scenes-and giving the much needed backup to the side enforcing your client's rights.

Number 8 indicates both left and right tarsometatarsus The tarsometatarsus is a bone that is only found in the lower leg of birds and some non-avian dinosaurs. It is formed from the fusion of several bones found in other types of animals, and homologous to the mammalian tarsus (ankle bones) and metatarsal bones (foot). Despite this, the tarsometatarsus of birds is often referred to as just the tarsus or metatarsus. Tarsometatarsal fusion occurred in several ways and extents throughout bird evolution. Specifically, in Neornithes (modern birds), although the bones are joined along their entire length, the fusion is most thorough at the distal (metatarsal) end. In the Enantiornithes, a group of Mesozoic avialans, the fusion was complete at the proximal (tarsal) end, but the distal metatarsi were still partially distinct. Cast of the type specimen of Heterodontosaurus tucki. Left tarsometatarsus is clearly visible. While these fused bones are best known from birds and their relatives, avians are neither the only group nor the first to possess tarsometatarsi. In a remarkable case of parallel evolution, they were also present in the Heterodontosauridae, a group of tiny ornithischian dinosaurs quite unrelated to birds. The oldest remains of this taxon date from the Late Triassic more than 200 million years ago, and predate the first birds with tarsometatarsi by nearly 100 million years.

When recommissioned in 1914, King Alfred was assigned to the 6th Cruiser Squadron, together with her sister ship, , and was briefly deployed at the beginning of the war to blockade the northern exit from the North Sea.Goldrick, p. 25 She was transferred to the 9th Cruiser Squadron in October 1915.Gardiner & Gray, p. 12 By January 1916, the squadron, under the command of Rear Admiral Archibald Moore in King Alfred, was patrolling the western entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar and unsuccessfully searching for the commerce raider .Corbett, Vol. III, pp. 267‚Äì68 The raider evaded all the British ships and returned to Germany before sortieing again into the Atlantic in late November. In the meantime, Rear Admiral Sydney Fremantle hoisted his flag in King Alfred on 22 September, in relief of the newly promoted Moore. When the Admiralty received word that M√∂we was loose in the Atlantic in early December, Freemantle ordered his ships to patrol the eastern trade routes, but the raider slipped through the gap between squadrons. When the sweep was concluded, the ship returned to Freetown on 25 December. Freemantle was relieved by Rear Admiral Thomas Sheppard three days later. On her return voyage in March 1917, M√∂we passed through the squadron's patrol area without being spotted.Newbolt, Vol. IV, pp. 177, 181, 184, 191 In July King Alfred arrived at Devonport to begin a refit that was completed on 13 August. She escorted convoys from Dakar and Freetown to Plymouth for the rest of the year. In February 1918 she began escorting troop convoys from Halifax. The ship was torpedoed by UB-86 on 11 April 1918, north of Ireland, killing one man. She was repaired in LiverpoolTranscript and returned to service. She was sold for scrap on 30 January 1920 and broken up in the Netherlands.

Most cases involve a Japanese mother taking her children to Japan in defiance of visitation or joint custody orders issued by Western courts. The issue is a growing problem as the number of international marriages increases. Barring exceptional circumstances, the effects of child abduction are generally detrimental to the welfare of children. Parental abduction often has a particularly devastating effect on parents who may never see their children again. Japan is a party to the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, which obliges signatories to promptly return abducted children to their country of habitual residence. The convention entered into force for Japan on 1 April 2014. The issue had become a cause for significant concern to other parties, the majority of which are Western countries.Matsutani, Minoru, \\"Hague pact no answer to in-country custody fights\\", Japan Times, 14 May 2010, p. 3. The National Diet approved ratification to the convention in 2013. The main impediment to Japan's becoming a party to the convention was that it would require a change in attitude of the legal system towards child custody rights. Japanese family law considers issues of divorce custody, child support or alimony as predominantly private matters. Consequently, Japan has no enforcement mechanism to enforce foreign custody rulings or recommendations made by its own domestic courts. Furthermore, Japan does not recognise joint parental authority or shared \\"residence\\" after divorce. As a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, however, Japan is supposed to recognize the right of a child to obtain non-custodial parent visitation. However, the Supreme Court of Japan has ruled before entry into force of the convention that this does not amount to the right of non-custodial parents to see their children (it has ruled that state-enforced visitation is the right of neither parent nor children). This ruling, in effect, makes visitation without the cooperation of the custody-holding parent a practical impossibility.  Parental child abduction in law  In some countries, international child abduction is a felony. The US made it so in the International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act of '93. In the United Kingdom the Child Abduction Act 1984 provides that the offence of abduction of a child by a parent is committed only if the child is taken out of the U.K. for a period exceeding one month. In the case of Japan, CNN quoted an unnamed official in the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo who stated, \\"Our two nations approach divorce and child-rearing differently. Parental child abduction is not considered a crime in Japan.\\" However, this statement is contradicted by several Japanese news media sources which report arrests involving parental abduction in Japan. The Supreme Court of Japan categorically ruled that a parental abduction in which force and coercion is used to remove child constitutes the felony of kidnapping of a minor irrespective of person's custodial right. The case concerned a couple who were separated but not divorced so the abducting father held joint custody. Therefore, while civil liability (or criminal liability in some countries) for parental abduction arise out of custodial interference of a parent and is not legally defined as kidnapping, in Japan, parental abduction is a kidnapping if it disrupts a child's residence or relationship with the primary caregiver. At the same time Japanese family courts have no enforcement mechanism in civil matters so they strongly encourage parents to engage in mediation in order to agree to custody arrangements on their own and rarely intervene in matters such as visitation and child support which are seen as private.Ito, Masami, \\"Returning to Japan with kids was only safe option, two mothers say\\", Japan Times, 14 May 2010, p. 3. Furthermore, it is rare for a nation to extradite one of its own citizens to another country for alleged parental abduction. On the other hand, a foreign national father, trying to re-abduct his child in Japan by force, may face arrest and possible criminal prosecution irrespective of his custodial status in the child's home country. Moreover, a foreign father trying to abduct children by force to another country would face the extra charge of \\"kidnapping for the purpose of transporting the kidnapped person to a foreign country\\" (Article 226(1) of the Penal Code), which carries the penalty of imprisonment with labor for a limited period of not less than two years. The law, which was originally designed as an extra penalty for the kidnapping of a minor for sexual slavery in China, is now used for preventing forced abduction from Japan by a parent. This provision of the Penal Code was amended in 2005 so that it covers kidnapping and abduction from any country, not just Japan. This means that it constitutes a criminal offence under Japanese law for a Japanese national to abduct his or her own child by force in another country and bring the child to Japan, and in such cases Japanese police and prosecutors could initiate criminal proceedings. However, this provision likely will not apply to cases where a Japanese mother who is the primary caregiver brings her children back to Japan in defiance of the custodial ruling of a foreign court, as this would not likely be seen to involve coercion or force against the child.In the Best Interests of the Court: What American Lawyers Need to Know About Child Custody and Visitation in Japan\\", Colin P.A.

International parental abduction statistics  U.S. Department of State - Report on Compliance with the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction - Compliance Report 2010 (pdf) (4,3 MB) Megumi Nishikawa, a senior writer for the Mainichi newspaper, stated in an editorial that there were nearly 200 cases of such disputes in Japan. The United States Department of State website states that, > ...in cases of international parental child abduction, foreign parents are > greatly disadvantaged in Japanese courts, both in terms of obtaining the > return of children to the United States, and in achieving any kind of > enforceable visitation rights in Japan. The Department of State is not aware > of any case in which a child taken from the United States by one parent has > been ordered returned to the United States by Japanese courts, even when the > left-behind parent has a United States child custody decree. According to the US Embassy, between 2005 and 2009, the number of child abduction cases of children from Australia, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States has quadrupled. = Australia = According to the Australian Embassy in Japan in 2010 there have been thirteen abductions to date. , there were at least thirteen cases of unresolved parental abduction to Japan. Australia, unlike other nations, does not maintain a national database of parental abduction cases. Moreover, media restrictions on family law and juvenile matters mean that many cases go unreported. = Canada = , there are 29 cases of unresolved parental child abduction to Japan, the highest of any destination country from Canada. In early 2007, there were 31 active cases of child custody and family distress dealt by Canadian Embassy and in 2006, there were 21 active cases. = France = , there are 35 cases of international parental child abduction of French nationals related to Japan. = United Kingdom = From 2003 to 2009, the United Kingdom has had 37 cumulative cases of British nationals being abducted to Japan by a parent, none of which have been resolved. For a yearly figure, The Guardian newspaper reported that, for 2008 alone, there are 336 cases and estimated 470 children were abducted from the UK and taken abroad illegally, an increase of 20% from 2005 figures. Pakistan (30 cases) top the list followed by the US (23), Ireland (22) and Spain (21). Other abduction hotspots included Australia, France and Egypt. The cases of international parental abduction are not well published in U.K. due to reporting restrictions that apply to any cases involving the welfare of minors. However, the Guardian provided anecdotal evidence. A reporter attended a day in London family court. Eight out of 14 cases heard involved child abduction, which may indicate that the problem is widespread. 40% (134 out of the 336) of international abductions in 2008 involve countries that are not signatories to the Hague Convention. These include Bangladesh, Russia, Iraq and Nigeria. Moreover, the problem is expected to worsen as immigration and international marriage become common. Moreover, The Independent newspaper cites the Reunite International Child Abduction Centre which claims that 43% of parental abductions involve ethnic minority children taken abroad and often forced to marry. Moreover, cultural complicity, collusion and shame mean that many cases go unreported. = United States = The U.S. State Department, which enforces the treaty in the U.S., has more than 2,000 active cases in 2009 involving nearly 3,000 children abducted from the U.S. or wrongfully retained abroad. The ten countries with the highest incidence of reported abductions in 2008 are Mexico (316), Canada (57), the United Kingdom (42), Japan (37), India (35), Germany (34), the Dominican Republic (25), Brazil (21), Australia (18), and Colombia (17), which together represent 602 cases out of the total of 776. Japan and India are the only non-signatory countries in this group. However, there has been a significant year by year increase. In 2009, there were 73 outstanding cases involving 104 children who have been abducted to or retained in Japan by parents. An additional 29 cases involve American parties in Japan with one parent denied access to his or her child. However, according to December 2009 figures, there appeared to be 79 child abduction cases involving 100 children. A State Department official stated in 2008 that no child has ever been returned to the US as a result of diplomatic or legal means Furthermore, embassy officials were only aware of three cases where children have returned to America, two involving reconciliation of parents and one in which a 15-year-old escaped to the American embassy. = Other nations = Justin McCurry of the GlobalPost claimed that the unofficial number of international parental abduction in Japan is much higher if failed marriages between Japanese and people from other Asian countries are included. Quoting Thierry Consigny of the Assembly for French Overseas Nationals (AFE) for Japan and North Asia, he point out that every year 166,000 children are separated from one of their parents in Japan following a divorce or separation, usually definitively, and 10,000 or more children of dual nationality fall into this situation.  International marriage and divorce in Japan  Japan is experiencing a dramatic increase in the number of international marriages between a Japanese and a non-Japanese. In 2007, 40,272 international marriages between a Japanese national and foreigner occurred, representing 5.6% of total marriages (719,822). In 2000, the number was 36,263, and in 1980 the number was only 7,261. This is despite the fact that the foreigners represent only about 1.22% of the total population in Japan. An estimated 20,000 children are born to Japanese-foreign couples every year. The vast majority of these marriages are with Chinese and Koreans, many of whom are second- or third- generation permanent residents of Japan, also known as zainichi, and other neighboring nations such as the Philippines and Thailand. However, the cases of a Japanese woman marrying a foreign national husband, marriage to a U.S. national is high (1,485), ranking second after Korean nationals (2,209), followed by Chinese nationals (1,016). At the same time, the number of international divorces in Japan is also increasing from 7,716 in 1992 to 18,220 in 2007. International divorces represent 7.15% of the total 254,832 divorces in Japan in 2007. Moreover, according to a 2007 figure, 10.53% of people under 20 experience the divorce of their parents. In 1990, the rate was 5.24%. In numerical terms, 245,685 under-20-year olds, had experienced the divorce of their parents, compared to 169,624 in 1990. In July 2008, Thierry Consigny of the Assembly for French Overseas Nationals (AFE) for Japan and North Asia, which has been advocating for right of foreign parents in Japan, further asserted that, according to a government survey, every year 166,000 children are separated from one of their parents in Japan following a divorce or separation, usually definitively. Furthermore, 10,000 or more children of dual nationality fall into this situation as well. Foreign parents face an additional obstacle in maintaining access due to their immigration status which may be revoked after a divorce.  Divorce, custody and visitation in Japan  In Japan, according to 2004 data from National Institute of Population and Social Security Research, mothers receive custody in roughly 80 percent of divorces involving children. This is a shift from 1970 which awarded custody to mothers only in 50 percent of cases. Similarly, in the U.S. one source estimates that fathers received sole or joint custody 26 percent of the time while mothers or someone other than the father received sole custody 74 percent of the time. While the law in some countries, such as France or the United States, provide for joint custody in divorce cases involving children, Japanese law does not provide for this arrangement. Jeremy D. Morley, an American lawyer who has handled many abduction cases in Japan, has pointed out that the practice of sharing child custody after a divorce is \\"alien\\" to Japanese and not found in Japanese culture or history, which may help to explain its absence from Japanese law. In Japan, when a marriage with children legally dissolves, full parental custody and authority is awarded to only one parent. Moreover, this custody ruling creates complete legal separation of the non-custodial parent from his or her biological children. An academic article discussing the work of Takao Tanase, notable legal scholar of comparative study of American and Japanese legal system, asserts that \\"the real difference lies in the two cultures' diverging conception of social parenthood, and thus of the identity of the person who holds parental rights: the noncustodial American parent remains a legal parent at least in part because he or she remains a social parent, in aspiration if not reality, while the traditional Japanese view is the opposite.\\" The paper then goes on to describe a Japanese case whereby a father is granted a primary custody of the children after a divorce. A year after the divorce, the father marries another woman. Subsequently, the son from the previous marriage is adopted out without having given any notice to the son's biological mother and, moreover, her subsequent attempt to regain the primary custody of her biological child failed in court. In Japanese law, irrespective of her biological link, her separation from her son was complete at the point of losing the custody. The paper further states that in Japan it is seen as preferable that children make a permanent break with the non-custodial parent because creating a legal \\"right\\" for parent would cause conflict damaging to the welfare of the child.https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&q;=cache:iQzSLQWpYsoJ:www.law.berkeley.edu/centers/ilr/pub_sho_sato_2005/ellman.pdf+Rights:+A+Comment+on,+and+Appreciation+of,+the+Work+of+Takao+Tanase&hl;=en‚â∑=uk&pid;=bl&srcid;=ADGEESi9k35Ll_iYrbbJ97zNN4T-d4sjIlHhv1r-zFfBqpw_C23LsnyRpx6uDqk6SWZRV7kcwtoorpYs7ekSqtBqQ4ZnD40ZhSRJCJ9-lG5t2RLMrc9wzVG60G9RGc0_TttJEoh6GJ9V&sig;=AFQjCNGIrKdcmGhtBTHf8F5_MNNp2S6lXA The Japan Times states that experts in Japan have been skeptical about the benefits of complete joint custody because the child is tossed back and forth between the parents for their own benefit. The typical 'deal' in Japan is that, upon divorce, the father pays nothing for the child's support, and he never sees his child. It is noted that the decision by family courts in Japan with regard to both visitation and child support are unenforceable. There are several consequences to this lack of enforcement. At first, the courts strongly prefer that divorcing couples agree to child custody arrangements in mediation. If mediation fails, the court can intervene and has the power to determine which parent shall have parental authority. Article 819 of Japanese Civil Code states that \\"In the case of judicial divorce, the court shall determine which parent shall have parental authority.\\" The primary custodian, or caregiver, as defined by the Japanese legal system, is the parent who has physical possession of the child at the time the case is initially brought to court in Japan. In other words, the court will likely choose the parent who already has possession. Colin P.A. Jones, a professor at Doshisha Law School, states that parental rights are not recognised in Japanese law, pointing out an academic debate in Japan over whether visitation was a right of the parent or the child or something else. In regard to visitation/access, the Supreme Court held in 2000 that visitation was a right of neither parent nor child. Consequently, court-mandated visitation in Japan only occurs with the cooperation of the custodial parent. U.S. Department of State website states that \\"compliance with Family Court rulings is essentially voluntary, which renders any ruling unenforceable unless both parents agree.\\" Consequently, any attempt to obtain visitation (or child support and/or alimony) through legal enforcement would be futile. If the custodial parent, usually the mother, refuses to cooperate with visitation, the other parent, usually the father, will often refuse to pay child support. According to New York City-based international family lawyer Jeremy D. Morley: > A charitable view of the Japanese system of divorce is that it favors a > 'clean break' so that the divorced parties have little or nothing more to do > with each other after the divorce. A less generous interpretation is that it > permits the spouse with economic assets (usually the husband) to keep most > of his assets, avoid payment of alimony and provide little or no child > support, but the price he pays is the abandonment of any relationship with > his children, while the other spouse is punished economically, but keeps her > children. In the 82 signatory countries custody rulings differ by country. While the mother usually gains sole or primary custody, there is an increasing trend in other developed countries to shift to shared parenting and joint custody. Enforcement of custody orders is also an issue in those countries that usually award sole or primary custody, as it is in Japan. In the UK, fathers' rights groups have advocated for changes to the Child Support Act including child support, shared parenting and access to children, and lack of enforcement of court orders. Citizens of the European Union have lobbied the European Parliament to take action against child abduction by Japanese parents post- divorce and for being denied access to their children. On 8 July 2020, lawmakers of the European Union adopted a non-binding resolution calling Japan to enforce domestic and foreign court decisions pertaining the return of children, parental access and visitation rights. This also emboldened divorced Japanese parents who lost access to their children to discuss the issue. The LDP's judiciary research commission responded that Japan should study other countries for alternatives to single-parent child custody. = Koseki issue = Moreover, something that is somewhat unusual in Japanese custody arrangements is the system of koseki, which legally defines households and persons' legal identity in Japanese law. When a non-Japanese marries a Japanese, the foreign spouse's name is recorded into Japanese spouse's koseki upon filing of the marriage, but the spouse's entry is not created in the koseki because of lack of Japanese citizenship. When their child is born, because the child has Japanese citizenship, an entry is created for the child in the Japanese spouse's koseki. There is a widespread misunderstanding that when a divorce occurs, the foreign spouse is removed from the koseki and the children's custody is automatically kept by the Japanese spouse who hold the koseki. Koseki and custody are not related. The confusion is increased by the fact that completely uncontested divorces are performed not by a court, but by the spouses simply filling out a family registry form at the city hall. When a divorce is finalized at the city hall, the name of the custodial parent of each child must be written in the filing. The name of the custodial parent is then recorded in each child's entry in the koseki.Êà∏Á±çÊ≥ïÊñΩË°åË¶èÂâá Á¨¨‰∏âÂçÅ‰∫îÊù° Ê¨°„ÅÆÂêÑÂè∑„Å´Êé≤„Åí„Çã‰∫ãÈ†Ö„ÅØ„ÄÅÂΩìË©≤ÂêÑÂè∑„Å´Ë¶èÂÆö„Åô„ÇãËÄÖ„ÅÆË∫´ÂàÜ‰∫ãÈ†ÖÊ¨Ñ„Å´„Åì„Çå„ÇíË®òËºâ„Åó„Å™„Åë„Çå„Å∞„Å™„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑ„ÄÇ ‰∫î Ë¶™Ê®©Âèà„ÅØÊú™ÊàêÂπ¥ËÄÖ„ÅÆÂæåË¶ã„Å´Èñ¢„Åô„Çã‰∫ãÈ†Ö„Å´„Å§„ÅÑ„Å¶„ÅØ„ÄÅÊú™ÊàêÂπ¥ËÄÖ Therefore, it is wrong to assume that unless custody is litigated in Japan, the Japanese parent will automatically hold custody of children in Japan, irrespective of the ruling of the foreign court. A divorce is not finalized in Japan unless custody is agreed to by the spouses or determined by the Japanese court.Civil Code of Japan Article 766. If parents divorce by mutual consultation, the matter of who will have custody over a child and any other necessary matters regarding custody is determined by that consultation. If there the consultation does not reach agreement, or if there is no consultation, the family court shall determine custody. Article 819. If parents divorce by mutual consultation, they must determine in such consultation which parent shall have parental rights. (2) In the case of a judicial divorce, the court determines which parent shall have parental rights. Furthermore, it is also wrong, but common, to assume that if the custodial parent dies, custody of the child is transferred within the koseki, which would mean that custody would be retained by the dead spouse's new married partner or Japanese grandparents who retain their custody as primary caregiver and would not be transferred to the surviving parent. When a sole custodial parent dies, the family court starts the procedure of appointing a guardian unless one has been designated in the will of the custodial parent.Civil Code of Japan Article 840. If there is no one to become a guardian of a minor pursuant to the provisions of the preceding article, the family court shall appoint a guardian of a minor on the application of a minor ward or his/her relative, or other interested person. This shall also apply in a case where any vacancy in the position of a guardian of a minor occurs.  The Hague Child Abduction Convention  Hague Abduction Convention Parties Japan became a party to the Hague Child Abduction Convention in January 2014. It entered into force on 1 April of that same year. Japan was the last G7 nation, to become a party to the convention. Many of the 97 parties to the convention are Western nations of Europe, North America, South America and Australia while most countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East are not parties of the convention. Between parties, children who were abducted are required to be sent back to their \\"habitual residence\\" after the abduction takes place. For nations which define such abductions as felonies, Interpol can issue notices, and the abducting parent can be arrested during international travel. The Convention does not demand that any country recognize the ruling of a family court in other countries, which is part of the Hague Protection of Children Convention. Rather, the convention demands that signatories recognize and promptly return abducted children to their habitual residence. Since the treaty has no retroactive effect, abductions before 2014 involving Japan cannot be resolved on the basis of the Hague convention. Rather, remedies must be sought under Japanese family law to enforce visitation orders.\\"Meanwhile, because the Hague is not retroactive, parents like Navy Cmdr. Paul Toland are also pushing U.S. and Japanese officials to devise a task force to help resolve the approximately 80 open cases involving more than 100 Japanese-American children documented by the State Department.\\" However, the convention has an important section that is not limited to children abducted after ratification, its Article 21, which lets parents in another country apply \\"to make arrangements for organising or securing the effective exercise of rights of access\\" and get help from both countries' governments to do that. Article 21 cases are not just for abducted children and are subject to few or none of the conditions or defenses that can block a petition for return of the child. =Japanese support for the convention= In a joint symposium on child abduction held at the Canadian Embassy in Tokyo in 2006, Jun Yokoyama, a Hitotsubashi University professor specializing in international private law observed that Japan did not need to join the Hague Convention when it took effect in 1980 because of the low number of international marriages at the time, which is no longer the case in the present situation. Similarly, a spokesman from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the Ministry was not opposed to the convention, but that \\"at present there is not enough support from Japanese nationals\\". In 2008, Japan Today had reported that, by 2010, Japan would become a signatory of the convention. However, this report later proved to be inaccurate. The 2009 election saw the Democratic Party of Japan gain power. Yukio Hatoyama stated in an interview, > My heart goes out to the fathers and mothers. There are cases of mothers as > well. We support ratifying and enforcing the Hague Convention, and involved > in this is a sweeping change to allow divorced fathers visitation of their > children. That issue affects not just foreign national fathers, but Japanese > fathers as well. I believe in this change. However Hatoyama resigned as Prime Minister before any such change was implemented. Commentators noted that signing the treaty would not retroactively affect previous child-abduction cases in Japan.Ito, Masami, \\"Few options for left-behind parents even if Hague OK'd\\", Japan Times, 29 December 2011, p. 3. In a similar joint symposium held at the American Embassy in May 2009, embassy officials from Canada, France, the UK, and the US issued a joint statement calling on Japan to sign the Hague Convention. Following the Christopher Savoie incident (see \\"Specific Cases\\"), a near identical statement was reissued in October 2009 with additional support from Australia, Italy, New Zealand and Spain. In a 2009 statement, Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada said that Japan was considering being a signatory, stating that \\"we are approaching the matter with an open mind, but we must also take public opinion into account.\\" One major obstacle, noted by Jeremy Morley, an attorney who had worked on parental child abduction cases in Japan, was that Japanese family law did not align to the parameters of the Hague Convention and that new legislation would need to be introduced for Japan's signature and ratification. Hans van Loon, Secretary General of the Hague Convention on Private International Law, pointed out that \\"Japanese civil law stresses that in cases where custody cannot be reached by agreement between the parents, the Japanese Family Court will resolve the issue based on the best interest of the child. However, compliance with Family Court rulings is essentially voluntary, which renders any ruling unenforceable unless both parents agree.\\" Yuko Nishitani, an associate professor at Tohoku University and director of the Hague Academy of International Law, agreed, saying that \\"the real reason Japan has not signed the Hague Convention is that no enforcement mechanism exists in the country. Signing the convention would expose these flaws.\\" An official of Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated, \\"The Japanese government's position is 'not interfering in civil affairs.'\\" At the time, any introduction of prerequisite legislation which would alter Japanese family court law would take at least a year in committee discussion and draft legislation could have been introduced in 2011 at the earliest or possibly later which would delay signature of the treaty to later than 2011 to allow for legislative change. Providing administration and judicial authorities to implement effective enforcement measures as required by the Convention presented the main impediment for Japan signing the convention. The Japanese government eventually established a Vice-Ministerial-level work group to study the proposal as to whether to ratify the convention.Ito, Masami, \\"Hague treaty seeks to balance rights of kids, parents \\", Japan Times, 7 June 2011, p. 3 In 2014, Japan became a party to the Hague Convention. Since then the treaty has had an impact in over 150 cases. = Domestic violence = Japan has argued that becoming a signatory of the convention may not protect Japanese women and their children from abusive non-Japanese husbands. According to an editorial from the Asahi Shimbun, a significant number of parental abduction cases filed in North America and Europe involve Japanese wives, and of those wives a number of them claim their husbands were abusive. Kensuke Onuki, a prominent Japanese lawyer who handles many international divorces, was reported as saying he opposes Japan signing the convention and claims that \\"[i]n over 90 percent of cases in which the Japanese women return to Japan, the man is at fault, such as with domestic violence and child abuse,\\" but admits that \\"domestic violence is difficult to prove.\\" Attorney Mikiko Otani, an expert on family law who ultimately supports joining the Hague Convention, also expressed her reservation, saying that the convention is based on the principle of returning the child and only in very extreme violent cases has the Article 13 defense been successfully invoked. On the other hand, Colin Jones of Doshisha University, while accepting that domestic abuse defense in the convention is inadequate, nevertheless argued that if Japan signed the convention, abducting mothers would more than likely resort to this defense successfully to avoid their children being returned because Japanese family court is heavily biased in favor of the mother. Domestic violence is also an issue of concern amongst signatory countries. The Special Commission of the Hague Convention stated in its report that two-thirds of the abductions are committed by the child's primary caretakers, usually mothers, and that this is \\"giving rise to issues which had not been foreseen by the drafters of the Convention\\". Merle H. Weiner in the Fordham Law Review pointed out that there was widespread media attention in the US during the late 1970s and early 1980s about international child abduction where the typical abductor was a foreign non-custodial male who abducted children from their primary caregiver. According to Weiner, this stereotype dominated the U.S. Congressional proceeding for ratification and resulted in a presumption in the US that abduction is always harmful to children. The Hague Convention makes no mention of domestic violence as a defense. Due to the focus on promoting return of children to their habitual residence, \\"the domestic violence victim's ability to defeat a Hague Convention application for the return of their child, if possible at all, often turns more on fortuity and the judge's sympathy than on any principled rule of law.\\" The Australian delegate to the Hague Convention commission stated that: > There is concern that the Convention is now being used by abusive (usually > male) parents to seek the return of children and primary carers back to the > country of habitual residence and that the Convention is moving away from > what it was meant to deter. Recent statistics demonstrate that the majority > of abducting parents are women, often those fleeing situation[s] of abuse > and domestic violence. There is also growing concerns regarding the > correlation between incidents of child abduction and the presence of > domestic violence and that the Convention does not give due consideration > and sufficient weight to such mitigating circumstances in the context of a > \\"grave risk\\" argument. There are cases where, if the child is returned, the abductor will not or cannot return with the child out of safety concerns. One of the crucial problems is that, upon return to the foreign country, abducting parents lack resources to hire a lawyer to obtain protective measures against domestic violence. Another concern regarding signing the treaty is the possibility that implementing it would, in practice, \\"tear the child away from a parent\\", as a primary caregiver would be unable to accompany the children to countries which have criminalized parental abduction. Colin Jones, a law professor of Doshisha University, commented that \\"[w]hatever the law says, it is very hard to imagine it being in the interests of the police and prosecutors to be seen taking crying half-Japanese children away from distraught Japanese mothers.\\" = United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child = Japan is a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which enumerates the fundamental civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of children. There are a number of articles that deal indirectly or directly with child abduction in the convention and demonstrate the violations of children's rights that frequently occur during international child abductions: Articles 7 and 8 of the Convention protect a child's right to a name and a nationality. Article 9 protects a child's right to not be separated from his or her parents against their will and to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, except when competent authorities subject to judicial review determine, in accordance with applicable law and procedures, that such separation is necessary for the best interests of the child. In accordance with Article 9, Article 10 stipulates that applications for international travel for purposes of family unification be dealt with in a positive, humane and expeditious manner and that the submission of such a request shall entail no adverse consequences for the applicants and for the members of their family. Articles 11 and 35 specifically exhort state parties to take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to combat the illicit transfer and non-return of children abroad and promote the conclusion of bilateral or multilateral agreements or accession to existing agreements and measures to prevent the abduction of children. Film is a 2013 documentary film about child abduction by parents and relatives in Japan. Produced and co-directed by David Hearn and Matt Antel, the film focuses on several cases. One is Murray Wood, a Canadian father, whose two children were taken by their Japanese mother. Another is Michael Gulbraa, a Utah father, whose two children were taken by their Japanese mother.

The Serra Fault is positioned approximately northeast of the San Andreas Fault; moreover the Serra Fault extends for more than from the town of Hillsborough to a point near Daly City. Serra geology According to Kennedy: \\"Three angular unconformities within the Merced and overlying Colma Formations have formed on the steeply dipping fold forelimb\\". Mid to later Holocene fluvial channel deposits inset into the Merced Formation along the forelimb of the fold seem to be deformed, illustrating that the folding is active. The Serra Fault is a low angle imbricate fault that has thrust older Franciscan Assemblage rocks and soils of the Merced Formation over the younger Colma Formation. The Serra Fault was originally zoned as potentially active by the State of California (California, 1974) under the mandated special studies for surface fault rupture. 1980s studies concluded that evidence for active Holocene age faulting (displacement within past 11,000 years) along the Serra Fault is lacking. (Earth Metrics, 1989) The Serra Fault is, therefore, not zoned for Special Studies by the State of California and is classified as Quaternary in age: that is, fault displacement within the past two million years. Regional geology Age constraints for coastal exposures of the Pleistocene Colma and uppermost Merced Formations have prior to 2005 been primarily correlative, generating uncertainty about the depositional history of these units as well as the timing of fault activity responsible for lifting them to elevations up to seventy meters along the northwestern coast of the San Francisco Peninsula.

She was assigned to the China Station upon completion and then served in the Mediterranean Fleet in 1905‚Äì06. She was assigned to the 7th Cruiser Squadron in 1907 before she was briefly reduced to reserve. Leviathan was recommissioned in 1909 for service with the 4th Cruiser Squadron before she was placed in reserve in 1913. Recommissioned in mid-1914, she was assigned to the 6th Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet at the beginning of World War I. She spent most of the rest of the year searching for German commerce raiders and escorting convoys before she became flagship of the 1st Cruiser Squadron. In early 1915, she was reassigned to the 6th Cruiser Squadron before she became flagship of the North America and West Indies Station in March. Leviathan retained that position for the next three years until she was relieved as flagship in early 1918 and began escorting convoys from North America to Britain. She was placed in reserve in 1919 and sold for scrap in early 1920. Design and description Leviathan was designed to displace . The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a deep draught of . She was powered by two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of .

Two additional 12-pounder 8 cwt guns could be dismounted for service ashore.Friedman 2012, pp. 250, 336 Leviathan also carried three 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and two submerged torpedo tubes. At some point during the way, the ship probably had all of the lower casemates for her six-inch guns plated over and six of them remounted on the upper deck so they could be used in heavy weather. Several twelve-pounders were removed to make room for the six- inch guns.Friedman 2012, p. 247 The ship's waterline armour belt had a maximum thickness of and was closed off by transverse bulkheads. The armour of the gun turrets and their barbettes was 6 inches thick while the casemate armour was 5 inches thick.

Construction and service Leviathan, named after the Biblical sea monster,Silverstone, p. 248 was laid down by John Brown and Company at their shipyard in Clydebank on 30 November 1899. She was launched on 3 July 1901 when she was christened by Lady Inverclyde, wife of George Burns, 2nd Baron Inverclyde, chairman of the Cunard Steamship Company. The ship sailed to Portsmouth for armament and engine tests in March 1902, and was completed on 16 June 1903 when she was initially assigned to the China Station. Transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1905, she was assigned to the 5th Cruiser Squadron after a refit when she returned home at the end of 1906.

Because of bilateral agreements, La Poste also has the responsibility of mail services in Monaco through La Poste Monaco and in Andorra alongside the Spanish company Correos. The company was created in 1991 following the split of the French PTT, a government department responsible for mail, telegraph and telephone services in France. The PTT, founded in 1879, was then divided between La Poste, which became responsible for postal service, and France T√©l√©com (nowadays Orange) for the telecommunication services. France T√©l√©com was immediately privatised but La Poste has remained a public company. However, in 1997 EU directive 97/67/EC required member states to \\"fully open the postal sector to competition\\", with the result that the French government allowed private postal service companies in 2005 and transformed La Poste into a public-owned company limited by shares in 2010. La Poste is a parent company of the Groupe La Poste, which also comprises a bank and insurance company (La Banque postale), a logistics service company (Geopost) and a mobile network operator (La Poste Mobile). Although its postal activities are declining because of the development of the Internet, they still represented half of the company's income. Other activities, such as parcel delivery and banking, are on the rise. The two represented respectively a quarter of the company's income in 2017. History =Kingdom of France= A coaching inn in Launois-sur-Vence. During the Middle Ages, postal delivery in France was not organised by the state and was provided by private enterprise. University envoys dominated the market from the 13th century onwards. In 1477, King Louis XI created coaching inns to deliver his own letters. These inns were for temporary use and usually led to battlefields. In 1576, royal mail delivery was further improved with the creation of the office of royal envoy. Royal envoys were allowed to provide services to private individuals. They prefigured modern postal services and their existence led to the appearance of the first post offices at the end of the 16th century. The first set fees appeared in 1627 for letters sent to Bordeaux, Lyon, Toulouse and Dijon. As with the rest of Europe, stamps did not exist in France at that time and mail was paid for by the recipient. The first map of post roads was published in 1632 and a book compiling lists of roads and inns including distances and fees to be paid was released in 1707. A new edition was released every two years until 1859. The country already had 623 coaching inns in 1632 and the figure reached 800 at the beginning of the 18th century. A ferme g√©n√©rale was created for mail services in 1672, which meant that postal services started to be subject to taxation. Tax officers progressively bought private postal companies and university envoys became subjects to the ferme g√©n√©rale in 1719. International treaties regarding postal services were signed with neighbouring countries under Louis XIV. =Birth of a national postal service= The \\"Black Ceres\\", the first stamp issued in France. During the French Revolution French postal services progressively became a fully public service. Directors of post offices lost their privileges in 1789 and their position became subject to universal suffrage. The ferme g√©n√©rale was abolished two years later and post offices started to be directly administered by the state. As a reaction to commonplace opening of letters by the royal authorities, an oath of confidentiality became compulsory for post employees in 1790. The first French mail coach appeared in 1793 and the first telegram in the world was delivered in 1794 with the Chappe optical transmitter on the Paris-Lille line. After the Revolution, French postal services continued their modernisation. An 1801 decree reasserted the state monopoly on mail delivery, postal orders were created in 1817 and postage stamps were introduced in 1849, nine years after they were invented in the United Kingdom. A rural service was implemented in 1830 with a mail delivery in rural areas every two days. The delivery became daily from 1832. France was a founding member of the General Postal Union in 1874. It became the Universal Postal Union in 1879. =French PTT= Post and telegraphs were united in one administration by the French government in 1879, giving birth to the P&T; (\\"Postes et t√©l√©graphes\\") which later became the PTT (\\"Postes, t√©l√©graphes et t√©l√©phones\\"). A French ministry of post and telegraphs was created the same year. A national savings bank opened in 1881 and was added to the services provided by the P&T.; The government took a monopoly over telephone services in 1889 and placed this responsibility under the P&T.; The administration then became PTT and kept this name until 1959 when it became \\"Postes et T√©l√©communications\\", although the acronym PTT was kept. Postal cheques were created in 1918. The first airmail flight operated in 1912 between Nancy and Lun√©ville and a regular airmail network was put in place in 1935 through the \\"Air Bleu\\" company. Night airmail services started in 1939 on two lines: Paris-Bordeaux-Pau and Paris-Lyon-Marseille. Postcodes were introduced in France in 1964.

Before 2005  In the 1980s, it became clear that the French PTT could not compete anymore in a country where communication was greatly increasing. The administration suffered from a constant lack of innovation and was dependent on political will and decisions. A division between postal and telecommunication services was suggested as soon as 1974 in a report from the French parliament. However, changes in the structure of the PTT were opposed by trade unions who feared that employees could lose their status of civil servants. In 1988, under the premiership of Socialist Michel Rocard, a law was finally prepared to split the PTT. The aim of the government was to get the services out of the public administration and to prepare competition from private firms. Such a move was encouraged by the European Economic Community, and the United Kingdom had already separated its national telephone company from its postal services in 1981. Most of the other member states did the same in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Trade unions organised several strikes but the law was adopted in 1990. La Poste and France T√©l√©com were officially created on 1 January 1991. The two had the status of \\"autonomous operators under public law\\". While France Telecom was privatised and floated on the stock exchange in 1997, La Post has remained a public service. Since its creation, the company has had to face strong competition from the Internet. As a result, it has tried to innovate and diversify its activities. In 2000, it became a webmail provider and created GeoPost, its logistics and parcel delivery subsidiary. The following year, it released its online trading platform to reinforce its online banking services. To comply with the law and EU directives, the banking activities had to form a distinct subsidiary in 2006, called La Banque postale. It received the official status of a bank while it had remained a public savings bank until then.  After 2005  A contemporary pillar box in Gif-sur-Yvette. La Poste lost its monopoly on postal delivery in 2005. Since then, several competing firms have started business in France. Most of them only deliver parcels (for example, TNT Express, DHL Express and United Parcel Service) or recorded letters, while mail delivery itself has yet to attract private companies. Most of the companies dealing with mail services only operate on a local scale, because they cannot compete with the extremely wide network of offices La Poste enjoys throughout the country. La Poste became a public limited company in 2010. Although most of the Western European countries have fully privatised their postal service companies, public opinion in France is largely against such a move. A majority of French citizens fear that if La Poste becomes a private company, many post offices would close, rural areas would be neglected and stamps would be more expensive. Supporters of privatisation claim that it would help solving the debt (‚Ç¨5.8 billions in 2009) and contain the rise of prices. In 2013 La Poste invested around ‚Ç¨1 billion in renovating post offices, modernising infrastructure and reinforcing its network, along with the purchase of electric delivery vehicles.

It treated 15 billion messages in 2012, of which 97% implied an administration or a firm. Relations to customer only represented 55% of the company's revenue (55% for business relations ; 16% for advertisement). International mail delivery accounted for 7% of the 2012 revenue. The same year, Swiss Post and La Poste launched a joint company, Asendia, to merge their international mail activities. La Poste offers three different rates for sending mail in France: first-class, second-class and green letter. The latter was introduced in 2011 to provide an ecological alternative to the regular rates. It emits 15% less CO2 than first-class letters. In 2012, it accounted for one in five priority letters.(20 percent of priority letters). =Parcels and Express (GeoPost)= GeoPost groups most parcel subsidiaries of La Poste Group. In France, the company provides two brands, Chronopost and DPD (formerly Exapaq). Worldwide, the brands are DPD, Yurti√ßi Kargo and Seur GeoPost. La Poste is the second biggest provider for parcel delivery in Europe, with a 15% share of the market and a ‚Ç¨5 billion revenue. In 2017, Geopost expands its activities in Italy, Russia, Brazil and Vietnam. =Other activities= In addition to postal services, La Poste also offers banking and insurance services (with La Banque Postale) and, via Chronopost, courier services. After the government, La Poste is the second largest employer in France. It also offers webmail, providing @laposte.net email addresses and hosts approximately 1.6 million active email accounts. More recently, the group has created a branch for communication counselling (Mediaprism), document exchange and archiving (Docapost), real estate (Poste Immo) and mobile telephony (La Poste Mobile, in partnership with SFR). Corporate identity Yellow is the main colour of the French post since the 1960s. Previously, postal vans used to be green and post boxes blue. Yellow was chosen because it is a colour that is easily seen and because it can symbolise speed and light. The logotype of La Poste was created by poster designer Guy Georget. It represents a bird, often called the \\"postal bird\\" (\\"l'oiseau postal\\"), symbolising a messenger. Its design was slightly altered by Georget in 1978.Chronique du timbre-poste fran√ßais, 2005, page 180. File:Logo ptt 1960.jpgThe 1960 bird. File:Logo ptt 1978.jpgCurrent design.

Eastern and Southern Georgia had been under intermittent Persian suzerainty for many centuries up to the early course of the 19th century, while western Georgia had been under its suzerainty for much shorter periods of time throughout history. Georgia especially rose to importance from the time of the Persian Safavids. Due to these millennia long intertwined relations, there has been a lot of political and cultural exchange between the two nations for thousands of years. In the words of Keith Hitchins / Encyclop√¶dia Iranica: Ancient period Evidence from Achaemenid cuneiform inscriptions suggest that there was trade between the Achaemenids and Georgian tribes. According to Herodotus, the proto-Georgians of Transcaucasia were included in the 18th and 19th satrapies (see: Districts of the Achaemenid Empire). Although the Achaemenids had Southern Georgia under their control, they never managed to subdue the tribes to the north. Following the collapse of the Achaemenids, the first Iberian king, Parnavaz (whose mother was a Persian woman),Georgian royal annals, page of edition 20, line of edition 18 adopted a Persian style institutions as models in organizing his realm. During the Parthian era, the Caucasus was contested between Rome and Persia, with the monarchy of Georgia playing both sides in order to maintain its independence. In the late 2nd century AD, the Arsacid Parthians established an eponymous branch of their dynasty on the Georgian throne, known as the Arsacid dynasty of Iberia. From the first centuries C.E., the cult of Mithras and Zoroastrianism were commonly practiced in Iberia. Excavation of rich burials in Bori, Armazi, and Zguderi has produced silver drinking cups with the impression of a horse either standing at a fire-altar or with its right foreleg raised above the altar.Machabeli, pls. 37, 51-54, 65-66 The cult of Mithras, distinguished by its syncretic character and thus complementary to local cults, especially the cult of the Sun, gradually came to merge with ancient Georgian beliefs. It is even thought that Mithras must have been the precursor of St. George in pagan Georgia.Makalatia, pp. 184-93 Step by step, Iranian beliefs and ways of life penetrated deeply the practices of the Iberian court and elite: the Armazian script and ‚Äúlanguage,‚Äù which is based on Aramaic (see Tsereteli), was adopted officially (a number of inscriptions in Aramaic of the Classical/Hellenistic periods are known from Colchis as well,;Braund, pp. 126-27) the court was organized on Iranian models, the elite dress was influenced by Iranian costume, the Iberian elite adopted Iranian personal names,Braund, pp. 212-15 and the official cult of Armazi (q.v.) was introduced by King Pharnavaz in the 3rd century B.C.E. (connected by the medieval Georgian chronicle to Zoroastrianism)Apakidze, pp. 397-401 This ended when the Sassanids took power. There was peace between Iberia and the Sassanids and Iberia helped the Sassanids in their campaigns against Rome. During this time, Zoroastrianism was also established in the region. However, Rome managed to taker the territory for sixty years, at which point Christianity was established, around 317. Iranian elements in ancient Georgian art and archeology gradually started to cease gradually as well since the adoptation of Christianity in the same century. Decisive for the future history of Iberia was the foundation of the Sasanian (or Sassanid) Empire in 224. By replacing the weak Parthian realm with a strong, centralized state, it changed the political orientation of Iberia away from Rome. Iberia became a tributary of the Sasanian state during the reign of Shapur I (241-272). Relations between the two countries seem to have been friendly at first, as Iberia cooperated in Persian campaigns against Rome, and the Iberian king Amazasp III (260-265) was listed as a high dignitary of the Sasanian realm, not a vassal who had been subdued by force of arms. But the aggressive tendencies of the Sasanians were evident in their propagation of Zoroastrianism, which was probably established in Iberia between the 260s and 290s. However, in the Peace of Nisibis (298) while the Roman empire obtained control of Caucasian Iberia again as a vassal state and acknowledged the reign over all the Caucasian area, it recognized Mirian III, the first of the Chosroid dynasty, as king of Iberia. However, after the emperor Julian was slain during his failed campaign in Persia in 363, Rome ceded control of Iberia to Persia, and King Varaz-Bakur I (Asphagur) (363-365) became a Persian vassal, an outcome confirmed by the Peace of Acilisene in 387 However, a later ruler of Kartli, Pharsman IV (406-409), preserved his country's autonomy and ceased to pay tribute to Persia. Persia prevailed, and Sassanian kings began to appoint a viceroy (pitiaxae/bidaxae) to keep watch on their vassal. They eventually made the office hereditary in the ruling house of Lower Kartli, thus inaugurating the Kartli pitiaxate, which brought an extensive territory under its control. Although it remained a part of the kingdom of Kartli, its viceroys turned their domain into a center of Persian influence. Sasanian rulers put the Christianity of the Georgians to a severe test. They promoted the teachings of Zoroaster, and by the middle of the 5th century Zoroastrianism had become the second official religion in eastern Georgia alongside Christianity. Religious issues arose after the Sassanids retook the territory. In 580, the Sassanids abolished the monarchy and made Iberia a province. Fighting between Rome, and later the Byzantines, and the Sassanids continued over the territory until the collapse of the Sassanids during the Islamic conquest of Persia,Hitchins, Keith. \\"History of Iranian- Georgian Relations\\". Encyclopaedia Iranica. June 11, 2007 with Eastern Georgia nevertheless staying under Persian suzerainty. Middle Ages The Kingdom of Georgia, under the reign of Tamar the Great, in 1209, laid waste to Ardabil ‚Äì according to the Georgian and Armenian annals ‚Äì as a revenge for the local Muslim ruler's attack on Ani and his massacre of the city's Christian population. In a great final burst, the brothers led an army marshaled throughout Tamar's possessions and vassal territories in a march, through Nakhchivan and Julfa, to Marand, Tabriz, and Qazvin in northwest Iran, pillaging several settlements on their way, making northwestern Iran mark the southernmost maximum extent of the empire. Safavid period =16th century= Rostom (also known as Rustam Khan), viceroy of Kartli, eastern Georgia, from 1633-1658. The Iranian Safavid dynasty (which, due to extensive intermarriages, was of partly ethnic Georgian origin itself as well, see; Safavid dynasty family tree) was in constant conflict with the Ottomans over control and influence in the Caucasus. From the 16th to the 18th centuries, Iran had to deal with several independent kingdoms and principalities, as Georgia was not a single state at the time. These entities often following divergent political courses. Iran's sphere of influence was Eastern Georgia (the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti) and Southern Georgia (the kingdoms of Samtskhe-Saatabago), while Western Georgia was under Ottoman influence. These independent kingdoms came under intermittent suzerainty of Persia after Div-Sultan Rumlu's conquests in 1518 (though Kartli and Kakheti had been made vassals as early as 1503), till the early 19th century. The Georgian kings and princes, however, sought to break loose of their vassalage. David, the king of Kartli refused to adopt Islam, did not present himself at Shah Ismail's court, and made preparations for war. In 1521, Shah Ismail sent out a large army to suppress the rebellion. The army invaded and captured the Georgian capital of Tbilisi. After Ismail's death, the ten-year-old Tahmasp became Shah. Taking advantage of the situation, David retook Tbilisi and freed himself from vassalage. The situation did not end there, as later Georgian kings continued the fight against Safavid Iran, while many others chose the Iranian side. In 1527, Luarsab I (Lohrasp I) ascended came to power in Kartli. Iskandar Beg Munshi, an Iranian historian of the first half of the 17th century, noted that Luarsab was distinguished among Georgian kings for his courage, refusing to show obedience and pay tribute. Only Luarsab continued to fight against the Iranians as other Georgian kings had made deals and accepted Iranian sovereignty, often accepting Islam and taking Persian names and embracing Persian culture for many centuries afterwards (Such as the important Georgian kings Isa Khan, Gurgin Khan, Daud Khan, Rostam Khan, Semayun Khan and many others). In 1540-1554 Shah Tahmasp led four campaigns against Georgia, devastating the country's eastern and southern regions and taking tens of thousands of Georgian captives to Iran. Luarsab fell in battle in 1556. On May 29, 1555, Safavid Iran and the Ottoman Empire concluded a treaty at Amasya by which Transcaucasia was divided between the two. Western Georgia and the western part of southern Georgia fell to The Ottomans, while Eastern Georgia and the (largest) eastern part of southern Georgia fell to Iran, thus making Kartli again part of the Safavid Empire. In 1556 Luarsab's son, Simon (also called Somayun Khan by Iskandar Beg Munshi), ascended the thrown of Kartli and continued the struggle for independence. In 1569 Simon was taken prisoner and sent to Qazvin. Refusing to adopt Islam, he was imprisoned in the fortress of Alamut in Iran. During Simon's captivity Kartli was governed by his Islamised brother Daud-Khan, adopted son of the shah of Iran. Shah Ismail II later freed Simon, making him an ally against the Ottomans. After this period, Iranian Georgians gained increasing influence and power in politics and the military. =17th century= In 1603, Shah Abbas attempted to solve the Georgian question by conquering eastern Georgia. Some members of the Georgian monarchy continued their struggle and Shah Abbas invaded and devastated Georgia several times, often killing members of the royal family. Upon the ignoring of Abbas' demand for Teimuraz I of Kakheti and Luarsab II of Kartli to appear in Mazandaran and his suspicion of their treason, he used it as a pretext to invade his Georgian lands, and settle the issue once and for all. During these punitive campaigns against his formerly two loyal subjects, 200,000 Georgians were deported to mainland Iran (see Abbas I's Kakhetian and Kartlian campaigns). After continued fighting and resistance, both sides agreed to compromise. The monarchies of the Georgian kingdoms were replaced by pro- Iranian monarchs of the Bagrationi line, while those who resisted would be eventually executed in Iran, such as the same Luarsab II of Kartli. But the kingdoms would be controlled as subjects for many centuries afterwards. In 1660 a rebellion took place in which the Georgians attacked the Turkmen settled in their regions by the Iranian Safavids, and defeating the Iranian garrisons. Afterwards, after the rebellion was suppressed, the leaders of the rebellion turned themselves in and were executed, in order to prevent Safavid retaliation. =18th century= Early in the 18th century, Iran was under a serious threat of being conquered by the Afghans. the shah of Iran entrusted the command of the troops fighting against Afghanistan to the Islamized Georgian kings. There were about 2000 Georgian troops in Afghanistan. Led by Giorgi XI (known as Gurgin Khan in Iran), the Georgians succeeded temporarily in halting the raids of Afghan tribes against Iran. In 1709 Giorgi XI was treacherously murdered by instigation of Afghan leader Mirwais Khan Hotak. From the 18th century the religious factor did not seem to determine state relations, yet the Shah's court ascribed serious meaning to the valee of Kartli professing Islam. By such policy towards Eastern Georgia, Iran clearly confronted Russian and Ottoman operations in the country. To keep Eastern Georgia loyal and its king a Muslim, the shah made many concessions to the valee of ‚ÄúGurjistan‚Äù ‚Äì adding to his titles, raising his ‚Äúsalary‚Äù, and granting him villages in Iran. In 1703, Vakhtang VI became the ruler of the kingdom of Kartli. In 1716, he adopted Islam and the shah confirmed him as King of Kartli. However, the shah retained Vakhtang in Iran, appointing him as spasalar (‚Äúcommander‚Äù) of the Iranian region of Azerbaijan. Vakhtang VI carried out successful campaigns against the Dagestani people. However, at a decisive moment he was ordered to discontinue the campaign, leading Vakhtang to adopt a pro-Russian orientation, though the Russian failed to tender him the promised military aid. During the war with the Afghans, the Ottomans occupied Kartli. In July of the same year Vakhtang was forced to go into exile to Russia, with a 1200 strong retinue. The Safavid dynasty collapsed in 1736, being succeeded by the Afsharids who would control all of Georgia again. Nader Shah expelled the Turkish garrisons that had invaded Georgia in the wake of the collapse of the Safavids and swiftly re-established Iranian rule over Georgia. For the loyal service of Teimuraz II of Kakheti and his son Erekle II against the Ottomans and their help in reestablishing Iranian rule over Georgia, he appointed them respectively as kings of Kartli and Kakheti in 1744.Ronald Grigor Suny. \\"The Making of the Georgian Nation\\" Indiana University Press, 1994. p 55 The Iranian Afsharids were succeeded by the Qajars, who would also reestablish (though briefly) Iranian suzerainty over Georgia. Qajar period Eastern Georgia, composed of the kingdoms of Kartli and Kakheti, had been in the early modern era under Iranian vassalship for the first time in 1502, and had been under intermittent Iranian suzerainty and rule since 1555. However, with the death of Nader Shah in 1747, both kingdoms broke free of Iranian control and were reunited in a personal union under the rule of the energetic king Heraclius II (Erekle) in 1762. Between 1747 and 1795, Erekle was therefore, by the turn of events in Iran following the ongoing turmoil there, able to maintain Georgia's autonomy through the Zand period. In 1783, Heraclius placed his kingdom under the protection of the Russian Empire in the Treaty of Georgievsk. In the last few decades of the 18th century, Georgia had become a more important element in Russo-Iranian relations than some provinces in northern mainland Persia, such as Mazandaran or even Gilan. Unlike Peter I, Catherine, the then ruling monarch of Russia, viewed Georgia as a pivot for her Caucasian policy, as Russia's new aspirations were to use it as a base of operations against both Iran and the Ottoman Empire, both immediate bordering geo-political rivals of Russia. On top of that, having another port on the Georgian coast of the Black Sea would be ideal. A limited Russian contingent of two infantry battalions with four artillery pieces arrived in Tbilisi in 1784, but was withdrawn, despite the frantic protests of the Georgians, in 1787 as a new war against Ottoman Turkey had started on a different front. The consequences of these events came a few years later, when a new dynasty, the Qajars, emerged victorious in the protracted power struggle in Persia. Their head, Agha Mohammad Khan, as his first objective, resolved to bring the Caucasus again fully under the Persian orbit. For Agha Mohammah Khan, the resubjugation and reintegration of Georgia into the Iranian Empire was part of the same process that had brought Shiraz, Isfahan, and Tabriz under his rule. He viewed, like the Safavids and Nader Shah before him, the territories no different than the territories in mainland Iran. Georgia was a province of Iran the same way Khorasan was. As the Cambridge History of Iran states, its permanent secession was inconceivable and had to be resisted in the same way as one would resist an attempt at the separation of Fars or Gilan. It was therefore natural for Agha Mohammad Khan to perform whatever necessary means in the Caucasus in order to subdue and reincorporate the recently lost regions following Nader Shah's death and the demise of the Zands, including putting down what in Iranian eyes was seen as treason on the part of the wali of Georgia. Finding an interval of peace amid their own quarrels and with northern, western, and central Persia secure, the Persians demanded Heraclius II to renounce the treaty with Russia and to reaccept Persian suzerainty, in return for peace and the security of his kingdom. The Ottomans, Iran's neighboring rival, recognized the latters rights over Kartli and Kakheti for the first time in four centuries.Donald Rayfield. Edge of Empires: A History of Georgia Reaktion Books, 15 feb. 2013 p 255 Heraclius appealed then to his theoretical protector, Empress Catherine II of Russia, pledging for at least 3,000 Russian troops, but he was not listened, leaving Georgia to fend off the Persian threat alone.Lang, David Marshall (1962), A Modern History of Georgia, p. 38. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. Nevertheless, Heraclius II still rejected the Khan's ultimatum.Suny, Ronald Grigor (1994), The Making of the Georgian Nation, p. 59. Indiana University Press, Agha Mohammad Khan subsequently crossed the Aras River, and after a turn of events by which he gathered more support from his subordinate khans of Erivan and Ganja, he sent Erekle a last ultimatum, which he also declined, but, sent couriers to St.Petersburg. Gudovich, who sat in Georgievsk at the time, instructed Erekle to avoid \\"expense and fuss\\", while Erekle, together with Solomon II and some Imeretians headed southwards of Tbilisi to fend off the Iranians. With half of the troops Agha Mohammad Khan crossed the Aras river with, he now marched directly upon Tbilisi, where it commenced into a huge battle between the Iranian and Georgian armies. Erekle had managed to mobilize some 5,000 troops, including some 2,000 from neighboring Imereti under its King Solomon II. The Georgians, hopelessly outnumbered, were eventually defeated despite stiff resistance. Iranian king Agha Mohammad Khan was eventually in full control of the Georgian capital. The Persian army marched back laden with spoil and carrying off thousands of captives.P.Sykes, A history of Persia, Vol. 2, p.293Malcolm, Sir John (1829), The History of Persia from the Most Early Period to the Present Time, pp. 189-191. London: John Murray. By this, after the conquest of Tbilisi and being in effective control of eastern Georgia, Agha Mohammad was formally crowned Shah in 1796 in the Mughan plain.Michael Axworthy. Iran: Empire of the Mind: A History from Zoroaster to the Present Day Penguin UK, 6 nov. 2008 As the Cambridge History of Iran notes; \\"Russia's client, Georgia, had been punished, and Russia's prestige, damaged.\\" Heraclius II returned to Tbilisi to rebuild the city, but the destruction of his capital was a death blow to his hopes and projects. Upon learning of the fall of Tbilisi General Gudovich put the blame on the Georgians themselves. To restore Russian prestige, Catherine II declared war on Persia, upon the proposal of Gudovich, and sent an army under Valerian Zubov to the Qajar possessions on April of that year, but the new Tsar Paul I, who succeeded Catherine in November, shortly recalled it. =Russo-Persian Wars and irrevocable cessions= Georgia, Dagestan, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, prior to being ceded to Imperial Russia per the two Russo-Persian Wars of the 19th century. In 1797, Agha Mohammad Khan was assassinated in Shusha, after which the Iranian grip over Georgia softened. A year later, Erekle II had died as well, leaving the country in total muddle and confusion. A year later, the Russian troops took advantage of the situation and marched into Tbilisi. This, and the official annexation of Georgia in 1801, would form the direct reason for the two Russo-Persian Wars of the 19th century. The first war, the Russo- Persian War (1804-1813) directly started over consolidation of Irano-Russian rule over Georgia. The Iranian shah, like all kings before him, viewed Georgia as an unmistakable and integral part of the Iranian domains, no different than the mainland provinces of Gilan or Fars for example. Eastern Georgia furthermore had been under intermittent Iranian rule 1555. The annexation of Georgia was thus annexation of Iranian land, which made it inevitable that the new Iranian shah, Fath Ali Shah Qajar, would fight the two 19th-century wars with Russia to keep its Iranian domains safe. The very first war however, the 1804-1813 war, turned out in a huge failure. Despite Iranian successes in the earlier stages of the war, the successful late Russian campaigns, notably those at Aslanduz and Lankaran, made Iran forcefully sue for peace. The Treaty of Gulistan that was concluded in 1813, forced Qajar Iran to irrevocably cede Georgia, as well as Dagestan and most of modern-day Azerbaijan to Imperial Russia, amongst the other terms of the treaty.Timothy C. Dowling Russia at War: From the Mongol Conquest to Afghanistan, Chechnya, and Beyond p 728 ABC- CLIO, 2 dec. 2014 The next bout of hostilities, due to the huge dissatisfaction with the turn of events that forced Iran to cede swaths of its lands, culminated in the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828). Despite a successful Iranian offensive in the first year, it eventually turned out in an even worse defeat; the 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay forced Iran to irrevocably cede all of modern-day Armenia and the remaining part of the Azerbaijani Republic that were still in Iranian hands.Timothy C. Dowling Russia at War: From the Mongol Conquest to Afghanistan, Chechnya, and Beyond p 728-729 ABC-CLIO, 2 dec. 2014 By 1828, Iran was stripped of all its territories in Transcaucasia and the North Caucasus including Georgia, which all had made part of the concept of Iran for three centuries. As the millennia old links with Iran and the Caucasus could only be severed by a superior force from outside, it would be Russia that cut these ties. From 1813 and on, Georgia entered a Russian- dominated sphere until 1991 with the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Cultural exchanges Starting from the early 16th century,Willem Floor,Edmund Herzig. Iran and the World in the Safavid Age I.B.Tauris, 15 sep. 2012 p 494 although certain aspects of more recent times were already incorporated since the 12th century, until the course of the 19th century, Georgian culture became significantly influenced by Persian culture. Though notably more visibly amongst the higher classes, Persian cultural aspects were incorporated amongst the already existing Georgian columns, especially painting, architecture, and literature. The French traveller Jean Chardin who visited Georgia in 1672 noted that the Georgians followed Persian customs. Since many Georgian kings, princes, and nobles were either born or raised in mainland Iran, it is not surprising that Persian cultural aspects spread in Georgia. =Georgian literary contacts with Persia and Persian literature= Georgian manuscript of the Shahnameh written in the Georgian script. Starting from the early 16th century, although certain aspects of more recent times were already incorporated since the 12th century, until the course of the 19th century, Georgian literature became significantly influenced by Persian culture. Jamshid Sh. Giunashvili remarks on the connection of Georgian culture with that of the Persian literary work Shahnameh: Georgian literary works such as Tamariani, the poem Abdulmesiani, Rustaveli's Vepkhistqaosani and chronicles contain the names of Iranian heroes borrowed from the Shahnama. These include Rustam, KhayKhusraw, Zal, Tur amongst others. The story of Zahak and Fereydun were known in Georgian literature and mention of this story is made in the Kartlis tskhovreba. Other important books of Persian literature like Jami's Yusuf and Zuleikha, Nizami's Lili o Majnoon, Onsori's Vameq and 'Azraa, the story of Salaman and Absal, and the famous Vis o Ramin were known in the literary circles of Georgia. An early Georgian translation of Vis o Ramin predates an extant Persian manuscript and has been used by scholars to produce a critical edition of Vis o Ramin. The familiarity of Georgian authors with the Persian classics also played a significant role in the development of Georgian literature. Monumental works such as the epic romance Amiran- Darejaniani ascribed to Mose Khoneli, Tamariani by Grigol Chakhrukhadze (12th century), Abdulmesiani by Iovane Shavteli and, finally, the masterpiece of Georgian poetry Vepkhistqaosani (The man in the panther skin) by Shota Rustaveli were written during this era of cultural synthesis. Trade A trade and caravan route crossed the territory of Georgia by which raw silk, wine, fruits, Furs, Kakhetian walnuts (annually 4000 camel-loads of Kakhetian walnuts were exported to Safavid Iran), Kakhetian horses (known as \\"gurji\\"), various vegetables, and madder were imported by Iran from Georgia. Georgian documentary sources supply abundant evidence that Georgian imported extensively from Iran. Georgian ‚ÄúDowry Books‚Äù very often refer to clothes make from fabrics manufactured in Iran, such as daraia of Yazd, wool of Kerman, daraya of Gilan, wool of Rizaiyh, sheidish of Yezd, and of Khar. Frequently mentioned among valuable fabrics are zarbab, darayabavt and diba. In the 17th and 18th centuries, precious stones were also imported from Iran. ‚ÄúDowry Books‚Äù make frequent mention of Nishapur turquoise, Badakhshan ruby, jacinth, pearls, emerald.

As a student, he won scholarships to study in the colony of Dahomey (Benin) in 1938 and French Indochina in 1939. He returned to France, and was an underground member of the jeunesses communistes resistance from 1940 to 1944. During this time he met his wife, Georgette, a feminist journalist, novelist and poet. He received a degree from the Universit√© de Paris (1946) in geography, specialising in the countries of West Africa and African studies. Returning to French West Africa after the war, he engaged in political and trade union organizing, taught secondary school in Dakar, but was forced to leave the then colony by the French government under military order. He was present during the 1947 Dakar‚ÄìNiger railway strike on which Ousmane Semb√®ne later based his seminal novel God's Bits of Wood. Back in France, Suret-Canale found a teaching post in Laval, Mayenne and pursued his political writing while keeping active in the Communist party. When Guinea became independent he returned to Africa, first teaching in Conakry (Lyc√©e Classique), becoming head of the former local branch of Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire (IFAN) (later the Institut National de Recherche et Documentation: the National Library, Archives and Museum of Guinea). Suret-Canale was later head of the Teachers College at Kindia (Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure). In the late 60s, he was again forced to return home by the French government under threat of having his nationality revoked. While in France Suret-Canale continued his active work in the French Communist Party, but was critical of the Stalinist leadership under Maurice Thorez. Following Stalin's (and Thorez's) death, Suret-Canale became one of the founders of the parties academic center, the Centre d'etudes recherches marxistes (C.E.R.M.) in 1960, where he is most known for developing Marxist theories on the Asiatic mode of production that were later adopteded by theoriticians of national liberation movements in the Third World. For some time was a member of the Central Committee of the PCF, despite having criticized the Politburo as an overly-rigid ruling body.R. Salloch.

Shortly before retiring to P√©rigord (where he had been in the resistance during the war) Suret-Canale submitted his Doctoral dissertation, a practice common in French academia. His \\"Africa and Capital\\" (Afrique et capitaux) brought together much of his research since the fifties or earlier.

It is mostly based on a novella by Zenna Henderson, \\"Pottage\\", but also contains elements from her stories \\"Ararat\\", \\"Gilead\\", and \\"Captivity\\". It stars Kim Darby, William Shatner, Diane Varsi, Laurie Walters, and Dan O'Herlihy. Plot summary This science fiction film tells the story of Melodye Amerson (Kim Darby), a young teacher who goes to a remote area to work with a group of individuals who have isolated themselves from civilization and maintained an independent community, vaguely similar to the Amish or a religious commune. Melodye is unnerved by the secretive behavior of her students, and the fact that all fun, games and activities she proposes are forbidden to them. Valancy (Diane Varsi), an elder in the community, advises Melodye to stay, because she senses that things are about to change in the valley, and Melodye herself is a part of that change. Melodye soon discovers that the secluded and \\"backwards\\" residents are actually aliens with mild paranormal powers. A natural disaster destroyed their planet, and they are hoping to establish a life on Earth. Landing in the late 1800s, initially they shared their secret with local residents, but found themselves condemned as witches. Many were killed, and the survivors forbade their children ever to use their abilities, even with extreme discretion. Young adults like Valancy (and even some of the older people) have been pushing for an end to these restrictions.

Caltrain only serves the stop on weekends and holidays; weekday service is provided by a bus shuttle to Millbrae. History The former station building in 2018 A station in north Burlingame was opened around 1911, and renamed to Buri Buri in 1917, then Broadway in 1926. The former Southern Pacific Railroad depot building at Broadway is extant and used as a restaurant. A lightly-used station at nearby Easton (which existed as a separate town from 1906 to 1910) was in service until at least 1925. Like most stations on the corridor, the Southern Pacific built Broadway with a side platform on the west track for southbound trains, and a narrow island platform between the tracks for northbound trains. Because of the narrow center platform for northbound passengers, a hold-out rule is in effect at the station: if a train is stopped for passengers, an approaching train in the opposite direction on the other track must wait outside the station. The resulting delays were the main reason that Broadway became a weekend-only station on August 1, 2005, shortly after the Caltrain Express project was completed. A free shuttle to Millbrae station was implemented in lieu of weekday service. =Future plans= After the electrification of Caltrain is completed, daily service is planned to be reinstated at Broadway. The nearby level grade crossing at Broadway Avenue is planned to be grade- separated, with construction projected to start as early as 2025 if funding can be identified. The at-grade crossing has been identified as the second- most necessary grade separation among 10,000 at-grade crossings in California because it handles 70,000 vehicles per day, and city officials state it is the site of the worst traffic congestion in Burlingame. Grade separation is projected to cost $250 million. Plans for a grade separation started in 1965 when the Peninsula Commute was being operated by the Southern Pacific Railroad, but were stymied by the complex geometry of Broadway, which intersects with roads immediately east (Carolan) and west (California) of the level crossing, and (further east) passes over U.S. 101 at an interchange rebuilt in 2017, and the heavy rail traffic, projected at more than 114 trains per day by 2020. Traffic through the actual grade crossing was estimated at 27,000 vehicles per day in 2015. There are an average of two accidents and 105 traffic citations issued each year resulting from traffic stopped on the tracks. Seven alternatives (including a no-build option preserving the current layout) were studied in the Broadway Grade Separation Project Study Report, which recommended Alternative A, a combination of partially elevating the rail line for and partially depressing the roadway for a length of , resulting in acceptable grades of up to 4.8 percent for road traffic and 0.75 percent for rail traffic. Under Alternative A, shoofly tracks would first be constructed east of the existing line and west of Carolan, then rail traffic would be diverted while the existing line was elevated. After the new rail bridge and embankments were completed, rail traffic would shift back to the newly elevated original alignment and Broadway would be temporarily closed while being reconstructed at a depressed alignment. Alternatives with the rail line lowered were considered, but they were rejected because of the high cost of drainage due to three nearby creeks. Broadway station would be rebuilt with an island platform to remove the existing hold-out rule. A preliminary design for the grade separation and station rebuild is anticipated for Spring 2019.

His work is categorized as Swiss typography and he is credited as \\"the father\\" of New Wave or Swiss Punk typography. Childhood Weingart was born near the Swiss border of Germany, in the Salem Valley, in 1941. He lived near Lake Constance for about thirteen years. and spent his childhood in Germany, moving to Lisbon in 1954 with his family. It was also known that Wolfgang had 9 siblings in is family, 4 of which were adopted. Education In April 1958 he returned to Germany and began his studies at the Merz Academy in Stuttgart, where he attended a two-year program in applied graphic arts. He learned typesetting, linocut and woodblock printing. Weingart then completed a three-year typesetting apprenticeship in hot metal hand composition at Ruwe Printing. There he came into contact with the company‚Äôs consulting designer, Karl-August Hanke, who became his mentor and encouraged him to study in Switzerland. Teaching and work Weingart met Emil Ruder and Armin Hofmann in Basel in 1963 and moved there the following year, enrolling as an independent student at the Schule f√ºr Gestaltung Basel (Basel School of Design). In 1968, he was invited to teach typography at the institution‚Äôs newly established Kunstgewerbeschule where Hofmann taught. The designers that surrounded Hofmann were not as focused on using Swiss-style principles in application to their work. These stylistic choices proved to be a great influence on Weingart, who was one of the first designers to abandon these strict principles that controlled Swiss design for decades. Between 1974 and 1996, at Hofmann‚Äôs invitation, Weingart taught at the Yale Summer Program in Graphic Design in Brissago, Switzerland. For over forty years he has lectured and taught extensively in Europe, North and South America, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. According to Weingart, \\"I took 'Swiss Typography' as my starting point, but then I blew it apart, never forcing any style upon my students. I never intended to create a 'style'. It just happened that the students picked up‚Äîand misinterpreted‚Äîa so-called 'Weingart style' and spread it around.\\"Poynor, Rick. Eye, No. 4, Vol. 1, 1994, pp. 8‚Äì16.

In 2005 he was awarded the honorary title of Doctor of Fine Arts from MassArt. In 2013 he was a recipient of the AIGA Medal, the highest honor of the design profession, for his typographic explorations and teaching.

Olteanu was born in T√¢rgu Mure»ô in 1888. After Northern Transylvania was ceded by Romania to Hungary in 1940, at a result of the Second Vienna Award, he moved to Bra»ôov, where he took command of a paramilitary unit of the Iron Guard. During World War II, this unit was active in Trei Scaune, Ciuc, Odorhei, and Mure»ô counties. Following King Michael's Coup of 23 August 1944, Romania switched allegiance from the Axis powers to the Allies. In early September, Soviet and Romanian forces entered Transylvania, captured the towns of Bra»ôov and Sibiu, and engaged units of the Hungarian 2nd Army and the German 8th Army at the Battle of Turda. On 26 September 1944, in reprisals against attacks on Romanian troops by the local population, members of the paramilitary Maniu Guard led by Olteanu massacred a number Hungarian civilians in Aita SeacƒÉ village; 9 were shot, 2 decapitated, and 2 later died of their wounds.

The family was traditionally circumscribed quite broadly, with around 55 genera totalling over 400 species. In 2001, though, this circumscription was found to be polyphyletic, and the family was split into four families in three different orders: Icacinaceae sensu stricto (then unplaced at order rank), Pennantiaceae (Apiales), Stemonuraceae (Aquifoliales) and Cardiopteridaceae (also Aquifoliales).

Genera List according to Stull et al. (2015): History In 1841, George Bentham described Apodytes and Pogopetalum as new genera and united them with Icacina, Gomphandra, and Leretia to create the tribe Icacineae of what would later be called the family Olacaceae.George Bentham. 1841. page 679. In: \\"Account of two new genera allied to Olacineae\\". Transactions of the Linnean Society of London 18:671-686 & plates 41 and 42. (see External links below). Olacaceae was at that time, and through the 20th century, defined broadly, encompassing several families in the order Santalales.Val√©ry Mal√©cot and Daniel L. Nickrent. 2008. \\"Molecular Phylogenetic Relationships of Olacaceae and Related Santalales\\". Systematic Botany 33(1):97-106.

A revision of Emmotum\\". Journal of the Arnold Arboretum 23:479-494. In 1852, John Miers argued that Bentham's Icacineae did not belong in Olacaceae and he raised them to the taxonomic rank of family as Icacinaceae.John Miers. 1852. page 221. In: \\"Observations on the Affinities of the Icacinaceae\\". Annals and Magazine of Natural History, iccluding Zoology, Botany, and Geology, series 2. 9:218-226. (see External links below). Philippe van Tieghem realized that the family Icacinaceae, as circumscribed by Miers, consisted of groups that were only distantly related, and in 1897, he divided it into seven families.Philippe E.L. van Tieghem. 1897. page 842.

Van Tieghem's treatment in some ways anticipated the results of 21st century phylogenetic studies, in particular, by his establishment of the families Emmotaceae and Leptaulaceae. His division of Icacinaceae into smaller families was not accepted and other authors continued to define Icacinaceae in the broad sense, known as Icacinaceae sensu lato. In 1942, Hermann Sleumer defined Icacinaceae broadly in his coverage of the family for Die Nat√ºrlichen Pflanzenfamilien.Hermann Sleumer. 1942. \\"Icacinaceae\\" pages 322-396. In: H.G.

In 2001, Jesper K√•rehed, using a combination of morphological and DNA sequence data, showed that Icacinaceae sensu lato was distantly polyphyletic and was, at least arguably, the worst of the plant families. It is now known to have rivaled Flacourtiaceae as an unnatural assemblage of disparate groups. K√•rehed divided it into four families: Pennantiaceae, Stemonuraceae, Cardiopteridaceae, and Icacinaceae sensu stricto. Pennantiaceae consists of the single genus Pennantia and is the most basal clade in the campanulid order Apiales.Jesper K√•rehed. 2003. \\"The family Pennantiaceae and its relationships to Apiales\\". Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society 141(1):1-24.Gregory M. Plunkett, Gregory T. Chandler, Porter P. Lowry, Steven M. Pinney, and Taylor S. Sprenkle. 2004. \\"Recent advances in understanding Apiales and a revised classification\\". South African Journal of Botany 70(3):371-381. Stemonuraceae is a family of 12 genera in the campanulid order Aquifoliales. It is sister to Cardiopteridaceae. Before the phylogeny produced by K√•rehed, Cardiopteridaceae contained only Cardiopteris. K√•rehed transferred Citronella, Gonocaryum, and Leptaulus from Icacinaceae to this family, and provisionally placed Metteniusa, Dendrobangia, and Pseudobotrys there as well. Metteniusa was shown to be a lamiid in 2007, and was placed in a family by itself.Favio Gonz√°lez, Julio Betancur, Olivier Maurin, John V. Freudenstein, and Mark W. Chase. 2007. \\"Metteniusaceae, an early-diverging family in the lamiid clade\\". Taxon 56(3):795-800. The affinities of Dendrobangia and Pseudobotrys remain obscure. Some authors have continued to maintain Cardiopteridaceae as a monogeneric family, placing Citronella, Gonocaryum, Leptaulus, Dendrobangia, and Pseudobotrys in Leptaulaceae.Timothy M.A. Utteridge and Richard K. Brummitt. 2007. \\"Leptaulaceae\\" pages 191-192. In: Vernon H. Heywood, Richard K. Brummitt, Ole Seberg, and Alastair Culham. Flowering Plant Families of the World. Firefly Books: Ontario, Canada. (2007). The study by K√•rehed showed Cardiopteris to be embedded in Leptaulaceae, but statistical support for this position was not strong. Some genera have later been moved to Metteniusaceae (Metteniusales).

It was the subject of a Guardian editorial simply entitled \\"Real progress\\". Origins It was conceived by the Publications Co-ordinator on the Green Party of England and Wales#Executive 25-year-old Matt Wootton in late Summer 2003. It was first used in a leaflet at the Green Party's Autumn Conference in Lancaster in 2003. The Real Progress phrase was based on a theme initiated by External Communications Co-ordinator 2000-2004 Dr Spencer Fitz-Gibbon. By the end of the year Wootton had employed graphic designer Jim Killock to unify the words Green Party and Real Progress in a single \\"badge\\" and the \\"lozenge\\" was born, inspired as a homage to the European Green Party's \\"rhomb\\" which Wootton and Killock considered clunky (see Wootton's homepage). Stylistic changes The Real Progress rebrand was also a house style change, using a new set of colours, according to Wootton's website, inspired by the colours used on the website of the Swedish Green Party. The rebrand utilised a designer typeface - the first time the Green Party had used one - which was chosen to be the modern-looking FF Profile which was chosen for its progressive, clean and slightly quirky qualities. Impact and significance The rebrand was first launched to the media at the Spring Conference 2004 and made was covered by the BBC and The Times. The Times articleGreens to drop sandals for suits and soundbites demonstrates the importance of the rebrand to the Green Party at that time, with the party apparently eschewing \\"beards, sandals and nut cutlets\\" for \\"sharp suits, a new colour scheme, a corporate logo and an ‚Äúupbeat‚Äù range of ‚Äúcommonsense‚Äù policies.\\" Although not an essentially research-based rebrand created using qualitative feedback, Wootton and Killock (Killock joined the Executive the next year) went on to become the party's two leading advocates of research and demographics.

He played college football at Stanford, where he was an All-American. College career Gallarneau attended Morgan Park High School in Chicago, Illinois, but did not play high school football, opting instead for swimming, track, and baseball. After high school, he was accepted to Stanford University on an academic scholarship, and decided to try out for the football team for the 1938 season and made the team. In 1938, Stanford's team was 3‚Äì6, and the next year, fell to 1‚Äì7‚Äì1. The next year, 1940, new head football coach Clark Shaughnessy introduced the T formation, and the Indians were transformed in a winner. Gallarneau, along with quarterback Frankie Albert, halfback Pete Kmetovic, and fullback Norm Standlee, were the core of a team known as the Wow Boys, which went undefeated and beat Nebraska 21‚Äì13 in the 1941 Rose Bowl. In that game, Gallarneau scored two of Stanford's touchdowns, on a 10-yard run and a 40-yard pass reception. Gallarneau was named an All-American in football, was on Stanford's rugby team, and won the Pacific Coast Conference heavyweight boxing title. NFL career In the 1941 NFL Draft, Gallarneau was selected in the third round by the Chicago Bears. He played for the Bears for the 1941 and 1942 seasons. Gallarneau still holds the Bears' record for the longest punt return in a postseason game, returning a punt 81 yards for a touchdown against the Green Bay Packers in the divisional playoffs to help lead the Bears to the 1941 NFL Championship game. The return also remains the third-longest in NFL postseason history. In 1943, Gallarneau joined the Marine Corps to fight in World War II, where he fought in the Pacific Theater and rose to the rank of major. He was a member of an Air Warning Squadron during the Battle of Okinawa and was responsible for directing night fighters to intercept incoming Japanese aircraftDeChant Devilbirds, p. 234. He returned to the Bears for the 1945 season, and played three more seasons before retiring in 1947. After football After leaving football, Gallarneau remained in Chicago, working for Marshall Field's and Hart, Schaffner & Marx, where he retired as a vice president in 1985. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1982 and is a member of the Stanford Athletic Hall of Fame and the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame. He died in Northfield, Illinois, in 1999.

Born in Kobe, Japan in 1878, he moved as a boy with his family to Western Australia's north-west where his father Sakutaro set up a business in 1891. Jiro attended the state school at Cossack, and from 1895 to '97 boarded at Xavier College, Melbourne. The family business prospered, importing goods for the Japanese community of Cossack, and when their father died in 1898 (leaving an estate of ¬£1,101) Jiro and his brother Tsunetaro took control of the family firm. They re-branded it J. & T. Muramats and under this title imported and traded goods to the north-west for more than 50 years. His brother moved back to Japan to operate the exporting side of the business from there, until his death in 1925. In November 1904 he applied for a Gallon License for his residence in Perseverance Street in Cossack. This license was granted, but not after opposition on the grounds that he was a foreigner (despite being naturalised at this point) and also that there were already two other pubs in town. On 17 January 1905 Jiro married Hatsu Noguchi (originally from Nagasaki) who had arrived in Australia in 1896. They had one daughter. The company also owned pearling luggers which operated from Cossack despite a number of racist policies of the state that prohibited \\"coloured aliens\\" from owning pearling licences. The pearling, combined with goods trading, and the supply of credit to many other firms, meant that by 1915 a large proportion of the freehold land in Cossack belonged to the Muramats brothers. A period of revitalisation in the pearling industry became one of defiance by a number of operators who did not join the federal government's voluntary Northern Territory Pearling Ordinance in 1931. Muramats had been granted naturalization in Victoria, Australia, but amendments to acts in Western Australia disenfranchised many people from non-English ethnic backgrounds. He was interned during World War II and died of cancer in 1943 whilst still locked up in Tatura Internment Camp. His wife returned to Cossack in 1946, and was its last resident when the town was abandoned in the 1950s. She later returned to Japan, and died in Yokohama on 12 August 1959 (leaving an estate in Australia of ¬£7,670).

Geography Liendo is a municipality in the autonomous community of Cantabria, Spain, located in its east-coast region, 52 kilometers from Santander, bordering laredo and Castro Urdiales. Unlike other coastal towns it does not have extensive beaches, but a spectacular cliff coastline. It is seated in a green valley, especially suitable for agriculture, composed of thirteen districts. The dead end valley is enclosed by mountains and contains a low altitude endorheic river network which drains into a single sinkhole or ponor, known as \\"Eye of Rucueva\\" in the neighborhood of Isequilla, a peculiarity characteristic of a polje. The coastline is very rugged, offering the highest cliffs in the region. There are two small coves, sheltered from the majestic Mount Candina and Yesera, which contain the beach of San Juli√°n and the beach of Valdearenas (or Sonabia). Access to the latter exists only from Ori√±√≥n in Castro Urdiales. Human geography Liendo's Town Hall. Liendo has a long heritage and archaeological caves. The houses around Hazas, the capital city are grouped according to the remaining twelve districts. Highlights include civic buildings, stately homes with masonry facade on farms. Highlight is the mansion Albo, in Iseca Vieja neighborhood. Church of the Assumption of Our Lady in Hazas, Liendo, Cantabria. The Church dedicated to \\"Our Lady of the Assumption of Liendo\\", is a Site of Local Interest since 2002. Monumental church with a rich interior.

La Ermita de San Andr√©s and Roman bridge access to it, well inventoried since 2002. It is in the neighborhood of Villaviad. La Ermita de San Julian, now in ruins, is situated with beautiful views across the valley. It is the oldest building in the city, dated to the end of the 12th or the beginning of the 13th century. Beaches include Playa San Julian and Vadelarenas beach. Starting from the Iseca Vieja neighborhood, one of the most emblematic is the beach of San Julian, with barely 180 meters in length it is frequented every summer. Immersed in a unique landscape among steep coastal cliffs, it is the only beach that is accessible from the valley itself. Just before reaching the beach, a path leads to the ruins of the hermitage of San Julian. The view of the green valley of Valle Liendo from here contrasts with the cliffs from the beach of San Julian. Vadelarenas beach (or Sonabia) 3.5 km from Ori√±√≥n is a sheltered beach of 154 meters in length, with sloping drop.

He made significant and enduring contributions to the social, political and economic life of Imerina. Chief among these was the expansion of his territories and the pacification and unification of certain principalities that had become locked in violent conflict; Andriamasinavalona established and ruled over the largest extent of the Kingdom of Imerina. He gave the name of Antananarivo to the capital city that was rapidly expanding around the royal palace on the hill of Analamanga, created a large public square at Andohalo outside the gates of the city, and named a series of other locations within the city. He also took possession of a distant hill he renamed Ambohimanga as a lodging for his son Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana; the royal city that developed there has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The innovations of Andriamasinavalona were numerous and enduring. He created two additional noble castes and defined their associated rights, responsibilities and restrictions, and was responsible for introducing the tradition of the red parasol as an indicator of royalty; he also decreed that all women had the right to choose their husbands. Trade with the Sakalava kingdom enabled this king to increase the firearms, cannons and gunpowder available for the defense of the kingdom, and expanded the availability of luxury items like silver piastres and porcelain dishes. The dikes around the Betsimitatatra rice fields of Antananarivo were expanded and raised to help ensure against famine. In the interest of strengthening the defenses of the kingdom, Andriamasinavalona divided his realm into four quadrants to be ruled by his four favorite sons. This decision had the opposite effect, however; each was interested in expanding his own realm, prompting one son to kidnap the king and hold him hostage for seven years. After the king's eventual release, he famously committed a mock human sacrifice to re-sanctify his authority. Upon his death, Andriamasinavalona's sons launched military campaigns against one another to seize each other's territories, triggering 77 years of civil war in Imerina. In Madagascar today, Andriamasinavalona's reign is remembered as a golden age of justice, harmony and prosperity. Early life and accession to throne Andriamasinavalona was born Prince Andrianjakanavalondambo in the historic Merina capital of Alasora to his father King Andriantsimitoviaminandriandehibe and mother Rampanambonitany. He was made Prince of Alasora upon his father's death in 1670; his older brother, Andrianjaka Razakatsitakatrandriana, was named king. Andriamasinavalona ascended to the kingship of Imerina upon the deposition of his brother in 1675. The deposed king fled to the Sakalava kingdom to the west and attempted unsuccessfully to secure military support there to regain the throne.Ogot (1992), p. 877 Two enduring royal traditions emerged in Imerina as a consequence of the power struggle between Andriamasinavalona and his older brother. Some versions of oral history describe a combat between their armies at Ambohibato in which Andriamasinavalona emerged victorious. He erected a commemorative stone at the battle site that he named Ankazonorona, designating it the site where newly enthroned kings would stand to receive their first expression of hasina (homage, affirmation of authority) from their subjects.Callet (1908), p. 539 Andriamasinavalona also introduced the practice of gathering his subjects to consult them and obtain their consent before making certain decisions. This practice was continued by subsequent rulers in Imerina.Callet (1908), p. 540 Family and descendants Andriamasinavalona married twelve wives and produced nine sons and one daughter. The children of four of his wives would go on to rule their own kingdoms: Ratompoindroandriana gave birth to Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana at Ambohimanga; Ramananandrianjaka gave birth to Andriantomponimerina at Ambohidratrimo; Ramananimerina had her son Andrianjakanavalona at Antananarivo; and Rasolomanambonitany had Andrianavalonimerina near Ambohitrabiby. The children of four other wives would renounce all claims to the throne: Andriamborosy and Rafaralahimanjaka, born to Renilambo in Ambohidrapeto; Andriantsilavo, born to Ranavalona in Anosimanjaka; Andrianavalona, born to Rakalafohy in Isoraka; and Andriankotofananina, born to Reninandriankotofananina in Anosipatrana. The descendants of Andriamasinavalona's wives who renounced claim to the throne were ennobled by him as the royal Andriamasinavalona class. The remaining four marriages (to wives Ralanimboahangy, Raseranolona, Ranavalotomponimerina and Ramanamabahoaka) would not produce children, but one of these wives - Ralanimboahangy - adopted a girl named Andriamanitrinitany. She was housed with her adoptive mother at Ambohipeno and died without producing children of her own, although she likewise adopted a child named Ramasina, who was most likely the son of her sister.Callet (1908), p. 548 Reign Andriamasinavalona gave the city of Antananarivo its name. Andriamasinavalona is remembered in Imerina as a king of significant achievements. He is credited with unifying a number of warring principalities in Imerina and expanding the territory of the kingdom to its largest extent. He created the Andohalo town square outside the gate of Antananarivo, where all successive sovereigns delivered their royal speeches and announcements to the public. Andriamasinavalona gave the city - previously called by the name of its hill, Analamanga - its current name of Antananarivo, and assigned the names of numerous locations within the city, based on the names of similar sites in the nearby village of Antananarivokely. During his reign the production of the Betsimitatatra rice fields around Antananarivo was dramatically increased. He also increased the number of guns and quantity of gunpowder in Imerina through trade with neighboring kingdoms, and imported the kingdom's first cannons for its defense. Other innovations included the importation and fabrication of plates made from sea turtle skin. He strengthened the social order by creating two new noble castes, putting in place further restrictions and responsibilities for each, and decreeing the right of every woman to choose her own husband.Callet (1908), pp. 654-656 Andohalo, where Merina sovereigns addressed the public Under Andriamasinavalona's rule, the political administration of Imerina became more clearly defined. The number of andriana (noble) sub-castes was expanded from four to six and additional roles and specific territories were designated for each group, both within the neighborhoods of Antananarivo and in the countryside surrounding the capital. These territorial divisions were strictly enforced: members of subcastes were required to live within their designated territories and were not authorized to stay for extended periods in the territories reserved for others.Callet (1908), pp. 563-565 Andriamasinavalona decentralized governance and strengthened the power of local administrators by creating a series of new decrees that further formalized the relationship between the andriana and the hova (commoners) they ruled.Callet (1908), pp. 566-567 The king's reign was marked by a drought lasting seven years that caused a famine in much of Imerina. According to oral history, the king attempted to purchase rice from his fief at Ambohipiainana. The town had a surplus but the local leader refused to sell rice to Andriamasinavalona, claiming none was available. The king then sent porters to purchase rice from Antsahatovoka, where the residents declared that while the land was his and it was thus unnecessary for the king to purchase what already belonged to him, there was no rice available to share. Finally Andriamasinavalona sought to purchase rice in Andraisisa. His money was refused by the local leader, Andriandrivotra, who willingly gave the king large shares of food and a tribute of silver. To reward the leader of the fief, Andriamasinavalona promised to give him anything he liked. Andriandrivotra declared that all he desired was the love of his sovereign. To show his appreciation, Andriamasinavalona declared that he would make Andriasisa into a great fief, and gave Andriandrivotra a large piece of land to the west of the territory.Callet (1908), pp. 553-555 He then undertook a major expansion of the Betsimitatatra rice fields around Antananarivo, significantly increasing their rice production to feed the populace.Ellis (1838), pp. 121-122 =Sociopolitical restructuring= The right to tranomasina on the tombs of nobles was extended to new andriana subcastes created by Andriamasinavalona. Andriamasinavalona's reorganization and refinement of the subdivisions of the noble class took into account the precedents set by earlier Merina kings Andrianjaka and Ralambo. He declared that only members of the Zazamarolahy (\\"Numerous Children\\") caste, composed of nobles descended from Andrianjaka's children, could be shaded by the red parasol of royalty; the tradition of the royal parasol was introduced to Imerina during Andriamasinavalona's reign and persisted until the dissolution of the monarchy in 1897.Callet (1908), p. 659 He also decreed that their tombs should be topped with a tranomasina, a small wooden house without windows or hearth and containing their worldly riches, where their spirit could return to visit after death. Unlike other noble subcastes, the Zazamarolahy were not constrained to inhabit a particular neighborhood, as Andriamasinavalona acknowledged the privilege of future sovereigns to determine the proximity of these most influential nobles according to the particularities of changing circumstances. Andriamasinavalona also narrowed the pool of potential future sovereigns by restricting this right to a new sub-group within the Zazamarolahy, which he termed Zanak'andriana (\\"Children of the Sovereign\\"). This group comprised all the descendants of the royal wives who had given birth to the king's four designated heirs. New rulers could only be selected from among this new sub-class of nobles.Callet (1908), pp. 567-571 The four wives of King Andriamasinavalona whose children were not chosen to rule one of the four districts of Imerina were assigned the noble sub-caste of \\"Andriamasinavalona\\" and transferred this ranking to their descendants. The king declared that members of this sub-caste would inhabit Ambatobevanja, at the southern limit of the neighborhood of Andohalo in Antananarivo, just outside the walls of the royal palace. Although not authorized to rule the kingdom, the Andriamasinavalona were deemed societal elders and gained the right to become \\"masters of the fief\\" (tompo-menakely) and construct tranomasina on their tombs. They were also assigned the honor of burying deceased sovereigns and carrying out sacrifices requested by the king. Outside of Antananarivo, the Zazamarolahy and the Andriamasinavalona settled throughout Imerina in the individual fiefs centered around the hill towns that they governed. In this way, nobles always lived in close proximity to the people they ruled, ensured their defense and provided for their livelihood. Andriamasinavalona established new rules to strengthen the authority of the tompo-menakely over their subjects. Inhabitants of the fief paid taxes (isam- pangady) to the local lord, and offered him the hindquarters of all slaughtered zebu as tribute. Parents who adopted or disowned a child paid a fee of one silver piastre to the lord, and the property of those who died without children would revert to the king, who would share it with him. The inhabitants of a fief were bound to execute any work or task ordered by the tompo-menakely. The authority of the lord was highly independent and interference of the king was infrequent, in part due to the close kinship ties uniting the king to the Zazamarolahy and Andriamasinavalona sub-castes. The Zana-tompo (or Andriantompokoindrindra) were also considered elders, and Andriamasinavalona decreed that kings would henceforth select their wives and royal food tasters from among this caste. The rites pertaining to circumcision were another honor reserved for the Zana-tompo. The king decreed that they should inhabit the countryside south of the capital extending from Ambavahadimitafo southward to Ambatolampy. Outside of Antananarivo, the Zana- tompo lived in the village of Ambohimalaza. The Andrianamboninolona (or Zanakambony), Andriandranando (or Zafinandriandranando) and Zanadralambo were considered junior nobles. They were excluded from most of the rules imposed on other noble castes and exempted from fanampoana (forced labor in lieu of monetary tax payment). Instead, they were made responsible for maintaining a key dike that supported irrigation of the capital's rice paddies, producing the silk used to make the king's clothing, and conscripting soldiers for the king's army. They were also responsible for gathering used hoes for the royal blacksmiths to melt down and then supervise the artisans as the metal was crafted into nails, shackles and other forged objects. Within Antananarivo, the territory of the Andrianamboninolona, designated generations before by King Andrianjaka, included the neighborhood of Ambatomasina (east of Andohalo) and extended from Ambohitantely eastward to Ambatolampy and north to the principal road that led to Ambavahadimasina. The neighborhoods reserved in Antananarivo for the Andriandranando, also decreed by Andrianjaka, laid to the northeast of Andohalo and extended from Ambavahadimasina in the west to Ambohimanoro in the east, and from the road to Ambavahadimasina northward to Ambatonandriankoto. King Andriamasinavalona decreed that within the capital city, the Zanaralambo would live in the area delimited by Ambohitsoa to the southwest, Ambodivoanonoka to the east, and Andohalokely in the north. Outside the capital, each group had its designated villages. The Andrianamboninolona lived in Ambohitromby, Fieferana, Ambohipiainana and Ambohitriniandriana. The Andriandranando lived in Ambohibe, Ambohimailala, Manankasina, Soamanandrariny, Betsizaraina, Iadiambola, Masinandriana, Ampomanjaka and Akadindramamy. Finally, the Zanaralambo inhabited Lazaina, Ambatofotsy and Masindray. In addition to these new roles for noble sub-castes, Andriamasinavalona singled out the Antehiroka as sacred royal advisers and custodians of ancestral traditions related to circumcision. This clan was formed of the descendants of Andriampirokana and his two sons, themselves descendants of a vazimba king. Andriampirokana befriended King Ralambo and played an integral part in establishing the tradition of circumcision in Imerina. The collection of water gourds and arranging of freshly woven mats for use in the ceremony were made the responsibility of this clan. The Antehiroka were also tasked with delivering royal benedictions, receiving hasina (tribute) on behalf of the king, and wrapping deceased sovereigns in the traditional lambamena shroud. In Antananarivo, the Antehiroka were placed in Ampamaho, the location of their clan tomb. In the countryside, Andriamasinavalona decreed that they should inhabit Ambohitrinimanga and Amboditsiry.Callet (1908), pp. 569-574 =Expansion of realm= At the time of Andriamasinavalona's reign, the highlands around Imerina were wracked with violent conflict among minor princedoms centered around fortified hill towns. Andriamasinavalona successfully united a number of these principalities in the territory bordering his own, thereby expanding the boundaries of Imerina to include Fanongoavana to the west, Rangaina to the north, Ombifotsy to the east and Sahasarotra to the south.Callet (1908), p. 549 As he brought each territory under his control, he restricted the autonomy of its original rulers and imposed strict submission to his own authority. His diplomatic and political conquests enabled Andriamasinavalona to extend his kingdom to its fullest historical extent, making him the first Merina sovereign to rule over the entire province of Imerina. The first of these four territories to be incorporated into Imerina was Fanongoavana, then a principality ruled by Andriampanarivofomanjaka. Continual threats to his kingdom's security led Andriampanarivofomanjaka to secretly travel to the Rova of Antananarivo to pledge submission to Andriamasinavalona. He was accompanied by seven advisers who eloquently communicated their master's willingness to acknowledge Andriamasinavalona as his king. Andriamasinavalona accepted this offer and sealed the union of their territories by marrying Andriampanarivofomanjaka to his sister, Ranavalontsimitovy. Andriampanarivofomanjaka then returned to his realm, announced the union to his people, and then spoke with the leaders of the neighboring Bezanozano people to successfully persuade them to join the kingdom and benefit from Andriamasinavalona's protection.Callet (1908), pp. 549-551 The territory of Ombifotsy was ruled by Andriambahoakafovoanitany, who had a friendly relationship with Andriamasinavalona. The two agreed to a challenge: each would leave his palace simultaneously on a chosen Friday night, and walk toward the other's palace until the two met. They crossed paths at the Ombifotsy (\\"White Zebu\\") river, so named because the two sacrificed a white zebu there in honor of their friendship and the peace agreement between their two territories of Imamo and Imerina. Andriambahoakafovoanitany's son dug a trench along the river, where he erected a stone to commemorate the agreement. Imamo was divided into four parts, each administered by one of Andriambahoakafovoanitany's sons.Callet (1908), pp. 552-553 In addition, Andriamasinavalona is credited with founding Ambohimanga, a site of spiritual and historical significance that was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001. Oral history recounts that Andriamasinavalona first remarked a distant hill named Ambohitrakanga when he noticed a bonfire lit on its southern face 24 kilometers away from his rova at Antananarivo; the visibility of the site from his capital led Andriamasinavalona to desire the hill as a residence for his son, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana. Andriamasinavalona gave the hill its current name,Labourdette & Auzias (2011), pp. 187-188} and when he divided the Kingdom of Imerina into four quadrants in 1710, he gave the eastern quadrant of Avaradrano to Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana, who transformed his rova at Ambohimanga into its capital.Campbell (2012), p. 500 =Division of Imerina= The greatest point of controversy in Andriamasinavalona's reign was his decision to divide his kingdom among his four favorite sons: Andrianjakanavalonamandimby, Adrianmanotronavalonimerina, Andriantomponimerina I and Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana, who received the largest share of the land and was the most powerful of the four young sovereigns. Andriamasinavalona furthermore declared that his nephew Andriambonimena, his sister's son, would replace his own sons and succeed him as king after his death to rule all of Imerina as a united whole.Callet (1908), pp. 555-557 The controversial decision to divide Imerina into four sub-kingdoms may have been rooted in the desire to reorganize the kingdom in accordance with traditional notions of symbolic unity as represented by the four cardinal points surrounding a unifying center termed the \\"heart of Imerina\\" (Imerina efa-toko). Andriamasinavalona believed the kingdom would be better defended by four brothers than by one alone, and that they could support one another in warding off attackers from the outside.Callet (1908), pp. 559-560 According to oral history, Andriamasinavalona asked the guardian of Matsatso, one of the three most prominent royal idols, to ask the idol which of his sons should rule after him. The guardian hesitated to declare the idol's choice, but after the king promised no ill reaction to the decision, the man declared the successor to be Andrianavalonimerina. However, the king had hoped that the successor would be another son, Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana. He decided to test the prophecy by sending one of his wives to the guardian's house, where the population showed her respect by offering zebu for her to eat. The zebu cooked inconsistently, and the king interpreted this as a sign that the guardian was dishonest and intended to seize power himself, so Andriamasinavalona ordered him put to death and had the idol Matsatso discarded in a lake. He then asked the guardians of the two other idols (Kelimalaza and Soratra) to declare a successor; the guardian of Soratra fled, while the guardian of Kelimalaza stated that only the king could choose his successor.Callet (1908), pp. 555-557 lamba to illustrate the harmful consequences of dividing Imerina. Oral history relates that Andriamasinavalona then gathered the people at Andohalo to announce his decision. He requested the presence of his respected adviser and elder, Andriamampandry, who rebuffed the messenger by stating \\"I have no lamba.\\" The king sent him a lamba to wear, and the elder sent it back with the four corners torn off. The king again returned the lamba, and this time the elder trampled it in the mud. Nonetheless, Andriamampandry dressed in the lamba, declaring \\"What's been torn can be mended, and what's been dirtied can be cleaned,\\" then attended the king's kabary. There, the king declared that he would divide his kingdom into four parts, each one a fief to be inhabited by his four favorite sons, who would participate in royal decision- making without being made kings themselves. The two northern principalities had their capitals at Ambohimanga and Ambohidrabiby, while the capital of the western principality was located at Ambohidratrimo. The southern principality was ruled from Antananarivo by Andriantomponimerina. Andriamampandry tried on several occasions to warn Andriamasinavalona of the danger of administering the kingdom in this way. In one instance, he placed a hen in the middle of a room, then set one red rooster free in each corner. The roosters attacked one another viciously, leaving the king speechless. On another day, the elder brought four eagles to the king in a basket. When the basket was opened, the eagles flew wildly about the room, creating havoc. Andriamampandry warned the king that his realm would be no better off once his four sons got a taste of power. Andriamasinavalona recognized the danger but could not bear to choose which among his sons should be excluded from having a part in the decision- making responsibilities of the kingdom, so ignored the elder's advice. Finally Andriamampandry decided to give the king a very explicit warning. Andriamasinavalona had gathered his people in Andohalo to give a speech, when Andriamampandry set a bull loose into the crowd. In the panic that ensued, numerous people were gored or trampled to death, several pregnant women miscarried, and the gathering dispersed in chaos. The king demanded to know who had loosed the bull so that he may be executed, but when Andriamampandry took responsibility he warned the king that yet more blood would be spilled before the earth would be quenched. He then criticized the king for his concern over the relatively few deaths at the gathering, in light of the number of people who would die as a consequence of his division of Imerina. He further predicted that the prince at Ambohimanga would unite Imerina and lead it back to greatness. Andriamasinavalona reportedly had no response to give Andriamampandry, but instead hung his head in shame. The 19th century transcription of Merina oral history, Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara, relates that Andriamampandry privately assessed the leadership qualities of each of the four selected sons, with disappointing results. He presented Andriambonimena of Alasora with a beautiful parrot, which the prince killed and served as food. The elder concluded that he was \\"a gun that loads itself.\\" The oldest son, Andrianjakanavalonamandimby, was given a pot of honey, which he smashed in order to eat every last drop. Afterward Andriamampandry remarked that the kingdom had become a pot of honey without a lid, implying the first one to come along would be free to reach his hand inside and take all its bounty for himself. He visited Andriantomponimerina at Ambohidratrimo and offered him a zebu kidney (considered unpalatable), which the prince ordered to be prepared as a meal nonetheless, leading the elder to remark, \\"This man can't even resist the temptation to eat the kidney.\\" He visited Andrianavalonimerina at Ambohitrabiby carrying a lemon and a weaver's stake, which the prince's wife demanded he give to them, demonstrating their greediness. Andriamampandry also visited prince Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana at Ambohimanga, carrying an axe and a rope. The prince asked to borrow the two items, then ordered a servant to use the axe and rope to butcher a zebu, put some of the best meat in a basket, cook the rest of the good meat for their meal, and set aside the neck and the ribbed part of the tripe in a second basket. The elder dined with the prince and spent the night at the village. When Andriamampandry was about to leave, the prince returned the rope and axe, gave him the basket of fine meat for his wife, and gave him the second basket, declaring \\"These are the parts for the axe (i.e. the neck) and the rope (i.e. the striated omasum).\\" Andriamampandry was deeply impressed by the hospitality and foresight of the prince. He related these incidents to Andriamasinavalona, who decided to test his sons in turn by calling them together to his house, then observing how they slept on the bed they shared there. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana had his head highest on the pillow, but Andriamasinavalona failed to understand the significance of this, and Andriamampandry rebuked him, remarking \\"You are the king, and yet you do not understand?\\"Callet (1908), pp. 560-563 =Imprisonment= Andriantomponimerina imprisoned Andriamasinavalona at Ambohidratrimo for seven years. According to oral history, Andriamasinavalona was temporarily usurped through the trickery of his son Andriantomponimerina, who ruled the western territory from his rova at Ambohidratrimo. Once Andriamasinavalona's sons had been installed in their territories, Andriantomponimerina tested his authority by imposing a particular hairstyle upon the Marovatana people he ruled, in disregard of the promise that the king had made to respect the diverse customs and taboos of Imerina. The Marovatana reminded the king of this vow and refused to submit, prompting the king and his sons to prepare for war against the people of the fief. This conflict provided the prince with an opportunity to seize power. Upon the suggestion of the prince's half-brother, Andrianentoarivo, the prince hid himself in a trench he dug into the dirt floor of his royal residence at Ambohidratrimo, then ordered his people to send word to his father that he was \\"in the ground\\". Believing his son to be buried alive by the Marovatana as a punitive measure, Andriamasinavalona hurried to Ambohidratrimo carrying reeds as a symbol of peace; upon the king's entrance into the residence, however, Prince Andriantomponimerina locked Andriamasinavalona inside and refused to release him for the next seven years. During this time the prince repeatedly offered to free the king on the condition that Andriamasinavalona accept to transfer power to him, which the king repeatedly refused. Andriantomponimerina prevented his brothers from taking action against him by telling their messengers that the king simply preferred his company and had decided to reside with him at Ambohidratrimo.Callet (1908), pp. 575-578 After some time, the king's designated successor, Andriambonimena, launched a retaliatory attack against the prince's half-brother Andrianentoarivo at Ambohipotsy and successfully chased him from his fief. Andriantomponimerina recognized the need to take more dramatic action to consolidate his grip on power and sent a messenger to the Sakalava king requesting his support. The Sakalava reaffirmed their loyalty to Andriamasinavalona, however, and threatened to attack the prince if the rightful king was not released from his captivity. According to one version of the oral history, having failed to use the king as a pawn to gain power, the prince decided to ransom his father for 7,000 piastres to increase his personal wealth. Every citizen of Imerina was obligated to contribute, and those who had no money sold their children or themselves into slavery in order to raise the necessary funds. The money was placed in seven baskets and transported by dugout canoe to the prince at Ambohidratrimo, who released the king. According to another version of the story, Prince Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana of Ambohimanga sent two hunters of the Tsimahafotsy clan to free the king by digging an escape passage under the wall of his heavily guarded enclosure. After returning to Antananarivo, Andriamasinavalona sent a messenger who announced that the king had decided to hand power to Andriantomponimerina and invited the prince to the capital to be enthroned. The prince hurried to the palace, and throughout the city he was greeted with cheers, singing and dancing. When Andriamasinavalona received him, however, he publicly condemned the prince and stripped him of his rank and power. =Resanctification= Two stories exist around a ritual of human sacrifice that Andriamasinavalona conducted after his imprisonment. In one version of the oral history, Andriamampandry and his fellow royal advisers were concerned that the king's imprisonment had weakened his authority and could lead the population to revolt against him. They suggested the king test his people by claiming to be ill and requesting a human sacrifice; if a citizen offered his life for the king, this gesture would indicate the public was still loyal to him. Andriamasinavalona followed this recommendation and gathered the people to request a volunteer who was willing to have his throat slit with a long dagger to sanctify the king. In another version of the story, this proposal was made to sanctify the new Besakana palace that the king ordered rebuilt at the rova in Antananarivo. A man named Trimofoloalina stepped forward to sacrifice his life. In the first version of the story, royal advisers bound him with ropes and laid him on the ground to the west of the Masoandro palace within the rova compound at Antananarivo, but rather than kill the man they symbolically \\"sacrificed\\" him by pouring rooster blood mixed with water onto his throat. In the second, he was bound and hoisted to the top of the central pillar of the new building, and his ear was nicked to allow several drops of blood to fall on the top of the pillar to sanctify it. Trimofoloalina was then released and the king asked him to name a reward for his courageous gesture. The man requested that he and his descendants would forever after be exempted from the death penalty for any crime they might commit; Andriamasinavalona agreed to grant this reward.Callet (1908), pp. 583-590 Death and legacy Andriamasinavalona died falling from his elevated bed (right). Andriamasinavalona died in 1710 when one of his wives, Rasolomananambonitany, inadvertently pushed him from the elevated bed where they slept.Callet (1908), p. 654 He was buried in the royal tombs located at the Rova of Antananarivo. In opposition to Andriamasinavalona's intentions, after the king's death his sons forsook the concept of unity and instead fought one another in an effort to expand their realms. As a consequence of this decision, Imerina fragmented and was wracked with conflict for 77 years, until the kingdom was once again united during the reign of Andrianampoinimerina (1787-1810). The reign of Andriamasinavalona is remembered in Madagascar as a golden age of prosperity, justice, abundance and harmony. He is described in oral histories as a talented politician and kind and just ruler. His name is often traditionally invoked in Imerina when paying tribute to the ancestors or making a binding pledge. Regarding Andriamasinavalona's legacy, Ellis (1832) remarked, \\"The character of this chieftain is held in the highest veneration and esteem. He is said to have exercised great care over his district, and to have introduced many important improvements. His memory, laws and customs are still held in the greatest respect, and his name is always mentioned in the public kabarys with a degree of reverence.\\" References Bibliography  * Category:Malagasy monarchs Category:1675 births Category:1710 deaths Category:17th-century monarchs in Africa Category:18th-century monarchs in Africa ","title":"Andriamasinavalona"},{"id":"11838107","text":"Sir Olumuyiwa Jibowu, Kt (26 August 1899 - 1 June 1959) was a Nigerian jurist who was the first African to serve on the Supreme Court of Nigeria.\\"Past Justices of the Supreme Court.\\" The first African police magistrate, the first Nigerian High court judge, a pioneer of the Nigerian Judiciary and one-time Chief Justice of Western Region, Nigeria.

The band was formed by lead vocalist and guitarist Ezra Koenig, multi-instrumentalist Rostam Batmanglij, drummer Chris Tomson, and bassist Chris Baio. The band's eponymous first album Vampire Weekend (2008)‚Äîwhich included the singles \\"Mansard Roof\\", \\"A-Punk\\", \\"Oxford Comma\\", \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\", and \\"The Kids Don't Stand a Chance\\"‚Äîwas acclaimed by critics for its world music influences. Their following album, Contra (2010), was similarly acclaimed and garnered strong commercial success. Their third studio album, Modern Vampires of the City (2013), won the group a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 2014. Batmanglij departed the group in early 2016. The band's fourth album, Father of the Bride, was released in 2019, again winning Best Alternative Music Album at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, at which it was also nominated for Album of the Year. History =Formation and early years (2006‚Äì2007)= The band members met while enrolled at Columbia University, beginning with a rap collaboration between Koenig and Tomson named \\"L'Homme Run\\". They bonded over a shared love of punk rock and African music. Koenig toured with The Dirty Projectors during a period of experimentation with African music, inspiring the band to incorporate world sounds into their earliest work. The band chose the name \\"Vampire Weekend\\" from the title of a short film project Koenig worked on during the summer between freshman and sophomore years in college. While home for the summer, Koenig watched the 1987 vampire film The Lost Boys and was inspired to make a Northeastern version of the film in which a man named Walcott travels to Cape Cod to warn the mayor that vampires are attacking the United States. Koenig abandoned the project after two days. The band began playing shows around Columbia University, starting with a battle of the bands at Lerner Hall in 2006. After graduating from college, the band self-produced their debut album while simultaneously working full-time jobs, Tomson as a music archivist and Koenig as a middle school English teacher. Vampire Weekend in 2007 In 2007, Vampire Weekend's song \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\" was ranked 67th on Rolling Stone's list of the \\"100 Best Songs of the Year\\". In November 2007, they toured the UK with The Shins. The then-nascent influence of blog hype and internet buzz played a role in their success and led to a large prerelease following sufficient to support them performing on three tours before their debut album was released. They were declared \\"The Year's Best New Band\\" by Spin magazine in the March 2008 issue, and were the first band to be shot for the cover of the magazine before releasing their debut album.Greenwald, Andy. \\"Vampire Weekend: The Graduates\\". Spin. February 25, 2008. Retrieved on June 28, 2009. The band made a television appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman on February 1, 2008, and on March 8, 2008, performed on Saturday Night Live. Four songs from the band's first album also made the Triple J Hottest 100, 2008. The internet hype had its backlash, however, as critics reacted against a perceived image of Vampire Weekend as privileged, upper-class Ivy League graduates stealing from foreign musicians. One critic went so far as to call Vampire Weekend the \\"whitest band in the world,\\" to which they took exception, given their Ukrainian, Persian, Italian, and Hungarian heritages. Koenig responded in a November 2009 interview by saying, \\"Nobody in our band is a WASP.\\" Furthermore, the backlash involving their social backgrounds was largely unfounded, as Koenig explained in the interview that the band members got into Columbia on scholarship and used student loans; he himself was still paying off student loans in 2009. =Vampire Weekend (2007‚Äì2009)= The band's first album, Vampire Weekend, was released January 29, 2008 and is ranked number 430 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

Reilly feature Step Brothers, and featured in the UK television show The Inbetweeners and the video games Guitar Hero 5, Just Dance 2 and Lego Rock Band. =Contra (2009‚Äì2010)= Lead singer Ezra Koenig with the band in 2009 The band's second album, Contra, was released on January 11, 2010 in the UK and the following day in the US, after being pushed back from the original release date for the fall of 2009. The album's first single, \\"Horchata\\", was released on October 5, 2009. The album's second single, \\"Cousins\\", was released as a single on November 17, 2009. Initial copies of the CD and LP sold at independent record stores in the US included a 3-track bonus CD containing two \\"melts\\", which featured bits of album tracks and a remix. Contra was the band's first album to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.. It is the band's first album to reach number one on the Billboard 200, and the 12th independently-distributed album in history to reach the number one spot on the Billboard 200 since Nielsen Soundscan began recording data in 1991, while also being the first independent artist to have done so without ever having signed with a major label, after already established rock bands Radiohead and Pearl Jam and before Arcade Fire's The Suburbs. The album sold 124,000 copies in its first week and was awarded Gold by the RIAA on November 21, 2011 which means it has sold over 500,000 units in the US alone. In 2010. It was awarded a diamond certification from the Independent Music Companies Association which indicated sales of at least 250,000 copies throughout Europe.http://www.impalamusic.org/arc_static/docum/04-press/2009/PR%20-%2020100127.htm On January 9, 2010, the band did an acoustic show for MTV Unplugged. The following month, the band toured Europe and Canada with Canadian electro duo Fan Death as their support. The video for their next single \\"Giving Up the Gun\\" was also released on February 18, 2010 which included cameos from Joe Jonas, Lil Jon, RZA, and Jake Gyllenhaal.

In 2010, Vampire Weekend embarked on a North American tour with Beach House and Dum Dum Girls. The tour started off on August 27, 2010, in Vancouver, British Columbia at the Malkin Bowl. Koenig mentioned to the audience that before this concert, the band had the longest \\"vacation period\\" that they had had in a while. Contra was nominated for a Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album, but lost to The Black Keys's Brothers. =Modern Vampires of the City (2010‚Äì2014)= On November 11, 2011, it was revealed that Vampire Weekend had been in the studio, writing and recording material for their third album. On April 26, 2012, Rolling Stone reported that the new album could be released by the end of the year. Koenig said, \\"We do have a ton of stuff. It would be cool if it was [released] this year...We just never want to be in a position [where] when we put out something, we feel could've benefited from more time.\\" Until its release, the band was discreet about the details of the next album, stating that a band \\"can give a bunch of interviews when they're working on stuff\\" but they \\"don't want something [they] said six months ago to influence how people hear it when it's done.\\" Vampire Weekend in 2013 Modern Vampires of the City was released in May 2013, and written and recorded in various locations including SlowDeath Studios in New York, Echo Park \\"Back House\\" in Los Angeles, Vox Recording Studios in Hollywood, Rostam Batmanglij's New York apartment and a guest house on Martha's Vineyard. The album was co-produced by Batmanglij and Ariel Rechtshaid. After Batmanglij produced the first two albums himself, this marked the first time the band worked with an outside producer on any of their records. In an interview for the February 2013 edition of Q (released in mid- January), Koenig described the upcoming album as \\"darker and more organic\\" and \\"very much the last of a trilogy.\\" Said Koenig, \\"Things that we might have found boring in the past, we've started to find more fresh. This album has more piano and acoustic guitar and organ.\\" Modern Vampires of the City also continued the use of digital voice modulation as heard in the songs \\"Diane Young\\" and \\"Ya Hey\\", a technique first used in the song \\"California English\\" on Contra Eliscu, J.

On May 11, 2013, Vampire Weekend were featured as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live with Kristen Wiig hosting, their third time on the show.

In the album's first week of release, it debuted number one on the Billboard 200 and sold 134,000 copies in the United States.

He noted that he and Koenig would continue to collaborate. Later the same day, Koenig announced that Vampire Weekend was in the studio working on their upcoming fourth album, with Batmanglij contributing to the record. The album's working title was revealed to be Mitsubishi Macchiato. In April 2016, the band briefly performed at a rally for presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in Washington Square Park. Koenig has been a well-known supporter of Sanders, after discussions on his Beats 1 radio show, Time Crisis. The band performed live with Dave Longstreth of the Dirty Projectors, which marked their first performance as a trio. In late 2016, Koenig was reportedly in talks to sign the band with Columbia Records, as he reportedly \\"hit it off\\" with executive Rob Stringer. Initially, this news was regarded a rumor, until the band's website revamp in 2018, in which a Sony Music copyright appeared on the site. In March 2017, Koenig revealed in an elaborate Instagram update that during 2016 he had spent countless hours researching and writing music in libraries with grad students. Additionally, he revealed that the album, given the working title of \\"Mitsubishi Macchiato\\", would feature a more 'spring-time' vibe and one of the songs would be entitled Flower Moon. Koenig revealed that LP4 would be partially inspired by the songwriting of country singer, Kacey Musgraves, after he attended one of her shows in September 2016. In an interview with Stereogum, he stated, \\"I‚Äôm the type of person who has spent hours poring over the avant-garde poetic lyrics of certain songwriters, and there was something that felt so good [about how] from the first verse, you knew who was singing, who they were singing to, what kind of situation they were in. After the show I realized there‚Äôs not a ton of Vampire Weekend songs where you could listen to the first verse and immediately answer the question of who‚Äôs singing and who are they singing to.‚Äù Furthermore, in a September 2017 interview with Zane Lowe, Ezra briefly spoke about LP4 and stated that it was \\"about 80% done.\\" He mentioned that the album would feature lead producer Ariel Rechtshaid with additional \\"guest appearances\\", one of which being Batmanglij. Lowe pushed Koenig for a release date, citing Q1 2018 as a likely candidate. In a December 2017 interview, Koenig noted that Batmanglij was involved in a few songs, some of which was material that they had started working on long ago, and that their method of collaboration had not changed despite the latter's departure from the band. Vampire Weekend performing at End of the Road Festival in 2018 Vampire Weekend's first gigs since the hiatus took place in Ojai, California on June 16 & 17. On January 31, 2018, it was announced that the band would be headlining the UK music festival End of the Road. The festival ran from August 31 to September 3 and marked Vampire Weekend's first return to a festival stage in 4 years. On July 21, they performed in Byron Bay for the Australian festival, Splendour in the Grass. Additionally, it was announced that they would headline the 2018 Fuji Rock Festival, scheduled for July 27 to 29. For their live shows, the core trio of Koenig, Baio, and Tomson has been augmented by Greta Morgan on keyboards, guitar, and vocals, Brian Robert Jones on guitar, Garrett Ray on percussion, drums, and vocals, and Will Canzoneri on keyboards and vocals. During their August 4, 2018 performance at Lollapalooza, where the band played fan favorite \\"A-Punk\\" three times in a row, Koenig announced that Vampire Weekend's 4th album was done. On January 17, 2019, Koenig announced the abbreviation of the band's fourth album title as FOTB, and revealed that the album would consist of 18 songs, running at approximately 59 minutes. Additionally, he announced that the album would be promoted by three monthly two-song releases, beginning the following week. On January 24, the songs \\"Harmony Hall\\" and \\"2021\\" were released, and Koenig confirmed the title of the album as Father of the Bride. He also said that the record would feature an array of collaborators, including Batmanglij, marking the first time the band has included guest vocalists in an album. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Koenig said, \\"We've had three albums of the same voice over and over again. I like the idea of opening up our world a little bit.\\" He also confirmed that \\"2021\\" features a Haruomi Hosono sample, and said that he planned to start work on Vampire Weekend's fifth album. The band's current touring approach is influenced by Phish, the Grateful Dead and other jam bands.

Alternatively, any accident involving a tram or a tram system may be considered a tram accident. The latter definition is more commonly used in public safety studies. Tram systems are typically considered to be environmentally friendly, efficient and cost effective methods of transport within urban areas. However, safety concerns associated with tram systems ‚Äì particularly poor maneuverability and long braking distances ‚Äì cannot be ignored. The research indicates that for each kilometer traveled, trams are 12 times more likely to be involved in a serious accident than a car. Limited information on tram accidents exists in scientific literature. Causes =Tram car accidents= The tram car may be damaged during derailment or collision with other vehicles or pedestrians. Tram derailments are often caused by damaged track, collisions with obstacles, junction failures, or excessive speed at a junction or curve. Additionally, collisions may occur between trams due to faulty junctions or poor driving. =Passenger accidents= Trams coming to a sudden stop may cause injuries to passengers on board. Passengers may also slip, trip or fall on the tram or the tram platform. Blind passengers are particularly at risk of falling off a tram or, despite safety systems, getting injured by closing doors. In areas of overcrowded tram systems, illegal passengers are in danger of falling off or being trapped between tram cars. Fire aboard a tram puts passengers at risk of severe injury or death. Other accidents involving passengers may include being struck by a car while exiting the tram or while waiting at a tram platform. Such incidents are often taken into account during Tram public safety studies. =Accidents involving the public= While collisions with cars are the most common form of tram accident, cyclists and pedestrians are the group most at risk of death during tram collisions. Cyclists may experience a loss of control if bicycle tires get jammed in tramway tracks.Ozanne-Smith J., and Sherry K.: Bicycle related injuries. Hazard, Edition No. 6, December 1990. Victorian Injury Surveillance System. http://www.campusglobal.org/muarc/VISU/hazard/haz06.pdf. Retrieved 26 June 2007. More rarely, members of the public may also climb over a tram car, or in other ways get in contact with the electric conductors or other electric appliances of a tram, and receive an electric shock. Within certain localities, alcohol consumption appears to be a major confounding factor. In Gothenburg, Sweden an estimated 60% of fatally injured victims were under the influence of alcohol.Hedelin Annika, Bj√∂rnstig Ulf, and Brismar, Bo: Trams ‚Äì a risk factor for pedestrians. Accid. Anal. and Prev. Vol. 28, No. 6, pp. 733‚Äì738, 1996. Analysis and consequences In Sheffield, UK, cyclists appear to be the group at highest risk to be injured in tram accidents, followed by pedestrians and motor vehicle users.Cameron IC, Harris NJ and Kehoe NJS: Tram- related injuries in Sheffield. Injury Vol 32, Issue 4, May 2001, pp. 275‚Äì277 In Sheffield, less than one third of casualties had a fracture, and approximately every tenth injured person had a hospital admission. In Gothenburg, the incidence of non-fatal injuries was 3 per million tramcar- kilometres, and the mortality was 0.2 per million tramcar kilometres. Two of 16 fatalities and 1 of 217 non-fatally injury events in 1988 ‚Äì 1992 were suicide attempts. The most fatal tram accident in Gothenburg happened when a high-speed runaway tram hit dozens of pedestrians and several vehicles. The accident happened after a technician manually released the brakes automatically activated after a power failure.The tram accident in Gothenburg on 12 March 1992 ‚Äì KAMEDO-report 62 http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/publikationer1994/thetramaccidentingothenburgmarch12-1992kamedo- report62 (retrieved on 28 January 2012) Emergency brake and emergency hammer near a tram door.

Some safety measures in a tram door. Some details on safety planning of a tram stop. The mortality of pedestrians hit by a tram seems to be much higher than the mortality of pedestrians hit by a motor vehicle. Typically most seriously injured people have been caught under or between tramcars. Non-impact absorbing parts at the side of the trams may lead to serious head injuries even at low speeds.Unger R., Eder C., Mayr J.M., and Wernig J.: Child pedestrian injuries at tram and bus stops. Injury Vol. 33, Issue 6, pp. 485‚Äì488, July 2002. In Austria, accidents of children at bus or tram stops were analyzed over a 6-year period. 6 children were injured by trams. Accidents happened while crossing the track, one child ran against a tram, one child was crossing at a crosswalk or looked at wrong traffic lights. Most of the children hit the side of the tram. In addition, 4 children were injured by a car at a tram stop. In Germany, 18 pedestrians with multiple traumas after tram accidents were evaluated with Multidetector computed tomography.Demant AW, Bangard C, Bovenschulte H, Skouras E, Anderson SE, Lackner KJ.: MDCT evaluation of injuries after tram accidents in pedestrians. Emerg Radiol. 2010 Mar;17(2):103-8. Epub 2009 Oct 14. The mean age was 36.9 years with a range from 14‚Äì92 years. There was a trend for accident events occurring more commonly during the winter months in middle-aged men, often under the influence of alcohol. In this study, leading diagnoses were head (83.3%) and thorax injuries (66.6%). Abdominal injuries (44.4%) were mainly found patients with complex injuries. The most serious injuries occurred when a victim was caught under or between tramcars. In the 1990s in Oslo, Norway, tram transport amounted to 3 million vehicle-kilometers per year with approx. 25‚Äì30 collisions with pedestrians or bicyclists, 60 accidents with travelers on board the tram or during boarding/leaving, and 600 collisions with cars. In 1982‚Äì1995 there were 10 fatalities of the pedestrians, mostly when a pedestrian stepped into the street without noticing the approaching tram, very often against red traffic light. Another common accident was a pedestrian crossing the street so close to the front of a stationary tram that he was not observed by the driver. 30% of collisions with cars happened with stationary cars stopped or parked too close to the tram tracks. 10% of collisions happened between trams and buses, and remaining 60% of collisions happened mostly with moving cars. This report analyzed 200 accident reports. It was recognized that more than half of the collisions between tram and car were caused by errors by the car driver only. 25% of the accidents were caused due to an error by tram driver. 25% of the accidents were caused by more complex causal patterns. About 2/3 of pedestrian accidents were caused by errors of the pedestrian only, tram driver error was very seldom the main cause. For passengers falling in the tram, errors by other road users were an important causal factor, necessitating the heavy braking of the tram. In addition, fewer accidents seemed to happen with older tram drivers and on tracks segregated from other traffic.Fridulv Sagberg, Inger-Anne F S√¶termo: Trafikksikkerhet for sporvogn i Oslo (Traffic safety of tram transport).

The most common reason for death was a multiorgan failure. In tram accidents, 86% of the victims were male. The victims of tram accidents did not suffer injuries of the highest severity like amputations. In Helsinki, Finland, more than 200 collisions happened between trams and vehicles in 2009. Most accidents were a direct result of track obstruction. In some countries accident investigation boards investigate all serious rail accidents and hazardous situations that may have led to a serious accident. These investigations are detailed analysis on the causes and consequences of the accidents. Investigations create information and recommendations to prevent further accidents. The investigations can be required by law. Systematic guides can determine minimum requirements for an analysis. In the accident in Helsinki 2008, two passengers were severely injured, and a tram driver and 22 passengers were slightly injured. The cause of the accident was that the driver of the tram approaching from behind was not able to stop the tram in time. The driver apparently tried to stop the tram via incorrect braking methods in the belief that the brakes were not working properly. The background factors were the driver's inexperience, the possibility that the driver anticipated the tram ahead would leave the stop earlier, and driver's suspicion that brakes were not working properly and therefore the use of the incorrect braking method. In order to prevent similar accidents, it was recommended that tram drivers be taught to brake in a proper way, and the drivers should be provided with a personalized and progressive training program with documented performance. It was also recommended that the tram floor hatches should be better fastened to prevent causing injuries to passengers, and trams should be equipped with a first aid kit. In addition, rail accident investigations can analyze previous occurrences of a similar character.Derailment of a tram at Phipps Bridge on the Croydon Tramlink 25 May 2006.

Safety Science, Vol. 40, Number 5, pp. 467‚Äì477, July 2002. The trams, tracks, and the environment of a tram systems should be physically planned as safely as possible. Even physical structures should be safe and minimize damage in case of accidents. Various kind of stress factors and forces should be calculated and assessed to create a tram system with diminished possibility of structural failures, derailments etc. In case a tram rides in a tunnel or on a bridge, various fire, derailment, and entrapment safety measures should be thought about.

In Toronto the CLRV streetcars have a skirt added to the front of the car covering the coupler. It was added to prevent passengers from being dragged under the car's wheels. Trams should be designed to have impact absorbing materials in front and side constructions. Lifting points can be marked for fire brigades to help rescuers to find safe and strong enough parts of the tram when e.g. lifting a tram to rescue a patient underneath it. Inside the tram the structures should also contain impact absorbing materials and round shapes instead of sharp edges. Automatic door controlling sensors decrease the possibility of entrapment injuries. Common safety features onboard tram often include driver's vigilance control systems and programmable logic speed controllers.Hongkong Tramways Limited: Safety and Reliability are our Top Priorities. In: The Company. . Retrieved 8 July 2007. The fire brigades may carry special tools for tram accidents, like heavy extrication tools, grounding equipment, and hydraulic lifting jacks for trams. Some trams are able to drop some sand on the rails to increase the friction during emergency braking. The most slippery seasons for trams are not necessarily an icy winter, but those when leaves fall from trees. A brush car can be used to clear the rails.Lehtikeli liukastaa ratikkakiskot.

A tram system may have a control centre following the trams, having radio contact with the drivers, and ability to contact and guide guards, emergency dispatch centre, or repair patrols. A tram typically carries first aid kit, a radio and/or a phone, some tools, and a fire extinguisher. Basic first aid, prodromic driving manners, safety courses, and protocols to follow in an accident are taught to tram drivers. Some organizations may test the drivers for alcohol and/or drugs regularly, occasionally, and/or in case of suspicion to avoid driving under the influence. Also the health of the drivers can be assessed regularly or in case of need. Some organizations can also give education to drivers and re-evaluate their skills and manners regularly. Also rescue organizations can be informed on tram structures, electricity, risks, and specific rescue and firefighting tactics concerning trams. Rescue organizations can also train with trams in simulated accident and firefighting situations. Various cities and traffic companies have given safety and traffic instructions for passengers, pedestrian, wheelchair users, cyclists, and motorists.For example, BBC: Idiot‚Äôs Guide to tram safety.

Naturally the state of traffic legislation, traffic culture, and safety culture in the tram and traffic system may have an influence on tram accidents. Tram stops can be separated with barriers from the street. Speed limits can be used near the tram stops, and strips painted between tram tracks.Oxley J., Corben B., and Diamantopoulou K.: Some cost- effective approaches to moderate vehicle speeds in high pedestrian activity environments. http://www.rsconference.com/pdf/RS010023.pdf?check=1. Retrieved 26 June 2007. Tram lanes can be also separated from other traffic. Trams may have their own traffic lights, which are integrated to work with normal traffic lights and stop the traffic when a tram stops at a tram stop. In some areas the junctions are warmed during winter to avoid ice and snow blocking the junction. Tracks, junctions, trams, tram traffic lights etc. should be regularly inspected and maintained. Rescue tactics Overhead wires used to power trams in Athens.Tram overhead lines and various electrical devices create risks in rescue operations. Heavy vehicles and structures of trams also require heavy tools and good rescue skills. In tram accidents, overhead lines and various electrical devices in a tram can create a risk in firefighting and rescue operations. Among the first missions in an accident is prevention of further accidents, additional damages and injuries. The emergency dispatch centres may have strategies and emergency response guides prepared for various kinds of tram accidents. The response guides can contain information on e.g. what emergency response units (police, ambulance, fire apparatus, investigation units etc.) are sent to the accident scene in various kind of accidents (fire, derailment, collision, pedestrian hit by a tram etc.). Also hospitals can be alerted in major accidents. At the accident scene, a ground connection is used to prevent electric shocks from overhead lines. The accident scene is surveyed, and in the case of several injured persons, a triage process or other recognition of patients' states is done. The most critically injured patients get more, faster, and better quality attention and treatment. In the case of a someone underneath a tram, lifting bags or hydraulic jacks brought by fire brigades can be used to elevate the tram and release anyone trapped under the vehicle. A crane can be used to lift a tram, too, or an overturned tram. If a patient is trapped inside crushed structures, various kinds of extrication tools, like hydraulic spreaders, rams, cutters, and circular saws can be used. In some cases, it is also possible to drive the tram backwards, but in most cases this would only cause more injuries to the victim. While cutting, lifting or turning an overturned tram or vehicle, structures often have to be stabilized to mitigate the risk of moving parts, and to secure suspended vehicles or objects.

After the patients have been treated and transported, police inquiries may take place. After a full inspection, the vehicles involved may be allowed to be removed from the scene. In severe accidents, special traffic or accident investigation boards may analyze the accident and its consequences, and give recommendations to improve safety in traffic. After the accident, the accident scene should be cleaned. The tram, the tracks and the overhead lines may need repair.

He was killed on November 11, 1919 during the Centralia Massacre in Washington State. Youth Warren (Wedge) Grimm, University of Washington Husky, circa 1911. Born in Lewistown, Pennsylvania, Grimm moved to Centralia, Washington at the age of four. He regularly achieved high academic marks and was a star on the local high school football team. Upon graduation, Grimm worked as a clerk in the Assessor‚Äôs Office of King County, Washington, to pay for college. This experience led to his interest in the practice of law. Grimm then attended the University of Washington, entering in the fall of 1908. During the following years, Grimm was best known for his athletic prowess, earning All-American honors on Washington‚Äôs famous football teams of the era. The leader of his freshman class, Grimm also joined the Sigma Nu fraternity. In those days, hazing was still an acceptable practice. The University of Washington had a traditional melee between each year‚Äôs freshman and sophomore classes, the goal of which was to identify potential Huskies and to see who could tie up the others. It was at this inaugural event that Grimm earned the nickname ‚ÄúWedge‚Äù that would identify him on football fields throughout the Northwest. Chosen Captain of the Freshman ‚Äútie-up‚Äù squad because of his size, Grimm actually showed his tactical acumen and organized his classmates into a tightly focused wedge that charged the sophomore formation. This highly successful maneuver became a staple of Husky football teams and contributed to his later All-American honors. In 1910, Grimm was awarded the Flaherty medal by the University of Washington. He was also honored with memberships in every honor society to which he was eligible including the Oval Club and Fir Tree. His growing potential in the practice of law was also noticed and he was awarded membership in Phi Delta Phi, a national law school honorary fraternity. After graduation from law school he returned to his home in Centralia. He was made deputy prosecuting attorney but, at the end of his term, decided to enter into private practice with his brother, Huber \\"Polly\\" Grimm. In 1914, Warren married Ina Olive Gilbert. Unfortunately, Warren would soon become a widower when Ina developed diabetes and died on April 12, 1917. World War I When the United States entered World War I, Grimm put his private practice on hold and volunteered for the Army. Sent to Officers Training Camp, he earned a commission of First Lieutenant and was assigned to the 12th Infantry. The 12th was ordered to Camp Fremont in January, 1918. On April 15, 1918, Lt. Grimm received exceptional leave HQ 8th Division, Special Orders #82, C.S. Fries, Lt. Col., General Staff as he would once again tie the knot, this time to Miss Verna Barstad, Kappa Sigma, who was Centralia's librarian. In August, 1918 Grimm's regiment was ordered to Siberia as part of the American Expeditionary Force Siberia (A.E.F. Siberia), under the command of General William S. Graves. Upon arrival at Vladivostok, Grimm was assigned to Co. I of the 31st Infantry and was stationed on guard duty about one hundred miles north of the Siberian seaport. Lieutenant Grimm was then transferred to Hardin, Manchuria, and assumed command of the 50 man detachment. In December, 1918, Grimm was rotated back to the HQ Company of the 31st Infantry and served as legal attach√© for General Graves. Successfully completing its tour of duty, Grimm‚Äôs company left Vladvistock on April 1, 1919 and returned to San Francisco. Grimm returned to Centralia to greet his wife and see his infant daughter, Shirley Ann, who had been born during his deployment. The town of Centralia decided to reward him for his combat service and elected him Commander of the Grant Hodge Post of the American Legion. Grimm also resumed his private law practice at this time. IWW The Industrial Workers of the World (Wobblies) is a revolutionary labor union based in Chicago. In Washington, the IWW had a strong presence among timber workers. A contentious relationship between the IWW and the town went as far back as 1914 when 47 members entered the town seeking bread for hungry workers. Denied assistance, the group was forced to leave town. In 1917, the IWW opened a Union Hall in Centralia. The hall was attacked in 1918 during a Red Cross parade, most probably at the hands of the local lumber companies and with support from Centralia's Elk Lodge. Consequently, by the fall of 1919, relations between Wobblies and businessmen hostile to labor were fraught with tension. Whether by design or unfortunate circumstance Grimm would become the first casualty of the Centralia Massacre. Centralia Massacre In Centralia, Washington, where the IWW had been organizing lumber workers, the lumber interests made plans to get rid of the IWW. On November 11, 1919, Armistice Day, the Legion paraded through town with rubber hoses and gas pipes, and the IWW prepared for an attack. When the Legion passed the IWW hall, shots were fired ‚Äì it is unclear who fired first. They stormed the hall, there was more firing, and Legionnaires Warren Grimm and Arthur McElfresh were killed in this initial confusion of shots. Of the seven Wobblies inside the hall, only Wesley Everest and Ray Becker fired any shots. It is unclear, of the men posted at other stations, who or how many fired upon the raiding Legionnaires. {A total of four members of the American Legion were killed and five wounded} Inside the headquarters was an IWW member, a lumberjack named Wesley Everest, a former ex-soldier {although he had not served overseas} while the IWW national leaders were on trial for obstructing the war effort. Everest was in army uniform and carrying a rifle. He emptied it into the crowd, dropped it, and ran for the woods, followed by a mob. He started to wade across the river, found the current too strong, turned, shot the leading man Dale Hubbard dead, threw his gun into the river, and fought the mob with his fists. They dragged him back to town behind an automobile, suspended him from a telegraph pole, took him down, locked him in jail. That night, his jailhouse door was broken down, he was dragged out, put on the floor of a car, and then he was taken to a bridge, hanged, and his body riddled with bullets. No one was ever arrested for Everest's murder, but eleven Wobblies were put on trial for killing an American Legion leader during the parade, and six of them spent fifteen years in prison. Aftermath Grimm‚Äôs wife and infant daughter attended every day of the trial and subsequent convictions and sentencing. However, by this point, the IWW allegedly sent death threats to Mrs. Grimm, Judge John M. Wilson, who presided over the trial, Lewis County and Centralia officials, and some of the testifying Legionnaires. As a result, Mrs. Grimm and her daughter were placed under Federal protection and relocated.

It was created by William Moulton Marston as an allegory for intuitive telepathy, or ESP, which he believed was a real phenomenon. Fictional history The mental radio device was created by the scientifically advanced Amazon nation on Paradise Island. It first appeared in Sensation Comics #3. It was frequently used throughout the Golden Age as a means for Wonder Woman to maintain communications with her mother and fellow Amazons on Paradise Island and for Wonder Woman's allies Steve Trevor and Etta Candy to communicate in times of distress. The mental radio was needed primarily as a receiver. Wonder Woman and her allies were shown to be able to broadcast their distress calls even when they were nowhere near a mental radio, but they had to sit down in front of a mental radio device in order to receive telepathic transmissions. Although the character most frequently shown to broadcast distress calls via mental radio was Wonder Woman, typically in the form of an \\"electronic\\" word balloon with a tail emanating from her forehead, mental radio broadcasting was not originally considered a feature of her tiara but was instead something even Steve Trevor and Etta Candy could do, with electronic thought balloons similarly pointing at their foreheads. Mental radios featured prominently in a plot by Nazi agent Fausta Grables to steal a device in order to eavesdrop on Wonder Woman and her companions. The mental radio appeared less frequently after the Golden Age. By the later pre-Crisis adventures, only Wonder Woman was shown to possess a mental radio outside of Paradise Island, and it was installed in her invisible jet.
